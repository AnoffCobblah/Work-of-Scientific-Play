Report of the Proceedings of the Council in 1845-46, presented to the
    General Committee at Southampton, Wednesday, Sept. 9, 184(5.

                        Report of the Council to the General Committee.

    1. The Council have the very satisfactory duty to perform, of reporting to
the General Committee that the resolutions of the Magnetical and Meteoro-
logical Conference, adopted by the General Committee at Cambridge, on
the 25th of June 1845, were submitted to the Right Hon. Sir Robert Peel,
Bart., by the President Sir John Herschel, Bart., accompanied by a commu-
nication from the Marquis of Northampton, President of the Royal Society,
conveying the concurrence of that body in the recommendations contained
therein ; that they received a very favourable consideration from Her Ma-
jesty's Government, and that the recommendations connected with the British
observatories, both at home and in the Colonies, are in progress of being
carried out. The resolutions relating to the East Indian observatories and
surveys have met with an equally favourable reception from the Hon. Court
of Directors of the East India Company, and the recommendations which they
contained have been approved and sanctioned. In accordance with the re-
solutions passed at Cambridge, therefore, the magnetic observatory at Green-
wich is permanently continued upon the most extensive and efficient scale.
The magnetical and meteorological observations are constituted a permanent
branch of the duties of the astronomical observatories at the Cape of Good
Hope, Bombay and Madras, and arrangements are in progress for inaking
them also a permanent branch of the observations to be made at the Obser-
vatory at Paramatta. The detachment of the Royal Artillery, by whom the
duties at the Cape of Good Hope have been hitherto performed, has been
relieved by a permanent increase in jhe civil strength of the Astronomical Ob-
servatory at that station, and in like manner the officers of the Royal Navy,
who now form the establishment of tlie observatory at Van Diemen Island,
will be relieved as soon as the civil establishment at Paramatta is completed.
The Ordnance Observatories at Toronto and St. Helena are continued until

the close of 1848.
    With reference to the recommendations relating to magnetic surveys, a
         -- ----

                    REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.           XVll

magnetic survey of the Indian Seas by Lieut, Elliot, of the Madras Engineers,

lias received tlie sanction of the Hon. Court of Directors of the East India

Company, and is now in progress. Also in the present summer, Lieut. Moore,

of the Royal Navy, proceeded under the direction of the Lords of the Ad-

miralty to Hudson's Bay, in one of the vessels belonging to the Hudson's Bay

Company, for the purpose of connecting the observations of the Canadian

Survey with those which the Expedition under Sir John Franklin is making

in the seas to the north of the American Continent.

In accordance with the recommendation concerning the co-operation of

foreign magnetical and meteorological observatories, communications were

made, on the application of the President, by the Earl of Aberdeen, Her Ma-

jesty's principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to the governments of

Russia, Austria, Prussia, Belgium, Sweden and Spain, from all of whom very

favourable replies have been received.

2. The resolution passed by the General Committee, to the effect " that

it is highly desirable to encourage, by specific pecuniary reward, the im-

provement of self-recording magnetical and meteorological apparatus, and

that the Presidents of the Royal Society and of the British Association be

requested to solicit the favourable consideration of Her Majesty's Govern-

ment to this subject," has been brought under the notice of Government,

and arrangements have been made to carry the recommendation into effect.

Whilst on this subject the Council has also much pleasure in noticing that

the President and Council of the Royal Society have granted г50 from the

Wollaston Donation Fund to assist in the construction of apparatus devised

by Mr. Ronalds for the self-registry of magnetical and meteorological instru-

ments ; which apparatus is in progress of completion at the Observatory of
the British Association at Kew. The Council are persuaded that the Gene-

ral Committee will view with satisfaction this co-operaticn of the Royal So-
ciety and British Association for objects common to both, and for which the

Observatory at Kew furnishes a very convenient locality.

   3. The General Committee at Cambridge having passed a resolution,
" That it be rcferi'ed to the Council to take into consideration, before the

--next Meeting of the Association, the expediency of discontinuing the Kew

Observatory," the Council appointed a Committee, consisting of the Presi-

dent (Sir John Herschel), the Dean of Ely, the Astronomer Royal, Professors

Graham and Wheatstone, and Lieut. -Colonel Sabine, to collect information
on the scientific purposes which the Kew Observatory has served, and on its
general usefulness to science and to the Association ; from whom they re-

ceived the following report :

   " Kew Observatory, May 7. 1846. Present,--Sir J. F. W. Herschel, Bart.,
the Astronomer Royal, Professors Graham and Wheatstone, and Lieut.-

Colonel Sabine.  ╖

" After an attentive examination of the present state of the establishment,

and of other matters connected therewith, the following resolutions were

unanimously adopted, viz.

" That it be recommended to the General Committee that the establish-,

ment at Kew, the occupancy of which lias been granted by Her Majesty

to the British Association, be maintained in its present state of effi-

ciency:

" 1. Because it affords, at a very inconsiderable expense, a local

         habitation to the Association; and a convenient depository for

         its books, manuscripts and apparatus.

" 2. Because it has afforded to Members of the Association the means
                       ;

xviii  --REPORT 1846.

                 of prosecuting many pliysical inquiries which otherwise would
                   not have been entered upon.
          " 3. Because the establishment has already become a point of interest
               to scientific foreigners, several of whom have visited it.
         " 4. Because the grant of the occupancy of tlie building by Her Ma-

                    jesty, at the earnest request of the British Association, is an in-

                 stance of Her Majesty's interest in, and approval of, the objects

                     of the Association.
            " 5. Because, if the Association at the present time relinquish the

                    establishment, it will probably never again be available for the

                    purposes of science.
           *' 6. Because it appears, both from the publications of the British As-

                   sociation and from the records in progress at the establishment,
                  that a great amount of electrical and meteorological observation
                   has been and continues to be made, and that a systematic inquiry
                   into the intricate subject of atmospheric electricity has been car-
                  ried out by Mr. Ronalds, which has been productive of very ma-
                   terial improvements in that subject, and has in effect furnished
                  the model of the processes conducted at the Royal Observatory
                   and because these inquiries are still in progress under local cir-
                    cumstances extremely favourable.
           " 7. Because other inquiries into the working of self-registering ap-
                   paratus, both meteorological and magnetical, are in actual pro-
                   gress at the establishment, and that there is a distinct prospect

                of the facilities it affords being speedily much more largely pro-

                      fited by.

          " 8. Because the access to the Observatory from London to Members
                  of the Association will shortly be greatly improved by railroads,
                   and because the local facilities and conveniences of the esta-
                  blishment have been very greatly enhanced by alterations in its
                relations to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests.
                                                    "J. F. W. Herschel, Chairman."

   In presenting this Report to the General Committee, the Council requests

that it may be understood to convey also the opinion of the Council.
   4. The Council has received a letter from the honorary Secretary of the

Literary and Philosophical Institution at Cheltenham, expressing, on the part

of the Members of that Institution, deep regret that " circumstances have

arisen which render uncertain their being able to give the British Association
that welcome and generous reception which it would be their desire to do,
and which they last year felt that they would have done had the Association

been so circumstanced as to have accepted the invitation for the summer of

1846."

   5. The Council has been informed by a letter from W. H. Grove, Esq.,
F.R.S., that a deputation has been appointed by the Mayor and Corporation

of Swansea, the principal inhabitants, magistracy and country gentlemen of

the neighbourhood, and by the Members of the Royal Institution of South
Wales, to attend the Meeting at Southampton, for the purpose of inviting
the British Association to hold their annual Meeting at Swansea at as early
a period as may suit their convenience.

SIR RODERICK IMPEY MURCHISON, G.C.St.S., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.

                                                       &c. &c.

--Gentlemen, After fifteen years of migration to various important cities

and towns in the United Kingdom, you are for the first time assembled in the
South-Eastern districts of England, at the solicitation of the authorities and

inhabitants of Southampton. Easily accessible on all sides to the cultivators
of science, this beautiful and flourishing sea-port is situated in a tract so

adorned by nature, and so full of objects for scientific contemplation, that,
supported as we are by new friends in England, and by old friends from
distant parts of Europe, we shall indeed be wanting to ourselves, if our
proceedings on this occasion should not support the high character which

the British Association has hitherto maintained.

   For my own part, though deeply conscious of my inferiority to my eminent

predecessor in the higher branches of science, I still venture to hope, that

the devotion I have manifested to this Association from its origin to the pre-

sent day, may be viewed by you as a guarantee for the zealous execution of
my duties. Permit me then. Gentlemen, to offer you my warmest acknow-
ledgements for having placed me in this enviable position ; and to assure

you, that I value the approbation which it implies as the highest honour

--which could have been bestowed on me an honour the more esteemed from

its being conferred in a county endeared to me by family connexions, and in
which I rejoice to have made my first essay as a geologist.

    The origin, progress and objects of this our " Parliament of Science " have

been so thoroughly explained on former occasions by your successive Pre-
sidents, particularly in reference to that portion of our body which cultivates
the mathematical, chemical and mechanical sciences, that after briefly allu-
ding to some of the chief results of bygone years, with a view of impressing

upon our new members the general advances we have made, I shall in tins
address dwell more particularly on the recent progress and present state of

natural history, the department of knowledge with which my own pursuits

have been most comiected, whilst I shall also incidentally advert to some of
the proceedings which are likely to occupy our attention during this Meeting.

   No sooner, Gentlemen, had this Association fully estal)lished its character

as a legitimate representative of the science of the United Kingdom, and by
its published Reports, the researches which it instituted, and the other sub-
stantial services which it rendered to science, had secured public respect,
than it proceeded towards the fulfilment of the last of the great objects which
a Brewster and a Harcourt contemplated at its foundation, by inviting the
attention of the Government to important national points of scientific inter-
est. At the fourth Meeting held in Edinburgh, the Association memorialized
the Government to increase the forces of the Ordnance Geographical Survey
of Britain, and to extend speedily to Scotland the benefits which had been
already applied by that admirable establishment to the South of England,
Wales and Ireland. From that time to the present it has not scrupled to call
xxviii  --REPORT 1846.

the notice of the Ministers of the day to everj"^ great scientific measure which
seemed, after due consideration, likely to promote the interests or raise the
character of the British nation. Guided in the choice of these applications
by a committee selected from among its members, it has sedulously avoided
the presentation of any request which did not rest on a rational basis, and
our rulers, far from resisting such appeals, have uniformly and cordially
acquiesced in them. Thus it was when, after pajing large sums from our

own funds for the reduction of masses of astronomical observations, we
represented to the Government the necessity of enabling the Astronomer
Royal to perform the same work on the observations of his predecessors
which had accumulated in the archives of Greenwich, our appeal was an-

swered by arrangements for completing so important a public object at the
public expense. Thus it was, when contemplating the vast accession to pure
science as well as to useful maritime knowledge, to be gained by the ex-
ploration of the South Polar regions, that we gave the first impulse to the
project of the great Antarctic expedition, which, supported by the influence
of the Royal Society and its noble President, obtained the full assent of the
Government, and led to results which, through the merits of Sir James
Ross and his companions, have shed a bright lustre on our country, by
copious additions to geography and natural history, and by affording nu-
merous data for the development of the laws that regulate the magnetism of

the earth.

   The mention of terrestrial magnetism brings with it a crowd of recol-
lections honourable to the British Association, from the perspicuous manner
in which every portion of fresh knowledge on this important subject has
been stoi'ed up in our volumes, with a view to generalization, by Colonel
Sabine and others ; whilst a wide field for its diffusion and combination has
been secured by the congress held at our last meeting, at which some of the
most distinguished foreign and British magneticians were assembled under
the presidency of Sir John Herschel.

    It is indeed most satisfactory for us to know, that not only did all the
recommendations of the Association on this subject which were presented
to our Government meet Avith a most favourable reception, but that in
consequence of the representations made by Her Majesty's Secretary of.
State for Foreign Affairs to the public authorities of other countries which
had previously taken part in the system of cooperative observation, the
Governments of Russia, Austria, Prussia and Belgium have notified their
intention of continuing their respective magnetical and meteorological ob-

servations for another term of three years.
    In passing by other instances in which public liberality has been directed

to channels of knowledge which required opening out, I must not omit to
notice the grant obtained from our gracious Sovereign, of the Royal Obser-
vatory at Kew, which, previously dismantled of its astronomical instruments,
has, under the suggestions of Professor Wheatstone, been converted by us
into a station for observations purely physical, and especially for those de-
 tails of atmospheric phcenomena which are so minute and numerous, and
 require sucii unremitting attention, that they imperiously call for separate
establishments. In realizing this principle, we can now refer British and
 foreign philosophers to our own observatory at Kew, where I have the au-
 thority of most adequate judges for saying they will find that a great amount
 of electrical and meteorological observation has been made, and a system-
 atic inquiry into the intricate subject of atmospheric electricity carried
 out by Mr. Ronalds, to which no higher praise can be given, than that it
 has, in fact, furnished the model of the processes conducted at the Royal
ADDRESS.  XXIX

Observatory of Greenwich. This establishment is besides so useful through
the facilities which it offers for researches into the working of self-register-

ing instruments whicii are there constructed, that I earnestly hope it may

be sustained as heretofore by annual grants from our funds, particularly
as it is accomplishing considerable results at very small cost.

   Our volume for the last year contains several communications on physical

subjects from eminent foreign cultivators of science, whom we have the

pleasure of reckoning amongst our corresponding members, and whose com-
munications, according to the usage of the Association, have been printed
entire amongst the reports. In a discussion of the peculiarities by which the
great comet of IS^S was distinguished. Dr. Von Bogusiawski of Breslau has
taken the occasion to announce the probability, resting on calculations which
will be published in Schumacher's ' Astronomische Nachrichten,' of the iden-
tity of this comet with several of a similar remarkable character recorded in his-
tory, commencing with the one described by Aristotle, which appeared in the
year 371 before our a^i-a : should his calculations be considered to establish
this fact. Dr. Von Bogusiawski proposes that the comet should hereafter be
distinguished by the name of " Aristotle's Comet." This communication
contains also some highly ingenious and important considerations relating to
the physical causes of the phsenomena of the tails of comets.

   Dr. Paul Erman of Berlin, father of the adventurous geographical explorer
and magnetician who was one of the active members of the magnetic con-
gress at Cambridge, has communicated through his son some interesting ex-

periments on the electro-dynamic effects of the friction of conducting sub-
stances, and has pointed out the differences between these and normal
thermo-electric effects. Baron von Senftenberg (who is an admirable ex-

ample of how much may be done by a liberal zeal for science combined

with an independent fortune) has published an account of the success with
which self-registering meteorological instruments have been established at his
observatory at Senftenberg, as well as at the national observatory at Prague.

    Of our own members, Mr. Birt has contributed a second report on Atmo-
spheric Waves, in continuation of the investigation which originated in the
discussion by Sir John Herschel, of the meteorological observations which,
at his suggestion, were made in various parts of the globe, at the periods of
the equinoxes and solstices, commencing with the year 1834.

     In a communication to the Meeting of the Association at York, Colonel
Sabine traced with great clearness (from the hourly observations at Toronto)

the effect of the single diurnal and single annual progressions of tempera-
ture, in producing on the mixed vapourous and gaseous elements of the atmo-
sphere, the well-known progressions of daily and yearly barometrical pressure.
To the conclusions which he then presented, and which apply, perhaps gene-
rally, to situations not greatly elevated in the interior of large tracts of land,
the same author has added, in the last volume, a valuable explanation of
the more complicated phaenomena which happen at points where land and
sea breezes, flowing with regularity, modify periodically and locally the con-
stitution and pressure of the atmosphere. Taking for his data the two-hourly
observations executed at the observatory of Bombay by Dr. Buist, Colonel
Sabine has succeeded in demonstrating for this locality a double daily pro-
gressiou of gaseous pressure, in accordance with tlie flow and re-flow of the
air from surfaces of land and water which are unequally affected by heat.

And thus the diurnal variation of the daily pressure at a point within the

tropics, and on the margin of the sea, is explained by the same reasoning
which was suggested by facts observed in the interior of the vast continent

of North America.
--XXX REPORT 1846.

   Among the many useful national objects which have been promoted by

the physical researches of the British Association, there is one which calls
for marked notice at this time, in the proposal of Mr. Robert Stephenson to
carry an iron tube or suspended tunnel over the Menai Straits to sustain
the great railway to Holyhead. This bold proposal could never have been
realized, if that great engineer had not been acquainted with the progress
recently made in the knowledge of the strength of materials, and specially of
iron ; such knowledge being chiefly due to investigations in which the Asso-
ciation has taken and is still taking a conspicuous share, by the devotion of

--its friends and the employment of its influence investigations which have,

as you know, been prosecuted with great zeal and success by its valued mem-
bers Mr. Hodgkinson and Mr. Fairbairn. I may further state, that in the

recent improvements in railways the aid of scientific investigations having
been called for by the civil engineer, to assist him in determining with accu-
racy the power to be provided for attaining the high velocities of fifty and
sixty miles an hour; it was found and admitted by the most eminent en-
gineers, that the very best data for this purpose, and indeed the only experi-
ments of any practical value, were those which had been provided for some
years ago by a Committee of the British Association, as published in our
Transactions. Let such results as these be our answer when we are asked,

what have been the useful objects attained by the British Association!

   However imperfect my knowledge of experimental philosophy may be, I
must now notice that the last volume of our Reports contains two contribu-

tions to it, in which subjects of the deepest theoretical and practical interest
have been elucidated, at the request of the Association, by the labours of

our foreign coadjutors.
    That some substance of a peculiar kind everywhere exists, or is formed in

the atmosphere by electrical agency, both natural and artificial, had long been
suspected, especially from the persistency of the odour developed by such
agency, and its transference by contact to other matter. Professor Schon-

bein, to whom I shall hereafter advert as the author of an important practical
discovery, is, however, the first philosopher who undertook to investigate the

nature of that substance ; and though the investigation is not yet complete,
he has been enabled to report no inconsiderable progress in this difficult and

refined subject of research.

   A request from the Association to Professor Bunsen of Marburg, and our

countryman Dr. Lyon Playfair, coupled with a contribution of small amount
 towards the expenses involved in the undertaking, has produced a report on
the conditions and products of iron-furnaces which is of considerable value in
 a commercial view to one of the most important of our manufactures, and
 possesses at the same time a very high interest to chemical science in some
of the views which it developes. On the one hand it exhibits an entirely
 new theory of the reduction, by cyanogen gas as the chief agent, of iron
 from the ore; on the other it shows, that in addition to a vast saving of fuel,
 about 2 cwt. of sal-ammoniac may daily be collected at the single establish-
 ment of Alfreton, where the experiments were made ; thus leading us to
 infer that in the iron-furnaces of Britain there may be obtained from vapour
 which now passes away, an enormous quantity of this valuable substance,
 which would materially lessen the dependence of our agriculturists on foreign
guano. It is, indeed, most gratifying to observe, that in pursuing this inquiry

 into the gaseous contents of a blazing furnace of great height, our associates
 traced out, foot by foot, the most recondite chemical processes, and described

 the fiery products with the same accuracy as if their researches had been made
 on the table of a laboratory. Weighed however only in the scales of absolute
                                                      --

                                      ADDRESS.                                        XXXI

and immediate utility, the remarkable results of these skilful and elaborate

experiments give them a character of national importance, and justly entitle

the authors and the body which has aided them to the public thanks.

After this glance at the subjects of purely physical science treated of in

the last volume of our Transactions, let us now consider the domains of

natural history ; and as one of the cultivators of a science which has derived
its main support and most of its new and enlarged views from naturalists,

let rae express the obligation which geologists are under to this Association,

for having aided so effectively in bringing forth the zoological researches

of Owen, Agassiz, and Edward Forbes. These three distinguished men

have themselves announced, that in default of our countenance and assist-

ance, they would not have undertaken, and never could have completed,

some of their most important inquiries. Agassiz, for example, had not

otherwise the means of comparing the ichthyolites of the British Isles with

those of the continent of Europe. Without this impulse, Owen would

not have applied his profound knowledge of comparative anatomy to British

fossil saurians ; and Edward Forbes might never have been the explorer of
the depths of the JEgean, nor have revealed many hitherto unknown laws

of submarine life, if his wishes and suggestions had not met with the warm

support of our body, and been supported by its strongest recommendations

to the Naval authorities.

   Such allusions to naturalists, whose works have afforded the firmest sup-

ports to geology, might lead me to dilate at length on the recent progress of

this science ; but as the subject has been copiously treated at successive
anniversaries of the Geological Society of London, and has had its recent

advances so clearly enunciated by the actual President of that body who now

presides  over  our Geological  Section *,  I  shall  restrain     my  "  esprit  de            "
                                                                                      corps

whilst I briefly advert to some of the prominent advances which geologists

have made. When our associate Conybeare reported to us at our second

meeting, on the actual state and ulterior prospects of what he well termed the

" archaeology of the globe," he dwelt with justice on the numerous reseai'ches

in different countries which had clearly established the history of a descent

--as it were into the bowels of the earth which led us, in a word, downwards

through those newer deposits that connect high antiquity with our own

period, into those strata which support our great British coal-fields. Beyond

this however the perspective was dark and doubtful

                            " Res alta terra et caligiue mersas."

Now, however, we have dispersed this gloom, and by researches first

carried out to a distinct classification in the British Isles, and thence ex-

tended to Russia and Arnerica, geologists have shown that the records of

succession, as indicated by the entombment of fossil animals, are as une-

quivocally developed in these very ancient or palaeozoic strata as in any of

the overlying or more recently formed deposits. After toiling many years in

this department of the science, in conjunction with Sedgwick, Lonsdale, De

Verneuil, Keyserling, and others of ray fellow-labourers, I have arrived at

the conclusion, that we have reached the very genesis of animal life upon

the  globe,  and  that  no  separate  and  clearly  definable      " vestigia                        "

                                                                               retrorsum

will be found beneath that protozoic or Lower Silurian group, in the great

inferior mass of which scarcely a vertebrated animal has yet been detected,

amid the profusion of the lower orders of marine animals entombed in it.
   But however this may be, it is certain that in the last few years all Central

and Eastern Europe, including Turkej'*, and even parts of Siberia have been
brought into accordance M'ith typical strata. France has been accurately

classified and illustrated by the splendid map of Elie de Beaumont and Du-

frenoy ; and whilst, by the labours of Deshayes and others, its tertiary fossils
have been copiously described, the organic remains of its secondary strata are

now undergoing a complete analysis in the beautiful work of M. Alcide d'Or-

bigny. Belgium, whose mineral structure and geological outlines have been
delineated by D'Omalius d'Halloy and Dumont, has produced very perfect
monographs of its palaeozoic and tertiary fossils ; the first in the work of

M. de Koningk, the second in the recently published monograph of M. Nyst.
Germany, led on by Von Buch, has shown that she can now as materially

strengthen ti╗8 zoological and botanical groundworks of the science, as in the
days of Werner she was eminent in laying tliose mineralogical foundations
M'hich have been brought so near to perfection by the labours of several living
men. So numerous in fact have been the recent German contributions, that
I cannot permit myself to specify the names of individuals in a country w'hich
boasts so many excellent geologists. As distinctly connected, however, with
the objects of this Meeting, I must be permitted to state that the ingenious
botanist Gdppert, whose works, in combination with those of Adolphe Brong-
niart in France, have shed so much light on fossil plants, has just sent to me,

--for communication to our Geological Section, the results of his latest inqui-

ries into the formation of the coal of Silesia results which will be the more
interesting to Dr. Buckland and the geologists of England, who have most
attended to this subject, because they are founded on data equally new and

original. Italy has also, to a great extent, been presented to us in its
general geological facies, through the labours of Sismonda, Marmora, Pareto,
Pasiui, Catullo and others ; whilst our kinsmen of the far West, with the

true enterprise of the Saxon race, have so laid open the structure of their
wide-spreading States, that our countryman Lyell has informed us, that the
instructive map which accompanies his work upon North America is simply
the grouping together of data prepared by native State geologists, which he

has paralleled with our well-known British types.
    If then the astronomer has, to a vast extent, expounded the mechanism of

the heavens ; if lately, through his large, new telescope, our associate the
Earl of Rosse has assigned a fixity and order to bodies which were pre-
viously viewed as mere nebulse floating in space, and has also inferred that the
 surface-cavities in our nearest neighbour of the planetary system are analo-

 gous to the volcanic apertures and depressions of the earth ; the geologist,
 contributing data of another order to the storehouse of natural knowledge,
 has determined, by tangible proofs, the very manner in which our planet has
 been successively enveloped in divers cerements, each teeming with peculiar
 forms of distinct life, and has marked the revolutions which have interfered
 witli these successive creations, from the earliest dawn of living things to the
 limits of the historic sera. In short, the fundamental steps gained in geology
 since the early days of the British Association, are so remarkable and so
 numerous, that the time has now come for a second report upon the progress
 of this science, which may I trust be prepared for an approaching Meeting.

     Intimately connected with these broad views of the progress of geology is

 the appearance of the first volume of a national work by Sir Henry De la

 Beche and his associates in the Geological Survey of Great Britain. Fol-
 lowing, as it does, upon the issue of numerous detailed coloured maps and

sections, which for beauty of execution and exactness of detail are unrivalled,
I would specially direct your attention to this new volume, as affording the
clearest evidence that geology is now strictly brought within the pale of the

fixed sciences. In it are found graphic descriptions of the strata in the South-

West of England and South Wales, whose breadth and length are accurately
measured, whose mineral changes are chemically analysed, and whose im-

bedded remains are compared and determined by competent palaeontologists.
The very statistics of the science are thus laid open, theory is made rigorously
to depend on facts, and the processes and produce of foreign mines are com-

pared with those of Britain.

   When we know how intimately the Director- General of this Survey and

his associates have been connected with the meetings of the British Associa-

tion, and how they have freely discussed with us many parts of their re-

--searches when we recollect that the geologist of Yorkshire, our invaluable

Assistant General Secretary, around whom all our arrangements since our
origin have turned, and to whom so much of our success is due, occupies

--his fitting place among these worthies that Edward Forbes, who passed as

it were from this Association to the iEgean, is the palaeontologist of this
Survey ; and again when we reflect, that if this Association had not repaired

to Glasgow, and there discovered the merits of the delineation of the Isle of
Arran by Mr. Ramsay, that young geologist would never have become a

--valuable contributor to the volume under consideration it is obvious from

these statements alone, that the annual visits of our body to different parts

of the Empire, by bringing together kindred spirits, and by testing the natural

capacity of individuals, do most effectually advance science and benefit the
British community.

   Whilst considering these labours of the Government geologists, I shall now
specially speak of those of Professor E. Forbes, because he here makes him-
self doubly welcome, by bringing to us as it were upon the spot the living

specimens of submarine creatures, which through the praiseworthy en-
thusiasm of Mr. M'^Andrew, one of our members, who fitted out a yacht
for natural-history researches, have been dredged up this summer by these

naturalists from the southern coast, between the Land's End and South-
ampton. As a favourite yachting port like Southampton may, it is hoped,

afford imitators, I point out witli pleasure the liberal example of Mr, M'^An-

drew, who although not professing to describe the specimens he collects, has
now, as on former occasions, placed them in the hands of the members best
qualified to do them justice, and is thus a substantial promoter of science.

   The memoir, then, of Edward Forbes in the Government Geological Sur-
vey to which I now allude, is, in truth, an extension of his views re-
specting the causes of the present distribution of plants and animals in the
British Isles, made known crt the last meeting of tlie British Association. As
this author has not only shown the application of these ideas to the re-

searches of the British Geological Survey, but also to the distribution of
animals and plants over the whole earth, it is evident that these views, in

great part original, will introduce a new class of inquiries into natural history,
which will link it on more closely than ever to geology and geography. In
short, this paper may be viewed as the first attempt to explain the causes
of the zoological and botanical features of any region anciently in connexion.
Among the new points which it contains, I will now only mention, that it
very ingeniously (and I trust satisfactorily) explains the origin of the pecu-

--liar features of the botany of Britain the theory of tlie origin of Alpine

--Floras distributed far apart the peculiarity of the zoology of Ireland as

--compared with that of England the presence of the same species of marine
XXxiv  --REPORT 1846.

--animals on the coasts of America and Europe the specialities of the marine
--zoology of the British seas called for by this Association the past and pre-
--sent distribution of the great Mediterranean Flora ; and lastly, it applies

the knowledge we possess of the distribution of plants to the elucidation of
the history of the superficial detritus, termed by geologists the " Northern

Drift."

   Amid the numerous subjects for reflection which the perusal of this me-
moir occasions, I must now restrict myself to two brief comments. First,
to express my belief that even Humboldt himself, who has written so much

and so admirably on Alpine floras, will admit that our associate's explanation
of the origin of identity removes a great stumbling-block from the path of
botanical geographers. Secondly, having myself for some years endeavoured
to show, that the Alpine glacialists had erroneously applied their views, as
founded on terrestrial phaenomena, to large regions of Northern Europe,
which must have been under the sea during the distribution of erratic blocks,
gravel and boulders, I cannot but consider it a strong confirmation of that
opinion, when I find so sound a naturalist as Edward Forbes sustaining the
same view by perfectly independent inferences concerning the migration of
plants to isolated centres, and by a studious examination and comparison of

all the sea shells associated with these transported materials. And if I mis-
take not, my friend Mr. Lyell will find in both the above points, strong evi-

dences in support of his ingenious climatal theories.

   Recent as the blocks and boulders to which I have alluded may seem

to be, they were however accumulated under a glacial sea, whose bottom
was first raised to produce that connexion between the continent and
Britain, by which the land animals migrated from their parent East to our
western climes ; a connexion that was afterwards broken through by the se-
paration of our islands, and by the isolation in each of them of those terres-
trial races which had been propagated to it. This latter inference was also,
indeed, thoroughly sustained by the researches of Professor Owen, commu-
nicated to this Association; first, in the generalization by which his report

on the Extinct Mammals of Australia is terminated, and still more in de-

--tailed reference to our islands in his recently published work ' On the Ex-

tinct Fossil British Mammalia,' a work which he has stated in his dedication
originated at the call of the British Association. Professor Owen, who fills a

Vice-President's chair, adds, indeed, greatly to the strength of our present
Meeting, by also acting as the President of one of our Sections, which having

in its origin been exclusively occupied in the study of Medicine, is now more
peculiarly devoted to the cultivation of Physiology. Under such a leader I

have a right to anticipate, that this remodelled Section will exhibit evidences
of fresh vigour, and will clearly define the vast progress that has been made
in general and comparative anatomy since the daj's of Hunter and of Cuvier,
for so large a part of which we are indebted to our eminent associate. I
may, indeed, confidently announce, from what I know of the communica-

tions about to be made to us by Professor Owen on anatomical homologies,
that our Members will be highly gratified in seeing our next volume en-

hanced with subjects from his pen, which hitherto have almost exclusively

occupied the attention of continental anatomists.
    Assembled in a county which has the good fortune to have been illus-

trated by the attractive history of the naturalist of Selborne, I am confident

that our Fourth Section, to whose labours I would next advert, will yield a
rich harvest, the more so as it is headed by that great zoologist who has en-

riched the adjacent Museum of the Naval Hospital at Haslar with so many

animals from various parts of the world, and has so arranged them as to render
ADDRESS.                                                       XXXV

them objects well-worthy of your notice. The report of Sir John Richardson

in the last volume, on the Fishes of China, Japan and New Zealand, when

coupled with his account in former volumes of the Fauna of North America,

may be regarded as having completely remodelled our knowledge of the

geographical distribution of fishes ; first by affording the data, and next by

explaining the causes through which a community of ichthyological characters

is in some regions widely spread, and in others restricted to limited areas.

We now know, that just as the lofty mountain is the barrier which separates

different animals and plants, as well as peculiar varieties of man, so the deepest

seas are limits which peremptorily check the wide diffusion of certain genera

and species of fishes ; whilst the interspersion of numerous islands, and still

more the continuance of lands throughout an ocean, ensures the distribution

of similar forms over many degrees of latitude and longitude.

The general study, indeed, both of zoology and botany has been sin-

gularly advanced by the labours of the Section of Natural History. I cannot

have acted for many years as your General Secretary without observing,

that by the spirit in which this Section has of late years been conducted,

British naturalists have annually become more philosophical, and have given

to their inquiries a more physiological character, and have more and more

studied the higher questions of structure, laws and distribution. This

cheering result has mainly arisen from the personal intimacy brought about

among various individuals, who, living at great distances from each other,

were previously never congregated ; and from the mutual encouragement

imparted by their interchange of views and their comparisons of specimens.

Many active British naturalists have in fact risen up since these Meetings

commenced, and many (in addition to the examples already mentioned) have

pursued their science directly under the encouragement we have given them.

The combination of the enthusiastic and philosophic spirit thus engendered

among the naturalists, has given popularity to their department of science,

and this Section, assuming an importance to which during our earliest Meet-

ings it could show comparatively slender claims, has vigorously revived the

study of natural history, and among other proofs of it, has given rise to that

useful publishing body the Ray Society, which holds its anniversary du-
ring our sittings. Any analysis of the numerous original and valuable re-

ports and memoirs on botanical and zoological subjects which have occupied

our volumes is forbidden by the limits of this address, but I cannot omit to

advert to the extensive success of Mr. H. Strickland's report on Zoological

Nomenclature, which has been adopted and circulated by the naturalists of

France, Germany, Sweden and America, and also by those of Italy headed

by the Prince of Canino. In each of these countries the code drawn up by

the Association has been warmly welcomed, and through it we may look

forward to the signal advantage being gained, of the adoption of an uniform

zoological nomenclature all o^er the globe.

Whilst investigations into the geographical distribution of animals and plants

have occupied a large share of the attention of our Browns and our Darwins,

it is pleasing to see that some members, chiefly connected with physical

researches, are now bringing these data of natural history to bear upon

Aclimatology and physical geography.         committee of our naturalists, to

whom the subject was referred, has published in our last volume a good

series of instructions for the observation of the periodical phsenomena of

animals and plants, prepared by our foreign associate M. Quetelet, the

Astronomer Royal of Belgium. Naturalists have long been collecting ob-

servations on the effects produced by the annual return of the seasons, but

their various natural-history calendars being local, required comparison and

concentration, as originally suggested by Linnajus, This has now for the
first time been executed by the Belgian Astronomer, who following out a
plan suggested by himself at our Plymouth Meeting, has brought together
the contributions and suggestions of the naturalists of his own country.
When M. Quetelet remarks, " that the phases of the smallest insect are
bound up with the phases of the plant that nourishes it ; that plant itself
beins in its gradual development the product, in some sort, of all anterior
modffications of the soil and atmosphere," he compels the admission, that
the study which should embrace all periodical phaenomena, both diurnal and
annual, would of itself form a science as extended as instructive.

   Referring you to M. Quetelet's report for an explanation of the dependence

of the vegetable and animal kingdoms on the meteorology and physics of
the flobe, and hoping that the simultaneous observations he inculcates will

be followed up in Britain, I am happy to announce, that the outline of a
memoir on physical geography was some months ago put into my hands

by Mr. Cooley, which in a great degree coinciding with the system of
M. Quetelet, has ultimately a different object. M. Quetelet chiefly aims
at investigating the dependence of organized bodies on inorganized matter,
by observing the periodical phfenomena of the former. Mr. Cooley seeks to
obtain an acquaintance with the same phsenomena for the sake of learning
and registering comparative climate as an element of scientific agriculture.
Speaking to you in a county which is so mainly dependent on the produce
of the soil, I cannot have a more favourable opportunity for inculcating the
value of the suggestions of this British geographer. The complete esta-
blishment of all the data of physical geography throughout the British
Islands ; i. e. the registration of the mean and extremes of the temperature of
the air and of the earth ; the amount of conduction, radiation, moisture and
magnetism; the succession of various phases of vegetation, &c. (with their
several local corrections for elevation and aspect), must certainly advance the
cause of science, and promote the material interests of our country.

   A minute knowledge of all the circumstances of climate cannot but be of

 importance to those whose industry only succeeds through the co-operation of
nature, and it may therefore be inferred, how a report like that with which
 I trust Mr. Cooley will favour us, if completed by the addition of tables,
 must prove to be a useful public document. Imbibing the ardour of that

author, I might almost hope that such researches in physical geography may

 enable us to define, in the language of the poet,

                               " Et quid quaeque ferat regio, et quid qiiseque recuset."

 At all events, they will tend to raise physical geography in Britain towards
 the level it has attained in Prussia under the aegis of Humboldt and Ritter,

 and through the beautiful maps of Berghaus.

    Though our countryman, Mr. Keith Johnston, is reproducing, in attrac-
 tive forms, the comparative maps of the last-mentioned Prussian author, much

 indeed still remains to be done in Britain, to encourage the study of physical
 geography and to place it on a basis worthy of tiiis great exploring and colo-

 nizing nation ; and as one of the elementary aids to the training of the youth-

 ful mind to acquire some perception of the science, I commend the spirited
 project of M. Guerin of Paris, to establish in London a georama of vast size,
 the objects and details of which he intends to explain during this week to the

 geographers present.
     Reverting to ceconomical views and the improvement of lands, I would

 remind our agricultural members, that as their great practical Society was

 founded on the model of the British Association, we hope they will always

oome to our Sections for the solution of any questions relating to their pur-

suits to which can be given a purely scientific answer. If they ask for the

explanation of the dependence of vegetation upon subsoil or soil, our geo-

logists and botanists are ready to reply to them. Is it a query on the com-

parison of the relative value of instruments destined to ceconomize labour,

the mechanicians now present are capable of answering it. And if, above all,

they wish us to solve their doubts respecting the qualities of soils and the re-
sults of their mixtures, or the effects of various manures upon them, our che-

mists are at hand. One department of our Institution is, in fact, styled the

Section of Chemistry and Mineralogy, with their applications to Agriculture
and the Arts, and is officered in part by the very men, Johnston, Daubeny and

Piayfair, to whom the agriculturists have, in nearly all cases, appealed. The

first-mentioned of these was one of our earliest friends and founders ; the

second had the merit of standing by the British Association at its first meet-

ing, and there inviting us to repair to that great University where he is so
much respected, and where he is now steadily determining, by elaborate
experiments, the dependence of many species of plants on soil, air and

stimulus ; whilst the third has already been alluded to as one of our best

actual contributors.

If in reviewing our previous labours I have endeavoured to gain your at-

tention by some incidental allusions to our present proceedings, I have yet to

assure you, that the memoirs communicated to our Secretaries are sufficiently

numerous to occupy our Sections during the ensuing week with all the vigour

which has marked our opening day. Among the topics to which our as-
sembling at Southampton gives peculiar interest, I may still say that if

geologists should find much to interest them in the Isle of Wight, the same
island contains a field for a very curious joint discussion between them and

the mathematicians, with which I became acquainted in a previous visit to

this place. It is a discovery by Colonel Colby, the Director of the Trigo-

nometrical Survey, of the existence of a notable attraction of the plumb-line

to the south, at the trigonometrical station called Dunnose, on Shanklin

Down. The details of this singular phsenomenon, which has been verified

by observations with the best zenith sectors, will be laid before the Sections.

In the meantime, we may well wonder, that on the summit of a chalk hill of

low altitude which is bounded on the south by the sea (near whose level the

deviation is scarcely perceptible), there should exist an attraction of more
than half the intensity of that which was registered by Maskelyne, when he

suspended a plummet at the side of the lofty Scottish mountain of Schehal-
lion ! If those of our geologists, who like Mr. Hopkins of Cambridge have

entered boldly into the field of geological dynamics, cannot explain this re-

markable fact, by connecting it with the ridge of dislocated strata that runs

through the island as a back-bone from west to east, may we venture to

refer it to dense plutonic masses, of rock ranging beneath the surface, parallel

to the line of displacement of the deposits ?

 -- --Another local subject one indeed of positive practical interest that

stands before us for discussion, is, whether, by persevering in deepening the

large shaft which they have sunk so deep into the chalk near this tqwn, the

inhabitants of Southampton may expect to be eventually repaid, like those

of Paris, by a full supply of subterranean water, which shall rise to the

surface of the low plateau on which the work has been undertaken ? On

no occasion, I must observe, could this town be furnished with a greater

number of willing counsellors, whose opinions will, it is hoped, be ade-

quately valued by the local authorities. The question whether this work

ought to be proceeded with or not, will however, I apprehend, be most

effectively answered by those geologists who are best acquainted with the
sections in the interior of this county, and with the levels at which the upper
greensand and subcretaceous strata there crop out and receive the waters,
which thence flow southwards beneath the whole body of chalk, of the hills

in the south of Hampshire.

 --Again, as we are now assembled in the neighbourhood of our great

naval arsenal as some of its functionaries, including the Admiral on the

station, have honoured us with their support, and as, further, I am now
speaking in a town whose magnificent new docks may compete with any

for bold and successful engineering, I must say a few words on our naval
architecture, the more so as we have here a Mechanical Section, presided
over by the eminent mechanician Professor Willis, assisted by the great
dynamical mathematician Dr. Robinson, and that sound engineer George
Rennie. Duly impressed with the vast national importance of this subject,
and at the same time of its necessary dependence on mathematical principles,
the British Association endeavoured in its earliest days to rouse attention to
the state of ship-building in England, and to the history of its progress in
France and other countries, through a memoir by the late Mr. G. Harvey.
It was then contended, that notwithstanding the extreme perfection to which
the internal mechanism of vessels had been brought, their external forms

or lines, on which their sailing so much depends, were deficient as to ad-
justment by mathematical theory. Our associate Mr. Scott Russell has,
as you know, ably developed this view. Experimenting upon the resistance

of water, and ascertaining with precision the forms of vessels which would
pass through it with the least resistance, and consequently with the greatest
velocity, he has contributed a most valuable series of memoirs, accompanied
by a great number of diagrams, to illustrate his opinions and to show the
dependence of naval architecture on certain mathematical lines. Employed,
in the meantime, by merchants on their own account, to plan the construction
of sailing ships and steamers, Mr. Scott Russell has been so successful in
combining theory with practice, that we must feel satisfied in having at
different meetings helped him onwards by several money grants ; our only

regret being, that our means should not have permitted us to publish (he
whole number of diagrams of the lines prepared by this ingenious author.

    But however desirous to promote theoretical knowledge on this point, the
men of science are far from wishing not to pay every deference to the skilful
artificers of our wooden bulwarks, on account of their experience and practi-
cal acquaintance with subjects they have so long and so successfully handled.

We are, indeed, fully aware, that the naval architects of the Government,

who construct vessels carrying a great weight of metal and requiring
much solidity and capacious stowage, have to solve many problems with
which the owners of trading vessels or packets have little concern. All that
we can wish for is, that our naval arsenals should contain schools or public
 boards of ship-building, in which there might be collected all the " constants

 of the art," in reference to capacity, displacement, stowage, velocity, pitching

and rolling, masting, the effect of sails and the resistance of fluids. Having
ourselves expended contributions to an extent which testify, at all events,
our zeal in this matter, we are, I think, entitled to express a hope, that the
data derived from practice by our eminent navigators may be effectively
combined with the indications of sound theory prepared by approved culti-
vators of mathematical and mechanical science.

    I cannot thus touch upon such useful subjects without saying, that our Sta-
tistical Section has been so well conducted by its former presidents, that its
subjects, liable at all times to be diverted into moral considerations and thence
ADDRESS.             XXXIX

into politics, have been invariably restricted to the branch of the science
which deals in facts and numbers ; and as no one individual has contributed
more to the storehouse of such valuable knowledge than Mr. George Porter

(as evidenced even by his report in our last volume), so may we believe that

in this town, with which he is intimately connected, he will contribute to
raise still higher the claims of the Section over which he is so well qualified

 to preside.

    If in this discourse I have referred somewhat more largely to those
 branches of science which pertain to the general division of natural history,

in which alone I can venture to judge of the progress made by others, let me
however say, that no member of this body can appreciate more highlj^ than

I do, the claims of the mathematical and experimental parts of philosophy,

in which my friend Professor Baden Powell of Oxford, who supports me as
a Vice-President of this meeting, has taken so distinguished a part. No one

has witnessed with greater satisfaction the attendance at our former meetings
of men, from all parts of Europe, the most eminent in these high pursuits.

No one can more glory in having been an officer of this Association when

it was honoured with the presence of its illustrious correspondent Bessel,

than whom the world has never produced a more profound astronomer.
If among his numerous splendid discoveries he furnished astronomers with

--what they had so long and so ardently desired a fixed and ascertained point

in the immensity of space, beyond the limits of our own sidereal system, it is
to Bessel, as 1 am assured by a contemporary worthy of him, that Englishmen
owe a debt of gratitude for his elaborate discussion of the observations of their
immortal Bradley, which, in his hands, became the base of modern astronomy.

    Passing from this recollection, so proud yet so mournful to us all as
friends and admirers of the deceased Prussian astronomer, can anyone see with
more delight than myself the brilliant concurrence at our present Meeting of

naturalists, geologists, physiologists, ethnologists and statists, with mathemati-

cians, astronomers, mechanicians, and experimental philosophers in physics and
in chemistry? Surely then I may be allowed to signalize a particular ground of
gratification among so many, in the presence at this Meeting of two individuals
in our Experimental Sections, to one of whom, our eminent foreign associate

Oersted, we owe the first great link between electric and magnetic phsenomena,
by showing the magnetic properties of the galvanic current ; whilst the other,
our own Faraday, among other new and great truths which have raised the

character of English science throughout the world, obtained the converse

proof by evoking electricity out of magnets. And if it be not given to the
geologist whom you have honoured with this chair, to explain how such arcana

have been revealed, still, as a worshiper in the outer portico of the temple of

physical science, he may be permitted to picture to himself the delight which
the Danish philosopher must have felt, when on returning to our shores, after

an absence of a quarter of a century, he found that the grand train of dis-
covery of which he is the progenitor, had just received its crowning accession
in England from his former disciple, who, after a long and brilliant series
of investigations peculiarly his own, has shown that magnetic or dia-magnetic

forces are distributed throughout all nature.

   And thus shall we continue to be a true British Association, with cosmo-
polite connexions, so long as we have among us eminent men to attract such
foreign contemporaries to our shores. If then at the last assembly we ex-

perienced the good effects which flowed from a concentration of mathe-

--maticians and magneticians, drawn together from different European king-

doms if then also the man* of solid learning, who then represented the

United States of America, and who is now worthily presiding over the Cam-

bridge University of his native soil, spoke to us with chastened eloquence
of the benefits our Institution was conferring on mankind ; let us rejoice
that this Meeting is honoured by the presence of foreign philosophers as

distinguished as those of any former year.

   Let us rejoice that we have now among us men of science from Den-
mark, Sweden, Russia, Prussia, Switzerland, Italy and France. The King

of Denmark, himself personally distinguished for his acquaintance with
several branches of natural history, and a warm patron of science, has
honoured us by sending hither, not only the great discoverer Oersted, who
evincing fresh vigour in his mature age brings with him new communications

on physical science, but also my valued friend, the able geologist and chemist
Forchhammer, who has produced the first geological map of Denmark, and
who has presented to us a lucid memoir on the influence exercised by marine

plants on the formation of ancient crystalline rocks, on the present sea and

on agriculture.

   As these two eminent men and their associates of the North received me

as the General Secretary of the British Association with their wonted cor-
diality at the last Scandinavian Scientific Assembly, I trust we may convince
them that the sentiment is reciprocal, and that Englishmen are akin to them
in the virtues of friendship and hospitality which so distinguish the dwellers

within the circle of Odin.

   Still adverting to Scandinavia, we see here a deputy from the country of Lin-
nгEus in the person of Professor Svanberg, a successful young experimenter in

--physics, who represents his great master Berzelius that profound chemist and

leader of the science of the North of Europe, who established on a firm basis
the laws of atomic weights and definite proportions, and who has personally
assured me, that if our Meeting had not been fixed in the month of September,
when the agriculturists of Sweden assemble at Stockholm, he would as-
suredly have repaired to us. And if the same cause has prevented Nilsson
from coming hither, and has abstracted Retzius from us (who was till within
these few days in England), I cannot mention these distinguished men, who
earnestly desired to be present, without expressing the hope, that the memoirs
they communicate to us may give such additional support to our British ethno-
logists, as will enable this new branch of science, which investigates the origin

of races and languages, to take the prominent place in our assemblies to

which it is justly entitled.
    The Royal Academy of Berlin, whose deputies on former occasions have

been an Ehrenberg, a Buch, and an Erman, has honoured us by sending
hither M. Heinrich Rose, whose work on chemical analysis is a text-book
even for the most learned chemists in every country ; and whilst his researches
on the constitution of minerals, like those of his eminent brother Gustave on
their form, have obtained for him so high a reputation, he now brings to us
the description of a new metal which he has discovered in the Tantalite of

Bavaria.
    Switzerland has again given to us that great master in palaeontology, Agassiz,

who has put arms into the hands of British geologists with which they have
conquered vast regions, and who now on his road to new fields in America,

brings to us his report on the fossil fishes of the basin of London, which will, he
assures me, exceed in size all that he has ever written on ichthyolites.

    From the same country we have our warm friend Professor Schonbein, who,
in addition to his report on Ozone, to which I have already referred, has now
brought to us a discovery which promises to be of vast practical importance.
The " gun-cotton" of Schonbein, the powers of which he will exhibit to his
ADDRESS.  xli

colleagues, is an explosive substance, which is stated to exercise a stronger
projectile force than gunpowder, to possess the great advantages over it of
producing little or no smoiie or noise, and of scarcely soiling fire-arms ; whilst
no amount of wet injures this new substance, which is as serviceable after
being dried as in its first condition. The mere mention of these properties,
to which our associate lays claim for his new material, is sufficient to sug-
gest its extraordinary value in warlike affairs, as also in every sort of sub-

terranean blasting, and may well lead me to say, that this discovery, which
may almost rival the invention of the substance which it is destined to sup-
plant, will signally mark this meeting at Southampton. But, as if British

chemistry were not to be outdone, here also there will be promulgated, for
the first time, the very rema;rkable discovery of our countryman Mr. Grove,
of the decomposition of water by heat.

   Professor Matteucci of Modena, who joined us at the York meeting, and
then explained his various new and delicate investigations in electro-phy-

siology, again favours us with a visit, as the representative of the Italian

Philosophical Society of Modena and of the University of Pisa. This
ingenious philosopher, who has measured the effect of galvanic currents in

exciting through the nerves mechanical force in the muscles, doubtless brings
with him such interesting contribution as will add great additional interest

to the proceedings of the Physiological Section.

   Among these sources of gratification, no one has afforded me sincerer

pleasure than to welcome hither the undaunted Siberian explorer. Professor

von Middendorff. Deeply impressed as I am with the estimation in

which science is held by the illustrious ruler of the empire of Russia, I
cannot but hope that the presence of this traveller, so signalized by his
enterprising exploits, may meet with a friend in every Englishman who is

burgh with the natural productions, both fossil and recent, of all these wild
and untrodden lands, are the exploits for which the Royal Geographical So-
ciety of London has, at its last meeting, conferred its Gold Victoria Medal on
this most successful explorer. Professor von Middendorff now visits us to con-
verse with our naturalists most able to assist him, and to inspect our museums,
in which, by comparison, he can best determine the value of specific cha-
racters before he completes the description of his copious accumulations; and

I trust that during his stay in England he will be treated with as much true

hospitality as I have myself received at the hands of his kind countrymen.

   It is impossible for me to make this allusion to the Russian empire, without
assuring you that our allies in science on the Neva, who have previously sent
to us a Jacobi and a Kupffer, are warmly desirous of continuing their good
connexion with us. It was indeed a source of great pleasure to me to have

 recently had personal intercourse in this very town with that eminent scientific
 navigator Admiral Liitke, in whose squadron His Imperial Highness the

 Grand Duke Constantine was acquiring a knowledge of his maritime duties.
--Xlii REPORT 1846.

Besides the narrative of his former voyages, Liitke has since published an

account of the periodical tides in the Great Northern Ocean and in the

Glacial Sea, which I have reason to think is little known in this country.

Having since established a hypsalographe in the White Sea, and being also

occupied from time to time in observations in Behring's Straits, the Russians

will soon be able to provide us with other important additions to our

knowledge of this subject. Separated so widely as Admiral Liitke and Dr.

Whewell are from each other, it is pleasing to see, that the very recommenda-

tion which the last-mentioned distinguished philosopher of the tides has re-

cently suggested to me, as a subject to be encouraged by this Association, has

been zealously advocated by the former. Let us hope then that this Meeting

will not pass away without powerfully recommending to our own Government,

as well as to that of His Imperial Majesty, the carrying out of systematic and

simultaneous investigations of the tides in the Great Ocean, particularly in the

--Northern Pacific, a subject (as Admiral Liitke well observes) which is not

less worthy of special expeditions and of the attention of great scientific bodies,

than the present inquiries into terrestrial magnetism ; and one which, I may

add, this Association will doubtless warmly espouse, since it has such strong

grounds for being satisfied with the results which it has already contributed to
obtain through its own grants, and by the researches of several of its associates.

Lastly, in alluding to our foreign attendants, let us hope that our nearest

neighbours may respond to our call, and may prove by their affluence to

Southampton,  that  in  the realms of  science there  is  that  "  entente                   "
                                                                            cordiale

between their great nation and our own, of which, at a former meeting, we

were assured by the profound Arago himself. No sooner was it made known

that the Chair of Chemistry at this Meeting was to be filled by Michael

Faraday, than a compeer worthy of him in the Academy of Sciences of Paris

was announced in the person of M. Dumas *, by a letter from that philoso-

pher to myself. To M. Dumas it is well known that we owe, not only the

discovery of the law of substitution of types, which has so powerfully aided

the progress of organic chemistry, but also the successful application of his

science to the arts and useful purposes of life ; his great work on that sub-
ject, ' La Chiniie appliquee aux Arts,' being as familiar in every manufactory

in England as it is upon the Continent.

Nor, if we turn from chemistry to geology, will such of us as work among

the rocks be backward in welcoming any French geologists who may come

to examine, in our own natural sections of the Isle of Wight, the peculiar

development of their Paris basin, the identity of their chalk and our own,

the fine sections of our greensand and of the Wealden formation of Mantell,

and to determine with us in situ the strict relations of their Neocomian rocks

with those peculiar strata which at Atherfield, in the Isle of Wight, have

been so admirably illustrated by Dr. Fitton and other native geologists, and

of which such beautiful and accurate diagrams have been prepared by

Captain Ibbetson.

    Will it not then be admitted, that the gathering together of such foreign

philosophers, as those above mentioned, with our own men of science, must

be productive of good results? Putting aside even the acknov/ledged fact,

that numerous memoirs of value are published in one country which are

unknown in another, where is the person, acquainted with the present acce-

lerated march of science, who can doubt that the germs of discovery which

are floating in the minds of distant contemporaries, must often be brought

to maturity by the interchange of such thouglits? The collision of these

his apology only reached the President towards the close of the Meeting.

thoughts may indeed be compared to the agency of the electric telegraph of
our own Wheatstone, which concentrates knowledge from afar, and at once
unites the extremities of kingdoms in a common circle of intelligence.

   But although the distinguished foreigners to whom I have adverted, and
others, including our welcome associate M. Wartmann, the Founder of the
Vaudois Society, and M. Prevost of Geneva, on whose merits I would
willingly dilate if time permitted it, are now collected around us ; many,
among whom I must name M. de Caumont, the President of the French

Society for the Advancement of Science, have been prevented from ho-

nouring us with their presence, because the national meetings in their

several countries also occur in the month of September. To remedy this in-
convenience, 1 ventured, when addressing you six years ago at the Glasgow
meeting, to express the hope, that each of the European societies might
be led to abstain during one year from assembling in its own country, for
the purpose of repairing by its own deputies to a general congress, to be

held at Frankfort or other central city under the presidency of the universal

Humboldt. Had the preparation of the ' Cosmos ' and other avocations of

that renowned individual permitted him to accept this proposition, which
the British Association would doubtless have supported, many benefits to

science must have resulted, and each national body, on re-assembling the

following year in its native land, would, I am convinced, have more vigorously

resumed its researches.

    But whether it be considered desirable or not to suspend the national

scientific meetings during one year, I call on my countrymen and their foreign
friends now present, to sustain the proposal for centralizing in a future year

the representatives of the various branches of science of different countries,

when they may at once learn the progress made in each nation, and when, at

all events, they can so appoint the periods of their respective assemblies,

as to prevent those simultaneous meetings in France, Germany, Scandinavia,
Italy, Switzerland and England, which are so much to be deprecated as in-
terfering with a mutual intercourse.

   Finally, my fellow-labourers in science, if by our united exertions we have
done and are doing good public service, let me revert once more to the place

in which we are assembled, and express on your part the gratification I know
you experience in being on this occasion as well supported by the noblemen,

--clergymen, and landed proprietors around Southampton, as by its inhabitants

themselves an union which thus testifies that the British Association em-
braces all parties and all classes of men.

   Seeing near me Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
the Speaker of the House of Commons, and several persons of high station
and great influence, who willingly indicate by their presence the sense

they entertain of the value of our conferences and researches, let us wel-
come these distinguished individuals, as living evidences of that good opinion
of our countrymen, the possession of whichл will cheer us onward in our

career. And above all, let us cherish the recollection of this Southampton

Meeting, which will be rendered memorable in our annals by the pre-
sence of the illustrious Consort of our beloved Sovereign, who participating
in our pursuits, in some of which His Royal Highness is so well-versed,
thus demonstrates that our Association is truly national, and enjoys the
most general and effectual support throughout British society, from the

humblest cultivators of science to the highest personages in the realm.

            REPORTS

                               ON

       THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

             Report on Recent Researches in Hydrodynamics,

By G. G, Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge.

At the meeting of the British Association held at Cambridge last year, the

Committee of the Mathematical Section expressed a wish that a Report on
Hydrodynamics should be prepared, in continuation of the reports which
Prof. Challis had already presented to the Association on that subject. Prof.
Challis having declined the task of preparing this report, in consequence of
the pressure of other engagements, the Committee of the Association did

me the honour to entrust it to me. In accordance with the wishes of the

Committee, the object of the present report will be to notice researches in
this subject subsequent to the date of the reports of Prof. Challis. It will
sometimes however be convenient, for the sake of giving a connected view
of certain branches of the subject, to refer briefly to earlier investigations.

    The fundamental hypothesis on which the science of hydrostatics is based
may be considered to be, that the mutual action of two adjacent portions of
a fluid at rest is normal to the surface which separates them. The equality

of pressure in all directions is not an independent hypothesis, but a necessary

consequence of the former. This may be easily proved by the method given
in the Exercices of M. Cauchy*, a method which depends on the considera-

tion of the forces acting on a tetrahedron of the fluid, the dimensions of which
are in the end supposed to vanish. This proof applies equally to fluids at

rest and fluids in motion ; and thus the hypothesis above-mentioned may be

considered as the fundamental hypothesis of the ordinary theory of hydro-
dynamics, as well as hydrostatics. This hypothesis is fully confirmed by ex-
periment in the case of the equilibrium of fluids ; but the comparison of theory
and experiment is by no means so easy in the case of their motion, on account
of the mathematical difficulty of treating the equations of motion. Still
enough has been done to show that the ordinary equations will suffice for
the explanation of a great variety of phsenomena ; while there are others the

laws of which depend on a tangential force, which Is neglected in the common

theory, and in consequence of which the pressure is different in different
directions about the same point. The linear motion of fluids in uniform
pipes and canals is a simple instance. In the following report I shall first

consider the common theory of hydrodynamics, and then notice some theo-

ries which take account of the inequality of pressure in different directions.
It will be convenient to consider the subject under the following heads :

    I. General theorems connected with the ordinary equations of fluid motion.
   II. Theory of waves, including tides.

III. The discharge of gases through small orifices.

IV. Theory of sound.

V. Simultaneous oscillations of fluids and solids.
VI. Formation of the equations of motion when the pressure is not sup-

posed equal in all directions.

   I. Although the common equations of hydrodynamics have been so long
known, their comi)lexity is so great that little has been done with them

except in the case in which the expression usually denoted by

                      udx + vdy+wdz                            (A.)

is the exact differential of a function of the independent variables x, 7/, z*.

It becomes then of the utmost importance to inquire in what cases this sup-

position may be made. Now Lagrange enunciated two theorems, by virtue
of which, supposing them true, the supposition may be made in a great

number of important cases, in fact, in nearly all those cases which it is most
interesting to investigate. It must be premised that in these theorems the

+accelerating forces X, Y, Zare supposed to be such that Xdx+ Ydy Zdz is

an exact differential, supposing the time constant, and the density of the fluid is
supposed to be either constant, or a function of the pressure. The theorems are

    First, that (A.) is approximately an exact differential when the motion is

wBO small that squares and products of u, v, and their differential coefficients

may be neglected. By calling (A.) approximately an exact differential, it is
meant that there exists an expression uflx-\-\\dy-\-wflz, which is accurately

wan exact differential, and which is such that m,, v^, lo, differ from u, v,

respectively by quantities of the second order only.
    Secondly, that (A.) is accurately an exact differential at all times when it

is so at one instant, and in particular when tiie motion begins from rest.
    It has been pointed out by Poisson that the first of these theorems is not

truef . In fact, the initial motion, being arbitrary, need not be such as to
render (A.) an exact differential. Thus those cases coming under the first
theorem in which the assertion is true are merged in those which come under
the second, at least if we except the case of small motions kept up by dis-

turbing causes, a case in which we have no occasion to consider initial motion

at all. Tliis case it is true is very important.

   The validity of Lagrange's proof of the second theorem depends on the

wlegitimacy of supposing u, v and capable of expansion according to posi-

tive, integral powers of the time t, for a sufficiently small value of that varia-

ble. This proof lies open to objection ; for there are functions of t the
expansions of whlcli contain fractional powers, and there are others which

cannot be expanded according to ascending powers of t, integral or fractional,

=even though they may vanish when < 0. It has been shown by Mr. Power

wthat Lagrange's proof is still applicable if w, ?; and admit of expansion

according to ascending powers of ^ of any kind;]:. The second objection
however still remains: nor does the proof which Poisson has substituted for
Lagrange's in his ' Traite de Mecanique' appear at all more satisfactory.
Besides, it does not appear from tliese proofs what becomes of the theorem if
it is only for a certain portion of the fluid that (A.) is at one instant an exact

differential.

   M. Cauchy has however given a proof of the theorem з, which is totally
different from either of the former, and perfectly satisfactory. M. Cauchy

    * In nearly all the investigations of Mr. Airy it will be found that (A.) is an exact dififeren-
tial, although he docs not start with assuming it to be so.

first eliminates the pressure by differentiation from the three partial differential

equations of motion. He then changes the independent variables in the

three resulting equations from x, y, z, t to a, b, c, t, where a, b, c are the

initial co-ordinates of the particle whose co-ordinates at the time t are x, y, z.
The three transformed equations admit each of being once integrated with
respect to t, and the arbitrary functions of a, b, c introduced by integration
are determined by the initial motion, which is supposed to be given. The
theorem in question is deduced without difficulty from the integrals thus
obtained. It is easily proved that if the velocity is suddenly altered by

means of impulsive forces applied at the surface of the fluid, the alteration is
such as to leave (A.) an exact differential if it were such before impact.

M. Cauchy's proof shows moreover that if (A.) be an exact differential for

one portion of the fluid, although not for the whole, it will always remain so

for that portion. It should be observed, that although M. Cauchy has proved
the theorem for an incompressible fluid only, the same method of proof

applies to the more general case in which the density is a function of the

pressure.

   In a paper read last year before the Cambridge Philosophical Society, I
have given a new proof of the same theorem*. This proof is rather simpler
than M. Cauchy's, inasmuch as it does not require any integration.

    In a paper published in the Philosophical Magazine f, Prof. Challis has
raised an objection to the application of the theorem to the case in which
the motion of the fluid begins from rest. According to the views contained
in this paper, we are not in general at liberty to suppose (A.) to be an exact
differential when u, v and %u vanish : this supposition can only be made when

the limiting value of if-* (udx+vdy+wdz) is an exact differential, where

a is so taken as that one at least of the terms in this expression does not

vanish when t vanishes.
    It is maintained by Prof. Challis that the received equations of hydro-

dynamics are not complete, as regards the analytical principles of the science,

and he has given a new fundamental equation, in addition to those received,
which he calls the equation of continuity of the motionX. On this equation
Prof. Challis rests a result at which he has arrived, and which all must allow

to be most important, supposing it correct, namely that whenever (A.) is an

exact differential the motion of the fluid is necessarily rectilinear, one peculiar
case of circular motion being excepted. As I have the misfortune to differ

from Professor Challis on the points mentioned in this and the preceding

paragraph, for reasons which cannot be stated here, it may be well to apprise

the reader that many of the results which will be mentioned farther on as

satisfactory lie open to Prof. Challis's objections.

By virtue of the equation of continuity of a homogeneous incompressible
--udyfluid, the expression
                                 vdx will always be the exact differential of a

function of x and y. In the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions з there

will be found some applications of this function, and of an analogous function

for the case of motion which is symmetrical about an axis, and takes place

in planes passing through the axis. The former of these functions had been

previously employed by Mr. Earnshaw.

II. In the investigations which come under this head, it is to be understood

that the motion is supposed to be very smallj so that first powers only of

small quantities are retained, unless the contrary is stated.

--4 REPORT 1846.

MM.The researches of  Poisson and Cauchy were directed to the inves-

tigation of the waves produced by disturbing causes acting arbitrarily on a

small portion of ihe fluid, which is then left to itself. The mathematical

treatment of such cases is extremely difficult ; and after all, motions of this

kind are not thoi^e which it is most interesting to investigate. Consequently

it is the simpler cases of wave motion, and those which are more nearly con-

nected with tlie phsenomena which it is most desirable to explain, that have

formed the principal subject of more recent investigations. It is true that

there is one memoir by IVI. Ostrogradsky, read before the French Academy

in 1826*, to which this character does not apply. In this memoir the author

has determined the motion of the fluid contained in a cylindrical basin, sup-

posing the fluid at first at rest, but its surface not horizontal. The interest

of the memoir however depends almost exclusively on the mathematical

processes employed ; for the result is very complicated, and has not been

discussed by the authoi*. There is one circumstance mentioned by M. Plana+

which increases the importance of the memoir in a mathematical point of

view, which is that Poisson met with an apparent impossibility in endea-

vouring to solve the same problem. I do not know whether Poisson's attempt

was ever published.

  --Theory of Long Waves. When the length of the waves whose motion is

considered is very great compared with the depth of the fluid, we may without

sensible error neglect the difterence between the horizontal motions of dif-

ferent particles in the same vertical line, or in other words suppose the par-

ticles once in a vertical line to remain in a vertical line : we may also neglect

the vertical, compared with the horizontal effective force. These considera-

tions extremely simplify the problem ; and the theory of long waves is very

important from its bearing on the theory of the tides. Lagrange's solution

of the problem in the case of a fluid of uniform depth is well known. It is

true that Lagrange fell into error in extending his solution to cases to which

it does not apply ; but there is no question as to the correctness of his result
when properly restricted, that is when applied to the case of long waves only.

There are however many questions of interest connected with this theory

which have not been considered by Lagrange. For instance, what will be

the velocity of propagation in a uniform canal whose section is not rectan-

gular? How will the form of the wave be altered if the depth of the fluid,

or the dimensions of the canal, gradually alter ?

   In a paper read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society in May 1 837 +,

the late Mr. Green has considered the motion of long w aves in a rectangular

canal whose depth and breadth alter very slowly, but in other respects quite

--arbitrarily. Mr. Green arrived at the following results : If /3 be the breadth,

and y the depth of the canal, then the height of the wave 0C/3~^y~^, the
horizontal velocity of the particles inagiven phaseof their motion OC (8~ y~*'

=the length of the wave OC y'^, and the velocity of propagation '*/gy- With

respect to the height of the wave, Mr. Russell was led by his experiments to
the same law of its variation as regards the breadth of the canal, and with
respect to the eff'ect of the depth he observes that the height of the wave
increases as the depth of the fluid decreases, but that the variation of the
height of the wave is very slow compared with the variation of the depth of
the canal.

February 1839*, Mr. Green has given the theory of the motion of long waves
in a triangular canal with one side vertical. Mr. Green found the velocity of
propagation to be the same as that in a rectangular canal of half the depth.

   In a memoir read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in April 1839t>
Prof. Kelland has considered the case of a uniform canal whose section is of

any form. He finds that the velocity of propagation is given by the very

Asimple formula a /^--, where is the area of a section of the canal, and

b the breadth of the fluid at the surface. This formula agrees with the ex-
periments of Mr. Russell, and includes as a particular case the formula of

Mr. Green for a triangular canal.
   Mr. Airy, the Astronomer Royal, in his excellent treatise on Tides and

Waves, has considered the case of a variable canal with more generality than

Mr. Green, inasmuch as he has supposed the section to be of any form J. If
A, b denote the same things as in the last paragraph, only that now they are

supposed to vary slowly in passing along the canal, the coefficient of horizontal

displacement OC A~^ b^, and that of the vertical displacement OC A~^ 6~*>

while the velocity of propagation at any point of tlie canal is that given by

the formula of the preceding paragraph. Mr. Airy has proved the latter

formula з in a more simple manner than Prof. Kelland, and has pointed out
the restrictions under which it is true. Other results of Mr. Airy's will be

more conveniently considered in connection with the tides.

  --Theory of Oscillatory Waves. When the surface of water is covered with

an irregular series of waves of different sizes, the longer waves will be con-

tinually overtaking the shorter, and the motion will be very complicated, and

will offer no regular laws. In order to obtain such laws we must take a

simpler case : we may for instance propose to ourselves to investigate the

motion of a series of waves which are propagated with a constant velocity,

and without change of form, in a fluid of uniform depth, the motion being in

Atwo dimensions and periodical.  series of waves of this sort may be taken

as the type of oscillatory waves in general, or at least of those for which the

motion is in two dimensions : to whatever extent a series of waves propagated

in fluid of a uniform depth deviates from this standard form, to the same ex-

tent they fail in the characters of uniform propagation and invariable form.

The theory of these waves has long been known. In fact each element of

MM.the integrals by which  Poisson and Cauchy expressed the disturbance

of the fluid denotes what is called by Mr. Airy a standing oscillation, and a

progressive oscillation of the kind under consideration will result from the

superposition of two of these standing oscillations properly combined. Or,

if we merely replace products of sines and cosints under the integral signs

by sums and differences, each element of the new integrals will denote a

progressive oscillation of the standard kind. The theory of these waves how-

ever well deserves a more detailed investigation. The most important formula

connected with them is that which gives the relation between the velocity of

propagation, the length of the waves, and the depth of the fluid. If c be the

velocity of propagation, X the length of the waves, measured from crest to

m =crest, h the depth of the fluid, and  ^^, then

   If the surface of the fluid be cut by a vertical plane perpendicular to the

ridges of the waves, the section of the surface will be the curve of sines.
Each particle of the fluid moves round and round in an ellipse, whose major
axis is horizontal. The particle is in its highest position when the crest of
the wave is passing over it, and is then moving in the direction of propaga-
tion of the wave ; it is in its lowest position when the hollow of the wave is
passing over it, and is then moving in a direction contrary to the direction

of propagation. At the bottom of the fluid the ellipse is reduced to a right

line, along which the particle oscillates. When the length of waves is very

small compared with the depth of the fluid, the motion at the bottom is in-
sensible, and all the expressions will be sensibly the same as if the depth were

/з--OnInfinite.
this supposition the expression for c reduces itself to a

The ellipses in which the particles move are replaced by circles, and the
motion in each circle is uniform. The motion decreases with extreme rapid-

ity as the point considered is further removed from the surface ; in fact,

the coefficients of the horizontal and vertical velocity contain as a factor the

exponential г-"'3', where y is the depth of the particle considered below the

Whensurface.  the depth of the fluid is finite, the laio of the horizontal and

vertical displacements of the particles is the same as when the depth is infi-

nite. When the length of the waves is very great compared with the depth

of the fluid, the horizontal motion of different particles in the same vertical

line is sensibly the same. The expression for c reduces itself to ^'gju the

same as would have been obtained directly from the theory of long waves.
The whole theory is given very fully in the treatise of Mr. K\x^*. The

nature of the motion of the individual particles, as deduced from a rigorous

theory, was taken notice of, I believe for the first time, by Mr. Green t> who

has considered the case in which the depth is infinite.

   The oscillatory waves just considered are those which are propagated uni-
formly in fluid of which the depth is everywhere the same. When this con-

dition is not satisfied, as for instance when the waves are propagated in a
canal whose section is not rectangular, it is desirable to know how the velo-

city of propagation and the form of the waves are modified by this circum-

stance. There is one such case in which a solution has been obtained. In

a paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1841, Prof.

Kelland has arrived at a solution of the problem in the case of a triangular
canal whose sides are inclined at an angle of 45░ to the vertical, or of a canal

with one side vertical and one side inclined at an angle of 45░, in which the

velocity of propagation is given by the formula (B.), which applies to a rectan-

gular canal, or to waves propagated without lateral limitation, provided M'e

complete), and its concavity turned upwards or downwards according as the

the ridges of the waves do not bend forwards, but are situated in a vertical
plane, and they rise higher towards the slanting sides of the canal than in
the middle. I shall write down the value of <p, the integral of (A.), and then

any one who is familiar with the subject can easily verify the preceding re-
sults. In the following expression x is measured along the bottom line of
the canal, y is measured horizontally, and z vertically upwards :

   I have mentioned these results under the head of oscillatory waves, be-
cause it is to that class only that the investigation strictly applies. The
length of the waves is however perfectly arbitrary, and when it bears a large
ratio to the depth of the fluid, it seems evident that the circumstances of the
motion of any one wave cannot be materially affected by the waves which
precede and follow it, especially as regards the form of the middle portion, or

ridge, of the Avave. Now the solitary waves of Mr. Russell are long com-

pared with the depth of the fluid ; thus in the case of a rectangular canal he
states that the length of the wave is about six times the depth. Accordingly
Mr. Russell finds that the form of the ridge agrees well with the results of

Prof. Kelland.

   It appears from Mr. Russell's experiments that there is a certain limit to
the slope of the sides of a triangular canal, beyond which it is impossible to
propagate a wave in the manner just considered. Prof. Kelland has arrived
at the same result from theory, but his mathematical calculation does not
appear to be quite satisfactory. Nevertheless there can be little doubt that
such a limit does exist, and that if it be passed, the wave will be either con-
tinually breaking at the sides of the canal, or its ridge will become bow-
shaped, in consequence of the portion of the wave in the middle of the canal
being propagated more rapidly than the portions which lie towards the sides.

When once a wave has become suflSciently curved it may be propagated

without further change, as Mr. Airy has shown*. Thus the case of motion
above considered is in nowise opposed to the circumstance that the tide
wave assumes a curved form when it is propagated in a broad channel in
which the water is deepest towards the centre.

   It is worthy of remark, that if in equation (C) we transfer the origin to

either of the upper edges of the canal (supposed complete), and then suppose

Ah to become infinite, having previously written g ~*'' for A, the result

will express a series of oscillatory waves propagated in deep water along the
 edge of a bank having a slope of 45░, the ridges of the waves being perpen-
 dicular to the edge of the fluid. It is reraarkablte that the disturbance of the
 fluid decreases with extreme rapidity as the perpendicular distance from the
 edge increases, and not merely as the distance from the surface increases.
 Thus the disturbance is sensible only in the immediate neighbourhood of the
 edge, that is at a distance from it, which is a small multiple of A. The for-
 mula may be accommodated to the case of a bank having any inclination by
 merely altering the coeflicients of ?/ and z, without altering the sum of the
 squares of the coeflicients. If i be the inclination of the iDank to the verti-
 cal, it will be easily found that the velocity of propagation is equal to

 (o-- C08Z j . When i vanishes these waves pass into those already men-

 tioned as the standard case of oscillatory waves ; and when i becomes nega-
 tive, or the bank overhangs the fluid, a motion of this sort becomes im-

  possible.

I Iiave had occasion to refer to what Mr. Airy calls a standing oscillation

or standing tvave. To prevent the possibility of confusion, it may be well

to observe that Mr. Airy uses the term in a totally different sense from Mr.

Russell. The standing wave of Mr. Airy is the oscillation which would re-

sult from the coexistence of two series of progressive waves, which are equal

in every respect, but are propagated in opposite directions. With respect to

the standing wave of Mr. Ilussell, it cannot be supposed that the elevations

observed in mountain streams can well be made the subject of mathematical

calculation. Nevertheless in so far as the' motion can be calculated, by

taking a simple case, the theory does not differ from that of waves of other

classes. For if we only suppose a velocity equal and opposite to ihat of the

stream impressed both on the fluid and on the stone at the bottom which

produces the disturbance, we pass to the case of a forced wave produced in

still water by a solid dragged through it. There is indeed one respect in

which the theory of these standing waves offers a peculiarity, which is, that

the velocity of a current is different at different depths. But the theory of

such motions is one of great complexity and very little interest.

  --Theory of Solitary Waves. It has been already remarked that the length

of the solitary wave of Mr. Russell is considerable compared with the depth

of the fluid. Consequently we might expect tiiat the theory of long waves

would explain the main phaenomena of solitary waves. Accordingly it is

found by experiment that the velocity of propagation of a solitary wave in a

rectangular canal is that given by the formula of Lagrange, the height of the

wave being very small, or that given by Prof. Kelland's formula when the

canal is not rectangular. Moreover, the laws of the motion of a solitary

wave, deduced by Mr. Green from the theory of long waves, agree with the

observations of Mr. Russell. Thus Mr. Green found, supposing the canal

rectangular, that the particles in a vertical plane perpendicular to the length

of the canal remain in a vertical plane ; that the particles begin to move

when the wave reaches them, remain in motion while the wave is passing

over them, and are finally deposited in new positions ; that they move in

the direction of propagation of the wave, or in the contrary direction, ac-

cording as the wave consists of an elevation or a depression*. But when we

attempt to introduce into our calculations the finite length of the wave, the

problem becomes one of great difficulty. Attempts have indeed been made

to solve it by the introduction of discontinuous functions. But whenever

such functions are introduced, there are certain conditions of continuity to

be satisfied at the common surface of two portions of fluid to which different

analytical expressions apply ; and should these conditions be violated, the

solution will be as much in fault as it would be if the fluid were made to

penetrate the bottom of the canal. No doubt, the theory is contained, to a

MM.first approximation, in the fornmlse of  Poisson and Cauchy; but as it

happens the obtaining of these formulas is comparatively easy, their discus-

sion forms the principal difficulty. When the height of the wave is not very

small, so that it is necessary to proceed to a second approximation, the theory

of long waves no longer gives a velocity of propagation agreeing with expe-

riment. It follows, in fact, from the investigations of Mr. Airy, th at the velo -

city of propagation of a long wave is, to a second approximation, yg(h+3k),

h+kwhere h is the depth of the fluid when it is in equilibrium, and  the

height of the crest of the wave above the bottom of the canal f.

    The theory of the two great solitary waves of Mr. Russell forms the sub-
ject of a paper read by Mr. Earnshaw before the Cambridge Philosophical
 Society in December last*. Mr. Russell found by experiment that the hori-
 zontal motion of the fluid particles was sensibly the same throughout the
whole of a vertical plane perpendicular to the length of the canal. He attri-
buted J;he observed degradation of the wave, and consequent diminution of

 the velocity of propagation, entirely to the imperfect fluidity of the fluid, and
its adhesion to the sides and bottom of the canal. Mr. Earnshaw accordingly

--investigates the motion of the fluid on the hypotheses, first, that the particles

 once in a vertical plane, perpendicular to the length of the canal, remain in
a vertical plane ; secondly, that the wave is propagated with a constant velo-
city and without change of form. It is important to observe that these
hypotheses are used not as a, foundation for calculation, but as a means of
selecting a particular kind of motion for consideration. The equations of
fluid motion admit of integration in this case in finite terms, without any
approximation, and it turns out that the motion is possible, so far as the 2vave
itself is concerned, and everything is determined in the result except two
constants, which remain arbitrary. However, in order that the motion in

question should actually take place, it is necessary that there should be an
instantaneous generation or destruction of a finite velocity, and likewise an
abrupt change of pressure, at the junction of the portion of fluid which con-
stitutes the wave with the portions before and behind which are at rest, both
which are evidently impossible. It follows of course that one at least of the
two hypotheses must be in fault. Experiment showing that the first hypo-
thesis is very nearly true, while the second (from whatever cause) is sensibly

erroneous, the conclusion is that in all probability the degradation of the

wave is not to be attributed wholly to friction, but that it is an essential cha-
racteristic of the motion. Nevertheless the formula for the velocity of pro-
}>agation of the positive wave, at which Mr. Earnshaw has arrived, agrees very
well with the experiments of Mr. Russell ; the formula for the negative wave
also agrees, but not closely. These two formulas can be derived from each
other only by introducing imaginary quantities.

    It is the opinion of Mr. Russell that the solitary wave is a phaenomenon
sui generis, in nowise deriving its character from the circumstances of the
generation of the wave. His experiments seem to render this conclusion
probable. Should it be correct, the analytical character of the solitary wave
remains to be discovered. A-complete theory of this wave should give, not
only its velocity of propagation, but also the law of its degradation, at least
of that part of the degradation which is independent of friction, which is
probably by far the greater part. With respect'to the importance of this
peculiar wave however, it must be remarked that the term solitary loave, as
so defined, must not be extended to the tide wave, which is nothing more (as
far as regards the laws of its propagation) than a very long wave, of which
the form may be arbitrary. It is hardly necessary to remark thdt the me-
chanical theories of the solitary wave and of the aerial sound wave are

altogether difierent.

  --Theory ofRiver and Ocean Tides. The treatiseof Mr. Airy already referred

to is so extensive, and so full of original matter, that it will be impossible
within the limits of a report like the present to do more than endeavour to

been arrived at, by the same reasoning, had the law not been restricted. This formula is
given as expressing the velocity of propagation of the phase of high water, which it is true is
not quite the same as the velocity of propagation of the crest of the wave ; but the two velo-
cities are the same to the second order of approximation.

give an idea of the nature of the calculations and methods of explanation
employed, and to mention some of the principal results.

   On account of the great length of the tide wave, the horizontal motion of

the water will be sensibly the same from top to bottom. This circumstance
most materially simplifies the calculation. The partial differential equation
for the motion of long waves, when the motion is very small, is in the simplest
case the same as that which occurs in the theory of the rectilinear propaga-
tion of sound ; and in Mr. Airy's investigations the arbitrary functions which
occur in its integral are determined by the conditions to be satisfied at the
ends of the canal in which the waves are propagated, in a manner similar to
that in which the arbitrary functions are determined in the case of a tube in

which sound is propagated. When the motion is not very small, the partial
differential equation of wave motion may be integrated by successive ap-

proximations, the arbitrary functions being determined at each order of ap-

proximation as before.

   To proceed to some of the results. The simplest conceivable case of a

tidal river is that in Avhich the river is regarded as a uniform, indefinite canal,

without any current. The height of the water at the mouth of the canal will
be expressed, as in the open sea, by a periodic function of the time, of the
form a sin (w<+a). The result of a first approximation of course is that
the disturbance at the mouth of the canal will be propagated uniformly up
it, with the velocity due to half the depth of the water. But on proceeding to
a second approximation*, Mr. Airy finds that the form of the wave will alter
as it proceeds up the river. Its front will become shorter and steeper, and
its rear longer and more gently sloping. When the wave has advanced suf-
ficiently far up the river, its surface will become horizontal at one point in
the rear, and further on the wave Mill divide into two. At the mouth of the
river the greatest velocities of the ebb and flow of the tide are equal, and
occur at low and high water respectively ; the time during which the water
is rising is also equal to the time during which it is falling. But at a station
up the I'iver the velocity of the ebb-stream is greater than that of the flow-
stream, and the rise of the water occupies less time than its fall. If the sta-
tion considered is sufficiently distant from the mouth of the river, and the
tide sufficiently large, the water after it has fallen some Avay will begin to
rise again : there will in fact be a double rise and fall of the water at each
tide. This explains the double tides observed in some tidal rivers. The
velocity with which the phase of high water travels up the river is found to

Vbe <7A (1 +36), A being the depth of the water when in equihbrium, and

h k the greatest elevation of the water at the mouth of the river above its
 mean level. The same formula will apply to the case of low water if we
 change the sign of b. This result is very important, since it shows that the
 interval between the time of the moon's passage over the meridian of the
 river station and the time of high water will be affected by the height of the

Hetide. Mr. Airy also investigates the effect of the current in a tidal river.

 finds that the difference between the times of the water's rising and falling
 is increased by the current.

    When the canal is stopped by a barrier the circumstances are altered.
 When the motion is supposed small, and the disturbing force of the sun and
 moon is neglected, it is found in this case that the tide-wave is a stationary-

 wave t, so that there is high or low water at the same instant at every point
 of the canal ; but if the length of the canal exceeds a certain quantity, it is
 high water in certain parts of the canal at the instant when it is low water

in the remainder, and vice versa. The height of high water is different in

different parts of the canal : it increases from the mouth of the canal to its

extremity, provided the canal's length does not exceed a certain quantitj'. If

four times the length of the canal be any odd multiple of the length of a
free wave whose period is equal to that of the tide, the denominator of the
expression for the tidal elevation vanishes. Of course friction would pre-

vent the elevation from increasing beyond a certain amount, but still the tidal

oscillation would in such cases be very large.

  When the channel up which the tide is propagated decreases in breadth

or depth, or in both, the height of the tide increases in ascending the channel.

This accounts for the great height of the tides observed at the head of the

Bristol Channel, and in such places. In some of these cases however the
great height may be partly due to the cause mentioned at the end of the last

paragraph.

   When the tide-wave is propagated up a broad channel, which becomes

shallow towards the sides, the motion of the water in the centre will be of

the same nature as the motion in a free canal, so that the water will be flow-

ing up the channel with its greatest velocity at the time of high water.
Towards the coasts however there will be a considerable flow of water to
and from the shore ; and as far as regards this motion, the shore will have

nearly the same effect as a barrier in a canal, and the oscillation will be of

the nature of a stationary wave, so that the water will be at rest when it is
at its greatest height. If, now, we consider a point at some distance from

the shore, but still not near the middle of the channel, the velocity of the
water up and down the channel will be connected with its height in the same
way as in the case of a progressive wave, while the velocity to and from the

shore will be connected with the height of the water in the same way as in a
stationary wave. Combining these considerations, Mr. Airy is enabled to

explain the apparent rotation of the water in such localities, which arises
from an actual rotation in the direction of its motion*.

   When the motion of the water is in two dimensions the mathematical cal-
culation of the tidal oscillations is tolerably simple, at least when the depth

of the water is uniform. But in the case of nature the motion is in three

dimensions, for the water is distributed over the surface of the earth in broad

sheets, the boundaries of which are altogether irregular. On this account a

 complete  theory  of  the  tides  appears  hopeless,  even  in  the  case  in  which  the

.

depth is supposed uniform. Laplace's theory, in which the whole earth is
supposed to be covered with w ater, the depth of which follows a very pecu-

liar law, gives us no idea of the effect of the limitation of the ocean by conti-
nents. Mr. Airy consequently investigates the motion of the water on the
supposition of its being confined to narrow canals of uniform depth, which
in the calculation are supposed circular. The case in which the canal forms

a great circle is especially considered. This method enables us in some de-

gree to estimate the effect of the boundaries of the sea ; and it has the great
advantage of leading to calculations which can be worked out. There can

be no doubt, too, that the conclusions arrived at will apply, as to their general

nature, to the actual case of the earth.

With a view to this application of the theory, Mr. Airy calculates the

motion of the water in a canal when it is under the action of a disturbing

force, which is a periodic function of the time. The disturbing force at a

point whose abscissa, measured along the canal from a fixed point, is x, is
A -- mx +supposed to be expressed by a function of the form sin (n<
                                                                                       a).

This supposition is sufficiently general for the case of the tides, provided the

canal on the earth be supposed circular. In all cases the disturbing force
will give rise to an oscillation in the water having the same period as the force

itself. Tills oscillation is called by Mr. A'lry'a forced wave. It will be suf-

ficient here to mention some of the results of this theory as applied to the

case of the earth.

In all cases the expression for the tidal elevation contains as a denominator

the difference of the squares of two velocities, one the velocity of propagation

of a free wave along the canal, the other the velocity with which a particular

phase of the disturbing force travels along the canal, or, which is the same,
the velocity of propagation of the forced wave. Hence the height of the

tides will not depend simply on the rtiagnitude of the disturbing force, but
also on its period. Thus the mass of the moon cannot be inferred directly

from the comparison of spring and neap tides, since the heights of the solar
and lunar tides are affected by the different motions of the sun and moon in

right ascension, and consequently in hour-angle. When the canal under

consideration is equatorial the diurnal tide vanishes. The height of high water

is the same at all points of the canal, and there is either high or low water at

the point of the canal nearest to the attracting body, according as the dejith
of the water is greater or less than that for which a free wave would be pro-

pagated with the same velocity as the forced wave. In the general case there

is both a diurnal and a semidiurnal tide, and the height of high water, as well
as the interval between the transit of the attracting body over the meridian

of the place considered and the time of high water, is different at different

points of the canal. When the canal is a great circle passing through the
poles, the tide-wave is a stationary wave. When the coefficient of the dis-

turbing force is supposed to vary slowly, in consequence of the change in

declination, &'C. of the disturbing body, it is found that the greatest tide oc-

curs on the day on which the disturbing force is the greatest.

The preceding results have been obtained on the supposition of the absence

Heof all friction ; but Mr. Airy also takes friction into consideration.  sup-

poses it to be represented by a horizontal force, acting uniformly from top to

liottom of the water, and varying as the first power of the horizontal velocity.

Of course this supposition is not exact: still there can be no doubt that

Whenit represents generally the effect of friction.  friction is taken into

account, the denominator of the expressions for the tidal elevation is essen-
tially positive, so that the motion can never become infinite. In the case of

a uniform tidal river stopped by a barrier, the high water is no longer simul-
taneous at all points, but the phase of high water always travels up the river.

But of all the results obtained by considering friction, the most important

appears to be, that when the slow variation of the disturbing force is taken
into account, the greatest tide, instead of happening on the day when the
disturbing force is greatest, will happen later by a certain time, /╗,. More-
over, in calculating the tides, we must use, not the relative positions of the sun

and moon for the instant for which the tide is calculated, but their relative

positions for a time earlier by the same interval p^ as in the preceding case.
The expression for p^ depends both on the depth of the canal and on the
period of the tide, and therefore its value for the diurnal tide cannot be

inferred from its value for the semidiurnal. It appears also that the phase of

the tide is accelerated by friction.

The mechanical theory of the tides of course belongs to hydrodynamics

but I do not conceive that the consideration of the reduction and discussion

of tidal observations falls within the province of this report.
   Before leaving the investigations of Mr. Airy, I would call attention to a

method which he sometimes employs very happily in giving a general expla-

nation of phgenomena depending on motions which are too complicated to

admit of accurate calculation. It is evident that any arbitrary motion may

be assigned to a fluid, (with certain restrictions as to the absence of abrupt-

ness,) provided we suppose certain forces to act so as to produce them. The
values of these forces are given by the equations of motion. In some cases
the forces thus obtained will closely resemble some known forces ; while in

others it will be possible to form a clear conception of the kind of motion
which must take place in the absence of such forces. For example, sup-

posing that there is propagated a series of oscillatory waves of the standard
kind, except that the height of the waves increases proportionably to their
distance from a fixed line, remaining constant at the same point as the time
varies, Mr. Airy finds for the force requisite to maintain such a motion an
expression which may be assimilated to the force which wind exerts on water.
This affords a general explanation of the increase in the height of the waves
in passing from a windward to a lee shore*. Again, by supposing a series
of waves, as near the standard kind as circumstances will admit, to be pro-
pagated along a canal whose depth decreases slowly, and examining the force
requisite to maintain this motion, he finds that a force must be applied to
hold back the heads of the waves. In the absence, then, of such a force the
heads of the waves will have a tendency to shoot forwards. This explains
the tendency of waves to break over a sunken shoal or along a sloping
beach f. The word tendency is here used, because when a wave comes at all
near breaking, but little reliance can be placed in any investigation which

depends upon the supposition of the motion being small. To take one more

example of the application of this method, by supposing a wave to travel,
unchanged in form, along a canal, with a velocity different from that of a free
wave, and examining the force requisite to maintain such a motion, Mr. Airy
is enabled to give a general explanation of some very curious circumstances
connected with the motion of canal boats |, which have been observed by
Mr. Russell.

    III. In the 16th volume of the ' Journal de I'Ecole Polytechniqueз, will be

found a memoir by MM. Barre de Saint-Venant and Wantzel, containing the

results of some experiments on the discharge of air through small orifices,
produced by considerable differences of pressure. The formula for the ve-
locity of efflux derived from the theory of steady motion, and the supposition
that the mean pressure at the orifice is equal to the pressure at a distance
from the orifice in the space into which the discharge takes place, leads to
some strange results of such a nature as to make ue doubt its correctness. If
we call the space from which the discharge takes place the first space, and
that into which it takes place the second space, and understan.d by the term
reduced velocity the velocity of efflux diminished in the ratio of the density
in the second space to the density in the first, so that the reduced velocity
measures the rate of discharge, provided the density in the first space remain
constant, it follows from the common formula that the reduced velocity va-
nishes when the density in the second space vanishes, so that a gas cannot be
discharged into a vacuum. Moreover, if the density of the first space is given,
the reduced velocity is a maximum when the density in the second space is
rather more than half that in the first. The results remain the same if we
take account of the contraction of the vein, and they are not materially al-
tered if we take into account the cooling of the air by its rapid dilatation.
The experiments above alluded to Avere made by allowing the air to enter an
exhausted receiver through a small orifice, and observing simultaneously the

* An. 265, &c.   t Art. 238, &c.

--14 REPORT 1846.

pressure and temperature of the air in the receiver, and the time elapsed since

the opening of the orifice. It was found that when the exhaustion was com-
plete the reduced velocity had a certain value, depending on the orifice em-

ployed, and that the velocity did not sensibly change till the pressure of the

air in the receiver became equal to about flhs of the atmospheric pressure.
The reduced velocity then began to decrease, and finally vanished when the

pressure of the air in the receiver became equal to the atmospheric pressure.

   These experiments show tliat when tlie difference of pressure in the first
and second spaces is considerable, we can by no means suppose that the mean

pressure at the orifice is equal to the pressure at a distance in the second

space, nor even that there exists a contracted vein, at which we may suppose

the pressure to be the same as at a distance. The authors have given an

empirical fornmla, which represents very nearly the reduced velocity, what-

ever be the pressure of the air in the space into which the discharge takes place.

The orifices used in these experiments were generally about one millimetre

in diameter. It was found that widening the mouth of the orifice, so as to

make it funnel-shaped, produced a much greater proportionate increase of
velocity when the velocity of efHux was small than when it was large. The

authors have since repeated their experiments with air coming from a vessel in

which the pressure was four atmospheres : they have also tried the effect of

using larger orifices of four or five millimetres diameter. The general results

were found to be the same as before*.

IV. In the 6th volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philoso-

phical Society, p. 403, will be found a memoir by Mr. Green on the re-

flection and refraction of sound, which is well-worthy of attention. This

problem had been previously considered by Poisson in an elaborate memoirf.

Poisson treats the subject with extreme generality, and his analysis is con-

sequently very complicated. Mr. Green, on the contrary, restricts himself

to the case of plane waves, a case evidently comprising nearly all the phseno-

mena connected with tliis subject which are of interest in a physical point of

view, and thus is enabled to obtain his results by a very simple analysis. In-

deed Mr. Green's memoirs are very remarkable, both for the elegance and

rif^our of the analysis, and for the ease with which he arrives at most im-

portant results. This arises in a great measure from his divesting the pro-

blems he considers of all unnecessary generality : where generality is really

of importance he does not shrink from it. In the present instance there is

one important respect in which Mr. Green's investigation is more general

than Poisson's, which is, that Mr. Green has taken the case of any two fluids,

whereas Poisson considered the case of two elastic fluids, in which equal con-

densations produce equal increments of pressure. It is curious, that Poisson,

forgetting this restriction, applied his formulee to the case of air and water.

Ofcourse his numerical result is altogether erroneous. Mr. Green easily

arrives at the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction. He obtains also a
Avery simple expression for the intensity of the reflected sound. If is the

ratio of the density of the second medium to that of the first, and B the ratio

of the cotangent of the angle of refraction to the cotangent of the angle of

incidence, then the intensity of the reflected sound is to the intensity of the
A --incident as
                 B to A-fB. In this statement the intensity is supposed to

be measured by the first power of the maximum displacement. When the

velocity of propagation in the first medium is less than in the second, and the

angle of incidence exceeds what may be called the critical angle, Mr. Green

Herestricts himself to the case of vibrations following the cycloidal law.

finds that the sound suffers total internal reflection. The expression for the
disturbance in the second medium involves an exponential with a negative

index, and consequently the disturbance becomes quite insensible at a di-

stance from the surface equal to a small multiple of the length of a wave.
The phase of vibration of the reflected sound is also accelerated by a quan-
tity depending on the angle of incidence. It is remarkable, that when the
fluids considered are ordinary elastic fluids, or rather when they are such
that equal condensations produce equal increments of pressure, the expres-

sions for the intensity of the reflected sound, and for the acceleration of
phase when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, are the same

as those given by Fresuel for light polarized in a plane perpendicular to the

plane of incidence.

   V. Not long after the publication of Poisson's memoir on the simultaneous
motions of a pendulum and of the surrounding air*, a paper by Mr. Green
was read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which is entitled ' Re-
searches on the Vibration of Pendulums in Fluid Media f.' Mr. Green does
not appear to have been at that time acquainted with Poisson's memoir. The
problem which he has considered is one of the same class as that treated by
Poisson. Mr. Green has supposed the fluid to be incompressible, a suppo-
sition, however, which will apply without sensible error to air, in considering
motions of this sort. Poisson regarded the fluid as elastic, but in the end, in
adapting his forftiula to use, he has neglected as insensible the terms by
which the effect of an elastic differs from that of an inelastic fluid. The
problem considered by Mr. Green is, however, in one respect much more
general than that solved by Poisson, since Mr. Green has supposed the oscil-
lating body to be an ellipsoid, whereas Poisson considered only a sphere.
Mr. Green has obtained a complete solution of the problem in the case in
which the ellipsoid has a motion of translation only, or in which the small
motion of the fluid due to its motion of rotation is neglected. The result is
that the resistance of the fluid will be allowed for if we suppose the mass of
the ellipsoid increased by a mass bearing a certain ratio to that of the fluid
displaced. In the general case this ratio depends on three transcendental
quantities, given by definite integrals. If, however, the ellipsoid oscillates in
the direction of one of its principal axes, the ratio depends on one only of

these transcendents. When the ellipsoid passes into a spheroid, the tran-

scendents above-mentioned can be expressed by means of circular or loga-

rithmic functions. When the spheroid becomes a sphere, Mr. Green's result

agrees with Poisson's. It is worthy of remark, that Mr. Green's formula will
enable us to calculate the motion of an ellipse or ojrcle oscillating in a fluid,

in a direction perpendicular to its plane, since a material ellipse or circle may

be considered as a limiting form of an ellipsoid. In this case, however, the
motion would probably have to be extremely small, in order that the formula
 should apply with accuracy.

   In a paper ' On the Motion of a small Sphere acted on by the Vibrations of

an Elastic ^Medium,' read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society in April
 184;l:j:, Prof. Challis has considered the motion of a ball pendulum, retaining
in his solution small quantities to the second order. The principles adopted
by Prof. Challis in the solution of this problem are at variance with those of
Poisson, and have given rise to a controversy between him and Mr. Airy,
which will be found in the 17th, ISth and 19th volumes of the Philosophical

Magazine (New Series). In the paper just referred to, Prof. Challis finds that
when the fluid is incompressible there is no decrement in the arc of oscilla-

tion, except what arises frona friction and capillary attraction. In the case

of air there is a slight theoretical decrement ; but it is so small that Prof.

Challis considers the observed decrement to be mainly owing to friction.

This result follows also from Poisson's solution. Prof. Challis also finds that

a small sphere moving with a uniform velocity experiences no resistance, and

that when the velocity is partly uniform and partly variable, the resistance

depends on the variable part only. The problem, however, referred to in

the title of this paper, is that of calculating the motion of a small sphere

situated in an elastic fluid, and acted on by no forces except the pi'essure of

the fluid, in which an indefinite series of plane condensing and rarefying

waves is supposed to be propagated. This problem is solved by the author on

principles similar to those which he has adopted in the problem of an oscil-

lating sphere. The views of Prof. Challis with respect to this problem, which

he considers a very important one, are briefly stated at the end of a paper

published in tlie Philosophical Magazine*.

In a paper ' On some Cases of Fluid Motion,' published in the Trans-

actions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society f, I have considered some

modifications of the problem of the ball pendulum, adopting in the main the

principles of Poisson, of the correctness of which I feel fully satisfied, but

supposing the fluid incompressible from the first. In this paper the eff'ect of

a distant rigid plane interrupting the fluid in which the sphere is oscillating is

given to the lowest order of approximation with which the effect is sensible.

It is shown also that when the ball oscillates in a concentric spiierical enve-

lope, the eff'ect of the resistance of the fluid is to add to the mass of the

sphere a mass equal to ,  -- --, where a is the radius of the ball, h that

mof the envelope, and the mass of the fluid displaced. Poisson, having

reasoned on the very complicated case of an elastic fluid, had come to the

conclusion that the envelope would have no effect.
   One other instance of fluid motion contained in this paper will here be

mentioned, because it seems to afford an accurate means of comparing theory
and experiment in a class of motions in which they have not hitherto been

compared, so far as I am aware. When a box of the form of a rectangular

parallelepiped, filled with fluid and closed on all sides, is made to perform small
oscillations, it appears that the motion of the box will be the same as if the
fluid were replaced by a solid having the same mass, centre of gravity, and
principal axes as the solidified fluid, but different principal moments of in-
ertia. These moments are given by infinite series, which converge with
extreme rapidity, so that the numerical calculation is very easy. The oscil-
lations most convenient to employ would probably be either oscillations by

torsion, or bifilar oscillations.

   VI. M. Navier was, I believe, the first to give equations for the motion of

fluids without supposing the pressure equal in all directions. His theory is

contained in a memoir read before the French Academy in 1822J:. He con-
siders the case of a homogeneous incompressible fluid. He supposes such a

fluid to be made up of ultimate molecules, acting on each other by forces
which, when the molecules are at rest, are functions simply of the distance,
but which, when the molecules recede from, or approach to each other, are
modified by this circumstance, so that two molecules repel each other less
strongly when they are receding, and more strongly when they are approaching,

than they do when they are at rest*. The alteration of attraction or re-

pulsion is supposed to be, for a given distance, proportional to the velocity

with which the molecules recede from, or approach to each other; so that
-- Vthe mutual repulsion of two molecules will be represented by f(r)
                                                                       F (r),

Vwhere r is the distance of the molecules, the velocity with which they recede

from each other, and/(7-), F (r) two unknown functions of t- depending on

the molecular force, and as such becoming insensible when r has become

sensible. This expression does not suppose the molecules to be necessarily

receding from each other, nor their mutual action to be necessarily repulsive,

Vsince and F (r) may be positive or negative. It is not absolutely necessary

that/(r) and F (r) should always have the same sign. In forming the equa-

tions of motion M. Navier adopts the hypothesis of a symmetrical arrangement

of the particles, or at least, which leads to the same result, neglects the irre-

gular part of the mutual action of neighbouring molecules. The equations

at which he arrives are those which would be obtained from the common

^ ^ ^equations by wntmg

Afirst, and making similar changes in the second and third.       is here an

unknown constant depending on the nature of the fluid.

The same subject has been treated on by Poissonf, who has adopted hy-

potheses which are very different from those of M. Navier. Poisson's theory
is of this nature. He supposes the time t to be divided into n equal parts,

each equal to r. In the first of these he supposes the fluid to be displaced

in the same manner as an elastic solid, so that the pressures in different

directions are given by the equations which he had previously obtained for

elastic solids. If the causes producing the displacement were now to cease

to act, the molecules would very rapidly assume a new arrangement, which

would render the pressure equal in all directions, and while this re-arrange-

ment was going on, the pressure would alter in an unknown manner from

that belonging to a displaced elastic solid to the pressure belonging to the

fluid in its new state. The causes of displacement are however going on

during the second interval r; but since these different small motions will

take place independently, the new displacement which will take place in the

second interval t will be the same as if the molecules were not undergoing a

re-arrangement. Supposing now n to become infinite, we pass to the case in

which the fluid is continually beginning to be displaced like an elastic solid,

and continually re-arranging itself so as to make the pressure equal in all

directions. The equations at which Poisson arrived are, in the cases of a

homogeneous incompressible fluid, and of an elastic^uid in which the change

of density is small, those which would be derived from the common equations

by replacing t^ in the first by

Aand making similar changes in the second and third. In these equations

and B are two unknown constants. It will be observed that Poisson's equa-

tions reduce themselves to Navier's in the case of an incompressible fluid.

   The same subject has been considered in a quite different point of view by
M. Barre de Saint-Venant, in a communication to the French Academy in

express the relative motion of the fluid particles in the immediate neighbour-

direction of the principal sliding (^glissemeni) along that plane. The sliding

J h 77 in the direction of y. These two slidings may be compounded

into one, which will form the principal sliding along the plane xy. It is

then shown, by means of IM. Cauchy's theorems connecting the pressures in

different directions in any medium, that the tangential force on any plane

passing through the point considered, resolved in any direction in that plane,

is proportional to the sliding along tliat plane resolved in the same direction,

Tso that if represents the tangential force, referred to a unit of surface, and

S the sliding, T=гS. The pressure on a plane in any direction is then

found. This pressure is compounded of a normal pressure, alike in all di-

rections, and a variable oblique pressure, the expression for which contains

the one unknown quantity s. If the fluid be supposed incompressible, and

г constant, the equations which would be obtained by the method of M.Barre

de Saint- Venant agree with those of .M. Navier. It will be observed that

this method does not require the consideration of ultimate molecules at all.

When the motion of the fluid is very small, Poisson's equations agree with

those given by M. Cauchy for the motion of a solid entirely destitute of elas-

ticity f, except that the latter do not contain the pressure jo. These equations
have been obtained by M. Cauchy without the consideration of molecules.

His method would apply, witli very little change, to the case of fluids.

   In a paper read last year before the Cambridge Philosophical Society ;{:, I

have arrived at the equations of motion in a different manner. The method

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             "

employed in this paper does not necessarily require the consideration of ulti-

mate molecules. Its principal feature consists in eliminating from the rela-

tive motion of the fluid about any particular point the relative motion which

corresponds to a certain motion of rotation, and examining the nature of the

relative motion which remains. The equations Anally adopted in the cases

of a homogeneous incompressible fluid, and of an elastic fluid in which the

change of density is small, agree with those of Poisson, provided we suppose
A = Ain the latter
3 B. It is shown that this relation between and B may

be obtained on Poisson's own principles.

The equations hitherto considered are those which must be satisfied at any

point in the interior of the fluid mass; but there is hardly any instance of

the practical application of the equations, in wliich we do not want to know

also the particular conditions which must be satisfied at the surface of the

fluid. With respect to a free surface there can be little doubt : the condi-

tion is simply that there shall be no tangential force on a plane parallel to

the surface, taken immediately within the fluid. As to the case of a fluid in

contact with a solid, the condition at which Navier arrived comes to this:

that if we conceive a small plane drawn within tlie fluid parallel to the sur-

face of the solid, the tangential force on this plane, referred to a unit of
surface, shall be in the same direction with, and proportional to the velocity
with which the fluid flows past the surface of the solid. The condition ob-

tained by Poisson is essentially the same.
   Dubuat stated, as a result of his experiments, that when the velocity of

water flowing through a pipe is less than a certain quantity, the water adja-

cent to the surface of the pipe is at rest*. This result agrees very well with

an experiment of Coulomb's. Coulomb found that when a metallic disc was
made to oscillate very slowly in water about an axis passing through its
centre and perpendicular to its plane, the resistance was not altered when
the disc was smeared with grease ; and even when the grease was covered
with powdered sandstone the resistance, was hardly increased f. This is just
what one would expect on the supposition that the water close to the disc is
carried along with it, since in that case the resistance must depend on the

internal friction of the fluid ; but the result appears very extraordinary on

the supposition that the fluid in contact with the disc flows past it with a

finite velocity. It should be observed, however, that this result is compatible

with the supposition that a thin film of fluid remains adhering to the disc, in
consequence of capillary attraction, and becomes as it were solid, and that

the fluid in contact with this film flows past it with a finite velocity. If we

consider Dubuat's supposition to be correct, the condition to be assumed in
the case of a fluid in contact with a solid is that the fluid does not move re-

latively to the solid. This condition will be included in M. Navier's, if we
suppose the coefficient of the velocity when M. Navier's condition is ex-
pressed analytically, which he denotes by E, to become infinite. It seems
probable from the experiments of M. Girard, that the condition to be satis-

fied at the surface of fluid in contact with a solid is different according as the

fluid does or does not moisten the surface of the solid.

   M. Navier has applied his theory to the results of some experiments of
M. Girard's on the discharge of fluids through capillary tubes. His theory

shows that if we suppose E to be finite, the discharge through extremely

small tubes will depend only on E, and not on A. The law of discharge at
which he arrives agrees with the experiments of M. Girard, at least when the
tubes are extremely small. M. Navier explained the difference observed by
M. Girard in the discharge of water through tubes of glass and tubes of

copper of the same size by supposing the value of E different in the two

cases. This difference was explained by M. Girard himself by supposing that

a thin film of fluid remains adherent to the pipe, in consequence of molecular
action, and that the thickness of this film differs with*the substance of which

the tube is composed, as well "as with the liquid employed if. If we adopt
Navier's explanation, we may reconcile it with the experiments of Coulomb

Eby supposing that is very large, so that unless the fluid is confined in a

very narrow pipe, the results will depend mainly on A, being sensibly the

same as they would be if E were infinite.

    There is one circumstance connected with the motion of a ball-pendulum

oscillating in air, wiiich has not yet been accounted for, the explanation of
which seems to depend on this theory. It is found by experiment that the
correction for the inertia of the air is greater for small than for large spheres,
that is to say, the niaj^s which we must suppose added to that of the sphere
bears a greater ratio to the mass of the fluid displaced in the former, than in

the latter case. According to the common theory of fluid motion, in which

everytbing is supposed to be perfectly smooth, the ratio ought to be inde-
pendent of the magnitude of the sphere. In the imperfect theory of friction
in which the friction of the fluid on the sphere is talcen into account, while
the equal and opposite friction of the sphere on the fluid is neglected, it is
shown that the arc of oscillation is diminished, while the time of oscillation
is sensibly the same as before. But when the tangential action of the sphere
on the fluid, and the internal friction of the fluid itself are considered, it is
clear that one consequence will be, to speak in a general way, that a portion
of the fluid will be dragged along with the sphere. Thus the correction for

the inertia of the fluid will be increased, since the same moving force has now
to overcome the inertia of the fluid dragged along with the sphere, and not
only, as in the former case, the inertia of the sphere itself, and of the fluid
pushed away from before it, and drawn in behind it. Moreover the addi-
tional correction for inertia must depend, speaking approximately, on the
surface of the sphere, whereas the first correction depended on its volume,
and thus the effect of friction in altering the time of oscillation will be more

conspicuous in the case of small, than in the case of large spheres, other cir-

cumstances being the same. The correction for inertia, when friction is
taken into account, will not, however, depend solely on the magnitude of the
sphere, but also on the time of oscillation. With a given sphere it will be

greater for long, than for short oscillations.

Sixth Report of a Committee, consisting of H.'E. Strickland, Esq.,
   Prof. Daubeny, Prof. Henslow, and Prof. Lindley, appointed

    to continue their Experim.ents on the Vitality of Seeds.

These experiments have again been repeated upon 48 kinds of seeds ga-
thered in 1843, as well as upon 26 kinds of new seeds added to the general

collection in 1845.

   Many kinds of old seeds, of various dates from 1812 to 1845 inclusive,

consisting of 151 packets, have been contributed by Miss Molesworth. These
were for the most part in small quantities, and were sown only at Oxford, on
a slight hot-bed.

  A small quantity of soil from the bed of a freshwater lake of the tertiary

period, at Mundesley, Norfolk, containing scales of fish, elytra of beetles,

seeds of Ceratophyllum and other plants from Sir W. C. Trevelyan, was sub-

jected to three tests ; viz. one-third part was placed in a shallow pan, and
kept moist with distilled water ; the second portion was kept well-saturated
with the same ; and the third portion, also in a shallow pan, under about
one inch of distilled water. The whole was kept under a glass case to pre-

vent the chance of seeds, &c. being deposited in it. No vegetation appeared

in either case.

   It may be well to remark, that the seeds have been sown under different
circumstances, and have received different treatment at each of the three
places they have been experimented upon. At Oxford, as in previous years,
a selection was made from the whole quantity to be sown, of such as usually
require the assistance of heat to enable them to germinate ; these were sown
in pots and placed in slight heat, and the remainder were sown on a small
bed made in a cold frame, and, Avith the exception of two or three waterings,

left to nature.

   At Hitcham they were all sown in a border carefully prepared for them,
and aftervj'ards left to nature.

   At Chiswick the whole of the seeds were sown in separate pots and placed

in a pit heated with hot water.
    These several treatments will at once account for the great difference there

has been in many cases between the length of time the seeds required to
vegetate, as well as the greater number of seeds which did vegetate at one
place more than at the other, which will be seen on referring to the following

ON THE COLOURING MATTERS OF MADDER.  25

tions of madder, except so far as to mention that Robiquet discovered in it

a crystallized volatile colouring matter, which he called Alizarin, and that

Runge described five colouring matters which he obtained from it, viz, madder

purple, madder red, madder orange, madder yellow and madder brown, I

may here state as one result of my investigation, that I agree with Runge in

thinking that there is more than one colouring matter in madder, though I

am of opinion that the substances which he enumerates and describes are

not pure. Before however entering on this part of the subject, I shall first

give the results at which I have arrived in regard to alizarin. Alizarin is

doubtless the most interesting and the most definite in its nature of all the

substances contained in madder. It also presents itself the most easily to

the observer even on the most superficial examination. If we heat madder

spread out in a thin layer on a metal plate without carrying the heat far

enough to cliar the woody parts of the root, we shall in the course of a few

hours find its surface covered with small red or orange-coloured crystals,

which consist of alizarin. In the same way any extract of madder, whether

with water, alcohol or alkalies, evaporated to dryness and gently heated, gives

a crystalline sublimate of alizarin, which is variously coloured from a light

yellow to a dark red or brown. Now one of the first points to be ascertained

in regard to this body was whether it exists as such in the root, or whether

it is formed by the process of sublimation. Robiquet, the discoverer, states

Hethat it pre-exists in the plant.  considered alizarin as the colouring prin-

ciple of madder, and merely subjected it to sublimation for the purpose of

purifying it. But his investigation presents us with no convincing proof of

this opinion, for the extract of madder with water, alcohol, &c., from which

he prepares his alizarin by sublimation, shows no trace of anything crystalline;

and many chemists have asserted in consequence that it is a product of de-

composition, being formed by the action of heat in the same way as pyrogallic,
pyrotartaric acid, and many other bodies. I have however no hesitation

in affirming that it exists in the plant as such, having in more than one way

obtained it in a crystallized state without the intervention of heat. If we

make an extract of madder with cold water, we obtain a brown fluid which

produces no reaction on test paper. After being exposed however to the

action of the atmosphere for some hours, it acquires a distinctly acid reaction

and if it be now examined carefully, there will be found floating about in it
a number of long hair-like shining crystals : these crystals are alizarin. If

the fluid be still further exposed to the influence of the' atmosphere, a yellow

amorphous substance begins to separate, which I shall mention afterwards.

This is succeeded by a gelatinous substance, and after some days a complete

state of putrefaction ensues. It seems as if the alizarin in madder, or at all

events that part which dissolves in the water, exists in combination with lime.

On exposure to the atmosphere, there is formed, from some constituent

of the root dissolved in the fluid through the instrumentality of the oxygen,

some acid, which seizes hold of the lime in the solution and separates the

bodies which are combined with the lime. Now the alizarin, being a body

of very slightly acid properties, is separated first, and the other substances

follow in succession. The fresher the madder is, the purer will be the ali-

zarin, which separates on exposure to the atmosphere ; in some instances it
forms on the surface of the fluid a thick light yellow scum ; but in most cases

it is mixed with brown or red substances, from which it is separated with

difficulty. It is therefore most advisable to separate the crj^stals which are

deposited after twelve hours' standing, by filtration. These crystals are then
washed from the filter and boiled with very dilute nitric acid until they have
become of a bright yellow colour. They are then dissolved in boiling alcohol,
--26 REPORT 1846.

from which they separate on cooling in yellow transparent plates and needles

having a strong lustre. Alizarin prepared in this way has the following

--properties : It has a pure yellow colour without any admixture of red. It

may be volatilized without leaving any residue. The vapour crystallizes on

cooling in beautiful yellow plates and needles. It suffers hardly any change

if exposed to the action of the most powerful reagents. It dissolves without

change in cold concentrated sulphuric acid. Concentrated nitric acid hardly

affects it even on boiling. It is not changed by chlorine. It is insoluble in

water, but soluble in alcohol with a yellow colour. It dissolves in alkalies

with a beautiful purple colour. Its compounds with the alkaline earths are

red and slightly soluble in water. Its compounds with the earths and metallic

oxides are insoluble in water and exhibit diff"erent shades of red. It imparts

no colour to cloth mordanted with acetate of alumina or oxide of iron, on

account of its insolubility in water. Very little alizarin is obtained in this

way                  perhaps  one  1  gr.  from  1 lb.  of madder,  though  there  is  more of it  con-
                  ;

tained in the root.

I shall now shortly describe two other colouring matters which I have

obtained from madder. If an extract of madder be made with liot or cold

water, and a strong acid, such as muriatic or sulphuric acid, be added to the

fluid, a dark reddish-brown flocculent precipitate is produced. This preci-

pitate was separated by filtration and washed until the acid was removed.

On being treated with boiling water, apart of it dissolves with a brown colour.

On adding a few drops of acid to the liltered solution a dark brown pre-

cipitate is produced, which seems to me to be a peculiar colouring matter

similar in its properties to orcein, hematin and other soluble colouring

matters. It dissolves in alkalies with a red colour, and is capable of imparting

very lively colours to mordanted cloth. As far as I am aware it has not

been described in the former investigations of tiiis subject, though it seems

to be the principal substance concerned in the production of the colours for

which madder is used in the arts. I have however only examined it very

slightly as yet. The residue left behind by the boiling water was treated

with dilute boiling nitric acid, by which every trace of the preceding substance

is destroyed, and the residue itself acquires a bright yellow colour and

a more powdery consistence. This yellow powder contains alizarin, as is

shown by its giving crj'stals of that substance on being gently heated ; in

fact it contains all the alizarin of the root, but mixed with another substance

of an amorphous nature but very similar properties, from which it is difficult

to separate it. By crystallising from alcohol no separation can be effected,
as they are both about equally soluble in that menstruum. They also behave

in a similar manner towards the alkalies, the earths and most of the metallic

--oxides. I have hitherto only succeeded in discovering one method of se-

parating them, which is as follows : The mixture of the two is dissolved in a

little caustic potash. To the solution is added perchloride of iron, which

produces a dark reddish-brown precipitate consisting of peroxide of iron in

combination with the two substances. Now on boiling this precipitate with

an excess of perchloride of iron, the aljzarate of iron dissolves, forming a dark

brown solution, wiiile the iron compound of the other substance remains

behind. On adding muriatic acid to the filtered solution, the alizarin separates

in yellow flocks and may be purified by crystallization from alcohol. The

other substance, to which I have not yet given a name, is obtained by de-

composing its iron compound, which remains behind on treating with per-

chloride of iron, with muriatic acid, and washing till all the oxide of iron is

removed. It seems also to be a colouring matter, as it dissolves with a red

colour in alkalies and gives red compounds with the earths and metallic
                                                                                ;

oxides. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol with a yellow colour.
It therefore resembles the resins in its general properties. It cannot be ob-

tained in a crystallized state. From a hot concentrated solution in alcohol
it separates on cooling as a yellow powder. It imparts no colour to mor-

danted cloth.

On t/ie Physiological Action of Medicines. By J. Blake, M.B.., F.R.C.S.

The present report is a continuation of those which have already been read

before this section, and which have been published in the reports of the
Association. The only additional experiments I now ha<'e to bring forward

have been instituted to investigate the action of the salts of iridium and
osmium, and the acids of selenium and sulphur, when introduced directly

into the blood.

   The experiments that have been made with the salts of iridium and osmium

prove that these substances closely agree in their physiological action with

the salts of palladium and platinum. They are, like these salts, very poison-

Aous.  solution containing half a grain of the double chloride of iridium

and ammonia, was injected into the jugular vein of a dog. Before the injec-

tion, the action of the heart was regular and strong*; in eight seconds after

the injection, the action of the heart appeared affected, it being rendered flut-

tering ; and after a few seconds there was an apparent obstacle to the passage
of the blood through the systemic capillaries, as the pressure in the arterial

system became greater. In about a minute the pressure again diminished

the action of the heart was slower, the force it exerted in pi'opelling the blood

being equal to a column of mercury of but three inches and a half, or little

more than the half of that under which the circulation is generally carried

on. The animal appeared to be uncomfortable, owing to the circulation be-
coming so feeble. On injecting a solution containing a grain of the salt, the

circulation was arrested in eleven seconds, owing either to the action of the

heart having ceased, or else that its contractions were so weakened that they

did not suffice to force the blood through the pulmonary capillaries. The

pressure exerted by the blood in the arterial system became suddenly dimi-

nished, so as only to support a column of mercury of an inch and a half, at

which point the circulation through the capillaries wbuld appear to have

been suspended, for the pressure remained stationary for more than a minute,

and then sunk to zero, owing to relaxation of the capillaries taking place.

Death followed about three minutes and a half after the injection, and the

eye retained its sensibility to mechanical irritation for three minutes; respi-

ration and sensibility continuing nearly two minutes longer than would have

been the case had the injection of the salt totally paralyzed the heart. On

opening the thorax immediately after death, the heart was found contracting

rythmically, but very feebly, certainly not with sufficient power to propel its

contents : both cavities were full of blood ; in the right it was dark, that in
the left was of a maroon colour, and had evidently been oxygenized, proving
that the circulation had ceased before respiration was suspended. The blood

coagulated imperfectly, and this has been noticed after the introduction of

the salts of palladium and platinum, which are isomorphous with those of

--28 REPORT 1846.

iridium, and which exert, although in such small quantities, a marked effect

in preventing the perfect coagulation of the blood. Another experiment

was performed to observe more particularly the general effects following the

introduction of the salt into the veins ; the liaemadynamometer was not used,

and the animal was allowed to run about. On injecting a solution containing

half a grain of the salt, no immediate effects followed, but in about forty

seconds the animal became unsteady, and there was a tendency to fall back-

wards : in a minute and a half respiration was longer and deeper ; sensibility

remained unimpaired ; after a few minutes the animal laid down, and the

dyspnoea increased, coming on in paroxysms; in six minutes after the injec-

tion, respiration was suspended for forty seconds, but this was not accompa-

nied by convulsions, or even by loss of sensibility : this occurred four or five

times in the coursa of ten minutes ; the animal laid perfectly still, and did not

Aappear to be suffering, although sensibility was unimpaired.  grain of the

salt, on being introduced into the vein, served to increase these symptoms,

although the animal did not die until some minutes after it had been in-

jected. These symptoms are such as would result from the gradual weaken-

ing of the action of the heart, and the consequent diminution of the supply

of blood to the brain ; they lead to the conclusion that, when injected into the

veins, this salt does not exert any marked action on the nervous system.

When introduced directly into the arteries, by being injected through the

axillary artery so as to mix with the blood as it passes through the aorta, the

salts of iridium, as those of platinum and palladium, impede the passage of

the blood through the capillaries, to such an extent as to require the heart to

exert more than twice the power that is required in the natural state of the

circulation, to force the blood through them. This sudden increase of the

pressure in the arterial system is attended by general spasm. When a grain

of the salt was injected into the artery, in a few seconds the pressure was equal

to a column of mercury of twelve inches ; violent spasm immediately came on,

during which respiration was suspended, nor did it again take place regularly.

Six respiratory movements Mere observed during the next four minutes, after

which there was no further movement. The action of the heart appeared to be

arrested by asphyxia ; but even after it had ceased, the pressure in the arteries

was equal to three inches of mercury, showing that the passage of the blood

through the systemic capillaries was still impeded, although the animal had

been dead two or three minutes. When thus brought into direct contact

with the nervous centres, there can be no doubt but that these substances

exert a marked action on them ; it is possible that the violent spasm that im-

mediately followed their injection might be owing to the great pressure the

brain is subject to from the over- distension of the arterial system, but this will

not explain the permanent cessation of its functions.

The salts of osmium are perfectly analogous in their action to those of

iridium, and the other members of this isomorphous group. The salt used

was the double chloride of osmium and potassium, for owing to the chlorides

of both iridium and osmium being decomposed by water, I was forced to use

them conlbined with another base, although I should have wished to have

avoided this if possible.

The effects produced by selenic and sulphuric acids, when introduced into

the blood, are not very striking, that is, they do not appear to act in a marked

manner on any one organ. They agree in this respect with other bodies,

which either are found entering into the composition of the blood, or have

isomorphous relations with these constituents. The important part which

sulphur takes in the proteine compounds, might lead us to expect that its in-

troduction into the blood, as well as selenium, which is so closely isomorphous
ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF MEDICINES.                     29

with it, might not produce any very marked effect. In an experiment per-

formed with selenic acid, the following are the symptoms that presented

themselves (the acid used was of specific gravity 1'046, containing about five

and a half per cent, of real acid). On injecting three drachms of the acid,

mixed with an equal quantity of water, into the jugular vein, no appreciable

effect was produced ; neither the passage of the blood through the lungs, nor

through the systemic capillaries, appeared at all impeded ; nor was the action

of the heart affected ; in about forty-five seconds after the injection its move-

ments appeared slightly fluttering ; after two minutes the respiration was

observed to be rather deeper. Immediately after the introduction of half an

ounce of the acid into the vein, there was a falling off of the quantity of

blood sent into the arterial system ; and as this took place five seconds after

the injection, it must have been owing to the passage of the blood through

the pulmonary capillaries having been impeded, for there had not been time

for the substance to reach the coronary arteries and act on the heart. After

thirty seconds the supply of blood to the arteries was restored, and the action

of the heart was as strong as before. There appeared to be no marked effect

produced on any organ, although the quantity of acid introduced was very

considerable (seven drachms) ; after a few minutes the respiratory movements

became longer and deeper, and the action of the heart decidedly weaker, the

force with which the blood was propelled into the arteries being only half

what it is in the natural state of the circulation ; there was no expression of
pain. Half an ounce of the acid was again injected into the veins. The

immediate effect was to arrest the passage of the blood through the lungs, no

blood being sent into the arteries, although the heart could be felt beating

through the parietes of the thorax. Respiration was stopped at a minute

and twenty seconds after the arrest of the circulation, sensibility having dis-

appeared a few seconds earlier. On opening the thorax immediately after the

cessation of respiratory movements, the heart was found beating rytlimically:

the right cavities were very much distended with blood, which was dark and

grumous, and apparently physically incapable of passing through the lungs.

The left cavities contained a small quantity of scarlet blood, which was co-

agulated ; the lungs were redder than natural ; the heart retained its irrita-
bility some time after death. The above symptoms do not suffice to indicate

any particular organ on which the acid exerts a marked influence; for although

death was produced by the passage of blood through the pulmonary ca-

pillaries being arrested, yet this was probably owing to the mechanical

impediment which the coagulated state of the blood must have opposed to

its passage through the pulmonary vessels. In other experiments that I have

made with this substance, I have sometimes seen a serous secretion take place

in the air passages. There is also some action on the nervous system, as the

following experiment will show. The animal was small ; it was not confined,

in order that the effects on the functions of voluntary motion and sensation

Amight be more accurately observed.  drachm of the acid was introduced

Ainto the veins, without giving rise to any marked symptoms.  second in-

jection, containing a drachm and a half of the acid, did not affect the animal

in any marked degree : after a few minutes it appeared rather dull, but there

was no expression of pain, nor was sensibility impaired. On introducing

two drachms into the veins, the animal fell down in about thirty seconds, and

respiration was much affected ; it got up again in about a minute, and jumped

about in a very curious manner, the movements being evidently involuntary,

as if the animal had chorea : it remained standing quite motionless for a few

minutes, but gradually became weaker, and death took place ten minutes

after the last injection ; there were no convulsions, nor was the sensibility
--30 REPORT 1846.

destroyed until immediately before death. On opening the thorax, the heart

was found contracting rythmically. There was a considerable quantity of

frothy secretion in the bronchial tubes, and this renders it difficult to deter-
mine if the asphyxia, by which the action of the heart was finally arrested,
was nervous or pulmonary ; that is, whether the nervous system was aflfected
by the want of aeration of the blood, or whether the respiratory movements
ceased in consequence of the action of the acid directly on the nervous
system. The latter opinion I think the more probable.

    Sulphuric acid, when introduced into the veins, gives rise to exactly the
same phsenomena, the only organ on which it appears to exert any marked
effect being the lungs, although slight nervous symptoms are produced when
a considerable quantity has been introduced into the blood. The action of
these substances when injected into the arteries, and thus applied directly to
the brain and over the system, without previously passing through the lungs,

is evidently on the nervous sj'stem. Two drachms of the diluted acid, mixed

with four drachms of water, were injected into the left axillary artery, so as
to pass into the aorta ; in ten seconds all movements ceased ; there was a slight
spasm, which relaxed in a few seconds. During the continuance of the spasm,
the pressure in the arterial system was slightly increased, but it rapidly de-
clined, so that I think the passage of the blood through the systemic capil-
laries is facilitated, rather than impeded by these substances. All effective
contractions of the heart ceased a minute after death, probably ouang to the
shock produced by the sudden annihilation of the functions of the nervous
system, for it retained its irritability some minutes after death.

   With these experiments I conclude the first part of the series of researches
which I propose to undertake for the elucidation of this branch of physiology.
I have been engaged on it for the last six years, but I trust the results ob-
tained fully repay the labour that has been bestowed on it. The action on
the animal ceconomy of the compounds of twenty-nine of the most important
elements lias been experimentally investigated, and the facts which have been
observed have led to the discovery of a new laiW in vital chemistry which
had escaped the attention of former observers, viz. tJial the reactions which
take place between the elements of the livinx/ body a/ul inorganic compounds
are not governed by tJie ordinary chemical properties of these substances, but
depend on certain properties they possess connected with. their isomorphous
relations. The verification of this law enables us to undertake the investi-
gation of the higher chemical phaenomena of living bodies from an entirely
new point of view, whilst its existence accounts for the failure that has con-
stantly attended attempts to explain the chemistry of animal life by analogy
from ordinary chemical phaenomena. The fact that we now possess the
means of producing well-marked and definite modifications of some of the
most important physiological properties of various organs, and this too by
means of reagents, the laws governing whose action we are acquainted with,
places in our hands an instrument for discovery which has hitherto been
wanting in physiological investigations. The enumeration of some of the
effects that can be produced at pleasure on the more important functions,
will, I trust, suftice to lead others into this rich field of inquiry. As regards
the functions of the heart, we can annihilate or increase its irritability,
quicken or diminish its pulsations, render them regular or irregular, augment
their force or render them weaker, destroy the contractility of the auricles,
whilst that of the ventricles remains ; keep up the circulation of the blood
many minutes after every sign of life has disappeared, and this too more
actively than when respiration was being carried on ; we can facilitate or
arrest the passage of the blood through the pulmonary and systemic capil-

--laries; produce important modifications in the functions of the brain: in

short, the injection of various substances into the arteries and veins enables
us to modify all the most important functions of the body ; and this, as before
stated, by reagents, the laws of whose action we can fairly hope to discover.

My reason for having neglected the closer investigation of these interesting

phaenomena, was a determination fully to establish the law of the analogous

action of isomorphous substances. This having been accomplished, I shall

now direct my researches to the elucidation of these secondary questions.

        Report on the Actinograph. By Mr. Robert Hunt.

It will be remembered that in 1838 Sir John Herschel proposed an instru-
ment for the purpose of registering the variations of the actinic or chemical
rays, and published in the Philosophical Transactions a design for what
he termed an Actinograph, by which it was thought both the chemical action
of the direct solar rays and of the diffused daylight would be registered.
Dr. Daubeny, Prof Nichols and Mr. Thomas Jordan have severally designed,
and I believe used, instruments somewhat similar, but it does not appear that
any very satisfactory results have been obtained by either of these inquirers.
At the York meeting I pointed out the importance of some such registration,
and at the request of the committee I had an instrument constructed, which
I exhibited to the Association at the Cambridge meeting. The actinograph
I have been using differs but little from that proposed by Sir John Herschel,
a modification of Mr. Jordan's being introduced, by which it was thought
the results could be tabulated for every hour of the day. As the form of
this instrument is published in the Report for 1845, it will be unnecessary to
do more than describe such alterations as have suggested themselves during
the past year. The triangular slit, divided into one hundred parts, has been
abandoned, it being found in practice almost impossible to discriminate be-
tween the amount of coloration produced on the paper during an exposure of
three minutes or six ; consequently it became quite idle to attempt to register
by this plan to the degree of nicety which it was hoped might be attained.

A new external cylinder has therefore been constructed, in which are thirteen

holes, commencing with a mere pin-hole and gradually increasing to a :|
inch diameter. By this means thirteen bands are marked upon the sensi-
tive paper, each one separated from the other by an unaltered line, and it
becomes easy to distinguish with considerable accuracy between the tints

 thus produced.
    Bromide of silver was the material which, from the circumstance that all

 the rays of the prismatic spectrum exert some influence upon it, was em-

ployed in procuring most of my registrations. It has however been found

 that under all circumstances this preparation is too sensitive, and that although
 in the winter, when the solar radiations are weak, it answers admirably, yet
 in the bright sunshine of summer it assumes too great a degree of darkness,
 in even diffused daylight, and during the shortest exposure to which it is ex-

 posed during the revolution of the cylinder. Many experiments have been
 made with other photographic preparations, and the result has been in favour

 of the general use of the ammonio-nitrate of silver. It is true that this paper
 is not impressed by all the rays of the spectrum, but, as it is acted upon by all
 the rays beyond the yellow ray, and as the influence of the actinic principle
 throughout the entire range of the spectrum is, as it appears, always equally
--32 REPORT 1846.

effected by the increased or diminished intensity of the luminous and calo-
rific rays, and consequently that even the actinism residing in the extreme
violet ray is relatively as much influenced by an increase of luminous power

as that which is detected in the yellow ray weitself, may by the use of the

 paper prepared with the ammonio-nitrate of silver arrive at a very close ap-
proximation to the true result.

    Although I have not been enabled to realize the hope I held forth last year
of presenting at this meeting a register of actinic influences for the year, (vyhich
I have been prevented from doing by circumstances which I shall presently

explain,) yet I have determined, most satisfactorily to my own mind, the prac-

ticability of procuring, in favourable positions, such a registration as shall

aflPord much valuable information.
   The circumstances to which I allude as those which have prevented my

procuring any series of registers, are the impossibility of securing in London
any position free from the constant interferences of smoke and fog, and the
difficulty of placing the instrument so as to be free from the reflected radia-
tions of adjoining buildings. The first alone is a fatal objection ; for instead
of securing, what is desired, a registration of the relative amount of chemical
influence as compared with the quantity of light, heat, and the natural at-
mospheric conditions, we only get a register of the influence of smoke in
absorbing the actinic rays. 1 therefore propose to hand over the instrument
to the Association, requesting that it may be placed in a favourable position
at Kew, under the attention of the excellent observer there, when I do not
doubt some curious and instructive results may be obtained.

   It is necessary however to state that my experience has pointed out some
objections to this mode of registration, which indeed militates against the

use of the actinograph as a philosophical instrument.
    It is a curious fact that upon almost all kinds of photographic paper the

colour produced by the solar rays at diffierent periods of the day varies
considerably. It is not a mere difference of tint, but an actual change in the
colour; thus frequently the light of both morning and evening will give to
chloride of silver a rose hue, whilst that of noon will change it to a bluish
variety of brown. There is consequently much difficulty in deciding which
is the strongest impression. Thus also the rays upon two days, when the sun
appears equally bright, will in one case produce a red brown, and in the other
a blue brown. It is left to the eye to decide upon the intensity of the effect
produced, and with the utmost care it is frequently impossible to say whether
the actinic influence is greatest on the red brown lines, or those which are
blue brown.

   The importance of the inquiry has been peculiarly evident during this
summer ; many peculiarities have been observed in the growth of plants, in-
fluenced no doubt by the solar radiations. Many of our garden flowers,
particularly roses, have exhibited an abnormal condition, leaf-buds being
developed in the centre of the flower, arising from the vegetative functions

of the plant overpowering its reproductive functions. Again, during the
intense sunshine and the prevalence of the unclouded skies of the hot wea-
ther of June and July, practical photographists found the greatest difficulty

in obtaining portraits by the Daguerreotype process. At this time, although
the intensity of effect produced on paper in the actinograph under the usual
circumstances of summer sunlight should have been at a maximum, it was
found that it was far below this point, the maximum point being repre-
sented by 120. During several experiments made at the time mentioned, the
greatest effect indicated was 100 ; whilst the sky still being unclouded and
the sun shining brightly, it often fell to 90, and sometimes indeed to 80.
   ON THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT ON THE GROWTH OP PLANTS. 33

   These facts show the importance, amongst many others, of some mode of
registration by which these ever-varying solar influences may be carefully
observed. There can be little doubt that they exert an influence, sometimes
baleful, sometimes beneficial, upon the organized creation, and that we have
yet to discover, in these emanations or influences, the secrets of many of the
grand phaenomena of the universe.

Notices on the Influence of Light on the Gi'owth of Plants.

                      By Mr. Robert Hunt.

The experiments connected with this very interesting inquiry have been

steadily pursued, and a concluding report would have been made at this

meeting, but that some experiments, which had been conducted with much

care, with a view of determining the quantity of solid matter in plants grown

under different circumstances, were destroyed by the hail-storm which lately

prevailed over an extensive district of the metropolis, the glasses and troughs

of coloured fluids being broken, and the plants themselves washed into the

soil. As it was impossible to repeat this year these experiments, there was no

alternative but either to present an imperfect report, or to defer the report

for another year. The latter course has been chosen, and the detail of

these experiments will be reserved for a future communication ; I have how-
ever thought it might be attended with some advantages to state a few of the

leading facts which have been determined. The order of the arrangements

have been the same as those observed in the former experiments, and nearly

all the results have been confirmatory of those published six years since.

The germination of seeds is peculiarly due to the influence of the actinic

or chemical rays ; and if these are completely isolated whilst the luminous

rays are permitted to act upon the soil in which the seeds are planted, no

germination will take place. This influence is exerted and is most necessary

up to the point at which the first leaves begin to form, when the luminous

rays are rendered necessary to effect the formation of woody fibre. It must

be remembered that this was a point upon which I was at issue with some

other investigators ; and it is due to them that I should state, that the dis-

crepancies between us appear to have arisen from our not observing with a

sufficient degree of accuracy the point at which the two influences balance

each other, previously to the more complete exercise of the exciting force

of light, as distinguished from actinism. The vegetative process having been

carried on until the plant arrives at its maturity, a new agency, the calorific,

is more decidedly necessary to develope the reproductive functions of the

plant ; and then, again, the chemical rays combined with the calorific be-

come more active than the luminous rays. In spring we find the chemical

influences exerting without interference their most decided force : seeds

then germinate, and young buds and shoots are developed. As soon as this

is effected, the luminous rays, with the advance of the sun, become more

active, and the formation of woody fibre proceeds under their particular

agency ; not that the chemical power becomes dormant, but it is rendered

proportionally less active by the agency of light. In the late summer and

the autumn the peculiar properties of the calorific rays are required, and

under their agency, with diminished powers of light, the ripening of fruits

and the production of seed are accomplished.

  My experiments have also led me to detect some curious influences which

appear to be due to dissimilar rays, and which in their action exhibit great

inconstancy of effect. One class of rays, the same to which Sir J. Herschel
has given the name of Parathermic rays, are so subdued by the influences of
the more refrangible rays, as to be nearly inactive during the spring and early
summer months; and indeed in the spring they scarcely produce any effect
upon dead vegetable colouring matter, unless their action is assisted by the
use of some decomposing agent, such as sulphuric acid. These rays increase
in power towards the autumn, and to them appears to be due the browning

 of the leaf.

    It is well known that plants will grow in the dark, but that they do not
then form chlorophylle ; the formation of this colouring-matter has been an
object of some attention, and I believe I have determined it to result from
the joint influence of the luminous and actinic rays. Boxes of cress have been
grown in the dark, and they have then been brought under the influence of
a large spectrum formed by a water-prism. It has been stated by Dr.Gardner,
that the plants under those circumstances exhibit a lateral movement, bend-
ing towards the yellow ray. This appears to be a mistake ; the plants under
the influence of the red rays bend from the light but along the line of the ray
and those exposed to the most refrangible rays turn towards it, but still in the

line of the ray. Now the plants which first become green, by careful treatment

in this way, are those which are exposed to the rays situated between'the mean
green ray and the extreme blue. The action is continued eventually to the edge
of the most refrangible violet below the yellow ray. There is not any change
effected beyond the visible spectrum, notwithstanding the abundance of dark
chemical rays ; and the change is slow where there is really the largest amount
of light. I therefore conclude that the luminous rays are fessential in the pro-
cess, producing the decomposition of the carbonic acid and the deposition of
the required carbon, which is afterwards, in all probability, combined with
hydrogen under the influence of purely chemical force as exerted by the ac-

tinic principle.

   Such are the main results I have obtained. I have several experiments
now in progress, and I hope to be enable ^ in another year to complete this par*
ticular branch of investigation so far as to present to the British Association a
complete report.

Report on the Recent Progress qf Analysis [Theory of the Comparison of

                 Transcendentals). By R. L. Ellis, M.A.

1. The province of analj'sis, to which the theory of elliptic functions belongs,

Ahas within the last twenty years assumed a new aspect.  great deal has

doubtless been effected in other subjects, but in no other I think has our

knowledge advanced so far beyond the limits to which it was not long since

confined.

    This circumstance would give a particular interest to a history of the re*
cent progress of the subject, even did it now appear to have reached its full
development. But on the contrary, there is now more hope of further pro-
gress than at the conmiencement of the period of which I have been speaking.
When, in 1^27, Legendre produced the first two volumes of his ' Theorie
des Fonctions P^lllptiques,' he had been engaged on the subject for about
forty years ; he had reduced it to a systematic form ; and had with great
labour constructed tables to facilitate numerical applications of his results.,;
But little more, as it seemed, was yet to be done ; nor does the remark of J

   Bacon, that knowledge, after it has been systematized, is less likely to increase

   than before, seem less applicable to mathematical than to natural science.

   Nevertheless, almost immediately after the publication of Legendre's work,

   the earlier researches of Abel and Jacobi became known, and'it was at once
   seen that what had been already accomplished formed but a part, and not a
   large one, of the whole subject.

   To say this is not to derogate from the merit of Legendre. He created

   the theory of elliptic functions ; and it is impossible not to admire the per-

   severance with which he devoted himself to it. The attention of mathema-

   ticians was given to other things, and though the practical importance of his

   labours was probably acknowledged, yet scarcely any one seems to have

   entered on similar researches*. This kind of indifference was doubtless dis-

   couraging, but not long before his death he had the satisfaction of knowing

   that there were some  by whom that which    he  had  done  would not willin^el^v
   be let die.

      The considerations here suggested have led me to select the theory of the

   integrals of algebraical functions as the subject of the report which I have the
   honour to lay before the Association.

      2. The theory of the comparison of transcendental functions appears to
   have originated with Fagnani. In 1714, he proposed, in the ' Giornale de

   Litterati d' Italia,' the following problem : To assign an arc of the parabola
   whose equation is

   such tha.t its difference from a given arc shall be rectifiable.

   Of this problem he gave a solution in the twentieth volume of the same

   journal.

j

, The principle of the solution consists in the transformation of a certain

, differential expression by means of an algebraical and rational assumption

   which introduces a new variable. The transformed expression is of the same
I form as the original one, but is affected with a negative sign. By integrating

j

I both we are enabled to compare two integrals, neither of which can be as-

I signed in a finite form. It is difficult, however, to perceive how Fagnani was
  led to make the assumption in question : a remark which applies more or

   less to his subsequent researches on -similar subjects,

i The theorem which has made his name familiar to all mathematicians, ap-

: peared in the twenty-sixth volume of the ' Giornale.' In its application to

   Wethe comparison of hyperbolic arcs we find some indications of a more general
  method.    have here a symmetrical relation between two variables, x and

   =z dx. It follows at once that/(2;) dz x dz, and consequently that

             /f(x) dx +/f(z) dz =/{x dz + zdx}=xz + C.

   The remarkable manner in which the idea of symmetry here presents itself
   suggested to Mr. Fox Talbot his ' Researches in the Integral Calculus.'

rectification of elliptic arcs, or, as we should now express it, is reduced to
elliptic integrals. But of these instances Legendre has remarked that they
are isolated results, and form no connected theory. MacLaurin is charged,
in a letter appended to the works of Fagnani, with taking from the latter,

without acknowledgement, a portion of his discoveries with respect to the

lemniscate and the elastic curve.

4. In 1761, Euler, in the ' Novi Commentarii Petropolitani ' for 1758 and

1759, published his memorable discovery of the algebraical integral of the

equation

          m dx                                       n dy
+ + + + ~ + + + +(A Ba; Ca;* Tioc> Ea;^)i (A B?/ C?/"* Dz/3 E?/<)4'

m and n being any rational numbers.

   He says he had been led to this result by no regular method, " sed id

potius tentando, vel divinando elicui," and recommends the discovery of a

direct method to the attention of analysts. In effect his investigations re-

semble those of Fagnani : he begins by assuming a symmetrical algebraical
relation between the variables, and hence finds a differential equation which

it satisfies. In this differential equation the variables are separated, so that

each term may be considered as the differential of some function. Vv'ith one

form of assumed relation we are led to the differentials of circular, and with
another to those of elliptic integrals, and so on. It is in this manner that

Dr. Gudermann, in the elaborate researches which he has published in Crelle's

Journal, has commenced the discussion of the theory of elliptic functions.
   5. In the fourth volume of the Turin Memoirs, Lagrange accomplished

the solution of the problem suggested by Euler. He integrated the general

differential equation already mentioned by a most ingenious method, which,

with certain modifications, has remained ever since an essential element of

the theory of elliptic functions. He proceeded to consider the more general

equation        dx _ dy_

X Ywhere and are any similar functions of a; and rj respectively, and came

to the conclusion, that if they are rational and integral functions, the equa-

tion cannot, except in particular cases, be integrated, if they contain higher

powers than the fourth. He also integrated this equation in a case in which

X Yand involve circular functions of the variables. It had been already

pointed out in the summary of Euler's researches, given in the ' Nov. Com.

X YPet.' t. vi., that if and are polynomials of the sixth degree, the last-

written equation does not in general admit of an algebraical integral, since,
                                                                --= ^, which

(as the square of 1 -|- j?' is a polynomial of the sixth degree) is a particular

case of that which we are considering, could be reduced to an algebraical

form. Now this solution involves both circular functions and logarithms, and

therefore the required reduction is impossible. This acute remark* showed

that Euler's result did not admit of generalisation in the manner in which it

was natural to attempt to generalise it. It was rese^ed for Abel to discover

the direction in which generalisation is possible.

6. The discovery of Euler, of which we have been speaking, is in effect

the foundation of the theory of elliptic functions, as the generalisation of it

by Abel, or more properly speaking, the theory of which Euler's result is an

isolated fragment, is the foundation of our knowledge of the higher trans-

Wecendents.  may therefore conveniently divide the subject of this report

into two portions, viz. the general theory of the comparison of algebraical

integrals, and the investigations which are founded on it. Mathematicians

have been led, by comparing different transcendents, to introduce new func-

tions into analysis, and the theory of these functions has become an important

subject of research.

   The second portion may again be divided into two, viz. the theory of

elliptic functions, and that of the higher transcendents.
    This classification, though not perhaps unexceptionable, will, I think, be

found convenient.

   7. About sixteen years after the publication of Lagrange's earlier researches

on the comparison of algebraical integrals, he gave, in the New Turin Me-

moirs for 1784 and 1785, a method of approximating to the value of any

Rintegral of the form / tAf, where P is a rational function of x and the

                                         *y JR.

square root of a polynomial of the fourth degree. I shall consider this im-
portant contribution to the theory of elliptic functions in connexion with the

writings of Legendre. At present, in order to give a connected view of the
first division of my subject, it will be necessary to go on at once to the works
of Abel, and to those of subsequent writers. In the history of any branch
of science the chronological order must be subordinate to that which is

founded on the natural connexion of different parts of the subject.
   I shall merely mention in passing, that in 1775, Landen published in the

Philosophical Transactions a very remarkable theorem with respect to the

arcs of a hyperbola. He showed that any arc of a hyperbola is equal to the

difference of two elliptic arcs together with an algebraical quantity. In 1780
he published his researches on this subject in the first volume of his ' Mathe-
matical Memoirs,' p. 23. This theorem, as Legendre has remarked, might
have led him to more important results. It contains the germ of the general
theory of transformation, the eccentricities of the two ellipses being con-

nected by the modular equation of transformations of the second order*. It
is on this account that in a report on M. Jacobi's ' Fundamenta Nova,' con-
tained in the tenth volume of the Memoirs of the Institute, Poisson speaks
of Landen's theorem as the first step made in the comparison of dissimilar
elliptic integrals. Several writers have accordingly given Landen's name to
the transformation commonly known as Lagrange's.

  We8. have seen that even Lagrange failed in obtaining a result more

general than that which had been made known by Euler, and yet, as we now
know, Euler's theorem is but a particular case of a far more general proposi-

tion. But in oi'der to further progress, it was necessary to introduce a wholly
new idea. The resources of the integral calculus were apparently exhausted ;
Abel, however, was enabled to pass on into new fields of research, by bring-
 ing it into intimate connexion with another branch of analysis, namely, the
theory of equations. The manner in which this was done shows that he wгis
 not unworthy to follow in the path of Euler and of Lagrange.

    I shall attempt to state in a few words the fundamental idea of Abel's

 method.

    Let us suppose that the variable a^ is a root of the algebraical equation

=fx 0, and that the coefficients of this equation are rational functions of

 certain quantities a, b, . . . c, which we shall henceforth consider independent
 variables. Let us suppose also that in virtue of this equation we can express

             * Vide infra, pp. 50 and 67.
--38 REPORT 1846.

certain irrational functions* of x as rational functions of a;, a, b, . . . c. For

+ + -- =instance, if the equation were x- ax --(a- I) 0, it follows that

= +a/i-- a;* a x. So that any irrational function of the form F (x Vl --x-)

can be expressed rationally (F being rational) in x and a.

From the given equation we deduce by differentiation the following,

                 =dx ++ +ada /3л?6 . . . ydc,

y mwhere a, jS, . . . are rational  x, a, b, . . . , c.

Lety be one of the functions which can be expressed rationally in x, &c.,

it follows that ydx= Ada + Bdb + ... +Cdc,

where A, B, . . ╖ C are also rational in x, &c.
=The equation fx
                       will have a number of roots, which we shall call

л,, x^ .. .x^. It follows that

                       y,dx^ +         -{-y^dx^zs.

{A. + .. + A^}rfa + {B, + .. + B^}(Z6 +... + {,+ .. + C^}(fc,

where the indices affixed to y, A, &c. correspond to those affixed to x, so

that yp for instance, is the same function of x^ that y,, is of x,,.

Now + + A,,A, . . .    is rational and symmetrical with respect to a?, . . . x^,

=therefore it can be expressed rationally in the coefficients of /(a;) 0, and

Wetherefore in a,b..c.      will call this sura Ra, and thus with a similar

notation for b, &c. we get

+ + + +y, dxy ... -^ yfidXi^= Rarfa R4 c?Z╗ ... Re rfc.

The second side of this equation is from the nature of the case a complete

differential, and it is rational in a, b, c, &c. ; it can therefore be integrated

                                       ydxhy"^ (x,), we get

                       ^(x,) + ... + ^(x^) = M,

M being a logarithmic and algebraic function of a, b, &c., which we may

suppose to include the constant of integration.

   \j/ (x) is in general a transcendental function, while a, b, &c. are necessarily

algebraical functions of :r,, . . , x^, and the result at which we have arrived
                                                                                                                                  .

is therefore an exceedingly general formula for the comparison of transcen-

dental functions.

   The simplicity and generality of these considerations entitle them to espe-
cial attention : it cannot be doubted that the application thus made of the

properties of algebraical equations to the comparison of transcendents will

always be a remarkable point in the history of pure analysis.

  A very simple example may perhaps illustrate what has been said. Let us

recur to the equation               i
                       =x"-+ax + ^(a"--l) 0,
                                                                      (1.)

and suppose that                y= 1

Differentiating the first of these equations, we find that

                    (^x + a)dx -r (x + a)da = 0.

   * It must be remembered tliat an algebraical function is either explicit or implicit : ex-
plicit, when it can be expressed by a combination of ordinary algebraical symbols ; implicit,
when we can only define it by saying that it is a root of an algebraical equation whose co-

=efficients are integral functions of x. Thus y is an implicit function of x ii y^-^xt/-\-l 0.

The remarks in the text apply to all algebraical functions, explicit or implicit.

=Hence, as \{/ a; sin-' x, our result is merely this, that the sum of two arcs

is constant if the sine of one is equal to the cosine of the other.

   An infinity of analogous results may be obtained either by varying the

=form of y (e. g. by making y \^l--x-), or by changing the equation (1.).
A formula applicable to all forms of y, and which, for each, includes all the

results which can be established with respect to it, is, it will readily be ac-

knowledged, one of the most general in the whole range of analysis. Abel's

principal result is a formula of this nature ; he developed at considerable

length the various consequences which may be deduced from it.

Generally speaking, the number of independent variables a, b, . . . c will

be less than that of the different roots, a;,, . , . x/^; hence a certain number,

say m, of the roots may be looked on as independent (viz. as many as there

are quantities a, b, . . . c), and the rest will be functions of these. It may

a fixed number of them, together with an algebraical and logarithmic func-

pressed by means of one. Accordingly it appears from the general theory,
-- mthat in this ease (x,
                           may be made equal to unity.

9. The history of this important theory is curious. It was developed by

Abel in an essay which he presented to the Institute in the autumn of 1826,

when he had scarcely completed his twenty-fourth year.

   In a letter to M. Holmboe, appended to the edition of his collected works,
Abel writes, " Je viens de finir un grand traite sur une certaine classe de

fonctions transcendantes pour le presenter a I'lnstitut, ce qui aura lieu lundi

                 * The ambiguous sign of the radical is to our purpose immaterial.

prochain. J'ose dire sans ostentation que c'est un traite dent on sera satis-

fait. Je suis curieux d'entendre I'opinion de I'lnstitut la dessus. Je ne

manquerai pas de t'en faire part." Long before this memoir was published
Abel had become " chill to praise or blame." He died at Christiania in the

spring of 1829.

M. Jacobi mentions in a note in Crelle's Journal, that while at Paris he

represented, and as he believed not ineffectually, to Fourier, who was then

one of the secretaries of the Institute, that the publication of this memoir

Awould be verj' acceptable to mathematicians.         long period however was

still to elapse before the publication took place. It was po.-^sibly retarded by

the death of Fourier. In 184>1 the memoir appeared in the seventh volume

of the ' Memoires des Savans Etrangers.' It was prepared for publication

by M. Libri.

Thus for about fifteen years Abel's general theory remained unpublished

but in the meenwhile Crelle's Journal was established, and to the third vo-

lume of this he contributed a paper which contains a theorem much less ge-

neral than the researches he had communicated to the Institute, but far more

so than anything previously effected in the theory of the comparison of

transcendents. This is commonly known as Abel's Theorem. Legendre, in

--a letter to Abel, speaks thus of the memoir in which it appeared : " Mais le

memoire . . . ayant pour titre ' Remarques sur quelques proprietes gene-
rales,' &c., me parait surpasser tout ce que vous avez publie jusqu'a-present

par la profondeur de I'analyse qui y regne ainsi que par la beaute et la gene-

ralite des resultats." In a previous letter, with reference I believe to the

same subject, he had remarked, " Quelle tete que celle d'un jeune Norve-

gien !

Abel's theorem gives a formula for the comparison of all transcendental

functions whatever whose differentials are irrational from involving the square

root of a rational function of x.

In a very short paper in the fourth volume of Crelle's Journal, which

must have been the last written of Abel's productions, the chief idea of his

general theory is stated ; and in the second volume of his collected works we

find a somewhat fuller development of it, in a paper written before his visit

to Paris, but not published during his lifetime.

While Abel's great memoir remained unpublished at Paris, several mathe-

maticians, developing the ideas which he had made known in his contribu-

tions to Crelle's Journal, succeeded in establishing results of a greater or

less degree of generality. Researches of this kind ma}' be presented in a

variety of forms, because the algebraical function to be integrated, which

we have called y, may be defined or expressed in different ways. For in-

M Nstance, if and are general symbols denoting any integral functions of x,

^ N = Nthe two suppositions v
                                   and y    ._ are precisely equivalent, since

                                          V

Mby an obvious reduction, and by changing the signification of and N, the

one may be transformed into the other ; and so in more general cases. Thus
the same function may assume a variety of aspects, and there will be a cor-

responding variety in the form of our final results.

In Crelle's Journal we find a good many essays on this part of the sub-

ject : of these I shall now mention several.

M. Broch is the author of a paper in the twentieth volume of Crelle's

Journal, p. 178. It relates to the integration of certain functions irrational

in consequence of involving a polynomial of any degree raised to a fractional

power. For tiiese functions he establishes formulae of summation, which of
ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OF ANALYSIS.                                        41

course include Abel's theorem, since the latter relates to cases in which the

fractional power in question is the (^)th. Subsequently to the publication

of this paper he presented to the Institute a memoir on the same subject, but

gave to the functions to be integrated a different but not essentially more

general form. This memoir, which was ordered to be printed among the

' Savans Etrangers,' but which will be found in Crelle's Journal (xxiii. 145),
may be divided into two portions : the first contains results analogous to

Abel's theorem ; the second relates to the discussion and reduction of the

transcendents which they involve. In this part of his researches M. Broch

has followed the method, and occasionally almost adopted the phraseology

of a memoir of Abel, on the reduction and classification of Elliptic Inte-

MM.grals (Abel's Works, ii. p. 93).  Liouville and Cauchy, in reporting on

the memoir, conclude by remarking that the author " n'a pas trop presume

de ses forces en se proposant de marcher sur les traces d'Abel."

M. Jiirgenson has contributed two papers to Crelle's Journal on the sub-

ject of which Ave are speaking. The first, which is very short, contains a

general theorem for the summation of algebraical integrals* when the func-

tion to be integrated is expressed in a particular form. This paper appears

in the nineteenth volume, p. 113. In the second (vol. xxiii. p. 126) the au-

thor reproduces the results he had already obtained, pointing out the equi-

valence of one of them to tlie theorem established in M. Broch's first essay.

Besides this, he discusses a question connected with the reduction of alge-

braical integrals.

   M. Ramus, in the twenty-fourth volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 69, has

established two general formulae of summation ; from the second he deduces

with great facility Abel's theorem, and also another result, which Abel men-

tions in a letter to Legendre, published in the sixth volume of Crelle's

Journal, but which he left undemonstrated.

M. Rosenhain's researches (Crelle's Journal, xxviii, p. 249, and xxix.

p. 1) embrace both the summation and reduction of algebraical integrals.

His analysis depends on giving the function to be integrated a peculiar form,

which he conceives leads to a simpler mode of investigation than any other.

  A paper by Poisson will be found in the twelfth volume of Crelle's Jour-

nal, p. 89. It relates to the comparison of algebraical integrals, ^but is not

I think so valuable as that great mathematician's writings generally are.

   Beside the memoirs thus briefly noticed, I may mention two or three by
M. Minding : that which appears in the twenty-third volume of Crelle's

Journal, p. 255, is the one which is most completely developed.

There is also a very brief note by M. Jacobi in the eighth volume of

Crelle's Journal.

   10. To the Philosophical Transactions for 1836 and 1837 Mr. Fox Tal-
bot contributed two essays, entitled ' Researches in the Integral Calculus.'
These researches may be said to contain a development and generalisation
of the methods of Fagnani. They are however far more systematic than the

writings of the Italian mathematician, and if they had appeared in the last

century would have placed Mr. Talbot among those by whom the boundaries

of mathematical science have been enlarged. But it cannot be denied that
they fall far short of what had been effected at the time they were published,

nor does it appear that they contain anything of importance not known before.
I have assuredly no wish to speak disparagingly of Mr. Talbot ; his mathe-
matical writings bear manifest traces of the ability he has shown in so many

   * I have used the expression " algebraical integrals," though perhaps not correctly, to de-
note the integrals of algebraical functions.

branches of science*. But as in tliis country tliey seem to have been thought,
and by men not apparently unqualified to judge, to contain great additions to
our knowledge, I cannot avoid inquiring whether this be true.

   Mr. Talbot points out in the early part of his first paper, that if there are

--n 1 symmetrical relations among the n variables x, t/ . . .z, then the iden-

tical equation

   --{y . . .z}dx + (x . . .z)d7j +. .,+ {xy .. .}dz d[xy .. .z)

will assume the form

         =(p{x)dx -\-(p{y)dy -\-...'{- (p(z)dz d{xy . . .2},

and thus give us

J'(p      (x) dx          =(y) dy +,. .+yл (z) dz      +xy z. . .  C.

                  \-J^<p

Precisely the same remark, though expressed in a different notation, is the

foundation of M. Hill's memoir, published in 1834, on what he calls " func-

Ationes iteratse." It will be found in Crelle's Journal, xi. p. 193.   much

more general theorem might be established by similar considerations : they

are of course applicable whether the function <p be algebraical or trans-

cendent.

   In the course of his researches, Mr. Talbot recognised the important prin-

--ciple, that the existence of w 1 symmetrical algebraical relations among n

variables may be expressed by treating them as the roots of an equation, one

of whose coefficients at least is variable, the others being either constant or

functions of the variable one. Unfortunately he did not pass from hence to

pthe more general view, that the existence of л        symmetrical relations

may be expressed in a similar manner if we consider j9 of the coefficients of
the equation as arbitrary quantities. Had he done so, it is possible, though

not likely, that he would have rediscovered Abel's theorem; but as it is, he

has never introduced, except once, and then as it were by accident, more

than one arbitrary quantity. Thus only one of his variables is independent,

and consequently, in more than one instance, his results are unnecessarily

restricted cases of more general theorems.

The character of his analysis will be perceived from what has been said.

fXdx Xl( be the transcendent to be considered, being an algebraical func-

tion of X, he makes the following assumption

                               X=f(xv),

/aV being a new variable, and  rational function.      From this assumption he

deduces an algebraical equation in x, the coefficients of which are rational
functions of w. This equation then is one of those of which we have spoken,

by means of which the function to be integrated can be expressed in a ra-
tional form. Taking the sum with respect to the roots of this equation, we

get

                                 ^(Xdx)=z-2(fCxv)dx).

It must be remarked that many forms might be assigned to the function f,
which would give rise to a difficulty, of the means of surmounting which

Mr. Talbot has given no idea. If x and v are mixed up iny(a; v), it is ma-

nifest that we cannot integrate f(xv)dx, since 2j is a function of x, which

   * It must be remembered also that Mr. Talbot admits himself to have been anticipated
to a considerable extent by the publication of Abel's theorem.

ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OP ANALYSIS.                            43

Weif we eliminate we merely return to our function X.    must therefore

express ^f(xv)dx in the form V dv,Y being a function and, as Abel has

shown, an integrable function of v. Abel has given formulse by means of

which this reduction may be effected in all possible cases. But there is no-

thing analogous to this in the writings of Mr. Talbot, and consequently he

could not, setting aside the defect already noticed, obtain results as general

as many previously known. In Mr. Talbot's investigations, /(a; v)(i a; is such

that Sy"(x v)dx may be put in the form

                  V, S {^', xdx} + V.^ ^{f,,xdx} + &c.,

=(PfX, PdX, &c. (of which (p'l a;, ^'o a:, &c. are the derived functions) being

rational functions of x. Then S ip a; a rational function of v by a well-
known theorem. Let the form of this function be ascertained, and let us

%denote it by v. Then differentiating,

                  =ll(p'xdx ^'v dv,

and hence

        X = = +S Jx 'S,f(xv)dx [V, x'l V Yo.-xjoj' +. .] rfv,

and the second side of this equation is of course rational and integrable.
But the form of the function /(a;?;) is unnecessarily restricted in order that
this kind of reduction may be possible. Nevertheless, Mr. Talbot's papers,
from their fulness of illustration and the clear manner in which particular
cases of the general theory are worked out by independent methods, will be
found very useful in facilitating our conceptions of the branch of analysis
which forms as it were the link between the theory of equations and the in-

tegral calculus.

   In Mr. Talbot's second memoir (Phil. Trans. 1837, part 2. p. 1) he has
applied his method to certain geometrical theorems. Three of them relate

--to the ellipse, and are proved by the three following assumptions i

fl-- c2^14               '''            =  \~ex      =   //^
                                           --7T''''
iT-^l =1+^^'                                            Tzrx

These assumptions are all cases of the following

                  +r X--e'^x'^ 1 *_ c c^x
                  -- ~ +1 1
                  a;2 J                 a a' x'

where a, л', c, c' are arbitrary quantities. The results of this assumption
are completely worked out by Legendre (Theorie des Fonctions EUiptiques,
iii. p. 192) in showing how the known formulas of elliptic functions may be
derived from Abel's theorem. Mr. Talbot's first theorem is a case of" the
fundamental formula for the comparison of elliptic arcs. This remark has
reference to an inquiry which Mr. Talbot suggests as to the relation in which
his theorems stand to the results obtained by Legendre and others.

   In conclusion, it may be well to observe that Mr. Talbot has remarked

that, apparently, a solution discovered by Fagnani of a certain difierential
equation cannot be deduced from Abel's theorem ; but as this solution may
be easily derived from the ordinary formula for the addition of elliptic in-
tegrals of the first kind it is manifestly included in the theorem in question.

   II. I now come to the history of researches into the properties of par-
ticular classes of algebraical transcendents. The earliest, and still perhaps
the most important class of these researches relates to the transcendents
--44 REPORT 1846.

which are commonly called elliptic functions or elliptic integrals. For a reason
which will be mentioned hereafter the latter name seems preferable, and it is
sanctioned by the authority of M. Jacobi, though the former was used by Le-
gendre. Elliptic integrals then may be defined as those whose differentials are

+irrational in consequence of involving a radical of the form //{a (ioc+y x"^

+ +Sx3 гX'^}. But it may perhaps be more correct to say that all such in-

tegrals may be reduced to three standard integrals, to which the name of

elliptic integrals has been given.
    In the Turin Memoirs for 1784- and 1785, p. 218, Lagrange considered,

as has been already mentioned, the theory of these transcendents. He

showed that the integration of every function irrational in consequence of
containing a square root may be made to depend on that of a function of

R Rthe form --, P being rational, and  the  radical  in  question                                  and that  if
                                                                                                ;

under the sign of the square root x does not rise above the fourth degree,
                                                         "N dx

it may ultimately be made to depend on that of - /.      a~2^7l 4. TT)'

Nwhere  Heis rational in x-.  thus laid the foundation of that part of the

theory of elliptic transcendents in which a proposed integral is reduced

to certain canonical or standard forms, or to the simplest combination of

such forms of which the case admits. In Legendre's earliest^ writings on
elliptic functions there is nothing relating to this part of the subject. Having

thus, in the simple manner which distinguishes his analysis, reduced the ge-

neral case to that which admits of the application of his method, Lagrange

proceeded to prove that if we introduce a new variable whose ratio to x is

+ +the subduplicate of the ratio of 1 p' a:^ to 1  g- .r'-, the last written inte-

gral is made to depend on another of similar form, but in which p and q are

replaced by new quantities p' and q\ Ifp is greater than q, p^ will be greater

than^, and g' less than q, and thus by successive similar transformations we

+ultimately come to an integral in which q is so small that the factor 1 q^ x"

may be replaced by unity, and the elliptic integral is therefore reduced to a

circular or logarithmic form. Or by successive transformations in the oppo-

site direction Ave come to an integral in which p^ and q^ are sensibly equal,

in which case also the elliptic integral is reduced to a lower transcendent.

This most ingenious method is the foundation of all that has since been

effected in the transformation of elliptic integrals, or at least whatever has

been done has been suggested by it. Thus it is to Lagrange that we owe

the origin of two great divisions of the theory of these functions.
   In the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1786, p. 616, we find Legen-

dre's first essay on the subject to which he afterwards gave so much attention.

We recognise in it what may I think be considered the principal aim of his

researches in elliptic functions, namely to facilitate, by the tabulation of

these functions, the numerical solution of mathematical and physical pro-

blems.

   He begins, not with a general form as Lagrange had done, but with the

integral /Vl--c-sin^^rf^, which as Ave knoAV represents an elliptic arc,

and shows how other functions, for instance the value of the hyperbolic arc,
may be expressed by means of it, and of its differential coefficient with re-
spect to the eccentricity c. The memoir does not contain Ynuch that is now
of interest. After Avriting it he became aware of the existence of Landen's
researches ; and in a second memoir appended to the first gave a demonstra-

tion of Landen's principal theorem. This demonstration is founded on
       ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OP ANALYSIS.                                        45

Legendre's own methods, and he deduces from it the remarkable conclusion,
that if of a series of ellipses, whose eccentricities are connected by a certain
law, we could rectify any two, we could deduce from hence the rectification
of all the rest. The law connecting the eccentricities of the ellipses is that
which would be obtained by making use of Lagrange s method of transtor-

mation, with which accordingly this result is closely allied.            ,,  ^to  .,
Legendre's next work was an essay on transcendents*, presented
                                                                                  the

AcadSmy in 1792 and published separately the year after. It contains the
same general view as that which is developed in the first volume of the

'Exercices de Calcul Integral,' which appeared in 1811.                  Legendre,
                                           as it is presented to us by
   12. The theory of  elliptic functions,
may conveniently be                        the following heads :--
                      considered under

a. The reduction of the general integral,

             y^ F dx

Pin which is rational to three standard forms, since known as elliptic inte-

grals of the first, second and third kinds t-
   This classification, though the reduction of the general integral had, as we

have seen, been already considered by Lagrange, is I beheve entirely due to
Legendre. If we consider how much it has facilitated all subsequent re-
searches, we can hardly over-rate the importance of the step thus made. It

may almost be said that Legendre, in thus showing us the primary forms with
which the theory of elliptic integrals is conversant, created a new province

of analysis : he certainly gave unity and a definite form to the whole sub-

ject.

    For the three species of functions thus recognised Legendre suggested the
names of nome, epinome and paranome, the name of the first being derived
from the idea that it involves, so to speak, the law on which the comparison
of elliptic integrals depends. But these names do not seem felicitous, nor
have they I believe been ad9pted. To this part of the subject an important
theorem relating to the reduction of elliptic integrals of the third kind,

whose parameters are imaginary, seems naturally to belong.
    /3. The comparison of elliptic integrals of the same form differing only

in the value of the variable, or as it is often called, the amplitude of each.
This part of the subject divides itself into three heads, corresponding to the

three classes of integrals. The fundamental results are to be found in the
memoirs of Euler, of which we have already spoken. By Legendre how-

 ever they were more fully developed.
    It is interesting to observe that Legendre suggested that the discovery of

  A* translation of it appeared in Leybourne's Mathematical Repository, vols. ii. and iii.

way in which it can be generalised.

   y. Theorems relating to the comparison of different kinds of elliptic func-
tions. One of the most remarkable of these is the relation between the

complete integrals (those, namely, in which the variable x is unity) of the

first and second kind, the moduli of which are complementary ; that is, the

sum of the squares of whose moduli is equal to unity, Legendre's demonstra-

--tion of it is rather indirect, but many others have been since given. Another

theorem may be mentioned, that the complete integral of the third kind

can always be expressed by means of the complete integrals of the first and

Asecond.    third and most important result shows that in elliptic integrals

of the third kind we may distinguish two separate species, and that to one

Aor other of these any such integral may be reduced.    memorable dis-

covery of M. Jacobi has greatly increased the importance of this subdivision,

of which we shall hereafter speak more fully. This part of the subject is,

I imagine, entirely due to Legendre.

S. The evaluation of elliptic integrals by means of expansions.

e. The method of successive transformations. The idea of this method

originated, as we have seen, with Lagrange. It is developed at great length

by Legendre, with a special reference to the modifications required in apply-

ing it to the different species of integrals. As Lagrange had shown, the

series of transformed integrals extending indefinitely both waj's conducts us,

in whichever direction we follow it, towards a transcendent of a lower kind

than an elliptic integral, or in other words, towards a logarithmic or circular

integral. There are thus two modes of approximation, one of which depends

on a series of integrals with increasing moduli, and the other on a series

whose moduli decrease. Thus for the three species of integrals there will

be in all six approximative processes to be considered. In the case of the

elliptic integral of the third kind, we have to determine the law of formation

of the successive parameters ??, n', &c.

   This analysis, however slight, will give an idea of the contents of that part
of the ' Exercices de Calcul Integral ' which relates to elliptic functions. In

the third volume there are tables for facilitating the calculation of integrals
of the first and second kind: they are accompanied with an explanation of
the manner in which they were constructed. The ninth table is one with
double entry, the two arguments being the angle of the modulus and the

amplitude.

13. In 1825 Legendre presented to the Academic des Sciences the first
Avolume of his ' Traite des Fonctions Elliptiques.'
                                                     great part of this work

is precisely the same as the ' Exercices de Calcul Integral.' By far the most,

important addition to the theory of elliptic functions consists in the disco-

   In the earlier work Legendre had shown that a certain transcendent might
be expressed in two ways by means of elliptic integrals of the first kind.

Comparing the two results, he obtained a very simple relation between the
two elliptic integrals. Their moduli are complementary; while the ratio of

the A's in the two integrals can be expressed rationally in terms of the sine

of the amplitude of one. This circumstance seems to have suggested to Le-

gendre the possibility of generalising the result. He accordingly assumed a

relation between the amplitudes of two integrals, of which the equation sub-
sisting in the theorem of which we have been speaking is a particular case

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and showed from hence that a simple relation perfectly similar to that wiiich

he had obtained in the particular instance existed between the two integrals,

viz. that they bore to each other a ratio independent of their amplitudes.

Their moduli are connected by an algebraical equation, but are not comple-
mentary. This circumstance therefore now appeared to be unessential,

though in the ' Exercices' the investigation is introduced for the sake of ex-

hibiting a case in which an integral may be transformed into another with a

complementary modulus.
   Legendre thus obtained a new kind of transformation, which might be re-

peated any number of times or combined in an infinite variety of ways with

--that of Lagrange. To illustrate this he constructed a kind of table a " da-

mier analytique." In the central cell is placed the original modulus c. All the
moduli contained in the same horizontal row are derivable from one another
by Lagrange's scale of moduli ; those in each vertical row by the newly-

discovered scale. He seems to have been very much struck by the infinite
variety of transformations of which elliptic integrals admit. The integral of

the first kind is especially remarkable, because of the simplicity of the rela-
tion which connects it with any of its transformations, viz. that their ratio is
independent of the amplitudes.

   Legendre's second work was, as we have remarked, presented to the Aca-
demy in 1825, but it was not published till 1827. In the summer of 1827
M. Jacobi announced in Schumacher's ' Astronomischen Nachrichten,' No,
123, that he was in possession of a general method of transformation for
elliptic integrals of the first kind. He was not acquainted with Legendre's
discovery of a new scale, and as an illustration of the general theorem gave
two cases of it, the first being equivalent to Legendre's method of transfor-
mation. Thus much was announced in a letter to M. Schumacher, dated
June I3th ; but in one of a later date (August 2nd) he gave a formal
enunciation of his theorem, but without demonstration. The two commu-
nications appear consecutively (Ast. Nach. vi. p. 33).

   In No. 127 of the Nachrichten, vi. p. 133, M. Jacobi gave a demonstra*

tion of his theorem.

   If we can so determine y in the terms of x as to satisfy the difierential

equation

MV(i-y.)"(l--x^^^)=  V(i-/)0-./t--^'.) ^^ '^^'"S ^""^^^"t>'

it is manifest that we shall have (F denoting the elliptic integral of the first

kind) F(Aa;)=MF (A?/), provided that y and x vanish together. The

question therefore is, how may the differential equation be satisfied, for it is

clear that by means of a solution of it we transform the elliptic integral
F(A x) into another, viz. into F(Xy).

two general conditions, the second of which is found to be deducible from

the first. He then makes an assumption which is equivalent to assigning

Uparticular forms to and V, and thence shows, by a most ingenious method,

U Vthat these forms of and are such as to fulfil the first of the required condi-

Hetions, which, as has been said, implies the other.                       thus verifies, a poste-

riori, the assumed value of the function y.

U VIn proving that the forms assigned for and have the required pro-

in the finite relation between these quantities, the same thing will be true in

the differential equation by which they are connected, a remark which may

very easily be verified. But, on the other hand, it by no means follows that

because it is true in the differential equation therefore any assumed finite

relation between y and x having this property is the integral required. The

property in question therefore does not enable us to verify any assumed

value of y.
   This remark has reference to a communication from Legendre which ap-

pears in No. 130 of Schumacher's Nachrichten, vi. p. 201. In it he gives

an account of M. Jacobi's researches, and an outline of the demonstration of

which we have been speaking. I find it impossible to avoid the conclusion

that this great mathematician mistook the character of the demonstration in

question, and that to him it appeared to be in effect a mere verification of

the assumed value of y by means of the principle of double substitution.

He remarks that the direct substitution of the value of y in the diff'erential
equation is impracticable, but that M. Jacobi had avoided this substitution

by means of " une propriete particuliere de cette equation qui doit etre com-
mune aux integrales qui la representent." This property is the principle of

double substitution ; and after showing that it is true of the differential
equation, the writer proceeds thus: " Ce principe une fois pose, rien n'est

plus facile que de verifier I'equation trouvee y=- ~, car par la double sub-

stitution on obtient la meme valeur de y a un coefficient pres qui doit etre

6gal                                       ;  and, after a remark to  our present purpose immaterial, con-

      a I'unite "

que, etc."

   As we have seen, such a verification would be wholly inconclusive, nor is

the essential point of M. Jacobi's reasoning, namely, that the assumed forms

U Vof and satisfy the general condition, laid down at the outset of his de-

monstration, here adverted to.

   In 1828 Legendre published the first supplement to the 'Traite des Fonc-

tions EUiptiques,' &c. It contains an account of the researches of M.

Jacobi, and of a memoir by Abel inserted in the third volume of Crelle's

Journal. The account here given of M. Jacobi's demonstration is fuller and

more explicit than that already noticed. It leaves, I think, no doubt of the

error into which Legendre had fallen. No notice whatever is taken of the

first part of M. Jacobi's reasoning : and after remarking that the differential
equation is satisfied when the double substitution is made, he goes on, " Tout

                                                                    X \J

   Legendre remarks, that although M. Jacobi's demonstration rests on " un

principe incontestable et tres ingenieux," it is still desirable to have another

verification of so important a theorem. He accordingly gives an original
demonstration of it, which is however more nearly allied to M. Jacobi's than

to him it seemed to be. This demonstration had already been hinted at in
his communication to the Nachrichten. The principal difference is, that
while M. Jacobi proved generally that if the first of the two required condi-
tions were satisfied, the second would also be so, and then showed that the

U Vforms assigned to and satisfied the first condition ; Legendre shows the

assigned forms are such as to satisfy both conditions, on the connection be-
tween which it is therefore unnecessary for him to dwell. In the third sup-
plement to the 'Traite des Fonctions EUiptiques,' Legendre has given an-

other demonstration of M. Jacobi's theorem, remarking that it is both more
rigorous and more like M. Jacobi's than that which he had first given. I
have thought it necessary to make these remarks, because it has been said
that it was in the supplements to Legendre's work that the demonstration of

this theorem received "le dernier degre de rigueur"*.

   14. In 1829 M. Jacobi's great work on elliptic functions, the ' Fundamenta
Nova Theorise Functionum EUipticarum,' was published at Kcenigsberg. It

contains his researches not merely on the theory of transformation, but also
with respect to other parts of the subject. But the great problem of trans-
formation is the fundamental idea of the whole work ; the other parts are

subordinate to it, or at least derived from it. The subject is treated with
great fulness of illustration and in a manner not unlike that of Euler.

    M. Jacobi begins by considering the possibility of transforming the ge-
neral transcendent whose differential coefficient is unity divided by the square
root of a polynomial of the fourth degree. Subsequently, having shown that
this transcendent may be transformed by introducing a new variable y equal
to the quotient of two integral functions of x, and also that the general

transcendent may be reduced to one of the form / . ^           ^.,                                                                                                            x>

he proceeds to consider the latter in detail.

   The first step of this reasoning, viz. the possibility of the transformation,
depends on a comparison of the number of the disposable quantities in the

1846.                                                            E

assumed value of y with that of the conditions required, in order that the
quantity under the radical in the transformed expression may be equal to
the square of an integral function of x multiplied by four unequal linear
factors. It is shown that the number of disposable quantities exceeds by
three that of the required conditions. But, as Poisson has remarked in the
report already mentioned (^lem. de I'lnstitut. x. p. 87), and as M. Jacobi
himself intimates, this does nut amount to an absolute a piiori proof of the
possibility of the transformation ; 7ion constat but that some of these condi-
tions may be incompatible.

   Granting however the possibility of putting the quantity under the radical
in the required form, it is shown, as in Schumacher's Journal, that this
condition is not only necessary but also sufficient, or, in other words, that it
involves the second condition already mentioned.

The transcendent / ,,  /,                    mav be transformed bv as-

= U Vsuming y =r, being composed wholly of odd powers of a*, and of even

Upowers of it. If the degree of be greater than that of V, the transforma-

tion is said to be of an odd order, and of an even order in the contrary

case.

   This being premised, M. Jacobi discusses the particular cases of the trans-
formations of the third and of the fifth order. The first is the same as that
of Legendre. It is shown that if we put

                       _ + +(v 2 u^} V X u'^ x^
                      ~ + +^ t,2 (vi-s u''- 2 л5) X-*

where tt and v are constants connected by the following equation

                      -- -- =n* V* + 2nv {l u- v-} 0,

we shall get

modular equation.

   The "principle of double substitution" may be illustrated by writing

for X in the expression for y, which then becomes, according to the principle

m1
     question,

   If we seek to show that the assigned value of y actually satisfies the dif-
ferential equation just stated, we begin by finding the value of 1 ^y. Re-
ducing this value by means of the equation between u and r, we can put it in

-- Rthe form (1 a) ---, being an integral function of a: and V, as heretofore

+the denominator of the expression for y. The value of 1 y is hence got
--by changing the sign of a', while that of 1 v*y is obtained by simultane-

ously replacing x and y respectively by  and  and reducing. Simi-

+larly for 1 v^y. Hence it will appear that

              (l-y^)(l-i-3y"-)=(l-a;0(l-"^x^)|^ . . . (a.)

                                                                                1

and combining these two results obtain the required verification.

The essence ot M, Jacobi's demonstration consists in showing that if the

value of y in terms of x is such that an equation of the form (a.) subsists,

had hitherto been accustomed to look on the value of the elliptic integral as

a function of its amplitude, to make the amplitude (if the expression may so

be used) the independent variable. But in reality a contrary course is on

Wemany accounts to be preferred.                                have in the more advanced part of the

theory more frequently occasion to consider the value of the amplitude as

determined by the corresponding value of the integral than vice versa ; and
it therefore becomes expedient to frame a notation by which the amplitude

may be expressed as a function of the integral. In a paper in the ninth vo-

lume of Crelle's Journal by M. Jacobi, which, like many of his writings,

contains in a short compass a philosophical view of a wide subject, he has
made use of the analogy between circular and elliptic functions to illustrate

the importance of the new notation for the latter. When the modulus of an

elliptic integral of tlie first kind is equal to zero, the integral becomes

fx dx                                           ,  as we know,                   arc whose sine is x,

J VI --I /     -, which,                                        is equal to the                        or to
           <i
               x'^

sin~'a". Now this is a function which we have much less often occa-

sion to express than its inverse sin x, and we accordingly always look on the

latter as a direct, and on the former as an inverse function. Yet in the case

of elliptic functions, the functional dependence for which we had an explicit

and recognised notation, viz. that of the integral on the amplitude, corre-

sponds to that which in circular functions has always and almost necessarily

been treated merely as an inverse function. The origin of this discrepancy

is obvious ; our knowledge of the nature of circular functions is not derived

                                                                        e2

from the algebraical integrals connected with them, and therefore these in-
tegrals are not brought so much into view as in the theory of elliptic func-
tions the corresponding integrals necessarily are ; but it is certain that while

the discrepancy continued to exist the subject could never be fully or satis-

factorily developed. The maxim " verba vestigia mentis" is as true of ma-

thematical symbols as of the elements of ordinary language.

  We shall see hereafter that Abel took the same step in his first essay on

elliptic functions. At present I shall only remark, that one of the earliest
consequences of the new notation was the recognition of a most important
principle, viz. that the "inverse function" sin am m, that is, the function

corresponding to sin u in circular functions, is doubly periodic, or that it re-
tains the same value when u increases by any multiple either of a certain

real or of a certain imaginary quantity. Now M. Jacobi has shown that no

function * can be triply periodic, and therefore these inverse functions pos-
sess the most general kind possible of periodicity, a property which gives

them great analytical importance.
   Following M. Jacobi, we shall henceforth give the name of elliptic func-

tions to those which are analogous to circular functions. It is on this ac-
count better to call Legendre's functions elliptic integrals than, as he has

done, elliptic functions (vide ante, p. 44).

   By the new notation we are led to consider a great variety of formulae
analogous to those of ordinary trigonometry. The sine or cosine of the am-
plitude of the sum of two quantities may be expressed in terms of the sines
and cosines of the amplitudes of each, &c.t; and we have only to make the
modulus equal to zero to pass from what has sometimes, though not with
much propriety, been called elliptic trigonometry to the common properties

of circular functions.

   M. Jacobi gives a table of formulae relating to the new elliptic functions,
and proceeds to apply their properties to the problem of transformation. It
was in this manner that he had treated the problem in the Nachrichten. As

in his earlier essay, he assumes y equal to a rational function of x, whose

coefficients are elliptic functions, and shows that this assumption satisfies the

difi"erential equation already mentioned. It may be asked what is gained by
the introduction of elliptic functions into a problem of which, as we have

seen, particular cases (e.^. the transformations of the third and fifth order)

can be solved by algebraical considerations. The answer is, that the pro-

perties of these functions enable us to transform the assumed relation between

y and a? in a manner which would otherwise be impracticable. It is con-
ceivable that any particular case might be solved by mere algebra, but it

does not seem possible to discover in this way a general theorem for trans-

formations of all orders, and practically the labour of obtaining the formulae

for the transformation of any high order would be intolerable.

Having proved the theorem for transformation in nearly the same manner

as he had already done, M. Jacobi developes the demonstration which, as

we have said, Legendre hinted at in No. 130 of Schumacher's Journal.

He then proceeds to consider the various transformations of any given

Weorder.  have seen that the modular equation for those of the third order

rises to the fourth degree, that is to say, for a given value of the modulus of

the original integral four new moduli exist, corresponding to four new in-

tegrals, into which the given one may be transformed. These four trans-

formations are all included in the general formula for the third order ; but

it is to be remarked that in general only two of the roots of the modular

equation are real. Thus there are two real transformations and no more.

The same thing is true, mutatis mutandis, of the transformations of any

prime order (to which M. Jacobi's attention is chiefly directed), that is to

+ --say, there will be ╗ 1 transformations of the nth order, w 1 of which

are imaginary. The two real transformations are called the first and the se-

cond ; the second is sometimes called the impossible transformation, because

it presents itself in an imaginary form*. Of the formulae connected with

these two transformations M. Jacobi gives copious tables.

He next shows, in a very remarkable manner, that, corresponding to a

transformation in which we pass from a modulus ^ to a modulus A, there

exists another, whose formulae are derivable from those of the former, in

-- --which we pass from a modulus \^\ A* to a modulus \/\ X% or which

connects moduli complementary to A. and k. The latter is accordingly called,
with reference to the former, the complementary transformation. The first

real transformation of k corresponds to the second real transformation

--V\ k% and vice versa.

The next theorem which M. Jacobi demonstrates is not less remarkable.

It is that the combination of the first and second real transformations gives

a formula for the multiplication of the original integral, or, in other words,

that the modulus of the integral which results from this double transforma-

tion is the same as that of the original integral, so that the two integrals

diflTer only in their amplitudes. Of this theorem he had in the earlier part

of the work proved some particular cases f.

   * Mr. Bronwin, in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal and in the Phil. Mag., has
made some objections to this transformation ; but from a correspondence which I have re-

cently had with him, I believe I am justified in stating that he does not object either to M.
Jacobi's result or to the logical correctness of his reasoning, but only to the form in which

the result is exhibited.

    After fully developing this part of the subject, he next treats of the nature
of the modular equation, and shows that it possesses several remarkable

properties. One is, that all modular equations, of whatever order, are par-
ticular integrals of a differential equation of the third order, of which the

general integral can be expressed by means of elliptic transcendents.

  We16. now enter on the second great division of M. Jacobi's researches,

the evolution of elliptic functions.

The evolution of elliptic functions into continued products with an infinite

number of factors presents itself as the limit towards which M. Jacobi's

theorem for the transformation of the nth order tends as n increases sine

limite. It is for this reason that we may look on the problem of transforma-

tion as the leading idea in M. Jacobi's researches.

We may in some degree illustrate these evolutions by a reference to cir-
Acular functions.
                   sine is, as we know, an elliptic function whose modulus

is zero. Now if k is zero, X is also zero. Thus if we apply a formula of

transformation to a sine, we shall be led to another sine either of the same

or of a multiple arc. Accordingly the first real transformation degenerates

in the case in question into the known formula for the sine of a multiple

arc ; while the second, leading us merely to the sine of the same arc, becomes

illusory. Thus in the case of a sine, transformation is merely multiplication ;

but from the formula for multiplication, viz.

---sin(2?╗+l)9=(2m + l)sin9/l         sin"^ 9       _\ /,                        sin"- 9  \

                                                         and 2               \ infinite, the

common formula

            ^^"^=K'-S)0-5>

    This then is a formula of evolution deduced from the first real transfor-
mation. It is however only when h, is zero that the first transformation will
give such a formula. In all other cases it is, for a reason which we cannot

here enter on, impossible to derive from it a formula of this kind. M. Jacobi's

formulae are accordingly derived from the second real transformation, and
therefore are illusory when k is zero, or for the case of the sine. There is
nothing therefore strictly analogous to them in the theory of angular sections.

m mBy means of them we express the function sin am x in terms of sin x,

being a certain constant.

   From the fundamental expressions in continued products, of which there
are three, many important theorems may be derived. This part of the sub-

ject seems to admit of almost infinite increase, and it is difficult to give any

General view of it. I may, however, mention a remarkable transcendental

perpetually in this part of the theory of elliptic functions. If for the moment

=we denote this function by Y k, so that (/ F k, then if for k we write k^,

which we suppose to represent the modulus of the first real transformation

=of the nth order, we find that q" F k,^, so that if q^ is the same function of

^,, that g' is of A

                     =g^ g"-

This singular property, and others of an analogous character, are of great

use in establishing various formulae *.

   Before discussing the evolution of integrals of the third kind, M. Jacobi
has premised some important theorems. He proves that the elliptic integral

of the third kind, though it involves three elements, viz. the amplitude, the
modulus and the parameter, can yet be expressed in terms of other quantities
severally involving but two. In order to this we introduce either a new trans-

cendent t or a definite elliptic integral of the third kind, whose amplitude is a
certain function of its modulus and parameter. It is almost impossible to

tabulate the values of a function of three elements, on account of the enormous
bulk of a table with triple entry ; we therefore see the importance of the step
thus made. M. Jacobi announced this discovery as generally true of elliptic

integrals of the third kind, but his demonstration applies to that subdivision
already mentioned, which was designated by Legendre " Fonctions du troi-
sieme ordre ^ parametre logarithmique," and not to functions " a parametre

circulaire X'' It is probable that this limitation was in M. Jacobi's mind, but
lie does not seem to have expressed it. Further on, in the ' Fundamenta
Nova,' we find another mode of expressing integrals of the third kind in

terras of functions of two elements, but this method also applies only to
" fonctions du troisieme ordre a parametre logarithmique," the two methods

being in fact closely allied.

   Legendre appreciated the importance of this discovery of M. Jacobi. He

speaks of it in a letter to Abel, as a " decouverte majeure," but adds that

bis attempts to extend M. Jacobi's demonstration to the other class of inte-
grals of the third kind had been unsuccessful. The same remarks occur in
his second supplement (Traite des Fonct. Ell., iii. p. 141). The distinction
thus made between the two classes of integrals of the third kind appeared
to Legendre sufficient to make it desirable to recognise in all four classes of
elliptic integrals, so as to make the division between the two species of the

third class coordinate with that between either and the first or second.

Legendre says explicitly that M. Jacobi had announced, in making known

his discovery, that it applied to functions " a parametre circulaire." This

                                  =yE (л??);A (e ^)'

where E (c <f) is the elliptic integral of the second kind. If we introduce the inverse nota-

however possibly arose from some misconception of M. Jacobi's meaning.
Dr. Gudermann, in the iburteenth volume of Crelle's Journal, has given it

as his opinion that the circular species of integrals of the third kind does not

admit of the reduction in question ; and remarks, that it occurs much more

frequently than the other species in the applications of mathematics to na-
tural philosophy.

    After having discussed at some length, and by new methods, the proper-
ties of elliptic integrals of the third kind, M. Jacobi concludes his work by
investigating the nature of two new transcendents which present themselves
in immediate coimexion with the numerator and denominator of the con-
tinued product by which sin am u is expressed. One of them however
M. Jacobi had already recognised by a distinctive symbol, in consequence of
its intimate connexion with the theory of integrals of the third kind.

    Such is the outline of this remarkable work : before it appeared M. Jacobi
 gave in the third and fourth volumes of Crelle's Journal (iii. pp. 192, 303,

 403, iv. p. 185) notices, mostly without demonstrations, of the progress of
 his researches. Almost everything in the first and second of these notices

is found in the 'Fundamenta.' In the third we find a remarkable algebraical
 formula for the multiplication of the elliptic integral of the first kind. The
 fourth and last relates to ulterior investigations, which it was the intention

 of the author to develope in a second part of his work. It contains an indi-
 cation of a method of transformation depending on a partial differential
 equation * ; values of the elliptic functions of multiple arguments ; a method
 of transforming integrals of the second and third kinds ; a most important
 simplification of the method of Abel for the division of any integral of the

 first kind, &c. Of this simplification he had already given some idea in a
 note in the preceding volume of the same Journal, p. 86.

    17. It may not be improper in this place to observe, that in 1818, and
 thus in the interval between Legendre's first and second systematic works on
 the theory of elliptic functions, M. Gauss published the tract entitled ' De-
 terminatio Attractionis,' &c. The illustrious author begins by i-emarking
 that the secular inequalities due to the action of one planet on another
 are the same as if the mass of the disturbing planet were diffused according
 to a certain law along its orbit, so that the latter becomes an elliptic ring of
 variable but infinitesimal thickness. The problem then presents itself of
 determining the attraction exerted by such a ring on any external point.
 In the solution of tliis problem M. Gauss arrives at two definite integrals
 they can readily be reduced to elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds.
 For the evaluation of the integrals to which he reduces those of his problem,
 M. Gauss gives a method of successive transformation, analogous in some
 measure to that of Lagrange. But the transformation of which he makes
 use is a rational one, and is in fact the rational transformation of the second
 order. The discovery of this transformation appears therefore to be due to
 M. Gauss. He has remarked, though merely in passing, that his method is
 applicable to the indefinite as well as to the definite integral. The rational

 transformation in question leads to a continually increasing series of moduli,

 or is, to use an expression of M. Jacobi a transformation "minoris in
 majorem." The law connecting two consecutive moduli is the same as in
 Lagrange's, which is, as we have seen, an irrational transformation ; so that
 M. Gauss's method does not afford us a new scale of moduli. Nevertheless,
 as no rational transformation had I believe been noticed when his tract ap-

     * Mr. Cayley, to whose kindness I have been, while engaged on the present report, greatly
 indebted, has communicated to me a demonstration of the truth of this equation.

peared *, his method is, in a historical point of view, of considerable in-

terest.

   18. In the second volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 101, we find Abel's first
memoir on elliptic functions. It was published in the spring of 1827, and
therefore before M. Jacobi's announcement in No. 123 of Schumacher's
Journal. But it contains nothing which interferes with M. Jacobi's disco-
very of the general theory of transformation. Abel's researches on this part
of the subject appeared in the third volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 160.
This second communication is dated, as we are informed by an editorial
note, the 12th of February, 1828, and though it is announced as a continu-

ation of the former memoir, it is yet in effect distinct from it, as its contents
are not mentioned in the general summary prefixed to the first communica-

tion.

   These details may not be without interest, though it is not often that ques-

tions of priority deserve the importance sometimes given to them. There
is no doubt that Abel's researches were wholly independent of those of

M. Jacobi ; and though the coincidence of some of their results is therefore

interesting, yet the general view which they respectively took of the theory of
elliptic functions is essentially different, as different as the style and manner

of their writings.

With M. Jacobi the problem of transformation occupied the first place

with Abel that of the division of elliptic integrals. Both introduced a nota-

tion inverse to that which had previously been used, and as an immediate

consequence recognised the double periodicity of elliptic functions. Ex-

pressions of these functions in continued products and series were given by

both, but those of Abel were deduced by considering the limiting case of

the multiplication of elliptic integrals, those of M. Jacobi, as we have seen,

from the limiting case of their transformation. Hence Abel's fundamental

expressions depend on doubly infinite continued products, corresponding to

the double periodicity of elliptic functions. On the other hand, M. Jacobi's

continued products are all singly infinite.

Other differences might of course be pointed out, but the most remarkable

is that which we find in the character and style of their writings. Nothing

can be more distinct. In M. Jacobi's we meet perpetually with the traces

of patient and philosophical induction ; we observe a frequent reference to
particular cases and a most just and accurate perception of analogy. Abel's

are distinguished by great facility of manner, which seems to result from

his power of bringing different classes of mathematical ideas into relation

Wewith each other, and by the scientific character of his method.  meet in

his works with nothing tentative, with but little even that seems liiie artifice.

He delights in setting out with the most general conception of a problem,

and in introducing successively the various conditions and limitations which
it may require. The principle which he has laid down in a remarkable pas-

sage of an unfinished essay on equations seems always to have guided him

that a question should be so stated that it may be possible to answer it.
When so stated it contains, he remarks, the germ of its solution f

   * The fundamental formula of his transformation is incidentaDy mentioned in Legendre's
second work (Traite des Fouct., i. 61).

   t For instance, Is it possible to trisect an angle by the rule and compass ? The ques-
tion thus stated leads us to consider the general character of all problems soluble by the
methods of elementary geometry ; and following the suggestion thus given, we find that it
is to be answered in the negative. But if the last clause be omitted or neglected, we can
only proceed, as many persons have done, tentatively, i. e. by attempting actually to solve
the problem. If we fail, the question remains unanswered ; if we succeed, we do answer
it, but as it were only by accident.
               --;

--58 REPORT 1846.

   I do not presume to compare the merits of these two mathematicians.
The writings of both are admirable, and may serve to show that if ever the
modern method of analysis seems to be an en-n-eipia lather than a re^vq, it

does so, either because it has not been rightly used, or because it is not duly

understood.

   To obtain a general view of Abel's writings it may be remarked, that his
earliest researches related to the theory of equations. Of the ideas with
which he was then conversant he has made two principal applications. The

one is to the comparison of transcendents in the manner already described

the other to the solution of the equations presented by the problem of the

division of elliptic integrals. The second of these applications is contained

in the memoir published in the second volume of Crelle's Journal.

  He begins by introducing an inverse notation (u) corresponding to the

function denoted in the ' Fundamenta Nova' by sin am л, while/ (i<) and

AF (m) correspond respectively to cos am u and  am u. This notation

has the defect of appropriating three symbols which we cannot well spare.
On the other hand it is certainly more concise than M. Jacobi's.

   He then verifies the fundamental formulae for the addition of the new

functions, and goes on to show that they are doubly periodic *, He next

considers the expressions of <pna,, &c. in (p a, &c., and proceeds to prove

the important proposition that the equation of the problem of the division

of elliptic integrals of the first kind is always algebraically soluble.

In order to illustrate this, which is one of the most remarkable theorems

in the whole subject, it may be observed, that as any circular function of a

multiple arc can be algebraically expressed in terms of circular functions

Fwaof the simple arc, so may <pna,fna.,         be algebraically expressed by

means of (p a, fa, F a.

Conversely, as the determination (to take a particular function) of sin a in

terms of sin w a requires the solution of an algebraical equation, so does that

of ^ a in terms of ^ wa. The equation which presents itself in the former

case is, as we know, of the ni\\ or of the (2/i)th degree as n is odd or even.

But the equation for determining <p a, rises to the {n")th degree in the former

Wecase, and in the latter to the (2 n-)i\\.     may however confine ourselves

to the case in which n is a prime number ; since if it be composite the ar-

gument of the circular or elliptic function may first be divided by one of

the factors of n, and the result thus got by another, and so on. Thus setting

=aside the particular case of n 2, we shall have to consider, in order to

determine sin a or (p a, an algebraical equation of the nth or (n-)th degree

respectively.

In consequence of the periodicity of sin at, the roots of the equation in

sin a admit of being expressed in a transcendental form ; they are all in-

+ ----cluded in the formula sin | a             p), in which is integral, and which

therefore admits of only n different values.

   But elliptic functions are doubly periodic, and therefore the roots of the
equation in aip are expressible by a formula analogous to the one just written,
but which involves two indeterminate integers corresponding to the two

pperiodicities of the function, just as does to the single periodicity 2 iz*.

Giving all possible values to these integers, we get nP^ different values for

the formula.

   The question now is, how are we to pass from the transcendental repre-

sentation of these roots to their algebraical expression ? Or, in other words,

how are the relations among the roots deducible from the circumstance of
their being all included in the same formula, to be made available in effect-

ing the solution of the algebraical equation ?

   The answer to this question is to be found in the following principle : that

X, y, ' -z being the roots of an algebraical equation, then any of these quan-

tities may be expressed in terms of the coefficients of the equation. This
follows at once from the consideration that we shall have

              --%л = {%^+%y + ╖╖╖ +X^)'

jw, being the number of the roots x,y,...z. For the sum within the bracket

being a rational and symmetrical function of the roots, is necessarily expres-

sible in the coefficients of the equation, and the same is therefore of course

%true of X, or of any of the other quantities to which it is equal.

   If, therefore, by means of the relations which -we know to exist among the
roots of the equation to be solved we can establish the existence of a system
of such functions, %, %', %", &c., each of which retains the same value of
whichever root we suppose it to be a function ; and if by combining these

functions we can ultimately express x in terms of them, the equation is solved,
since each of these functions may be considered a known quantity.

   Such is the general idea of Abel's method of solution. The principle on

which it depends, namely, the expressibility of any unchangeable function %,
is one which is frequently met with in investigations similar to that of which

we are speaking. M. Gauss's solution of the binomial equation is founded

upon it.

   I have already remarked that an important simplification of Abel's process

was given by M. Jacobi. The result which M. Jacobi has stated without

demonstration may be proved by means of a theorem established by Abel in

the fourth volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 194.

   M. Jacobi shows the existence of a system of li^ functions v, yj, &c., by
combining which we can immediately express the values of the roots. In the

last of his ' Notices ' on elliptic functions we find, as has been said, the ex-

plicit determination of all the roots. The formula given for this purpose is,

like the former, undemonstrated, and I do not know whether any demonstra-

tion of it has as yet been published ; but from a note of M. Liouville, in a
recent volume of the ' Comptes Rendus,' we find that both he and M. Her-

mite have succeeded in proving it.

But in whatever manner the solution is effected it will always involve cer-

tain transcendental quantities, which are introduced in the expressions of the

relation subsisting between the different roots. The solution can therefore

be looked on as complete, only if we consider these to be known quantities.

They are the roots of a particular case of the equation to be solved. They

Werelate to the division of what are called the complete integrals.  may

therefore say that the general case is reduced to this particular one. But
                     ..

--60 REPORT 1846.

the latter is not, except under certain circumstances, soluble, though the

solution of the equation on which it depends can be reduced to the solution

of certain other equations of lower degrees.

   But for an infinity of particular values of the modulus, the case in ques-
tion is soluble by a method closely analogous to that used by M. Gauss for
the solution of binomial equations. Thus for all such values the problem of

the division of elliptic integrals is completely solved.

   The most remarkable of these cases corresponds to the geometrical pro-

blem of the division of the perimeter of the lemniscate. Abel discovered
that this division can always be effected by means of radicals, and further,
that it can be constructed by the rule and compass in the same cases (that

is for the same values of the divisor) as the division of the circumference of

a circle. Of this discovery we find Abel writing to M. Holmboe, " Ah qu'il

est magnifique! tu verras*."

   In order to form an idea of the nature of the difficulty which disappears
in the case of which we are speaking, let us suppose that we have to solve

the algebraical equation which is represented by the transcendental one
^ -- =(p (3 9) 0, in the same manner as the equation 'ix^ 3a?
                                                                is represented

   * It is right to mention that M. Libri has disputed Abel's title to the theory of the di-
vision of the lemniscate. I shall, however, not enter on the merits of the controversy which
arose on this point between him and M. Liouville. The reader will find it in the seventeenth
volume of the ' Comptes Rendus.' It appears that M. Gauss had himself recognised the
applicability of his method to the equation arising out of the problem of tlie division of the
perimeter of the lemniscate (vide Recherches Arithmetiques, з vii. p. 429. I quote from

the translation published at Pai-is in 1809).

              ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OF ANALYSIS.                                             61

  +On considering our table, we observe that it consists of 3 1 horizontal
--rows, each containing 3 1 terms, and that the arguments of the terms in

each row are connected by a simple relation ; that of the second being double

that of the first. If we were to replace 3 by any odd number p, we should
get an equation of thep'^ degree, whose roots, setting aside zero, might simi-

--larly be arranged in j╗ -f 1 rows, each of jo 1 terms, the arguments of the

terms in each row being as 1, 2, 3, &c.

 -- -- -- --Moreover, sin is rarionally expressible in sin , and generally sin ^

is so in sin      p, n and being any integers we please. So too are all

the terms in each horizontal row of our table, whether for the particular case
we have written down, or for that of any odd number, rationally expressible

in the first term.

  +Hence it may be shown that when the divisor 2 w 1 is a prime number,

an equation whose roots were the terms in any horizontal row could be solved

algebraically, by a method essentially the same as that of Gauss, just as we

                                             whose                  2 ^o tt

                        the  t╖y'p^e                roots  is  sin  2,, w         .

                                                                             1

struct this equation, i. e. to determine its coefficients, requires the solution of

an equation of the same degree as the number of horizontal rows, i. e. of the

+degree 2 л 2. And this equation is in general insoluble. The difficulty

we here encounter may be expressed in general language, by saying that

although we can pass from one root to another along each horizontal row,
yet we cannot pass from row to row.

   Our table, however, has the remarkable property, that supposing, as we

+may always do, 2 n 1 to be a prime number, all the roots are rationally

expressible in terms of any two not lying in the same row. This depends on

a property of the function <p, which it is very easy to demonstrate, and it is
intimately connected with the relations which exist among the terms of the
same row.

   If, then, which is the case for an infinite variety of values of the modulus,
we can express any root rationally in terras of another of a different row,

              2w 2w
2n+lsay in a  , all the roots become rational in terms of a                          . Moreover,
                                                                           2ra+l

it appears that not only are the roots all expressible in one, but they are so

in such a manner that the functional dependencies among them fulfil a cer-
tain simple condition, which, as Abel shows in a separate memoir (Crelle, iv.

p. 131 ; or Abel's works, i. p. 114), renders every equation, all whose roots
are rationally expressible in terms of one, algebraically soluble.

   To apply what has been said to the solution of the general equation for

are derived from the expressions of (p a, Sec. in terms of <p _, &c., by supposing

n to increase sine Ibnite, and are therefore analogous to the expression of

sin (p in terms of <p which we have already mentioned.
   The second contains the development of what had already been pointed

out Avith respect to the lemniscate, so far as relates to the division of its peri-

+meter by any prime number of the form 4wi !╖ In an interesting note

which M. Liouville communicated to the Institute in 1844, and which is

published in the eighth volume of his Journal, p. 507, he has proved gene-

rally that the division of the perimeter of this curve can always be effected

whether the divisor be a composite or prime number, real or complex (that

v --is, of the formp -t-  q, p and q being integers). In order to do this, it

was only requisite to follow m.m., the reasoning by which Abel has shown

that the equation which presents itself in the problem of the division of the

circumference of the circle is always resoluble. Thus, as M. Liouville has

remarked, his analysis is implicitly contained in Abel's.

This memoir also contains Abel's theorem for the transformation of elliptic

integrals of the first kind. It is equivalent to that of M. Jacobi ; nor is the

demonstration, though presented in quite a different form, altogether unlike

M. Jacobi's.

   Abel begins by considering the sum of a certain series of (p functions whose
arguments are in arithmetical progression. He shows that the sum of this

series is a rational function of its first term. If we call this sum (multiplied

by a certain constant) y, and the first term x, then y is such a function of x

as to satisfy the differential equation already mentioned, viz.

              dy 1 dx                                            r . ->

                   M""    V{l-x-){\-h'-x'')'

^(l-r/2)(l-A*i/░-j

mor rather an equation of equivalent form. In fact y is .m . the same func-

tion of X that it is in M. Jacobi's theorem. Thus the sum of the series of

elliiJtic functions is itself, when multiplied by a constant, a new elliptic func-

tion, having a new modulus, and whose argument bears a constant ratio to

that of the first term of the series. It appears also that for the sum of the

elliptic functions we may, duly altering the constant factor, substitute their

continued product. Thus, beside the algebraical expression of y, there are

two transcendental expressions of it, both of which are given by M. Jacobi

in the ' Fundamenta Nova.' At the close of the memoir Abel compares his

result with the one in Schumacher's Journal, No. 123, and mentions that he

had not met with the latter until his own paper was terminated.

19. In the 138th number of this journal Abel resumed the problem of

transformation, and treated it in a more general and direct manner than had

yet been done. This memoir appeared in June 1828. M. Jacobi, in a letter

to Legendre, has spoken in the highest terms of Abel's demonstration of the

formulee of transformation : he says, " EUe est au-dessus de mes eloges,
comme elle est au-dessus de mes travaux." An addition to this memoir,

establishing the real transformations by an independent method, appeared in

Number 148 of the same journal. These two papers are printed consecu-

tively in the first volume of Abel's Works, pp. 253, 275.
   In the first of these two remarkable essays Abel makes use of the perio-

dicity of the function f 9, or, as he here denotes it, A 9, to determine a priori

what rational function of x, y must be in order that the differential equation

              dy _        dx

may be satisfied. [I have altered his notation for the sake of uniformity.]

=Le rj/a; be the function sought, then considering ?/ \|/ .r as an equation de-

termining X in terms of y, he shows that certain relations necessarily exist
among its roots. Let A 6 be one of them and X 9' another, it Avill readily be

seen that we may put    =dS' dQ,

since each is equal to

                        dy

Hence

a. being the constant of integration, or, which is the same thing, being inde-

pendent of ?/. Hence A 6 being one root, every other root is necessarily of

+the form A (9 л)╖ Again, we see from hence that

which is to be true for all values of 9, and which therefore implies the exist-
ence of a series of equations, of which the type is

                 + - = +if/(A(9 A 1 л)) T^(A(9 ka.)),

+where k is an integer. Hence A (9 ^ a) is a root, whatever integral value

we may give to k. But the equation ij ^=^fx has but a finite number of

+roots, and therefore the values of the general expression A (8 A a) must

recur again and again. This consideration throws light on the nature of the

quantity a ; it must in all cases be an aliquot part of a period (simple or

compound) of the function A 9.

  +All the values of A (9 A a) got by giving different values to k are roots ;

but the converse is not necessarily true ; all the roots are not necessarily

included in this expression. But it is not difficult to perceive that all the

Kroots are included in a more general expression, viz. A(9 +A, a,^ +^2 ^i ╖ ╖ л*л)╗

and conversely, that all the values of this expression are roots. The number

=л is indeterminate : we may have formulas of the form y \|/ a:, in which n

is unity, others in which it is two, &c. ; but in all cases a is an aliquot part

of some period of A 9, and k is integral.

identically true equation ; whence, to determine y in 9, we have only to assign
a particular value to x, or to compare the coefficients of similar powers of it*л

   This then determines the form which the function y must necessarily be
of: the question which Abel goes on to discuss is this: Under what circum-
stances will a function of the form thus determined a priori be such a fuuc^
tion as we require? The character of the reasoning by which this question
is treated is similar to that of the method by which Abel had, in his second

tnemoir on elliptic functions, verified the form which, without assigning any

reason, he had there assumed for the function y.
   The second essay is singularly elegant. If (p^ denote the function inverse

function (p^, y does so too; that is 0;t9' remains unchanged when 9' increases

tinuous functions of the tivo quantities k and c. Hence both are determinate

mand if we wish c to remain indeterminate, we must either make             and q

assign a real value to it. When a is real we have

And it may be shown that this condition is not only necessary but sufficient.

Similar considerations apply to the case in which a is impossible.

   Simple as this view is, it leads to many consequences of great interest.

(an integer). Hence in multiplying an integral, the multiplier must be an

integer, if y is rational in x, except for particular values of c.
   In the paper of which we are speaking Abel has applied precisely similar

considerations to the case in which x and y are connected by any algebraical

equation.

Passing over one or two shorter papers, one of which has been already

referred to at p. 59, we come to a ' Precis ' of the theory of elliptic func-
tions, published in the fourth volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 236. The

work of which it was designed to be an extract was never written, and the

A' Precis ' itself is left unfinished.  general summary was prefixed to it, from

which we learn that the work was to be divided into two parts. In the first

elliptic integrals are considered irrespectively of the limits of integration, and

their moduli may have any values, real or imaginary. Abel proposes the

general problem of determining all the cases in which a linear relation may

exist among elliptic integrals and logarithmic and algebraical functions in

virtue of algebraical relations existing among the variables*.

   His first step is to apply his general method for the comparison of trans-
cendents to elliptic integrals, which may be done by what is called Abel's
theorem, in at least two different ways: the one, that of which he now makes

use ; the other, that which we have seen is applied to the case of four func-

tions by Legendre in his third Supplement.

   He next determines the most general form of which the integral of an al-

gebraical differential expression of any number of variables is capable, pro-
vided it can be expressed linearly by elliptic integrals and logarithmic and
algebraical functions. The result at which he arrives admits of many im-
portant applications. It is, that the integral in question may be expressed in
a form in which the sine of the amplitude of each elliptic integral and the

corresponding A, and also the algebraical and each logarithmic function are

all rational functions of the variables and of the differential coefficients of the

integral with respect to each.

   He proceeds by an interesting train of reasoning to establish the remark-
able conclusion, that the general problem which we are considering may

ultimately be reduced to that of the transformation of elliptic integrals of the
first kind. The problem of this transformation is then discussed, and by a

method essentially the same as that of which he had made use in his paper in
Schumacher's Journal. The appearance however of the two investigations is

dissimilar, because no reference is made to elliptic functions (as distinguished
from elliptic integrals) in the first part of the ' Precis.' The relations there-
fore which exist among the roots of 3/=4'a? are established by considerations

independent of the periodicity of elliptic functions ; though it is not difficult
to perceive that they were suggested by the results previously obtained by
means of that fundamental property. It is shown, that if the equation

y=.'ifx, where i^x is a rational function, satisfy the differential equation (A.),

then this equation, considered as determining x in terms of y, is always alge-
braically soluble. As the multiplication of elliptic integrals may be consi-

dered a case of transformation (that, namely, in which the modulus of the

transformed integral remains unchanged), this theorem may be looked on as

an extension of that which we have spoken of (p. 58) in giving an account of
Abel's first memoir on elliptic functions. The two theorems are proved by
the same kind of reasoning.

   The second part of the memoir was to have related to cases in which the
moduli are real and less than unity ; of this however only the summary exists.

* In the assumed relation, the amplitude, or rather the sine of the amplitude of each

elliptic integral, is to be one of the variables, and not a function of one or more of them.

Abel proposed to introduce three new functions, the first corresponding to

that which lie had previously designated by <p9*. He now denotes it by A 9.

The second and third functions are apparently what the second and third

kind of elliptic integrals respectively become, when, instead of x, we intro-

duce the new variable 9 ; x and 9 being of course connected by the equation

=x XS. The double periodicity of the function X and its other fundamental

properties having been established, it was his intention to proceed to more

profound researches. Some of his principal results are briefly stated. I may

mention one, that all the roots of the modular equation may be expressed

rationally in terms of two of themf.

One of the last paragraphs of the summary relates to functions very

nearly identical with those which M. Jacobi discusses at the close of the

' Fundamenta Nova,' and which he has designated by the symbols H and 0.

The second volume of Abel's collected works consists of papers not pub-

Twolished during his life.  or three of these relate to elliptic functions.

The longest contains a new and very general investigation for the reduction

of the general transcendent, whose differential is of the form  p    P  being,

with transformations with respect to the parameter of integrals of the third

kind.

   20. Having now given some account of the revolution which the disco-

veries of Abel and Jacobi produced in the theory of elliptic functions, I shall
mention some of the principal contributions Avhich have been made towards

the further development of the subject since the publication of the ' Funda-

menta Nova.' In Crelle's Journal, iv. p. 371, we find a paper by M. Jacobi,
entitled ' De Functionibus EUipticis Commentatio.' It contains, in the first
place, a development of the method of transforming elliptic integrals of the
second and third kind, and introduces a new transcendent Q,, which takes the
place of 0, with whicli it is closely connected. M. Jacobi proves that the

numerator and denominator of the value of 7/, mentioned above, and which

Uhave been denoted by and V, satisfy a single differential equation of the
Hthird order. The remainder of the paper relates to the properties of (vide

ante, note, p. 55). When this function is multiplied by a certain exponen-

tial factor it becomes a singly periodic function, and, which is very remark-

able, its period is equal to one of the single or composite periods of the el-

liptic function inverse to the integral of the first kind. By composite period
I mean the sum of multiples of the fundamental periods. The exponential

Hfactor being properly determined, its product by is equal to multiplied

by a constant. In considering this subject M. Jacobi is led to introduce the

idea of conjugate periods. These are periods by the combination of which
all the composite periods may be produced. It is obvious that the funda-
mental periods are conjugate periods; and there are, as may easily be

shown, an infinity of others.

   In the sixth volume of the same journal we find a second part of the

' Commentatio.' It contains a remarkable demonstration of the fundamental

this form he appears latterly to have adhered.

formed moduli themselves, or their foiu-th roots, i. e. in M. Jacobi's notation X or v. Vide

formulae of transformation of the odd orders founded on elementary proper-

ties of elliptic functions.

   In a historical point of view a notice by M. Jacobi in the eighth volume

of Crelle (p. 413) of the third volume of Legendre's 'Traite des Fonctions

EUiptiques' is interesting. It was here, I believe, that M. Jacobi first pro-

posed the name of Abelian integrals for the higher transcendents, which we

shall shortly have occasion to consider. After some account of the contents

of Legendre's supplements, the first two of which contain the greater part of
M. Jacobi's earlier researches, he goes on to generalise a remarkable reduc-

tion given by Legendre at the close of his work.
   21. I turn to one of the very few contributions which English mathema-

ticians have made to the subject of this report, namely, to a paper by Mr.

Ivory, which appeared in the Phil. Trans, for 1831. His design is to give

in a simple form M. Jacobi's theorem for transformation. The demonstra-

tion is essentially the same as that in the ' Fundamenta Nova.' But Mr.

= -- U VIvory does not set out with assuming y
                                         ., and being integral func-

tions of a;, but with assuming it equal to the continued product of a number
of elliptic functions (whose arguments are in arithmetical progression), mul-
tiplied by a constant factoi". This is one of M. Jacobi's transcendental ex-
pressions for y, and the two assumptions are therefore perfectly equivalent
in the transformations of odd orders ; but in those of even orders, or where
the continued product consists of an even number of factors, Mr. Ivory's
amounts to making y equal to an irrational function of x. Transformations
by irrational substitutions, though long the only kind known (since Lagrange's
belongs to this class), had not of late been considered in detail. Abel
indeed remarked in the beginning of the general investigation contained in
Schumacher's Journal (No. 138), that the existence of an irrational trans-
formation implied that of a rational one leading to an integral with the same

modulus as the other. He was, therefore, in seeking for the most general

modular transformation, exempted from considering irrational substitutions
but in a historical point of view it is interesting to see the connection between
Lagrange's transformation and those which have been more recently disco-
vered*.

68 REPORT-- 1846.

The question presents itself, what is the connection between the irrational

transformation (that of which Lagrange's is a particular case) and the rational

transformation of even orders ? Perhaps the simplest answer to it (though

every question of the kind is included in the general investigations contained

in Abel's ' Precis') is found in a paper by M. Sanio in the fourteenth volume

of Crelle's Journal, p. 1. The aim of this paper is to develope more fully
than Mr. Ivory has done the theory of transformations of even orders, and
particularly of the irrational transformations, which M. Sanio considers more

truly analogous to the rational transformations of odd orders than the rational

transformations of even orders ; and also to discuss the multiplication of

elliptic integrals by even numbers, a subject intimately connected with the

Weother.  have already mentioned the existence of what are called com-

plementary transformations, each of which may be derived from the other

by an irrational substitution, by which two new variables are introduced. In

the case of transformations of odd orders, the original transformation and the

complementary one are both rational, and are both included in the general

formula given by M. Jacobi's theorem ; but to the rational transformation of

any even order corresponds as its complement the irrational transformation

of the same order. This remark, which, as far as I am aware, had not before

been made, sets the subject in a clear light*.

22. In the twelfth volume of Crelle's Journal (p. 173), Dr. Guetzlaff has

investigated the modular equation of transformations of the seventh order : it

is, as we know from the general theory, of the eighth degree, and presents

itself in a very remarkable foi'm, which closely resembles that in which

M. Jacobi, at p. 68 of the ' Fundamenta Nova,' has put the modular equa-

tion for the third order. Dr. Sohncke has given, at p. 178 of the same vo-

lume, modular equations of the eleventh, thirteenth and seventeenth orders,

none of which apparently can be reduced to so elegant a form as those of

the third and seventh. Possibly the transformation of the thirty-first order

might admit of a corresponding reduction. The whole subject of modular

equations is full of interest. Dr. Sohncke has demonstrated his results in a

subsequent volume of the Journal (xvi. 97).

In the fourteenth volume of Crelle's Journal there is a paper by Dr. Gu-

dermann on methods of calculating and reducing integrals of the third kind.

I have already quoted from this paper the expression of the opinion of its

learned author, that it is impossible to express the value of integrals of the

circular species in terms of functions of two arguments. If this be so, it is

which is M. Gauss's, and is termed in M. Jacobi's nomenclature the rational transformation

of the second order. It satisfies the equation

                   ^y                                    =(i+c)       ^^ ^

impossible to tabulate such integrals, and therefore our course is to devise
series more or less convenient for determining their values when any pro-
blem, e.g. that of the motion of a rigid body, to which Dr. Gudermann espe-
cially refers, requires us to do so. The formation of such series is accordingly
the aim of this memoir, which contains some remarkably elegant formulae
one of which connects three integrals of the third kind with three of the

second.

   In the sixteenth and seventeenth volumes of the same Journal, Dr. Guder-
mann has given some series for the development of elliptic integrals ; and he
has since published in the same Journal a systematic treatise on the theory
of modular functions and modular integrals, these designations being used to
denote the transcendents more generally called elliptic. The point of view
from which he considers the subject has been already indicated (vide supra,
p. 36). In a systematic treatise there is of course a great deal that does not
profess to be original, and it is not always easy to discover the portions
which are so. Dr. Gudermann's earlier researches are embodied and deve-
loped in his larger work ; and in some of the latter chapters (XXIII. 329, &c.)
we find some interesting remarks on the forms assumed by the general trans-
cendent when the biquadratic polynomial in the denominator has four real
roots. Dr. Gudermann points out the existence of a species of correlation

between pairs of values of the variable.
   23. The development of the elliptic function (p in the form of a continued

product may be applied to establish formulae of transformation. This mode
of investigating such formulae was made use of by Abel in his second paper
in Schumacher's Journal, No. 148, which we have already noticed ; and a
corresponding method is mentioned by M. Jacobi in one of the cursory no-

tices of his researches which he inserted in the early volumes of Crelle's
Journal. Mr. Cayley, in the Philosophical Magazine for 1843, has pur-
sued a similar course. Another and very remarkable application of the same
kind of development consists in taking it as the definition of the function ^,
and deducing from hence its other properties. It has been remarked that

the continued products of Abel and M. Jacobi are derived from considera-

tions which, although cognate, are yet distinct ; those of the latter being

singly infinite, while Abel's fundamental developments consist of the product
of an infinite number of factors, each of which in its turn consists of an in-
finite number of simple factors. Thus w^e can have two very dissimilar de-

finitions of the function (p by means of continued products. M. Cauchy,
who has investigated the theory of what he has termed reciprocal factorials,

 that is, of continued products of the form

{{l+x){\+tx)  ){{\ + tx-^)(\ ^f^x-^)  },

which is immediately connected with M. Jacobi's developments, has accord-

ingly set out from the singly infinite system of products, and has deduced
from hence the fundamental properties of elliptic functions (Comptes Rendus,

xvii. p. 825).

   Mr. Cayley, on the other hand, has made use of Abel's doubly infinite
products, and has shown that the functions defined by means of them satisfy
the fundamental formulae mentioned in the note at page 52, which, as these

equations furnish a suflScient definition of the elliptic functions, is equivalent

Heto showing that the continued products are in reality elliptic functions.

has therefore effected for Abel's developments that which M. Cauchy had
done for M. Jacobi's. Mr. Cayley's paper appeared in the fourth volume of
the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, but he has since published a trans-

lation of it with modifications in the tenth volume of Liouville's. On the

same subject we may mention a paper by M. Eisenstein (Crelle's Journal,

xxvii. 285).

   24. M. Liouville has in several memoirs investigated the conditions under

which the integral of an algebraical function can be expressed in an alge-
braical, or, more generally, in a finite form. This investigation is of the
same character as that which occurs in the beginning of Abel's last published
memoir on elliptic functions (vide supra, p. 65). But while Abel's re-

searches are more general than M. Liouville's, the latter has arrived at a
result more fundamental, if such an expression may be used, than any of

which Abel has left a demonstration.

   He has shown that if ?/ be an algebraical function of x, such thatjydx

may be expressed as an explicit finite function of x, we must have

            =ri/dx t -\- Alogu + B\ogv +...+ Clog 10,

C wA, B, . . . being constant, and t, u,v, . . . algebraical functions of x.

The theorem established by Abel in the memoir referred to includes as a

particular case the following proposition, that if

             -- A ++ +Cydx t-\- log M B log V . . . C log w,

then t,u.,v, . . .w may all be reduced to rational functions of x and y.

Combining these two results, it appears that \ijydx be expressible as au

explicit finite function of x, its expression must be of the form

              +< AlogM -f- Blogzj -f . . .+ Clogw,

where t, u,v,...w are rational functions of x and y, or rather that its ex-

pression must be reducible to this form*.
   After establishing these results in the memoir (that on elliptic transcen-

dents of the first and second kinds), which will be found in the twenty-third

cahier of the ' Journal de I'Ecole Polytechnique,' p. 37, M. Liouville sup-

---- Rposes y to be of the form p , where P and are integral polynomials, and
              'vR ^p
hence deduces the general form in which the integral /  d x may neces-

sarily be put, provided it admit of expression as an explicit finite function of j:.

              /╗p
He shows from hence that if /-  d x cannot be expressed by an alge-

braical function of x, it cannot be expressed by any explicit finite function

of it, and finally demonstrates that an elliptic integral, either of the first or

second kind, is not expressible as an explicit finite function of its variable.

In a previous memoir inserted in the preceding cahier, M. Liouville

proved the simpler proposition, that elliptic integrals of the first and second

kinds are not expressible as explicit algebraical functions of their variable

(Journal de I'Ecole Polytechnique, t. xiv. p. 137). His attention appears to

have been directed to this class of reseai'ches by a passage of Laplace's

' Theory of Probabilities,' in which the illustrious author, after indicating the

fundamental, and, so to speak, ineffaceable distinctions between different

classes of functions, states that he had succeeded in showing that the inte-

----gral / ,  is not expressible as a finite function, explicit or

implicit, of x. Laplace however did not publish his demonstration.

   * An equivalent theorem is stated by Abel in his letter to Legendre for implicit as well

as explicit functions (Crelle's Journal, vi.).

ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OF ANALYSIS.  /I

   In his own Journal (v. 34 and 441), M. Liouville has since shown that

elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds, considered as functions of the

modulus, cannot be expressed in finite terms.
   25. In the eighteenth volume of the 'ComptesRendus'(Liouville's Journal,

ix. 333), we find in a communication from M. Hermite, of which we shall
shortly have occasion to speak more fully, a remarkable demonstration of

Jacobi's theorem. It is stated for the case of the first real transformation,
but might of course be rendered general. This demonstration depends es-
sentially on the principle already mentioned (p. 59), that any rational func-
tion of a root of an algebraical equation which has the same value for every

root of the equation is rationally expressible in the coefficients. The equa-
tion to which this principle is applied is that to which we have so often re-

= --ferred, viz. y  , considered as an equation to determine x in terms of y,

and by means of it, M. Hermite shows at once that a certain rational func-

tion of X is also a rational function of y, the form of which is subsequently

determined.

   M. Hermite goes on to prove other theorems relating to elliptic functions.
   As elliptic functions are doubly periodic, we may determine certain of
their properties by considering to what conditions doubly periodic functions
must be subject. This view is mentioned by M. Liouville in a verbal com-
munication to the Institute (Comptes Rendus, t. xix.). He states that he

had found that a doubly periodic function which is not an absolute constant
and has but one value for each value of its variable must be, for certain va-
lues of it, infinite ; that from hence the known properties of elliptic func-
tions are easily deduced ; and that by means of this principle he had suc-
ceeded in proving the expressions of the roots of the equation for the division

of an elliptic integral of the first kind, which M. Jacobi had given without
demonstration in Crelle's Journal*. I am not aware that any development
of M. Liouville's view has as yet appeared.

   In the recent numbers of Crelle's Journal there are many papers by M.
Eisenstein on different points in the theory of elliptic functions. Among
these I may mention one which contains a very ingenious proof of the fun-

damental formula for the addition of two functions, derived from the differ-
ential equation of the second order, which each function must satisfy.

    Other contributions to the theory of elliptic functions might be mentioned
some of these, not here noticed, are referred to in the index which will be

found at the end of this report. But in general it may be remarked that the

form which the subject has assumed, in consequence of the discoveries of

Abel and M. Jacobi, is that which it will probably always retain, however
our knowledge of particular parts of it may increase. What has since been

effected relates for the most part to matters of detail, of which, however im-
portant they may be, it is difficult or impossible to give an intelligible ac-

count.

     26. It does not fall within the design of this report to consider the various

applications which have been made of the theory of elliptic functions ; but
I shall briefly mention some of the geometrical interpretations, if the expres-
sion may so be used, which mathematicians have given to the analytical re-

sults of the theory.

    The lemniscate has, as is Avell known, the property that its arcs may be

represented by an elliptic integral of the first kind, the modulus of which is

--7=.. The problem of the division of its perimeter is accordingly a geome-

trical interpretation of that of the division of the complete integral, and was
considered by mathematicians at a time when the theory of elliptic func-
tions was almost wholly undeveloped. Besides Fagnani, whose researches
with respect to the lemniscate have been already noticed, we may mention
those of Euler, who however did not succeed in obtaining a solution of the
problem. Legendre, who seems to have attached considerable importance

to geometrical illustrations of his analytical results, assigned the equation of
a curve of the sixth order, whose arcs measured from a fixed point represent

the sum of any elliptic integral of the first kind and an algebraical expression.
He showed also that an arc of the curve might be assigned equal to the el-
liptic integral, but in order to this both extremities of the arc must be con-
sidered variable, so that in effect the integral is represented by the difference
of two arcs measured from a fixed point (Traite des Fonctions Elliptiques,

i. p. 36).

   M. Serret, in a note presented to the Institute in 1843 (Liouville's Journal,
viii. 14-5), has proved a beautiful theorem, viz. that the sum and difference of
the two unequal arcs, intercepted by lines drawn from the centre of Cassini's

ellipse to cut the curve, are each equal to an elliptic integral of the first
kind, and that the moduli of the two integrals are complementary. In the

lemniscate, which is a case of Cassini's ellipse, one of these arcs disappears,

and the moduli of the two integrals are equal, each being the sine of half a

right angle. So that M. Serret's theorem is an extension of the known pro-

perty of the lemniscate.

M. Serret has since considered the subject of the representation of elliptic

and hyper-elliptic arcs in a very general manner. His memoir, which was

presented to the Institute and ordered to be published in the ' Savans

Etrangers,' appears in Liouville's Journal, x. 257. He had remarked that

the rectangular coordinates of the lemniscate are rationally expressible in

terms of the argument of the elliptic integral which represents the arc,

{x, y and Z being real and rational functions of 3), the lemniscate will afford

us one solution of it ; and every other solution will correspond to some curve
whose arc is expressible by an elliptic or hyper-elliptic integral. Of this in-

determinate equation M. Serret discusses a particular case. He succeeds in

solving it by a most ingenious method, which is applicable to the general
equation, and shows from hence that there are an infinity of curves, the arcs
of which represent elliptic integrals of the first kind. M. Serret's researches
however have not led him to a geometrical representation by means of an
algebraical curve of any integral of the first kind, though his results are ge-

neralised in a note appended to his memoir by M. Liouville. In order that

the curve may be algebraical, it is necessary and sufficient, as M. Liouville

has remarked, that the square of the modulus of the integral should be ra-

tional, and less than unity.

   In a subsequent memoir (Liouville's Journal, x. 351) he has very much
simplified the analytical part of his researches, and in the same Journal
(x.421) has proved some remarkable properties of one class of what maybe
called elliptic curves. In the fourth number of the Cambridge and Dublin
Mathematical Journal (p. 187), M. Serret has developed this part of the sub-
ject, and has also given a general sketch of his previous papers. M. Liou-
ville (Comptes Rendus, xxi. 1255, or his Journal, x. 456) has given a very
elegant investigation of an analytical theorem established by M. Serret.

   In the fourteentli volume of Crelle's Journal (p. 217), M. Gudermann has

considered the rectification of the curve called the spherical ellipse, which is
one of a class of curves formed by the intersection of a cone of the second

order with a sphere. He has shown that its arcs represent an elliptic integral

of the third kind.

   In the ninth volume of Liouville's Journal (p. 155), Mr. W. Roberts proves

that a cone of the second order, whose vertex lies on the surface of a sphere,
and one of whose external axes passes through the centre, intersects the

sphere in a curve whose arcs will, according to circumstances, represent any

elliptic integral of the third kind and of the circular species ; or any elliptic

integral of the same kind and of the logarithmic species, provided the angle
of the modulus is less than half a right angle ; or (subject to the same con-
dition) any elliptic integral of the first kind ; or lastly, by a suitable modifi-
cation, any elliptic integral of the second kind. The cases here excepted
may be avoided by introducing known transformations. The cases in which
the arcs represent elliptic integrals of the first kind, Mr. Roberts has pre-

viously mentioned in the eighth volume of Liouville's Journal (p. 263). He

has since given in the same Journal (x. 297), a general investigation of the

subject, in which it is supposed that the vertex of the cone may have any
position we please. M. Verhulst has represented the three kinds of elliptic
integrals by means of sectorial areas of certain curves, and the function T by

the volume of a certain solid. It is manifest, however, that it is incom-
parably easier to do this than to represent these transcendents by means of
the arcs of curves.

   Beside one or two other papers I may mention a tract by the Abbe Tor-

tolini, on the geometrical representation of elliptic integrals of the second and
third kinds. This tract, however, I have not seen.

   Lagrange long since proved (vide Theorie des Fonctions Analytiques,
p. 85), that by means of a spherical triangle a geometrical representation of
the addition of elliptic integrals of the first kind may easily be obtained, and
that hence by a series of such triangles we are enabled to represent the mul-
tiplication as well as the addition of these integrals.

    M.Jacobi has given (Crelle's Journal, iii. p. 376, or vide Liouville's Journal,
X. p. 435) a geometrical construction for the addition and multiplication of
elliptic integrals of the first kind. It is founded on the properties of an irre-
gular polygon inscribed in a circle, and the sides of which touch one or more
other circles. It is to be remarked that Legendre, in giving an account cJf
this construction in one of the supplements to his last work, has only con-
sidered its application to multiplication and not to addition, and has been
followed in this respect by M. Verhulst, whose treatise on elliptic functions

has been already mentioned. In consequence of this, M. Chasles was led to
believe that until the publication of his own researches, no construction for
addition excepting that of Lagrange was known. But he has recently
--74 REPORT 1846.

(Comptes Rendus, January 1846) pointed out the error into which he had

fallen.

   27. In the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy (ix. p. 151), Dr.

Brinkley gave a geometrical demonstration of Fagnani's theorem with respect
to elliptic arcs, and in the sixteenth volume of the same Transactions (p. 76),

we find Landen's theorem proved geometrically by Professor MacCullagh.
   M. Chasles has considered the subject of the comparison of elliptic arcs

by geometrical methods, and with great success. His fundam^tal propo-
sition may be said to be, that if from any two points of an ellipse we draw
two pairs of tangents to any confocal ellipse, the difference of the two arcs of
the latter respectively intercepted by each pair of tangents is rectifiable.
Or, what in effect is the same thing, if we fasten a string at two points in
the circumference of an ellipse, and suppose a ring to move along the string,
keeping it stretched, and winding it on and off the arc which lies between its
two extremities, the ring will trace out a portion of an ellipse confocal to the
former. If for the first ellipse we substitute an hyperbola confocal with the
second, the sum of the arcs will be constant. From hence a series of theo-
rems is deduced, remarkable not only for their elegance, but also for the
facility with which they are obtained. They furnish constructions for the
addition and multiplication of elliptic integrals. The whole of this investi-
gation, of which an account is given in the 'Comptes Rendus' (vol. xvii.
p. 838, and vol. xix. p. 1239), shows, like others of M. Chasles's, how much
is lost in treating geometrical questions by an exclusive adherence to what
may be called the method of co-ordination. Invaluable as this method is,
it yet often introduces considerations foreign to the problem to which it is

applied *.

                                                                             III.

   28. The first outline of a detailed theory of the higher transcendents was
given by Legendre in the third supplement to his ' Traite des Fonctions

Elliptiques.' He proposes to classify the transcendents comprised in the

general formula

                                           f{x)dx

                           J(ixx -- a) Vi^ X

according to the degree of the polynomial x, the first class being that in
                                                                                                                                                    (f

which the index of this degree is three or four ; the second that in which it
is five or six, and so on. The first class therefore consists of elliptic inte-
grals ; all the others may be designated as ultra-elliptic. This epithet, how-
ever, which was proposed by Legendre, has not been so generally used as

hyper-elliptic, which was, I believe, first used by M. Jacobi. M. Jacobi, how-

ever, has proposed to call the higher transcendents Abelian integrals.

   The principle of Legendre's classification is to be found in the minimum
number of integrals to which the sum of any number of them can be reduced.
As A\e know, this number is unity in the case of elliptic integrals, and by
Abel's theorem we find that it is two in the first class of the higher trans-
cendents, three in the next, and so on.

    Following the analogy of elliptic integrals, Legendre proposed to recognise
three canonical forms in each class of hyper-elliptic integrals, and thus to
divide it into three orders. The sura of any number of functions of the first

lines of curvature and shortest lines on an ellipsoid. The latter has recently engaged the

MacCullagh and M. Roberts may be particularly mentioned.

kind will, when the required conditions are satisfied, be equal to a constant

that of any number of the second and third kinds respectively will, under

similar conditions, be equal to an algebraical or logarithmic function.

Much the greater part of the remainder of the supplement consists of a

discussion of the particular transcendents

It contains a multitude of numerical calculations, and if the writer's age be
considered (he was then almost eighty), is a very remarkable production.
By means of the numerical calculations he recognised, as it were empirically,
the values to be assigned in different cases to the above-mentioned constant
what these values ought to be, he did not attempt to determine a priori.

   At the close of the supplement we find a remarkable reduction of an inte-
gral, apparently of a higher order to elliptic integrals. The method em-
ployed has been generalised by M. Jacobi, in a notice of Legendre's ' Sup-
plements,' inserted in the eighth volume of Crelle's Journal (p. 413).

   29. In the ninth volume of Crelle's Journal (p. 394'), we find a most im-
portant paper by M. Jacobi (Considerationes Generales, &c.), which may
be said to have determined the direction in which the researches of analysts

in the theory of algebraical integrals were to proceed.
   The writer proposes two questions, both suggested by the cases of trigo-

nometrical and elliptic functions. First, as in these cases we consider certain
functions to which circular and elliptic integrals are respectively inverse, and
which are such that functions of the sum of two arguments are algebraically
expressible in terms of functions of the simple arguments, what are the cor-

responding functions to which the hyper-elliptic or Abelian integrals are
inverse, and how by means of them can Abel's theorem be stated ?

   Secondly, as in the same cases we obtain algebraical integrals of differen-
tial equations, whose variables are separated, but which nevertheless can only
be directly integrated by means of transcendents *, what are the differential
equations of which Abel's theorem gives us algebraical integrals? These
two questions are, it is obvious, intimately connected.

   M. Jacobi first takes the particular case in which the polynomial under the
radical is of the fifth or sixth degree. If we call this polynomial X, it follows

from Abel's theorem, that if

                                         pxdx

                             and, ^,a:=/;^7=,

we shall have the equations

          = + +(p a -|- ^ 6
                             9 a;  ? 3/     ^^ a;' -f- y',

where a and h are given as algebraical functions of the independent quan-

tities x, y, x^,y^.                         + =^x' (py' M'

Each term of tliis differential equation is a differential of a transcendent function sin~'x or

8in~V
            :;

--76 REPORT 1846.

Then x and y are both given as functions of u and v.     We may therefore

put                          =y >^ (m ^') ;

             =x k(ti v),

and similarly,               =y^ X, (m' i>')

            =x' X (m' ?;'),

and as                    + = +^ л (p 6 m ?л'
                          + = +^, a ^ 6 z; ^'j

M'e shall have            = + +a X (?^ m', л л╖)

+ + +Hence the functions X (m ?f ', v ╖{- v^) and X, (2^ u^, v ?;') are expres-

sible as algebraical functions oi \{uv), X, {uv), X (m" w'), X, (m' r').
   These then are functions to which the integrals are in a certain sense in-

verse, and which have the same fundamental property as circular and elliptic

functions.

In the general case of Abel's theorem, we introduce (when the degree of
m m -- w --the polynomial is 2 or 2 1 ), 1 functions analogous to X, each
m --being a function of
                          1 variables. These functions will, it may easily be

shown, have the fundamental property just pointed out for the case in which

m is equal to three.

   Again, the diiferential equations of which Abel's theorem gives us alge-

Xbraical integrals, are, if the degree of the polynomial be five or six, the

following

                          dx dy dz

                          X dx ydy z dz

m m --and generally, if the degree of the polynomial be 2 or 2  1, there are
m -- --1 such equations, the numerators of the last containing the (>╗ 2)th

power of the variables.

M. Jacobi concludes by suggesting as a problem the direct integration of

these differential equations, so as to obtain a proof of Abel's theorem cor-

responding to that which Lagrange gave of Euler's (vide ante, p. 36).

   30. Another important paper by M. Jacobi is that which is entitled ' De

Functionibus duarum Variabilium quadrupliciter periodicis, etc' (Crelle, xiii.

p. 55). It is here shown that a periodic function of one variable cannot

have two distinct real periods. In the case of a circular function, though we

have for all values of x

                          = wsin a;
                             2sin (a; -I-       ir)

                             = 2 лsin (a; -|-   ir),

m mand n being any integers, yet 2 if and 2 71 it do not constitute two

distinct periods, since each is merely a multiple of 2 if, which is the funda-
mental period of the function. But if we had for all the values of x

                     f(x)=f{x + a}=f{x+^},

we should also have

                          / +m=/(*(^)

ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OF ANALYSIS.                                                                              77

may, provided a and j3 are incommensurable, which is implied in their being
distinct periods, be made less than any assignable quantity, so that we may

put

                               fx =f{x + г),

where г is indefinitely small, and this manifestly is an inadmissible result.
Accordingly we see that one at least of the periods of elliptic functions is

necessarily imaginary.
    Again, similar reasoning shows that in a triply periodic function, that is

in one in which we have

/(^)=/{a.+╗i(a+/3A/::n") + ?л'(a' + /3'V'^) + ╗╗"(a" + ^"'^~l)}

for every value of x, m, m', m" being any integers, and in which the three

periods a+ ^V^--i, &c. are distinct, we can make

                                f{x)=f{x + e)

by assigning suitable values to m, m', m" ; s being as before less than any
assignable quantity. Hence as this result is inadmissible, it follows that
there is no such thing as a triply periodic function. Whenever therefore a
function appears to have three periods they are in reality not distinct, and
so a fortiori when it appears to have more than three. But now we come to
a difficulty. For M. Jacobi proceeds to show that if we consider a function

-^of one variable inverse to the Abelian integral / ^                                                            X, being of

the sixth degree in x, this function has four distinct and irreducible periods.

His conclusion is that we cannot consider the amplitude of this integral as

an analytical function of the integral itself. In the present state of our
knowledge, this conclusion, though seemingly forced on us by[the impossibi-
lity of recognising the existence of a quadruply periodic function of one va-
riable, is not, 1 think, at all satisfactory. The functional dependence, the

existence of which we are obliged to deny, may be expressed by a differen-
tial equation of the second order; and therefore it would seem that the
commonly received opinion that every differential equation of two variables

has a primitive, or expresses a functional relation between its variables, must

be abandoned, unless some other mode of escaping from the difficulty is dis-
covered. It is probable that some simple consideration, rather of a metaphy-
sical than an analytical character, may hereafter enable us to form a con-
sistent and satisfactory view of the question, and this I believe I may say is
the opinion of M. Jacobi himself. The same difficulty meets us in all the
Abelian integrals : as in the case of those of Legendre's first class, namely

Xwhere is of the fifth or sixth degree, so also generally, the inverse function

has more than its due number of periodicities.
   Abel, in a short paper in the second volume of his works, p. 51, has in

effect proved the multiple periodicity of the functions which are inverse to
the integrals to which his theorem relates. The difficulty to which this gives

rise did not strike him, or was perhaps reserved for another occasion.

   M. Jacobi next proves that his inverse functions of two variables are

quadruply periodic, but that quadruple periodicity for functions of two va-

riables is nowise inadmissible.

  A difficulty however seems to present itself, which is suggested by M.

Eisenstein in Crelle's Journal, viz. that if for each value of the amplitude

                           /*d X                                                             .  has  an  mfimty  off> magni╖tudJes

of u is determined by it *.

   31. Two divisions of the theory of the higher transcendents here suggest

themselves, which are apparently less intimately connected than the corre-
sponding divisions in the theory of elliptic functions, viz. the reduction and

transformation of the integrals themselves, and the theory of the inverse

functions.

   But before considering these I shall give some account of what has been
done in fulfilment of the suggestion made by M. Jacobi at the close of

the * Considerationes Generales.' Mathematicians have succeeded in effect-

ing the integration of the system of differential equations to the consideration

of which we are led by Abel's theorem, and which is commonly designated
by German mathematicians as the " Jacobische system ; " its existence and
its integrability having been first pointed out by M. Jacobi.

   In Crelle's Journal (xxiii. 354), M. Richelot, after modifying the form in

which Lagrange's celebrated integration of the differential equation of

elliptic integrals is generally presented, extended a similar method to the
system of two differential equations which occurs when we consider the

Abelian transcendents of the first class. He thus obtains one algebraical

integral of the system. In the case of Lagrange's equation one integral is

all we want ; but in that which M. Richelot here discusses we require
two. Now if in the former case we replace each of the variables by its reci-
procal, we obtain a new differential equation of the same form as the original
one, and integrable therefore in the same manner ; and if in its integral we
again replace each new variable by its reciprocal, that is by the original va-
riable, we thus, as it is not difficult to see, get the integral of the original

equation in a different form. That the two forms are in effect coincident

may be verified a postenori. But the same substitutions being made in M.
Richelot's equations, which are of course those we have already mentioned

at p. 76, the first of them becomes similar in form to the second, and vice
versd the second to the first. Thus the system remains similar to itself; and
if in the algebraical integral we obtain of it we again replace the new vari-
ables by their reciprocals, Ave fall on a new algebraical integral of the original

system ; this integral being, which is remarkable, independent of that pre-

viously got. Thus the system of two equations is completely integrated.

Extending his method to the general system of any number of equations,

M. Richelot obtains for each two integrals, but of course these are not all

that we want. At the conclusion of his memoir M. Richelot derives from

Abel's theorem the algebraical integrals of the " Jacobische system."

Though in this memoir M. Richelot only obtained by direct integration
m --two of the
                1 algebraical integrals of the " Jacobische system," yet he put

the problem of its complete integration into a convenient and symmetrical
m m --form. As there are variables and
                                        1 relations among them, we may

suppose each to be a function of an independent variable t, Lagrange, as

we know, in integrating the equation

                dx dy

   * The difficulty here mentioned may perhaps be met by saying that the value of ^.r de-
                               r^ dx

termined by the integral / ~'7^ is necessarily determinate, and so likewise is that of л.

That considerations connected vrith the conception of a function inverse to ^ a? make the
latter quantity appear indeterminate is undoubtedly a difficulty ; but it is, so to speak, a
difficulty collateral to M. Jacobi's theory, and therefore need not prevent our accepting it.

   Nothing is easier than to generalise this result. For instance, the " Ja-
cobische system " of two equations is

                              dx dy dz

                              xdx ydy zdz

  Now if F M =s have x, y, z for its roots, the two preceding equations

may, in virtue of a very well-known theorem, be replaced by the three follow-

In the twenty-fifth volume of Crelle's Journal M. Richelot resumed the

subject of his former paper, and discussed it in a very interesting memoir.

This fundamental or principal result may be said to be a generalisation of

M. Jacobi's. It is that in the function

               ^ - - -{(ix,                             z)}
                                 oc) (i^  y) . . . (fx

/* may have any value whatever. The resulting differential equation,

though rather more complicated than when, with M. Jacobi, we suppose ju<
= Wea root offee 0, is still very readily integrable.
                                                             have thus an indefi-

nite number of algebraical integrals, since the quantity jw, is arbitrary, but
m --of course not more than
                                 1 of them are independent.

   In the same volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 178, there is a curious paper by
Dr. Hoedenkamp, in which the algebraical integrals of Jacobi's system are

for the case of a polynomial of the fifth degree under the radical deduced

from geometrical considerations. It is shown that in a system of curvilinear

coordinates (those of which MM. Lame and Liouville have made so much

use), the equations of the system are the differential equations given by the

Calculus of Variations for the shortest line between two points. Conse-

quently the finite equations of a straight line are the integrals sought. This

very ingenious consideration is aft-^rwards generalised.

   32. In the twelfth volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 181, M. Richelot has
considered the Abelian integral of the first class. The principal result at

which he arrives is, that the only rational transformation by means of which

such an integral may be changed into one of similar form is linear in both

the variables which it involves. By means of this substitution, he transforms,

under certain conditions, the integral in question into a form analogous to

the standard forms of elliptic integrals. The subject of the division of hyper-

elliptic integrals of each class into three genera is also considered, and the

same principle of classification as Legendre's is made use of. The paper

concludes by pointing out an error which Legendre committed in the appli-

cation of his principle. Legendre had thought that the formula of summa-

--tion given by Abel's theorem for integrals of the form / , could not

involve a logarithmic function. Thus these integrals would belong to the
first or second kind, according to the value of the index e, and of X the degree
of <p X. But in reality, though the integrals in question are of the first kind
(that is, they admit of summation without introducing either an algebraical
or logaritiimic function) if e be less than a certain limit, yet if it be not so
their formula of summation will in general involve both algebraical and loga-
                        ;;

lithmic functions. Either may, under certain conditions as to the form of
(px, disappear, but while (p j? is merely known as the polynomial of the Ath

degree, we cannot decide whether the integral is to be referred to the second

or third kind.

   I may mention here a very elegant result due to M. Jacobi. It appears in
the thirtieth volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 121, and is a generalisation of the
fundamental formula for the addition of elliptic arcs. With a slight modifi-
cation it may be thus stated. li x(p involve only even powers of x, the

highest being j?^", then the sum of the integrals /  ,  is equal to

 the product of their arguments, that is of the different quantities denoted by
 the symbol x. In this case then the logarithmic function disappears, and

  the integral belongs to the second kind.

    In the twenty-ninth volume of Crelle's Journal there is a paper by M.
 Richelot on a question connected with hyper-elliptic integrals. The reader
 will find in it a good many fully-developed results, which may be considered
 as particular cases of Abel's theorem. They illustrate the learned author's

  criticism of Legendre's classification of hyper-elliptic integrals, though they

  are not adduced for that purpose.

   MThe function (vide ante, p. 38) is a function of the arbitrary quantities

 a, b, ... c, which, as has been remarked, may themselves be considered func-

 Mtions of the arguments Xi, x^, ... x^. "To determine as a function of the

  last-written quantities is a necessary ulterior step in almost any special appli-

 cation of Abel's theorem, and this M. Richelot has done in several interesting
 cases, establishing at the same time the relations which exist among the

 mquantities question. His investigations, however, have an ulterior purpose,

  and are not to be considered merely as corollaries from Abel's theorem.

     Another paper of M. Richelot, on the subject of the Abelian integrals, is
 found in the sixteenth volume of Crelle's Journal, p. 221. The aim of it is
  to furnish the means of actually calculating the value of the Abelian integral
  of the first class by a method of successive transformation, that is, by a method
 analogous to that used for elliptic integrals. M. Richelot's process depends
  essentially on an irrational substitution, by means of which we can replace

  the proposed integrals by two others which differ only with respect to their
  limits. In the development of this idea the author confines himself to the
  first kind of the Abelian integrals of the first class, though the same method

 mmay .m .he more generally applied*. From the formula which expresses

  the proposed integral as the aggregate of two others is deduced another, in
  which it is expressed by means of four integrals, the inferior limits of all being
  zero. The first and second of these integrals differ only in their amplitude,

  and the same is true of the third and fourth. There are two principal trans-
' formations, either of which may be repeated as often as we please ; and though

  it might seem that the number of integrals would in the successive trans-
  formations increase in a geometrical progression, yet by the application of
  Abel's theorem we can always reduce them to the same number. But the
  development of this part of the subject M. Richelot has reserved for another

  occasion f.

82 REPORT--1846.

   At the close of his memoir, M. Richelot has given some numerical exam-
ples of his method for the case of a complete hyper-elliptic integral. The

third example he had previously given in a brief notice of his researches,

published in No. 311 of Schumacher's Journal.

33. For many years after the death of Legendre the subject of the com-

parison of transcendents was studied principally by German and Scandi-

navian writers* : a young French mathematician, M. Hermite, has recently

made important discoveries in this theory ; but as the principal part of what

he has done is as yet not published, a very imperfect outline is all that can

be given.

   In the seventeenth volume of the ' Comptes Rendus ' we find the report

of a commission, consisting of MM. Lame and Liouville, on a memoir pre-

sented to the Institute by M. Hermite. This report is reprinted in the eighth

Avolume of Liouville's Journal, p. 502.  remark which incidentally occurs

in it, namely, that Abel was the first to give the general theory of the divi-

MM.sion of elliptic integrals, led to a very warm discussion between  Liou-

ville and Libri, on the subject of the claims which, as I have already remarked,

the latter had made with reference to this theory.

It appears from the report, that M. Hermite has succeeded in solving the

problem of the division of hyper-elliptic integrals. The division of elliptic

integrals depends on the solution of an algebraical equation ; that of the

hyper-elliptic integrals (as the functions inverse to them involve, as we have
seen, more than one variable), on the solution of a system of simultaneous
algebraical equations. This solution can, M. Hermite has shown, be effected

by means of radicals asuming, as in the analogous case of elliptic functions,

the division of the complete integrals. M. Hermite's method depends for

Athe most part on the periodicity of the functions considered.  transcen-

dental expression of the roots of the equation of the problem having been
obtained, their algebraical values are deduced from it.

   These researches, in themselves of great interest, are yet more interesting,
when we consider how completely they justify the views of M. Jacobi as to
the manner in which Abel's theorem ought to be interpreted, by showing
that his theory of the higher transcendents is no barren or artificial gene-

ralisation.

   At page 505 of the volume of Liouville's Journal already mentioned, we
find an extract from a letter of M. Jacobi to M. Hermite, in which, after
congratulating him on the important discovery he had made, he points out
that the transcendental functions X {u v), A, (?< v') (vide ante, p. 76) are alge-
braical functions of transcendental functions which involve but one variable.

   M. Hermite's subsequent researches have embraced a much more general

theory than that of the Abelian integrals, namely, that of the integrals of
any algebraical function whatever. Thus his views bear the same relation

to Abel's general theory, developed in the ' Savans Etrangers,' that those of

M. Jacobi in the ' Considerationes Generales ' do to Abel's theorem.
    All that has yet been published with respect to them is contained in the

* Comptes Rendus,' xviii. p. 1133, in the form of an extract of a letter from

M. Hermite to M. Liouville. This extract is reprinted in Liouville's Journal,

ix. p. 353. It was communicated to the Institute in June 184'4?.

   Following the course of M. Jacobi's inquiries, M. Hermite proposed to

determine what are the differential equations of which Abel's investigations

give the complete algebraical integrals. When this is done it suggests the

   * The papers of M. Liouville, already noticed, may be said to be an exception to this

remark.
ON THE RECENT PROGRESS OP ANALYSIS.                                           83

nature of the inverse functions which are to be introduced. The number
of these functions will of course vary in diflPerent cases, just as in M. Jacobi's
less general theory. Let us suppose this number to be denoted by y, then
each function will involve y variables. And if each of these variables be
replaced by the sum of two new variables, then all the functions are given
as the roots of an equation of the yth degree, whose coefficients are rational
in terms of the corresponding functions of each of the new variables and of
certain known algebraical functions. From hence is derived the theory of

the periodicity of these functions.

   After some other remarks on the theory of the higher transcendents, M.
Hermite states that the method of division of which he made use in the
problem of the division of Abelian integrals extends also to the new trans-
cendents now considered, but that in the theory of transformation he had
not as yet been successful. The greater part of the remainder of this re-

markable communication relates to elliptic functions, and has been already

noticed. The remark just mentioned as having been made by M. Jacobi for
the functions which are inverse to the Abelian integrals, extends, M. Hermite

observes, to the functions which he considers.

   In conclusion, M. Hermite remarks that the method of differentiation with
respect to the modulus of which Legendre made so much use in the theory
of elliptic functions, may be applied to all functions of the form

where y is given by the equation

   In concluding this report, it may be remarked that the subject of it is still
incomplete, and that there is yet much to be done which we may hope it

will not be found impossible to do. It is however difficult to predict the

direction in which progress will hereafter be made. Yet I think we may

reasonably suppose that the question of multiple periodicity, from the para-

doxical aspect in which it has presented itself, and from its connexion with

the general principles of the science of symbols, will sooner or later attract the

attention of all philosophical analysts. M. Liouville's idea of considering the

conditions to which a doubly periodic function must as such be subject, can

scarcely be developed or extended to the higher transcendents without leading

to results of great generality and interest.

The detailed discussion of different classes of algebraical integrals, their

transformations and reductions, form an endless subject of inquiry. But in

this, as in other cases, the increasing extent of our knowledge will of itself

tend to diminish the interest attached to the full development of particular

portions of it; and with reference to analytical problems arising out of

questions of physical science, the theory of the higher transcendents will it

is probable never become of so much importance as the theory of elliptic

Wefunctions.         have occasion to make use of circular much more frequently

than of elliptic functions, and similarly we shall, it may be presumed, have

less frequently to introduce the higher transcendents than elliptic functions.

Numerical calculations of the values of the higher transcendents are therefore

less important than similar calculations in the case of elliptic functions*.

        On Comparative Analytical Researches on Sea Water.
                         By Prof. FORCHHAMMER.

In a paper read today in the Chemical Section, I have tried to show that

in the ocean between Europe and America, the greatest quantity of saline

matter  is  found  in  the tropical  region  far  from  any  land                      in  such  places  1000
                                                                                    ;

parts of sea water contain 36'6 parts of salt. This quantity diminishes in

approaching the coast, on account of the masses of fresh water which the

rivers throw into the sea; it diminishes likewise in the westernmost part of

the Gulf-stream, where I only found it to be 35"9 in 1000 parts of the water.

By the evaporation of the water of this warm current, its quantity of saline

matter increases towards the east, and reaches in N. lat. 39░ 39' and W. long.
55░ 16', its former height of 36*5. From thence it decreases slowly towards

the north-east, and sea water, at a distance of sixty to eighty miles from the

western shores of England, contains only 35*7 parts of solid substances ; and

the same quantity of salt is found all over the north-eastern part of the At-

lantic as far to the north as Iceland, always at such a distance from the land

that the influence of fresh water from the land is avoided. From numerous

observations made on the shores of Iceland and the Faroe islands, it is evi-

dent that the water of the Gulf-stream spreads over this part of the Atlantic

Ocean, and thus we see that water of tropical currents will keep its character

even in high northern latitudes.

Besides the southerly direction which any current flowing from the north-

ern polar regions must take, it will, according to well-known physical laws

depending upon the rotation of the earth, always take a direction towards the

west, and thus be driven towards the eastern shores of the continents, while

any tropical current flowing towards the north will, according to the same law

of rotation, take a direction towards the western shores of the continents.

This is at present the case in the Atlantic Ocean, and its effects upon the

shores of Europe, which by a branch of a tropical current are surrounded by

warm water, produce a mild and moist climate.
--

    ANALYSIS OF SEA-WATER,  91

   The water of the different seas is much more uniform in its composition
than is generally believed. In that respect my analyses agree with the newer

analyses of atmospheric air, in showing that the differences are very slight

indeed. Sea water may contain more or less salt, from a very small quantity,
as in the interior part of the Baltic, to an amount of 37*1 parts in 1000 parts,

which I found in water from Malta, and which is the greatest quantity I ever
observed ; but the relative proportion of its constituent saline parts changes

very little.
    In order to get rid of those differences which might arise from the dif-

ferent quantity of saline matter in sea water, I have compared sulphuric acid
and lime with chlorine, and the following results are the mean of many ana-

lyses :

    In the Atlantic, the proportion between chlorine and sulphuric acid is
10,000 : 1188; this is the mean of twenty analyses, which differ very little
from each other.

   In the sea between the Faroe islands, Iceland and Greenland, the same
proportion, according to the mean of seventeen analyses, is 10,000 : 1193.

   In the German Ocean, according to ten analyses, it is 10,000 : 1191.
   In Davis's Straits, according to the mean of five analyses, it is 10,000 : 1220.
   In the Kattegat, according to the mean of four analyses, it is 10,000 : 1240.
   Thus it appears that the proportion of sulphuric acid increases near the
shores, a fact which evidently depends upon the rivers carrying sulphate of

lime into the sea.

   The proportion between chlorine and lime in the Atlantic Ocean, according
to the mean result of seventeen analyses, is 1 0,000 : 297 ; and in the sea
between Faroe and Greenland, according to the mean of eighteen analyses,

it is 10,000 : 300.
   In the longitude of Greenland, and more than 100 miles to the south of

the southernmost point of that large tract of land, sea water contains only
35*0 in 1000 parts. In going from this point towards the north-west it de-
creases constantly, and in Davis's Straits, at a distance of about forty miles
from the land, it only contains 32*5 parts of salt in 1000 parts of sea water.
This character seems to remain in the current which runs parallel to the

shores of North America ; and at N. lat. 43^-░ and W. long. 46| the sea water

contained only 33*8 parts of salt. Thus tropical and polar currents seem not
only to be different in respect to their temperature, but also in the quantity
of salt which they contain ; from which it appears, that while the quantity
of water carried away from the tropical sea by evaporation is greater than
that which rain and the rivers give back to that sea, the reverse takes place
in the polar seas, where evaporation is very small and the condensation of
vapour very great. The circulation must on that account be such, that a
part of the vapour which rises in tropical zones will be condensed in polar
regions, and in the form of polar currents flow back again to warmer climates.

Although my analyses are only made on water from the ocean between Eu-

rope and America, yet little doubt can be entertained that that part of the
ocean which separates America from Asia is constituted in a similar manner,
and that currents flowing from the poles are the rule, and currents flowing

towards the poles the exception.

   Lime is rather rare in the sea around the West Indian islands, where mil-

lions of coralline animals constantly absorb it, the proportion according to
five analyses being 10,000 : 247 ; and it is rather copious in the Kattegat,
where the numerous rivers of the Baltic carry a great quantity of it into the

ocean. The proportion is there, according to four analyses, 10,000 : 371.
--92 REPORT 1846.

On the Calculation of the Gaussian Constants for 1829. By A. Erman.

As purely theoretical speculations on natural phEenomena remain highly-
unsatisfactory until they can be founded on a sufficient number of observa-
tions, in the same manner collections of the most careful observations must

be almost useless before they are thoroughly elaborated according to a given
theory. Nay, the accumulation of observed numbers, notwithstanding the

value they possess when viewed by themselves, may even become injurious
to science, by retarding its progress. Indeed the aspect of progressively in-
creasing, but not duly elaborated, materials, must at last give rise to the ap-
prehension, both on the part of those engaged in furnishing them, and of
every one interested in the results to be gathered from them, that the means
may be wanting to bring such a stock of matter to bear for their proper
purpose. The loss of the whole, that is to say, of data which have not been
acquired without the exertion of considerable scientific labour, and which
seemed pregnant with beautiful germs, would then be a most discouraging

consequence.

   The British Association for the Advancement of Science has many times

Aproved itself convinced of the truth of this principle. resolution adopted by

the Association in 1833, during its first meeting at Cambridge, warded oflT the
peril just mentioned, even from a department of science whose long-established
rate of progress had not been able to protect it sufficiently against such a
risk. The reduction of the Greenwich observations of planets, undertaken in
consequence of this resolution, and now published by order of the Lords
Commissioners of the Admiralty, has been fully appreciated by all astrono-
mers, and particularly by the late M. Besscl, who in the last moments of his
life welcomed it as the beginning of a new period in astronomy. Moreover,
the condition that a uniform progress of observation and calculation is equally
indispensable in less-developed or only nascent branches of physical science,
has been expressed by the British Association at its second meeting at
Cambridge in 1845 ; first, by several of the members being inclined to
raise the question, whether the continuation of magnetic and meteorological
observations were desirable, as long as a great part of the materials collected
by them are still waiting their first employment ; and, secondly, by including
the calculation of the Gaussian constants of terrestrial magnetism for 1829
within the sphere of their own operations, being pleased at the same time to

entrust me M'ith the superintendence of the same, and to place at my disposal
the sum of г50, granted for this purpose for the year 1845 to 1846. I shall

 endeavour to point out in a few words the fruits this arrangement seems to

 promise, and the results it has already obtained.
    I think we are authorised to suppose that all those phaenomena which we

 have learned to express by numbers, with the help of remarkably accurate
 instruments, will at length lead us to a theory of the forces which produce
 them ; and that, in consequence, the intrinsic value of observations on such

-- --phaenomena a value which hitherto could not be demonstrated will then

 at once become most evident. It was this expectation alone which often
 encouraged observers to persevere in labours apparently rather tedious, and
 the zeal with which the meteorological and part of the magnetic variations
 are pursued by your members in British and colonial observatories, is, I think,
 attributable to the same cause. In the branches of physics which they cul-
 tivate, these observers, it is true, have still to look to futurity for both kinds
 of progress, viz. the discovery of an abstract theory, and the true establishment
 of the same by means of observed numbers. As to the first and most import-
ON THE GAUSSIAN CONSTANTS FOB 1829.  93

ant of these steps, they have a consolation in the fate of their predecessors

in most similar labours : I allude to the long series of philosophers who de-

voted themselves during the first thirty years of this century to ascertaining

the mean values of magnetic elements for as many points on the surface of

--the globe as possible, and whose undertakings are so carefully recorded by

one of them I mean Col. Sabine, in his admirable report on magnetic in-
tensity. They too were long enough under the necessity of restricting the
immediate application of their operations to refuting some evidently super-
ficial or erroneous theoretical views, and then, after detaching from their re-
sults every accidental influence, to register them in the annals of science, as
contributions to a theory which they only hoped might be attained. But M.
Gauss's admirable theorem, that any terrestro-magnetical element, that is
to say, any observable part of the intensity of magnetic force at a given point
of the earth, or any angle formed by this force with a given plane or line, can
be represented by combining with given functions of the latitude and longi-
tude of this point a limited number (probably twenty-four) of constant quan-
tities, and the way pointed out by him for deriving these constants from a
sufficient number of observed mean values of magnetic elements, have in a
short time so completely realized these hopes, that a great encouragement
was held out, both to former observers of mean magnetic elements, and
to those who were then, and are still employed in less-advanced branches of
physics: nevertheless this encouragement was but an imperfect one. To
complete it, the possibility of applying those former observations had to be

changed to a reality. On this account I am inclined to think that the com-

mittee appointed to conduct the cooperation of the British Association in the
system of combined magnetic and meteorological observations, have parti-

cularly contributed to the satisfaction of their own observers, by encouraging
the calculation of the Gaussian constants for 1829; for, by so doing, they in the
first place have confirmed their adhesion to the general principle, that no set of
observations whatever must remain longer than is indispensably necessary
without reduction to theory; and secondly, they have made the immediate ap-
plication of the mean magnetic values for 184-5, that may be furnished by the
combined British and Russian observatories, the more probable, as it will then
be already preceded by a similar application of the analogous values for 1829.

Besides this, to prove the influence of your resolution on the dej)artment of sci-

ence most directly connected with it, I may remark that a more and more exact

determination of magnetic constants (the Gaussian) is equally indispensable

at the present moment (and for the same reason), as the obtaining of the con-
stants for planetary orbits was formerly, from the moment in which Kepler's
and Newton's discoveries opened a possibility of arriving at them. Whatever
may be the analogies once to be found in magnetism for the secular varia-

tions and other perturbations of planetary orbits, the entrance into these
untouched fields of science cannot fail to be effected by fixing the actual

 values of Gaussian constants.

    It was under these circumstances that I long ago felt it to be a debt I had
 contracted towards science, that the magnetic elements which I observed
 from 1828 to 1830, at about 650 equidistant stations, on a line encircling
 the globe, between latitudes 67░ north and 60░ south, conjointly, perhaps,
 with the magnetic elements that had been observed in Europe during the
 same years, should be fully applied to the development of the now existing
 theory. For the undertaking of such a work, however, it was evidently ne-

 cessary to have more time at my disposal than I have ever enjoyed. M.

this comprehensive task, found his leisure hours unequal to its completion.
Now, on the contrary, the support of the British Association has enabled and
induced this gentleman to suspend his other official duties for the year just
expired, and to devote himself entirely to the prosecution of the work in
question, in which his success will, I think, be appreciated by the Association,
from the results which I have the pleasure of laying before you, accompanied

by some remarks on the means employed to obtain them. What proportions
these one year's results bear to the final term of the whole labour, and how

far they deserve to be continued, is a subject which I shall take the liberty
of touching upon at the conclusion of this paper.

   The object of the calculations committed to my superintendence may be

stated to consist in finding, by a sufficiently large series of observations,

twenty-four corrections,

calculating at the same time the probable errors of the so-corrected constants.
To this effect (preserving the literal denominations used in M. Gauss's theory

and then 283 numerical primary equations, relating to magnetic elements,

observed on a line from Berlin to the east coast of North Asia, at the port

of St. Peter and St. Paul, have been formed, by alternately i-ecurring to one

or the other of these six formulae. For the sake of uniformity, their first term,

which always meant the value of the magnetic element calculated with M.

marked by the letter n, independently of its having been derived by the 1st,

the two other, being only approximately re<iuired for this purpose, have been

merely calculated by theory, viz. by those values of constants which we are

about to correct.

   The correctness of the numbers in those 283 primary equations for the
twenty-four unknown, has then been controlled by determining the theoretic
values of the X, theY, the Z, or of the two or three of them that were required
for the composition of to, of tang S or tang i, a second time in a somewhat

different way. It consisted in calculating according to

X=F(m) + F' (u) cos X+F" (u) sin A + F"' (u) cos 2 K

+ + FTM(M)cos4A + F""(л)sin4X,

Yor to a quite analogous expression for and Z, for which the numerical values

contained in F(m), F'(m)        F''"'(m) are given as resulting from the pre-

liminary values of the twenty-four constants in M. Gauss's theory of terres-

trial magnetism, з 27.
   This part of the task being completed, the second, and by far the most

laborious one, consisted in forming out of the coefficients in each primary

of two factors, each according to this form,

   The 283 products, assembled under each of these 325 titles, were then
separately summed up, and by this means (marking by [] a sum of analogous

--terms) the twenty-four final equations of the following form were obtained:

   The numerical expressions of these equations will be found in the table
marked VI. Hitherto they have been controlled by the calculation leading
to them from the primary equations, being repeated a second time in the
same manner as the first, but with the suppression of one decimal figure in
the products and in their sums. To obviate the danger, arising from the ad-
dition of such extensive rows of numbers, lest the compensation of opposite
errors might produce an illusory agreement, M. Petersen, besides the forma-

--tion of new primary equations, has proceeded to subject these final equations

to another kind of control, I mean the process usually employed in similar

independently of the extension which is given to the sums marked by [].
   If we now consider, in the first place, the linear primary equations con-

tained in the Tables annexed, we shall find that the values of the Gaus-

sian constants hitherto accepted sufficiently approximate to the truth to
authorise the supposition from which we start, that the powers of their cor-
rections superior to the first can be neglected ; but, on the other hand, that
these values are still so erroneous, that the elements calculated by them differ
from the empirical ones by far more than can be ascribed to errors of obser-
vation, and in quite another manner than would arise from local irregularities

of terrestrio-magnetic power. Indeed we see that when the places of obser-
vation are in similar parts of the globe, the values of n belonging to them
remain nearly enough equal to each other ; whereas on the longitudes of the
places increasing, these values of n are gradually lessened, and at length
replaced by a series of values with opposite signs. Of course, to observe this
regularity of progress, we must only compare such values of )i as relate to

magnetic elements of a similar character ; as for instance, all to x, or all to
w, and so on.

   The value [ww] =233423, marked in the Table of Final Equations as re-
sulting from 283 equations, shows that for the part of the earth on which
the observations hitherto considered have taken place, the mean difference
between an observed magnetic element and the corresponding calculated one
amounts to 29, the intensity of the whole force at London being =1372 ; and
in agreement with this result, we find, for example, by immediate inspection
of the Table of Primary Equations,

The mean difference

be obtained for any one of the twenty-four unknown quantities, for ex-

ample, A^f''' depends entirely on its weight, that is to say, on the magni-

tude of the coefficient with which this quantity remains in the equation

containing at the origin the terms  + [(c.A^''').(c.A^''')].A5'''', after

the elimination of the twenty-three others ; and that these weights, as is easily
shown, will only become sufficiently extensive when there are neither two

nor more of the unknown quantities whose coefficients remain in a constant,

or in a nearly constant relation in the whole series of primary equations, tri-
butary to the final ones. Hence the examination in this same respect of the

above expressions for Aa;, Ay,      ^^i, will easily show that by reason

of the similarity of the latitudes in which by far the greatest part of the ob-

servations till now calculated have been effected, the solution of the final

equations as hitherto obtained would give but a very trifling weight to almost
all the corrections we are seeking for, and therefore be still without interest.

   Even the seventy elements that, according to date of observation, follow
next to the 283 finished ones, and for which M. Petersen has also nearly

accomplished the primary equations, will, by their contributing to the final

ones, most sensibly improve them in respect of solubility. Indeed in full
opposition to the now finished ones, these latter elements relate to points of
a line rather northern than eastern in its direction, and extending from 57░
latitude north to about the equator. It is therefore precisely those unknown

quantities whose coefficients have hitherto exhibited the least variations, or

followed in their varying a course parallel with that of the coefficients of

other unknown ones, that will vary the most, both relatively and absolutely

speaking, in the set of primary equations next to be formed, and thus will

add to the final equations just what is requisite for increasing the weight of
each of the quantities sought for and thereby preparing their due separation.

   M. Petersen will at all events subjoin, in the course of the ensuing months,

this next continuation of his present labour, which I shall then forward to the

Association.

   It is plain, notwithstanding, that even then we shall not have reached the
mostfavourable state which our fund of observations for the year 1829 would

allow of attaining in the knowledge of the Gaussian constants for the same

year. Indeed even then, by substituting, as could be effected through your

further patronage, a full execution of the task to a but partial one, the places

of observation contributing to the final equations may be trebled, and what
is still more important, a considerable improvement be attained in their re-

petition over the globe.

   I thought it my duty to submit to the Association my opinion of the

benefits to be derived from the continuation of M. Petersen's labours, leaving

it to their decision whether they will consider it advisable to grant him their

further support in devoting himself entirely to the prosecution of his task.

ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN.  99

On the Progress, present Amount, and probable future Condition of
   the Iron Manufacture in Great Britain. By G. R. Porter, F.R.S.

In obedience to the request of the Council of the British Association, made

--at its meeting in June 1845 at Cambridge, a request from that body being

--equivalent to a command, I avail myself of the first moment of leisure that

has since presented itself, to investigate the condition of the iron manufac-

ture in Great Britain.

   The incessant claims upon my time, of public duties, which have called in

their performance for the most anxious and unremitting labour, throughout
all of the present year that has hitherto elapsed, may perhaps be allowed to

plead in excuse for the imperfect manner in which I am able to perform my

task. I wish, most sincerely, that it had been otherwise, and that it had
been possible to devote to its accomplishment an amount of time and a de-

gree of research that might have enabled me to present a work more worthy

of the acceptance of this body, and better proportioned to the importance of

the subject.
    It was, doubtless, a conviction of the great and growing influence which

the progress of the iron manufacture must exercise upon other important
branches of our national industry, that led the Council of our body to desire
information concerning it, and all that has since arisen in the course of our
legislation has given additional interest to the subject, so that it has become
piore than ever of consequence to know the actual condition of this great
branch of our industry, and of the capabilities which present themselves for
its increase. The enormous demand for iron caused by the general and
simultaneous construction of railways all over this kingdom, and not here
only, but in various parts of Europe and in the United States of America,
and also by their promised extension to India, is calculated to produce much
of anxious inquiry into the subject, in order to ascertain, in the first place,
whether, and in what way, that enormous demand can be met, and then to
satisfy ourselves that through the cessation of that demand, which from its
nature must be in a chief degree temporary, we may not be exposing to
ruinous depreciation establishments for the formation of which vast capitals
have been and will be sunk, in which many skilled workmen are trained, who
during the continuance of the existing great demand will be receiving high

wages, but who when it ceases may, many of them, be thrown out of em-
ployment, and who must be so, unless some new and permanent uses can be

found for the produce of their industry.

    The object of the present inquiry does not call for any research into the

remote history of the iron manufacture. It will not assist us in the solution

of the questions now pressing upon our attention, to ascertain whether, in
centuries preceding the Christian sera, when the Phoenicians traded with our
ancestors for tin, the Britons did, as some writers have assumed, know and
practise the manufacture of iron. Certain it is, that the rise of that manu-
facture upon any scale deserving of notice as a national object, dates from a
time within the memory of persons now living. In 1788 the whole quantity
of pig-iron made in England and Wales is said to have amounted to no more
than 61,300 tons, of which quantity 48,200 tons were made with coke of
 pit-coal, and the remaining 13,100 tons were still made with charcoal (see
 Appendix No. 1). In the same year the production in Scotland did not
 exceed 7000 tons. In Ireland charcoal-iron was made on a moderate scale

 during the seventeenth century. Sir William Petty tells us in his ' Political
 Anatomy of Ireland,' that in 1672 the quantity of iron made there was about

 1000 tons, giving employment to about 2000 persons of both sexes. Works
                                                                                H2

--100 REPORT 1846.

established by Sir William Petty in the county of Kerry in 1660, continued
to be carried on until tlie exhaustion of the timber in the neighbourhood
brought them to a stand, and in 1788 there does not appear to have been
any ii-on-work in existence in Ireland.

   About this time the iron-masters in Great Britain began to avail them-
selves of Mr. Watt's improvements of the steam-engine, and were thus en-
abled greatly and rapidly to increase the productive power of their works,
so that in eight years from 1788 the quantity of British-made iron was nearly

doubled. An inquiry made in 1796, consequent upon the proposal of Mr.

Pitt, which was afterwards abandoned, to place a tax upon coal at the pit's
mouth, showed the make of British iron to be then

In England and Wales... 108,993 tons.

In Scotland  16,086 tons.

Together     125,079 tons. (See App. No. 2.)

   Ten years later, in 1806, it was proposed to tax the production of iron,
and again on that occasion an account was taken of the number of furnaces
and the quantity of iron produced, which was found to have been more than
doubled in ten years ; the production being

In England and Wales... 234,966 tons.

In Scotland  23,240 tons.

Together     258,206 tons. (See App. No. 3.)

Of this quantity it was stated that about 95,000 tons were converted into
bars and plates, and that the capital engaged in the manufacture amounted
to г5,000,000. The proposed tax was so powerfully opposed in the House
of Commons, tliat the bill was carried through the Committee by a majority

of only ten, and the measure was abandoned.
   The next account of this manufacture which has been given, was prepared

by Mr. Francis Finch, formerly member for Walsall, and had reference to
the year 1823. From that account (see App. No. 4) it appeared that in
seventeen years the make of iron in Great Britain had been increased from

258,206 tons to 452,066 tons. Between 1823 and 1830 there were erected
ninety-six new furnaces; and in the latter year it was found, on a further ex-
amination by Mr. Finch, that the quantity of pig-iron made in Great Bi'itain
amounted to 678,417 tons (see App. No. 5). Our confidence in the cor-

rectness of the quantities here stated should be confirmed by their having
been adopted in his evidence before the Committee on Import Duties in 1840
by Sir John Guest, whose authority upon this subject is conclusive.

   From this time (1830) a series of improvements has been introduced
into the processes of making iron, which has had the effect of improving

the quality of the metal and of materially ceconomising the cost of its pro-
duction. One of thq most important of these improvements was made the

subject of a patent in 1829 by Mr. Neilson of Glasgow, and consisted in the

artificial heating of the air previously to its being passed into the furnaces.

The eff"ect of this plan in saving fuel has been most remarkable. In 1829,
at the Clyde Iron Works, where Mr. Neilson's experiments were made, and
in which his patent M'as first adopted, it required more than 8 tons of coal,
when converted into coke, to produce 1 ton of cast iron. This was when
the air was forced into the furnace at its natural temperature. By heating
the air to 300░ Fahrenheit preparatory to its introduction, it became neces-
sary to consume for each ton of iron produced only 5 tons 3^ cwt. of coal

converted into coke ; but in heating the air to the required degree, nearly
           ----

           ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN. 101

 8 cwt. of coal was consumed. The saving was thus found to be 2^ tons of
 coal for each ton of iron. Thus encouraged, further experiments were made.
 The previous heating of the air was raised to 600░ Fahrenheit, and it was
then found, not only that a further great ceconomy was produced in the fuel,
 but that coal could be used for smelting in its raw or uncoived condition. It
was further discovered that the same blast-machinery, when the air was thus
heated, sufficed for a greater number of furnaces, so that the power neces-
sary for three furnaces, when cold air was employed, became ample for four
furnaces of equal size when the air was previously heated. The result may

be thus stated :

In 1829, using coiie and cold air, each ton of iron required for its produc-
                tion 8 tons I cwt. 1 qr. of coal.

In 1830, using coiie and heated air, each ton of iron was made with 5 tons

                 3 cwt. 1 qr. of coal.

In 1833, using raw coal and heated air, each ton of iron was made with
               2 tons 5 cwt. 1 qr. of coal.

The saving in fuel is thus seen to amount to 72 per cent.
    The effect of the hot-blast upon the quality of the iron produced has

been the object of many experiments to determine. As those experiments
were in great part undertaken at the instance of the British Association, and
as their results have been published from time to time in its Transactions, it
cannot be necessary to notice them further here. Mr. Neilson's invention
was for a long time greatly decried, and to this day it is the practice with
some few of our leading engineers, when drawing specifications for works, to
forbid the use of hot-blast iron. Under these circumstances, the introduc-
tion of this plan has been by no means universal in the iron-works of England
and Wales, although it is otherwise in Scotland, where the increased make

of iron, from 37,500 tons in 1830, to nearly 500,000 tons in the past twelve
months, maj' be in great part, if not altogether, ascribed to the ceconomy
which Mr. Neilson's plan has occasioned. But for the introduction of that
plan, we should in all likelihood not have witnessed the unequalled develop-

ment exhibited during the past fifteen years in this, which has now become
one of the greatest branches of our national industry. Without this discovery
our railroad system could not have marched forward with such giant strides,

--and in all probability the application of iron to the building of ships, an
--application from the extension of which, in future years, so many advantages

may be made to arise, might have continued unthought of.
   In a letter which has reached me while writing, from a most intelligent

iron-master in the North of England *, the subject is thus noticed :
   " Previously to this invention, metal was made with such coal only as was

easily destructible before the blast, thereby admitting a greater quantity of

air into the furnace. Air is the food of fire. Coals of a stronger or more
bituminous character were not serviceable ; the current of cold air at the
Tuyeres had the effect of caking the coal and choking the admission of air,
by which the process of reduction was stopped. But when Mr. Neilson intro-
duced his method the difficulty was conquered. By heating the air up to 600░
Fahrenheit, the caking at the Tuyeres no longer took place ; the air entered
freely into the furnace, and coal hitherto unserviceable was enlisted into the
service of mankind, and applied to the great improvement of their condition.

   " It was pretended that the metal made with hot-blast was not so good
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

that it was weaker ; and for a long time it was tabooed in all contracts ; but
this delusion is gradually giving way to truth. There was no foundation for
such prejudice. It is known that air does not burn until it reaches 3000░

Fahrenheit ; the raising of it to 600░ before admission to the furnace was
nothing, nor did it destroy any of its elementary qualities ; it only secured
its admission and ensured its regularity of action in the process of reduction.
This was an increase of man's power over eletnentary matter : it is by the
additions to and the increase of this power that men will in time accomplish
a greater and more powerful condition."

    The disinclination to adopt an innovation, which as we have seen in this
case of the hot-blast, has not been entirely overcome by more than fifteen

years' experience of its advantages, has not been confined to that instance,

but has been allowed for a much longer period to influence, in another case,
the proceedings of our iron-masters. It was as long ago as 1801, that Mr.
David Mushet, to whom the world is greatly indebted for his scientific re-
searches and his practical exertions in this important branch of metallurgy,
discovered when crossing the river Calder, in the parish of Old Monkland, a
description of ironstone, to which the name of black-band, or Mushet-stone,
has been given. For many years following this discovery the black-band was
used only in the Calder Iron Works, which were established in 1800 by Mr.
Mushet, and it was not even there employed alone, but was used in combi-
nation with other iron ores of the argillaceous class. It was not until 1825
that it was first used alone by the Monkland Company, whose success in the
experiment led gradually to its adoption by other establishments, and to the

erection of additional works.
   Mr. Mushet, in his ' Papers on Iron and Steel,' p. 128, thus describes the

advantages of this kind of ironstone :

   " Instead of 20, 25 or 30 cwt. of limestone formerly used to make a ton of
iron, the black-band now requires only 6, 7 or 8 cwt. to the production of a
ton. This arises from the extreme richness of the ore when roasted, and
from the small quantity of earthy matter it contains, which renders the ope-
ration of smelting the black-band with hot-blast more like the melting of
iron than the smelting of an ore. When properly roasted, its richness ranges
from 60 to 70 per cent., so that little more than a ton and a half is required
to make a ton of pig-iron ; and as one ton of coal will smelt one ton of
roasted ore, it is evident that when the black-band is used alone, 35 cwt. of
raw coal will suffice to the production of one ton of good gray pig-iron."

   This calculation is strongly corroborated by a statement which was pro-
duced by Dr. Watt to the Statistical Section of the Association at Cambridge,
from which it appeared, that to make 400,400 tons of iron in the counties of
Lanark, Ayr, Stirling and Clackmannan, the quantity of coal consumed was
934,266 tons, or 2 tons 6 cwt. 2 qrs. 18 lbs. for each ton of iron, part of which
is the produce of argillaceous ores.

   The statement of these discoveries appears necessary in order to account
for the great and rapid extension given since 1830 to the production of iron

in this kingdom, and especially in Scotland.
    In 1836 every iron-Avork in Great Britain was visited, and an account taken

of its produce, by a highlj^-gifted gentleman, M. F. Le Play, " Ingenieur en
chef," employed in the Ministry ot^ Public Works at Paris, under whose di-
rection are made the yearly reports describing the progress of mining indus-

try in France, of which I have on former occasions availed myself in pre-
paring papers read before this Section of the Association. The result of his
inquiries showed that in that year the quantity of iron made reached to
1,000,000 tons, an amount then deemed almost incredible, but which in the
years immediately following was greatly exceeded. In his ' Papers on Iron
and Steel,' to which reference has already been had, Mr. Mushet states
(p. 421) that the quantity of British iron made in 1839, was 1,248,781 tons
(See App. No. 6).
           ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN. 103

   In the following year a very elaborate inquiry into this subject was made
by Mr. William Jessop of the Butterley Works in Derbyshire, and the result
of his inquiries was printed by him for private distribution. His statement
embraces every iron-work in Great Britain, and gives the number of furnaces
in blast and out of blast, with the weekly produce of each establishment.
From Mr. Jessop's tables it was shown that the number of furnaces in blast
in that year (1840) was 402, and the number out of blast 88; the weekly
produce of the 402 furnaces being 27,928 tons, and consequently the yearly
produce, taken at 50 weeks' working, 1,396,400 tons. In the production of
this quantity Mr. Jessop states that there were consumed 4,877,000 tons of
coal, being at the rate of 3 tons in Scotland, and 3 tons 12 cwt. in England
and Wales, for each ton of iron. This was exclusive of the coal used in
converting pig-iron into wrought iron, and which he sets down at 2,000,000
tons additional (see App. No. 7). At the time Mr. Jessop's account was
taken, it appeared that out of 420 furnaces erected in England and Wales,
there were 82, or 1 in 5, out of blast, and that of 70 furnaces in Scotland,
6, or I in 11, were in that condition. The rapid increase of this manufac-
ture during the preceding ten years forbids the belief that this large number

of furnaces could have been idle through dilapidation. In fact, the country
was then suffering under an amount of commercial depression of no ordinary
character, and which continued to press heavily upon almost every branch of
its industry, until the abundant harvest of 1844, joined to the effect of the
fiscal reforms introduced in 1842, caused the return of healthiness to our
trading interests. The continuance of the depression, which had no doubt

extinguished so many of the furnace fires in 1840, caused still more of them
to be put out of blast in the years immediately following, and it was shown
by a statement drawn out under the direction of an association of the iron-
masters of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, that the quantity of iron made in the
first six months of 1842 in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire,
South Wales and Scotland did not exceed 523,214 tons, or at the rate of
1,046,428 tons per annum. The quantity of iron made in those divisions of
the kingdom in 1840 was, according to Mr. Jessop's statement, 1,343,400
tons, so that the diminution of production was at the rate of more than 22
per cent., which rate was probably experienced throughout the kingdom;
and in this case the whole quantity of iron made in 1842 did not much ex-
ceed one million of tons, the quantity ascertained by M. Le Play to have
been made in 1836.

  A great impulse had been given at that time to this branch of industry by

the demand arising from the construction of railways. This impulse, and
the subsequent depression, may be easily inferred from the following state-
ment of the number of railway acts passed in each year from 1831 to 1843,
distinguishing such as were for new lines from those which authorized ex-
tensions or amendments in former acts, and giving the amount of capital
authorized by Parliament to be raised under those acts.

culators tempted by that extremely low price, occurred in April, when the
quotation stands at 655. per ton : in September the price was again reduced
to 50s., and the average price of the year was 55s. 6d. per ton. In 1845, the
lowest price, which also occurred in January, was 60s., and in March the

price had advanced to 100s. ; in May purchases were freely made at 110s.

and we cannot wonder that with a rise in price equal to 175 per cent., so great a

stimulus should be given to the extension of iron-works. On the authority

of the same firm, it is stated, that the number of furnaces in blast, which at
the end of 1845 was 87, was on the 30th of June 1846 increased to 97, and
that the computed make of pig-iron in Scotland, in the first six months of
the present year, is 260,000 tons, equal to 520,000 tons in the year, showing
that the production has been more than doubled in the six years since 1840.

   I have before me a detailed account of the iron-works of Scotland in
August 1846, which gives 105 as the number of furnaces in blast, 21 as those
out of blast, in addition to 11 more building. The weekly make of pig-iron

at the 105 furnaces is said to be 11,010 tons, equal to 550,050 tons per
annum ; estimating that each furnace is in action during 50 weeks. This ac-

count is in part corroborated by a table kindly sent to me by Dr. Watt, of the

works in Lanarkshire, and which places the yearly produce of that county at

390,000 tons. It is further stated, that notwithstanding the great increase in
the quantity made, according to the concurrent testimony of all parties, the
stock of iron in the hands of the makers and dealers has materially decreased.

The stock in Glasgow at the end ot 1845 was 210,000 tons

and on the 30th of June 1846, only  140,000

Decrease                            70,000 tons.

It may be assumed that this increase of production, although it may have

been at first called forth by speculation, has not been sustained by those

means, since the stock has thus diminished in the face of that increase, while

the price has been declining. In January it was 80s. and in June 68s. per ton.

  A statement which appeared in the ' Glamorgan Gazette' computed the

make of iron in 1843 at 1,210,550 tons, of which quantity 238,750 tons were
assigned to Scotland. The entire quantity was stated to have been the pro-

duce of 339 furnaces in blast, while there were said to be 1 90 furnaces out
of blast in different parts of the kingdom. Another statement, communicated

to me by Mr. Buckley (Member of Parliament for Newcastle), differs but
slightly from that which was inserted in the ' Glamorgan Gazette,' the total
quantity made being given as 1,215,350 tons (see App. No. 10).

   In the absence of any authentic statement of the make of iron in England
and Wales at this present time, an attempt has been made by correspondence

to ascertain the facts as they exist in different localities. The result of in-
quiries thus conducted cannot have the same value as the investigations made

by Mr. Jessop in 1840, but is offered here as the best which it has been in

my power to produce.

  It is given as the opinion of several most intelligent iron-masters whom I

have consulted, that nearly all the increased production of iron in this king-

dom since 1840, has been drawn from Scotland. It is true that in some of the

Scotch works there is already experienced a short supply of materials, but on
the other hand, new fields are discovered and brought into working. Mr.
Jessop states, that " a new field of coal and iron has been opened out in

Ayrshire, but not so favourable as the Airdrie and Coalbridge district." The
great demand at present experienced, and that which is sure to follow from

the extent of the railway projects which have received legislative sanction in

1845 and 1846, have naturally stimulated every establishment to its utmost
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

point of production. But in order to add materially to the make of iron, a

great variety of circumstances must be brouglit to concur. One of the

greatest difficulties with which the manufacturers liave to contend in such

circumstances is offered by the workmen, who naturally enough, perhaps,

strive to obtain for themselves the largest possible share of the increased value

of that which they produce. To be of much use in any branch of this ma-

nufacture a man must have undergone a season of instruction, and as the

number of skilled workmen is limited, these, whenever any great or unwonted
demand arises, hardly know how to set limits to their demands. On this

subject, a recent number of the ' Merthyr Guardian' contains the following

paragraph.
-- We" Prosperity in the Iron Trade.
                                      believe the iron trade in this district

was rarely ever known to be in a more thriving state than at the present

time. Forgemen and puddiers realize from 10/. to 18/. per month. But

this state of prosperity brings its attendant snare, inasmuch as the surplus

which should be accumulating in the Savings' Banks, is in too many cases

squandered in debauchery or lavished in vice. The state of things calls

loudly for a remedy."

This complaint will not surprise us when we call to mind the fearful de-

scription of the state of the population of Merthyr, read before this section

of the Association at Cambridge, by Mr. Kenrick. But the same complaint

is made in other quarters, and there is but too much reason to fear that it

might be universally preferred. In a letter now before me, an extensive

--iron-master in the north of England writes on the 15th of August last, " The

cost of making iron from the recent spirt of prosperity has increased so

enormously that the ' prosperity ' has well-nigh ruined many makers ! wages

are so ruinously raised."

 A --gentleman writes from Scotland in June 1845, "This is the present

position of the trade. The speculators were first bitten by the mania of an-

ticipated consumption ; then the masters took the fever, and, as was to be
expected, the workmen follow, and say they must have a rise of wages equi-

valent to the 1 105. price. It is nothing to them that iron has again fallen

they say, first put us up equivalent to the high price before you can ask us

to conform to the present. The iron-master will therefore find that he must

give the wages corresponding to 110s., although he may sell at 70s. or less."

It is understood that chiefly I'rom this cause the cost price of iron in Scotland

has been increased about 15s. per ton.

   May we not reasonably allow ourselves to indulge the hope, that at some

future, and perhaps not very distant day, the two classes of employers and
workmen may come to the better understanding of their mutual interest, so
that the sun of prosperity, whenever it arises, may shine equally for both ?

Statements were inserted in the course of last year in the ' Mining Journal,'

and were made the subject of remark by different persons without impugn-

ing their accuracy, to the effect that the make of iron in Great Britain during

184'5 would amount to about 1,330,000 tons. If the statement concerning

the production in Scotland already mentioned should be correct, this would

leave for the make in England and Wales 917,500 tons, being 134',000 tons

less than the quantity stated by Mr. Mushet as made in 1839, and 238,000
less than the produce of IS^O, as given by Mr. Jessop. The increase in

Scotland during the five years was, on the other hand, 171,500 tons, thus

leaving the whole produce of 1845 less than that of 1840 by 66,500 tons.
   It will doubtless appear extraordinary, that with so much cause for increa-

sing the quantity as had arisen last year out ot the actual and anticipated

demand for railway purposes, the produce in England and Wales should not
ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN. 107

at least have overtaken that obtained in 1 840, and that it had not done so
calls for explanation. In the endeavour to obtain this I have been met by-
statements which might appear to be in some respects somewhat contradic-

tory of each other, the different writers representing matters as presented to

their own views and experience, and without possessing that general acquaint-

ance with the facts existing in other districts which it is so desirable to attain.

One most highly intelligent iron-master whom I have consulted writes, " I

consider now," that is, since the discovery of the hot-blast system, " that all

the ironstone and coal of this country is applicable to the production of iron.

I fear however that the deposits of ironstone exceed very much those of coal,
and that the increasing demand upon this latter article will before many years
show its effects. I think in Staffordshire they already feel a want in the high

price of coal, and the iron trade seems migrating northward, where coal is

more abundant and different deposits of ironstone are continually discovered."

The gentleman who thus writes is interested in iron-works in the county of

Northumberland, where the make of iron has increased and is increasing

greatly and rapidly, but still not sufficiently to compensate for the falling off

of production elsewhere.

   Another gentleman, from whom I have received great assistance in my

inquiries, writes, " In some of the localities in Scotland there is beginning to

be a great scarcity of ironstone, several furnaces being recently put out iu

consequence ; and in Staffordshire still more so. People's ideas about increase
of make of iron travel much faster than the reality. In fact, during 1845

great numbers of the furnaces in Staffordshire were going on half-quantity,

Isimply from want of materials ; this knoio." It is corroborative of this re-

presentation, that a powerful iron company, having works in Staffordshire, has
for some time had two new furnaces completed without putting them in action.

   From a third correspondent, whose interest is in the great iron district of
South Wales, I hear of so great a number of new works building in Durham,

Cumberland, Northumberland and Scotland, that any account taken of the

produce in those districts, even so recently as last April, must necessarily be

very imperfect. He adds, " They are progressing so rapidly, and can pro-

duce iron at such a cheap rate in these new iron districts, as to lead to the

conclusion that ultimately the principal seat of the iron manufacture will be

removed from South Wales to the North of England and Scotland."

   On the other hand, Mr. Mushet, whose acquaintance with the subject is
probably of a more general nature than that of my correspondents previously

--quoted, writes so recently as the 16th of August in the present year, "The

principal object in the iron trade which now attracts attention is the recent

discovery of an extensive district of black-band ironstone, ranging from

Cwmbeyond  Avon, through Maesteg, towards the valley of the Taffe.  The

two principal beds or veins of black-band lie high in the coal series, and in

this respect differ from the Beaufort black-band, which wafe found over the

lowest coal, and from the Scotch, which was found descending in the coal-

series at various depths. These beds measure fifteen inches each in thick-
ness, and will each yield fully 3000 tons per acre. The lower bed contains

40 per cent, of iron, and is put raw into the furnace ; the other is previously

roasted, as it contains more shale, and when so roasted yields the same quan-

tity of iron as the other when raw. As this range of minerals occupies both

Cwm Cwmsides of the line from
           Avon to             Taffe, large tracts of black-band

ironstone must unavoidably be found, and it may not be hazardous to pro-

nounce that this in time may rival Merthyr, and become an extensive ii'on-

making district, probably the Lanarkshire of South Wales." Mr. Mushet

furnishes a list of fourteen furuaces in which this black-band ironstone is
108 REPORT-- 1846.

partly used, and mentions three other furnaces now building in which it will

be employed.

Referring to the counties of Durham and Northumberland, Mr. Mushet

gives a list of thirty-five furnaces Avhere twenty years ago only one blast-

furnace, at Chester-le-street, was known to exist ; and he mentions, but not
as of his own knowledge, another source of supply as about being brought

forward into notice from the spoil and waste of the lead-mines in Weardale,

" which are now worked and have been so for ages." He says, " The rider

of the lead-ore is a true carbonate of iron, some of it yielding from 25

Ato 40 per cent.  small blast-furnace has been erected at Stanhope, where

a very important and interesting experiment has been made, and a suc-

cessful result obtained, in which this rider ironstone has been smelted, and

pig-iron of a strong and excellent quality produced. This ore, even after

being ground and washed, still contains some particles of galena, and which

in smelting gives out at the furnace-top a heavy cloud of sulphurous smoke,

of a forbidding aspect. The pig-iron, however, when remelted, yields no

smoke from its surface, which would be the case if a small quantity of me-

tallic lead were thrown in, from which it may be inferred that the lead is in

the process of smelting entirely dissipated and driven off. What effect may

be produced upon the conversion of this iron into bar-iron remains to be de-

termined. The result of this experiment has been deemed so satisfactory as

to induce the company to erect large smelting-works about three miles from

Wolsingham. These works consist of two powerful blast-engines and six

large blast-furnaces. In this enterprise we shall by and by behold the spoil

of ancient mines, which has reposed for ages, brought to light, no longer as a

useless, but as a useful material for the production of the common and ordi-

nary sorts of pig-iron. Great and beneficial results are calculated upon, and

should they be realized, will no doubt contribute greatly to the produce of

our iron manufacture."

Other authorities do not speak so hopefully of this discovery, and certain

it is, that of the six blast-furnaces of which Mr. Mushet speaks, only three

Ahave hitherto been erected, and only one of these is lighted.  great part

of the furnaces now existing in Durham are chiefly employed in reducing

ores procured from Whitby and from Scotland, and occasionally small quan-

tities of hematite ore are procured from Devonshire and from Cumberland.

There is a considerable quantity of ironstone of the argillaceous kind in the

eastern division of Durham, but it is for the most part found at inaccessible

depths, or in such positions of dislocation as to render the cost of working it
too great. At a place called Shottley-bridge, about fifteen miles west of

Newcastle, where the ore is plentiful and very accessible, there have been

eight furnaces at work for some time, and six others are now about to be

lighted. The argillaceous ironstone found at that place resembles in quality

the ironstone of Staffordshire. This is the only portion of the county of

Durham in which it has hitherto been found practicable to make iron in any

large quantity with materials wholly found on the spot. I have a list of

twenty-two furnaces now in blast in the two counties of Durham and North-

umberland yielding weekly 1895 tons of pig-iron, equal to a yearly produc-

tion of 94',750 tons, the quantity made in 1843 having been estimated at

25,750 tons, and in 1844 to only 21,250 tons. In various localities in North-

umberland there is abundance of clay-ironstone in the immediate vicinity of

plenty of excellent coal and limestone, and in the course of years large quan-

tities of iron may be made in that district. The great obstacle to any sudden

increase there and elsewhere is offered, as already mentioned, by the difficulty

of procuring skilled labour. Any addition to the number of coal-miners can
                                --

           ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN. 109

be made only by slow degrees, and the same condition applies to all other
classes of persons whose labour is required for the manufacture of iron. It
is hopeless to stimulate the exertions of the persons already employed. They
are naturally ready enough to exact higher rates of wages when the demand
for their labour becomes more urgent, but succeeding in this they prefer to
obtain the same amount of earnings, with higher rates of wages, to the secu-
ring of greater gains by the exertion of even the same amount of toil, so that
a greater urgency in the demand may be, and frequently is, accompanied by
a lessened production.

   Under these circumstances, how the enormous demand existing and to arise
from carrying out the railway schemes already sanctioned is to be met, it
would be most difficult to say. The laying down of these lines and providing
them with the needful working stock of carriages, &c. would absorb all the
iron which it is reasonable to expect will be made in Great Britain during
the next three years, and it affords no satisfactory solution of this difficulty to
say that the quantity required will only be called for progressively, and that
the demand will be spread over the same three years. To render this circum-
stance effective, we should be assured that no further projects will be sanc-
tioned during the time spent in their construction, an assurance for which
we can hardly look, and even then we should be left without a ton of iron
applicable to the thousand other purposes for which this metal is so indis-
pensable. If the difficulty presented by the want of larbour could be sur-
mounted, there appears no rational ground for supposing that we should, for
a very long time to come, experience any deficiency in the means for making
iron. In the anthracite coal district of South Wales, where clay-ironstone is
thickly interstratified with the coal seams, there appears to be no reason to
doubt that if the means employed in the anthracite district of America for
smelting the clay-ironstone Avere adopted, it would prove equally successful.
The difficulty consists in the sluggish nature of anthracite, which requires a
more rapid draught than can be provided by the ordinary means of bellows
and tall chimneys; and this is overcome in America by obtaining a great
volume of air by means oifanners. The iron made with raw anthracite coals
has been found by Mr. Mushet to be much stronger than iron made with
coke, and after a variety of experiments, the earlier of which afforded but
small encouragement, this fuel has been adopted by the proprietors of twenty-
three furnaces, who avail themselves of only the ordinary means for providing
a blast. The manner in which the railway demand has already limited other
uses of iron, may be gathered from the following extract from a letter of
recent date written to me by Mr. Mushet :

   " At the above period (1840) merchant bar-iron, boiler-plate, sheet-iron
and rod- iron, principally occupied our mills ; but these of late, particularly in
South Wales, have given way in a great measure to the manufacture of
railway bars, so as to eclipse in a striking manner the varied and extensive
assortments required by the merchants' demands." The long period of dul-
ness that intervened between 1839 and the beginning of 1845, accompanied
as it was by a continued fall in the market price of iron, caused this metal to
be applied, most advantageously, to a variety of new purposes, from which it
will be prejudicial henceforth to withdraw it. In a well-known mercantile
circular letter issued in February ISiS by Messrs. Jevons of Liverpool, it is
stated that there had arisen " a new and increasing demand for iron roofs,
iron houses, and fire-proof buildings in Liverpool," and that during the year
then just passed upwards of 20,000 tons of cast and wrought iron had been
so used iu that town. These gentlemen further stated that preparations were
going forward for the erection of still more extensive ranges of buildings of
--1 10 REPORT 1846.

similar construction during 184-5, and that the sailing-ships and steam-vessels

then under construction in that port would require 25,000 tons of plate-iron

and angle-iron.

The employment of iron for the purpose last mentioned, that of ship-

building, has already been an object of very great national importance. The

extent to which this use for the metal may be carried in future years it is

not possible to foresee, but we may base upon even our present limited ex-

perience the hope that by this means our furnaces and forges may be pro-

vided with some employment when our system of railways shall be completed.

The tonnage of mercantile shipping belonging to the British empire in 1845

was 3,7]4',061 tons, and exceeded the amount in existence in 1814 by

1,097,096 tons, but during that interval there were built and registered ships

amounting in their measurement to. 5,476,957 tons, so that there were required

to be built ships of the aggregate burthen of 4,379,861 tons, in order to re-

pair the waste occasioned by wear and tear and by losses : altogether the

building of ships has gone forward at the average rate of 176,676 tons

yearly. Assuming for the moment that this same rate of building will be

called for in future years, and that the whole of the mercantile shipping con-

structed would be built of iron, this would prove a very insufficient substitute

for the demand now existing for railway purposes. I have before me a

statement of the weight of iron used in building eight large sea-going steam-

vessels, the aggregate measurement of which was 5922 tons, by which it is

shown that the metal used was 2877 tons weight, or 9 cwt. 2 qrs. 24 lbs. for

each ton of measurement, and at this rate the construction of 176,676 tons of

shipping in each year would provide a market for no more than 85,814 tons

Weof wrought iron, equal to 115,849 tons of pig-iron.  cannot suppose,

however great may be the advantages attendant upon the substitution of iron

for timber in ship-building, that this use of the latter material will be all at

once, or indeed for many years, abandoned. There are many existing inter-

ests opposed to the change, and there is much of prejudice still to be over-

Wecome before all our merchant-ships will be built of iron.  must likewise

bear in mind the now well-established fact, that iron ships are far more durable
than those built of timber, that they require much less repair, and that they

are less subject to accident and to loss. It cannot be necessary, however, to

enlarge upon this subject, since the Association has already been favoured

--by Mr. Fairbairn at one of its former meetings that held at Glasgow in

--1840 with a valuable paper upon the subject.

Placing this subject in another point of view, may we not however feel

justified in believing, that when opposing interests shall have been silenced,

and existing prejudices shall be overcome, and the fast increasing commerce

of this country shall have experienced some degree of that development

which is expected to spring from late changes in our commercial legislation,

the rate of increase hitherto sufficient to supply the waste of our mercantile

marine, and to provide what has been necessary for its inci'ease, will no longer
suffice to that end, and that although our iron ships may outlast by three or

four times the less durable vessels now constructed, and through all their

existence may call for little or no materials to be used for their repair, that
the necessity for additional shipping may in great part prove an equivalent

for the lessened demand otherwise arising?

The building of iron ships is at this time proceeding at a greater rate than

at any previous moment since their first introduction, although the price of

iron has so materially advanced, and this should give us the assurance that

when, as we may expect it will happen, the falling off of railway demand, or

the exertions of our iron-masters, shall have restored the equilibrium between
ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN. Ill

aupply and demand, and the price shall again have become more moderate,

an impetus will be given to the production of shipping, not alone for the
uses of our own merchants, but for carrying on the trade and navigation of

other countries. The cost of our shipping will then be so materially reduced,

both their first cost and the expense of their maintenance, that the objection

so often and unfortunately so successfully offered by our shipowners to any

relaxations in our commercial code affecting their business, that the greater

cheapness with which shipping can be produced in foreign countries prevents

their successfully competing with ships of those countries, can no longer be

urged with any plausibility ; but on the contrary, tliat ships of English con-

struction will then be the cheapest in the world. It has been said that fluc-

tuations in the price of iron do not cause any considerable difference in the

cost of iron vessels, so large a proportion of their whole cost consisting in

Alabour.  reduction of 20s. per ton in the price of the material will, how-

ever, cause an oeconomy of 10s. per measurement ton in the cost of the ship,

and it will hardly be said that the very possible rise or fall of 31. or 4:1. per

ton in the price of iron plates is an immaterial circumstance to the ship-

builder. But the cheapness here spoken of will no doubt be principally

found in the greater durability and the insignificant cost of repairs of metal

ships.

  A statement was inserted a few months ago in a Scotch newspaper, giving

the particulars of the iron ships then under construction in the Clyde ; they
amounted to twenty-four in number, and were of the aggregate burthen of

14,032 tons (see Appendix No. 8). These were all steam -vessels, to which

class of shipping iron has hitherto been principally applied, although there is
no reason for supposing that it is not equally applicable to every description

of naval architecture. The reason for this circumstance may probably be

found in the fact, that the construction and employment of steam-vessels has,
for the most part, been undertaken by persons not previously interested in
shipping, and who consequently had no prejudice or habit to overcome in

their choice of material.

   This statement, imperfect as it necessarily is, would be more glaringly so
if it did not present some particulars of our external iron trade.

   So recently as the beginning of the present century more than two-fifths
of all the iron used in this kingdom was imported from the north of Europe.
Foreign metal was then used for very many of the purposes to which iron
was at that time generally applied in England, and it was so used indiscrimi-

nately with British iron. In 1806 the use of foreign iron had been lessened

by nearly one-third, while the home production was so increased as to form

seven-eighths of the quantity used. In a few years after our make was be-
yond our own wants, and foreign iron ceased to be imported for any pur-
poses to which the produce of our own forges could be applied. Thence-
forward our demands have been confined to metal of the qualities from which
alone steel can be made. Our exports of British iron have, on the contrary,
increased progressively, and have now become an object of great national
importance. The statement given in the Appendix, No. 9 shows the yearly
progress of the trade since 1827 up to the year 1845 inclusive. It will be
seen on consulting this statement, that the quantity had increased from 92,313
tons in 1827 to 351,978 tons in 18-t5, and that the declared value of the

Ashipments advanced in that interval from г1,215,561 to г3,501,895.

column has been added to the table, exhibiting the average value per ton of
all forms of iron exported in each year, from which it will be seen how great
an influence price has, in its advance and its diminution, upon the lessening
or increase of our exports. In 1840, when the average value appears to have
 112 REPORT 1846.

 been 9/. 85. 2d., the quantity of British iron exported was 268,328 tons. The
 price in the following years fell rapidly, and the demands from other countries
 increased as rapidly. In ISIS, when the average price is represented by
 51. 15s. 5d. per ton, the exports were 448,925 tons. In 1844 the quantity was
 slightly increased, viz. to 458,745 tons, although the price had advanced to

 6/. 195. 2c?. per ton ; but in 1845, the further advance in the average declared
 value to 9^. 18s. llrf. per ton, reduced our foreign shipments to 351,978 tons,
 or by more than 23 per cent.

    It is worthy of remark, that we now export largely, more largely than in
 former periods we ever imported from the same quarter, iron in its crude
 state, and articles manufactured with the same, to the countries whence we
 once drew the largest proportion of what was used by us. In 1844 our ship-
 ments of iron, in its various forms, to the north of Europe amounted to
 178,635 tons, equal probably to 200,000 tons of pig-iron ; and in 1845, not-
 withstanding the great speculative demand and rise in price at home, our
 shipments amounted to 140,006 tons, equal probably to 160,000 of pig-iron.
 In those two years the whole of our colonies and dependencies took from us,
 in 1844, 78,594 tons; and in 1845, 60,683 tons.

     Our largest customers are found in the United States of America, and it
 is probable that they will long continue to be so, unless the citizens of those
 states in which materials for producing iron are found should be unduly
 stimulated to increase their home production through the existence of high
prices in this countiy. An increased demand from that quarter is expected
 when the more liberal tariff recently passed at Washington shall come into
 operation, but it is clear that the realising of that expectation must depend
 greatly upon the state of markets in this country (see Appendix, No. 11).

   A writer of the protectionist school, in an article inserted in the ' National
Magazine,' published in New York in July 1845, states that the make of iron

in the United States in that year from 540 blast-furnaces would amount to
486,000 tons, and that the domestic supply would ere long be brought to

meet the entire wants of the country. New furnaces and rolling-mills are,

according to this writer, being erected in every direction, and those works
that had been inopei'ative and unproductive, from the low prices of iron in
1843 and 1844, were again at work, so that it might soon be unnecessary to
import a ton of the metal from Europe. With a moderate price in England

we need not put much faith in this assertion, which was put forth as an in-
ducement to Congress to add to the high protection then afforded by the
tariff, but which is now reduced.

    France, notwithstanding the exorbitant duties charged on importation,
takes from us a considerable and constantly increasing quantity of this metal
(see Appendix, No. 12), and although the production of pig-iron in that
country has increased from about 220,000 tons in 1831 to about 420,000
tons in 1843, and is still increasing, the want of a sufficient supply of this
all-important metal is severely felt in that country, and the high price is
found to weigh grievously upon various branches of industry. In particular

a cry has been raised, which it is expected may be successful, in favour of

the admission, free of duty, of plate-iron suitable for ship-building, but tiie

eagerness now shown to obtain this concession will be much abated should
the price of the material advance in any great degree in England. At this
time we are certainly not in any condition to meet the demand that might
come upon us should that concession be made by the French Chambers.

   With the exception of England, Sweden appears to be the only country
which has or can be expected to have any disposable quantity of iron for export-
ation, and it does not seem likely that we shall be a customer for any, except
         ON THE IRON MANUFACTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN. 113

that which we need for converting into steel, to which use Swedish iron is

peculiarly applicable, and for which its high price causes it to be reserved. To

Russia our shipments of this metal are fully equal to the quantity imported

thence.

   After much consideration given to the circumstances in which our iron
manufacture is now placed, and to its prospects for the future, I venture,
with some hesitation, to oifer the following opinion.

   Legislative sanction has been given in this and the two preceding years
to the construction of many thousand miles of new railways, in the comple-

tion of which so many interests are engaged, that we must not expect any

Weconsiderable portion of them to be abandoned by their projectors.  must

for this reason expect that for some few years to come, during which these

works will be going forward, the price of iron will be high. The tendency

of this high price will be, to give an impetus to the manufacture, and to cause

much new capital to be invested for its extension, for which ample opportu-

nity presents itself in different localities, although in other places, as in

Staffordshire, where the manufacture has hitherto flourished, there is more

reason to expect diminution than increase, owing to a failure in the supply

of materials. The great obstacle to the forming of new establishments, and

to the extension of those already in operation, consists in the difficulty of

procuring the necessary amount of labour, miners, furnace- men and others.

This obstacle will, however, be gradually and progressively lessened, and
when the present exaggerated railway demand shall have ceased, as it must

necessarily do through the completion of the lines which alone can be pro-

fitably opened, and the demand thence arising for iron shall be limited to

-- --the quantity still, however, considerable which will be needed for keep-

ing the lines in repair (see App. No. 13), we shall find ourselves in posses-
sion of means for making iron much beyond what have at any previous time

existed, and very greatly beyond any probable demand to arise from other

and existing channels of employment at home, or from foreign countries.

The price will consequently fall, as it has done at former times and under

Weanalogous circumstances.  shall then find that this metal will again be

employed in uses from which it may have been excluded by the previous

high price. From the improvements already made, and from others which
we may expect will be introduced into the processes of manufacture, we may

even find that the market price will fall to a lower point than has hitherto

been witnessed, and new uses may in consequence be discovered whereto to

apply this metal. All this, however, must be the work of time, and it seems

but too probable that in the meanwhile our iron-masters will have to undergo

a somewhat lengthened season of adversity, for the enduring of which they

are in a measure prepared by former experience.

to the chairman of a railway company. The quantities are greater than are com-
monly assigned, but an abatement of 25 per cent, would not disturb the calculation
made by me (page 109) ; and when provision is made for maintaining in repair the
railways now open, it would absorb all the iron which will probably be made in the
next four years, to construct, at that abatement of 25 per cent., the lines now sanc-

tioned by Parliament.

                          Third Report on Atmospheric Waves.

                      By William Radcliff Birt.

The two former Reports which I have had the honour to present to the Asso-

ciation necessarily possessed a fragmentary character. Sir John Herschel,
in his Report on Meteorological Reductions (1843), distinctly traced two
well-defined atmospheric waves which passed over the British Isles and the
west of Europe, one in September 1836, the other in December 1837. These
may be regarded as the earliest instances of our detecting and clearly appre-
hending the character of the atmospheric undulations constantly traversing
our oceans and continents, and mark the commencement of that sera in atmo-
spheric research to which Mr. Forbes alluded in his Report on the Recent
Progress and Present State of Meteorology, presented to the Association in
1832, when he said, " The great extent of country over which the accidental
variations of the barometer take place, is one of their most striking features
and in a future and more advanced state of meteorology we may be able to
draw the most interesting and important conclusions from the great atmo-
spheric tidal waves which are thus perpetually traversing oceans and conti-

nents."

   Sir John Herschel, in the conclusion of the report to which allusion has
been made, noticed the larger fluctuations which I had observed in the
autumn of 1842, especially the symmetrical wave which occupied thirteen
days in November for its complete rise and fall. The curves representing
these larger undulations were appended to Sir John Herschel's report ; and
the Association, under the direction of the Magnetical Committee and the

immediate superintendence of Sir John, entrusted me with the further in-
120 REPORT--1846.

 vestigation of these waves, especially that of November. The mode of in-
 vestigation and the partial results arrived at during the period between the
sittings of the Association in 1843 and 184'4' form the subject of my first re-
 port, which, as before stated, must be regarded only as a fragment.

    During the further investigation of the wave of November various obser-
 vations came to hand, which appeared to throw considerable light on the
 general character of atmospheric undulations. The publication of the Green-
 wich and Toronto observations afforded an interesting comparison of the
 passages of certain maxima at these distant stations, and by extending this
 comparison to Prague and Munich, several interesting features of certain
 secondary waves during the transit of a supposed normal wave appeared so
 clearly to be made out, that it was deemed desirable to include the whole of

 this comparison in the succeeding report, rather than run the risk of its being
 lost by deferring it until after the examination of the great wave should be
 completed. Another most interesting result arrived at about this time, was
 the recurrence of the great Avave of November. The return of this interest-
 ing phaanomenon appeared so strikingly distinct in 1843 and 184'4, that to
 have omitted noticing it in the Report would have greatly contributed to re-
 tard the inquiry. It accordingly forms the second section of the Report of
 1845. These circumstances, with the further investigation of the great wave

of November 1842, give to the second report a more fragmentary character.
     Previous to entering on the immediate subject of the present report, it will

be desirable to review the steps that have been taken for observing the great
symmetrical wave on its return in 1845; and also to notice any other cir-

cumstance that may have transpired during the past year at all calculated to
throw any light on the subject of our investigations. With regard to the first
point, certain instructions were drawn up, w^hich were forwarded to gentle-
men interested in meteorological research, and otherwise circulated, in con-
sequence of Avhich a number of interesting and valuable observations were
obtained. The results of the examination of these observations, as far as it

has yet proceeded, will form the first part of the present report. In the Phi-
losophical Magazine for April in the present year Mr. Brown published a
voluminous paper on the oscillations of the barometer, with particular refer-
ence to the meteorological phasnomena of November 1842, the month in
which I first observed the great symmetrical wave. This paper is accom-
panied by diagrams representing the direction of the wind in England, Scot-

land and Ireland every day, from the 1st to the 26th inclusive. Upon a very

careful perusal of it, I found that the observations, as given in the diagrams,
very beautifully illustrated Prof. Dove's theory of parallel currents or alter-
nately disposed beds of oppositely directed winds, and appeared to throw so
clear a light on the real character of the atmospheric undulations, that I was
induced to enter upon a very careful examination of the barometric obser-
vations in connexion with the diagrams of the wind. The result of this ex-
amination has been to give the inquiry a completeness which it was before

destitute of. It was previously difficult to define the real notion we formed
of an atmospheric wave ; not so much from the distribution of pressure over
a tract of country gradually decreasing on each side a line of maxima, as

from the relation of the aerial currents or winds to this distribution of
pressure of which we were to a certain extent ignorant. The examination
of these observations has exhibited very clearly tlie distribution of the aerial
currents in relation to the distribution of pressure, and enabled us to define
the nature of an atmospheric wave both as regards its undulatory and mole-
cular motion. This definition, with the examination of the observations,
forms the second part of this report.

                Part I. Recurrence of Symmetrical Wave.

   The following were the instructions drawn up for observing the Great
Symmetrical Wave on its return in IS^S.

   " The recurrence of the great November Wave observed in ISi^ (an en-

graving of which is inserted in the Report of the Thirteenth Meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science), during the autumns of
1843 and 1844, renders the barometric movements of the months of October
and November highly interesting. It is accordingly proposed that meteoi'o-
logical observations, on a similar plan, should be made as extensively as pos-
sible, with a view to observe this particular wave; and meteorologists are

invited to direct their particular attention to the oscillations of the barometer
during the months above-named.

    " Times of Observation.
   " The following hours are the most suitable for the object now in view
3 A.M., 9 a.m., 3 P.M. and 9 p.m.; these hours divide the day into four equal
parts ; they have been recommended by the Royal Society as meteorological
hours, and are the hours at which observations are made daily, by direction
and under the superintendence of the Honourable the Corporation of the
Trinity House, which have been most advantageously used in the examina-

tion of atmospheric waves.

   " In cases, however, in which the observation at 3 a.m. may be inconve-

nient or impracticable, it will be important to substitute for it two observa-
tions, one at midnight and the other at 6 in the morning, so that the hours of
observation will in such cases be 6 a.m., 9 a.m., 3 p.m., 9 p.m. and midnight.

   " To individuals who cannot command these hours, it is recommended
that observations should be made as near them as possible ; these will still be
valuable, although not to so [great an extent as those made at the regular

hours. In these cases, however, it will be absolutely necessary to substitute

--two readings for every one of the regular hours omitted one previous to,

the other succeeding the hour so omitted ; and these should, if possible, in-
clude an equal interval both before and after such hour. In all cases the
exact hour and minute of mean time at the place of observation should be
inserted in its appropriate column in the form sent herewith.

fix upon, in accordance with the foregoing instructions, it will be necessary
to observe,

--house observations, and to Rear-Admiral Beaufort, R.N., for the observations made on board

the surveying vessels. W. R. B.

   These observations, which were principally undertaken with a view to ob-
serve the return of the great wave, have been attended with highly interesting
results. I shall first notice the result of the comparison of the observations at
this station (Cambridge Heath) with those made at Leicester Square in IS-tS,
as fully establishing not only the return of the great wave, but also that of

other extensive undulations.

--Section I. Comparison of observations made at Cambridge Heath (north-

   east of London) from Oct. 1, lSi5 to Nov. 21, 1845, with observations

   made at Leicester Square from Sept. 14, 1842 to Nov. 25, 1842.

   The observations of 1842 are projected in curves and appended to Sir John
Herschel's 'Report on Meteorological Reductions,' 1843.

    1842. I. Plate I. fig. 1 (Report 1843) exhibits an undulation consisting of
a gentle barometric fall and almost as gentle a rise during seventeen days,
namely from Sept. 14 to Oct. 1, interrupted only by the diurnal oscillations,
which are in general well-developed.

    1845. In 1845 this undulation of seventeen days' interval returned. It
was observed from Oct. 1 (the commencement of the observations) to the
19th, but instead of exhibiting the gentle fall and ascent noticed in 1842, it
was interrupted by two most remarkable superposed waves. The first oc-
curred on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of October, and the second from the 11th to

the 16th.

  When these waves (the commencement and termination of each being well-

marked) are abstracted from the general curve, the resemblance between the

curves of 1842 and 1845 is very apparent.

                1842. September 14 to October 1.

                1845. October                      1 to October 19.

II. The curves of the succeeding four days in the two periods 1842 and

1845 exhibit similar barometric fluctuations, so that the movements during

the four days succeeding the seventeen-day wave in 1845 are identical with

those of the four days succeeding the same wave in 1842.

III. The exact identity between the curves of 1842 and 1845 breaks off

on Oct. 23, 1845. The barometer maintains an elevation above thirty inches

during the period in 1845 that the movements are not in accordance with

those of 1842,

IV. Plate I, fig. 3 (Report 1843). The identity between the curves of

1842 and 1845 again commences on Oct. 27, 1845, and is maintained in a
very close manner until midnight of Nov. 6.

1842. October 31, midnight to November 11, noon.

1845. October 27, noon to November 6, midnight.

V. In consequence of the movements from Oct. 27 to Nov. 6, 1845, ex-

hibiting so close a similarity to those between Oct. 31 and Nov. 11 in 1842

which immediately preceded the great wave in that year, considerable ex-

pectation was raised that the great wave M'ould set in on the morning of the

7th. At midnight of the 6th, the similarity between the curves that had been

so closely maintained during ten days and a half began to fail, and rendered

it difficult to determine for some days if the preceding movements had really

been followed by the great wave. This question was set at rest as the obser-

vations proceeded; for on comparing the curve from the 6th to the 21st with

that of the great wave of Nov. 1842 (Plate II., Report 1843), there was every
Nov.
ON ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.  125

 during the seventeen-day undulation of Oct. 1 to 19, 18^5, having their re-
spective maxima on the 5th, 10th, and 14th. Taking the same vertical or-

dinates in each curve, we have the epochs of the troughs of the first superposed
waves nearly similar but separated by an interval of civil reckoning of four-
teen and a half days ; that is, the gentle undulation of the last half of September
occurred a fortnight later, and the superposed waves indicating the disturbed
state of the atmosphere, and characterizing the period of greater barometric os-
cillation, came rolling on a fortnight earlier ; the two coinciding and producing
the compound curve really observed. The first of these superposed waves
being about half the size of the corresponding wave in 184<2, passed its maxi'

mum about a day and a half earlier, and a small wave succeeding it brought

the minimum on the same vertical line as that of 1842. In a similar manner
the largest superposed wave in 1 845 culminated at a later period of the normal
wave than the smaller wave of 1842. In consequence of these different rela-
tions of the superposed waves of 1842 and 1845, the two apices were much
nearer in 1842 than in 1845.

    From these remarks it appears that, taking the barometric movements from
 Sept. 14, 1842 to Nov. 25 of the same year, containing two undulations of
seventeen days' interval, and comparing them with those from Oct. 1 to Nov.

21 of 1845, only one undulation of seventeen days' interval was observed in
the latter year, namely from Oct. 1 to 19 ; that this undulation was not of the
gentle flowing character manifested by that from Sept. 14 to Oct. 1, 1842,
but was interrupted by the same number of superposed waves as that from
 Oct. 14 to 31, 1842; and that this state of things was brought about by the
later occurrence of the normal wave, and the earlier occurrence of the super-

posed waves. Of the two seventeen-day undulations of 1842 the first (Sept.

 14 to Oct. 1) returned in 1845.
     VIII. In addition to the absence of the second seventeen-day interval, Oct.

 14 to 31, 1842, in the observations of 1845 ; the preceding movements, Oct. 6
to 13, 1842 (the barometer attaining a considerable altitude), were not ob-

served in 1845.
    IX. During the period from Oct. 1 to Nov. 21 in 1845, the barometric

movements of Oct. 23 to 26 were the only oscillations that appeared to have
no corresponding movements in 1842.

    X. The distinctness with which the great wave commenced in 1842 and
 1845, and the breaking off of the exact similarity between the curve of the
preceding ten and a half days which had been so closely maintained just as
the wave commenced in 1845, exhibit this interesting phaenomenon in all its
individuality, and completely separate it from all the preceding barometric
movements.

    XI. The individuality which is thus given to the great wave, the distinct-
ness of its essential features, the close resemblance of its curves in 1842, 1843
and 1845, and the closer relations existing between those of 1842 and 1845,
induce the strong belief that we have obtained the ti/pe of the barometric
oscillations during the middle portion of November. This type I propose to

 express in the following language.

    "That during fourteen days in November more or less equally disposed about
the middle of the month, the oscillations of the barometer exhibit a remarkably

symmetrical character, that is to say, the fall succeeding the transit of the

maximum or highest reading, is to a great extent similar to the preceding

rise. This rise and fall is not continuous or unbroken ; in three out of four
of the occasions on which it has been observed, it has been found to consist of
Jive distinct elevations. The complete rise and fall has been termed the great
symmetrical barometric wave of November, and as such has been considered
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

126 REPORT--1846.

to result from the transit of a large wave ; but there is great reason to believe
that while it may be due to the transit of a normal wave of about fourteen
days' amplitude, it also exhibits the transits ofJive secondary superposed waves
of a similar character to those riding on the wave of seventeen days' interval,
Oct. 1 to 19 (VII.). The great November wave consequently possesses a com-
pound character : at its setting-in the barometer is generally loio, sometimes
below twenty-nine inches. This depression is succeeded by two well-marked
undulations, varying from one to two days in duration. Thecentral undulation,
which also forms the apex of the gi'eat wave, is of larger extent, occupying
from three to five days ; when this has passed, two smaller undulations, cor-
responding to those at the commencement of the wave, make their appearance,
and at the close of the last the wave terminates." This was the order of
things in 1842, 1843 and 1845. The smaller undulations in these instances
were not identical, that is, they did not occur on the same points of the wave
in each case ; but the two preceding and the two succeeding undulations to
the larger or central one were well-marked ; the physiognomy of the wave was

readily recognized.

   The wave of 1844 exhibited a striking departure from this type in two re-
markable particulars ; the epoch of transit and compound form of wave. The
epoch was considerably earlier than in 1842, 1843 or 1845, namely Oct. 27;
and the compound form consisted only of thee instead of Jive undulations.
The symmetry however was very apparent. This departure from]the November
type may probably be connected with the earlier occurrence of the wave
future observations will doubtless make us acquainted with its cause.

   XII. Capt. Larcom of the Royal Engineers has most obligingly forwarded
me, in addition to the observations made during the months of Oct., Nov. and
Dec. 1845, curves of the barometric undulations observed at Dublin during
the Novembers of 1829 to 1845 inclusive. These curves are so admirably cal-
culated to confirm or disprove the views advanced in XI., that I avail myself of
his permission to lay them before you ; and I beg to acknowledge the great
obligations I am under to that oflicer for the valuable assistance he has rendered
me inthisinquiry, both with respect to the immediate subject now under discus-
sion (the great wave), and the return of the other extensive undulations before
alluded to, which are admirably illustrated by the curves with which he has
furnished me, and which I have much pleasure in submitting to the Association.

Review of the essential features of the Great Symmetrical Barometric Wave,
    as exhibited in a series of Curves representing the Barometric Undulations
   as observed at Dublin (Mount Joy, Ordnance Survey Office, Phoenix Park)
    during the Novembers of 1829 to 1845 inclusive.

   [It may be well to notice, previous to proceeding with this review, that

Dublin is not constantly situated in the line of greatest symmetry. In 1842
it appeared to form one of the points in the line, but the observations of Nov.
1845 have shown that this line is 7iot stable. The line of greatest symmetry
appeared on that occasion to coincide to a great extent with the southern
coast of England, so that Dublin was thrown to the north of it. It is pro-
bable this line has a sort of oscillatory motion, and this may to a great ex-
tent explain the nodal character of Brussels as a barometric station, the fixed
point in the line being not far removed from that city. The departure from
symmetry on many of the returns of the great wave at Dublin, may readily
be accounted for by the line of greatest symmetry being considerably removed
from thence.]

    1829. The great wave very distinct; the two anterior undulations well-
marked, the two posterior not so distinct.

resembled that of 184?2 ; the two anterior and two posterior undulations well-

developed.

   The trough succeeding one of the posterior undulations is deeper than the

posterior trough of the great wave, a circumstance that occurred in the year
1845 at this station (Dublin). The similarity between the transits of the
great wave in 1829 and 1832, especially as to time, is highly interesting.

depressions of the seventh and twenty-first as the anterior and posterior troughs,
and regarding the movements between these epochs as due to the great wave,

although greatly concealed by the strongly developed subordinate waves, we
may regard the whole as a transit of the great wave at a station considerably
removed from the line of greatest symmetry ; the two anterior subordinate
waves are strongly marked ; the posterior appear to be broken into a numbel-

of smaller undulations.

replacing the great wave, they are characterized by the most remarkable

absence of the central undulation forming its crest ; two of the subordinate
undulations, equally posited with regard to the anterior and posterior troughs,

are strongly and strikingly developed; and where the central undulation

should have occurred, raising the apex above thirty inches, a great depression

is seen.

the gseat wave and that of ISiS during the same period is very striking ; the
antenbr slopes in each case are almost representatives of each other ; the two
subordinate waves on the anterior slopes are so nearly identical as to leave no

doubt of the movements of 1842 being a most decided return of those of 1 838
the similarity of the subordinate waves on the posterior slopes is not so distinct,
the two are however well-marked. One striking difference between the
curves must nevertheless be noticed ; in 1838 the anterior trough was lowest,
in 1842 the posterior was lowest.

A1839. The great wave in this year is very difficult to recognize.               maxi-

mum was passed on the 23rd, subordinate waves were developed on each

side this maximum. There appears to be some similarity in the movements

of this year to those of 1830, the subordinate waves are however not so

distinct.  Transit of apex, Nov. 23.

1 840. In this year also the great wave is difficult to detect unless the broad

maximum of the 26th forms its crest, in which case the posterior slope runs into

December ; this is borne out by the Greenwich observations, they however ex-

hibit a large development of one of the subordinate waves on the posterior slope.

In the following table all the above features are collected. The amplitudes

(in all cases except two being of the same extent, namely fourteen days)

strongly confirm the views advanced. These views receive still greater con-

firmation from the epochs of the transits of the crests, which are arranged

according to the days of the month on which they occurred in Table III.

Comparison of contemporaneous observations of the return of the Great
                                             Wave, Nov. \S^5.

   Of the observations that have come to hand, the following have been pro-
jected in curves in order to exhibit the characters of the great wave at various

and distant stations ; the epoch of the curves are Nov. 6 to 22, the duration
of the great wave.

Scilly.      London.              Birmingham.
             Yarmouth.
Helstone.                         Stokesley.

St. Catherine's Puint. Haisboro.  Belfast.

Portsmouth.  Heligoland.          Galway.

   These stations being considerably less than half the number from which
observations have been received, it would be premature to draw any conclu-
sions from a comparison of the curves, as well as appearing to give a preference

to certain observations to the exclusion of others which have been executed
with gi'eat care and fidelity, and from which in connection with the whole
the most valuable results are likely to be arrived at. Every exertion would have
been made to have completed the rough projection in curves of all the ob-
servations made during the transit of the great wave, in order to have sub-

mitted to the present meeting a first approximation to its general characters

as exhibited at a diversity of stations, had not the publication of Mr. Brown's

paper directed my attention to the arrangement of the aerial currents over the

area of the British Isles during the transit of the great wave of Nov. 1842,

the value of which I have alluded to in my introductory remarks.
   It may however be important on this head to report the progress made, and

to notice a few particulars merely as indicating the course pursued and the
highly important results likely to be obtained from a complete discussion of

the observations, not only for the period during the transit of the great wave,

but also during the two months over which the observations extend. The
curves are susceptible of a variety of arrangements, according as it may be
deemed desirable to exhibit certain characteristic features of the normal or
secondary waves. In submitting the projected curves to your notice on this

--occasion, I have selected that arrangement best calculated to exhibit, first,

the symmetrical character of the wave, and secondly, the direction in which
this symmetrical character is most departed from.

   The first two curves (Scilly and Helstone) are characterized by ^Aree periods
of barometric readings of nearly the same value (slightly above twenty-nine
inches), occurring on the 7th, 11th and 19th ; between the 11th and 19th we
find the central undulation forming the crest. The Helstone curve gives the
greatest symmetrical arrangement. From these curves we may conclude that
Scilly, and especially jHe/stowe, were situated near the line of greatest symmetry.

It is desirable particularly to notice, that at these stations the depressions of

the 7th and 11th are about equal ; there appears to have been no fallfrom the

commencement of the wave to the depression of the 11th. Two distinct and

well-marked waves (the two at the commencement of the great wave) are

very discernible.

    The next two curves, St. Catherine's Point (Isle of Wight) and Portsmouth,
nearly agree with the two preceding, especially in the depressions of the 1 1th
and 19th being of equal value. There is however a marked difference be-
tween these curves and those of Scilly and Helstone, in the two anterior waves
being less developed, and the barometer e-s.h\h\iing a fallfrom the commence-
ment of the great wave to the depression of the 1 1 th ; and this fall is not only
traced towards the E.N.E. through the stations London, Yarmouth and Har-
                                                                          --;

wich, Haisboro and Heligoland, but it increases in value as we approach
the N.E. Now this state of things would result from a large wave passing

from W.S.W., the posterior slope from Heligoland to Scilly. The readings

for contemporaneous epochs at each E.N.E. station would be higher, and the

fall greater. Taking the Helstone curve as the type of greatest symmetry

consisting in the equality of the three depressions above named, and the whole

--of the readings being above these depressions, we have St. Catherine's

Point and Portsmouth slightly departing from this symmetry, in the move-

ments from the 7th to the 1 1th being thrown higher than those at Scilly and

Helstone.

The curves in which we have traced the increase of the fall from the 7th

to the 11th, exhibit a much greater departure from symmetry, in the depres-

sion of the 19th being lower than that of the 11th; and this difference in-

creases in the order in which the curves are arranged, viz. London, Yarmouth,

Haisboro, and Heligoland ; and so great is this difference in the last three

curves, that when combined with the fall from the 7th to the 11th, the baro-

metric movements (abstracting the secondary waves) are of a downward

character, that is, from the 7th to the 19th at these stations the tendency in

the mercurial column is to fall very slowly and gently. At Scilly, Helstone,

Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, this tendency to fall did not exist.

Birmingham offers a striking difference from the last-named curves ; the

departure from symmetry is more apparent, but the downward movement is

confined to the period between the depressions of the 11th and 19th. On

this hand the Birmingham curve is connected with the south-eastern group,

and clearly shows that the symmetry is greatly departed from to the N.E. of

Scilly and Helstone. On the other hand, it is connected with the Scilly and

Helstone curves by the movements of the 7th to the 11th, with a slighter de-

velopment of the two anterior waves ; if there is any difference, there is a

slight rise from the 7th to the 11th.

Stokesley in Yorkshire presents features nearly approaching Birmingham,

with a greater departure from symmetry, more especially in the depression of

the 19th, which is deeper.

Belfast in Ireland exhibits the same departure from symmetry, in the de-

pression of the 19th being thrown considerably below that of the 11th ; but

there is in this curve a certain return to a symmetrical arrangement of a

somewhat different character to that exhibited by the curves of Scilly and

Helstone ; this consists in a most decided rise from the depression of the 7th

to that of the 11th: the depressions of the 7th and 19th are thus brought

nearer to an equality. In these respects (especially the latter) the curves of

Belfast and Galway strikingly agree, and offer a decided contrast to the south-

eastern group, which exhibits a fall to the depression of the 11th.

  We thus have the area included by the angular points, Scilly, St. Catherine's

Point, Heligoland, Belfast and Galway, parcelled out into three barometric

areas. Near the extreme southern station the greatest symmetrical move-

ments occurred ; the south-western portion of our island may therefore be re-

Agarded as the area of greatest symmetry.  line passing from Scilly to

Stokesley will divide the area into two portions, each characterized by dif-

ferent and opposite barometric movements, as far as the observations from

the 7th to the 11th are concerned. On the N.W. of this line the barometer

was rising, while on the S.E. of it, it was falling.

  We noticed that the fall might be occasioned by a wave passing off toward

the E.N.E. ; now as a rise is occasioned by an anterior slope, a wave coming
up from the N.W. would occasion the phaenomena observed. In that por-

tion of the area covered by the advancing wave the barometer would rise

                                                           k2
--152 REPORT 1846.

in that covered by the receding wave it would fall, while in that in which
the two waves interfered so as to counteract each other, a quiescent state of
the atmosphere would result. This appeared to be the case in the area of
greatest symmetry, in which the larger waves so interfered as to exhibit the
smaller secondary waves uninfluenced by them. This leads us to the real
character of the symmetrical wave ; not that there is such a reality in nature,
as will be shown in the next part of this report, but that it results from the
combination of large normal waves moving in different directions so as to

interfere*.

   I do not place any stress upon these deductions, as I have alluded to them
merely to show the progress I have made, and that a complete discussion of
the observations is likely to be attended with highly important results. The
results of the examination of Mr. Brown's observations, as detailed in the next
part of the report, are I apprehend calculated to throw nmch light on the
inquiry, and when these observations are discussed with reference to the
views there set forth, our knowledge of these interesting movements will I
have no doubt be greatly increased.

   Examination of Mr. Brown's paper on the Oscillations of the Barometer.

   In the Philosophical Magazine for April last, Mr. William Brown has

published a paper on the oscillations of the barometer, with particular reference
to the meteorological phaenoniena of November 1842. The object of this
paper is to show that the barometric oscillations are produced by the meeting
of opposite or nearly opposite aerial currents ; that one current thus meeting
or impinging on another, deflects it, and under some circumstances produces

a rise of the mercurial column, but under others occasions a fall in many
cases of considerable magnitude. In order to elucidate his views, Mr. Brown

has collected barometric observations from eleven stations, which are scattered

--over an area included by the following angular points : The Orkneys,

Christiania in Norway, Paris, Plymouth and Cork. These observations are
in most cases given as read off from the scale. In addition to these the
paper is accompanied by six plates, in which the direction of the wind at
numerous stations is indicated for every day during twenty-six days in the
month by arrows. The anemonal observations published in the body of the
paper not being in all cases for consecutive days, a comparison of them with
the plates is rendered difficult ; nevertheless the plates form a very valuable
portion of the communication, and if they have been laid down from accurate
observations, they furnish us with an important addition to our knowledge of
the arrangement of the aerial currents, especially with respect to the distribu-
tion of pressure. It is a matter of regret that Mr. Brown did not so arrange
his observations and plates, that the accuracy of the latter could have been
seen by inspection.

    I have alluded to this paper as peculiarly interesting at the present time,

when the attention of meteorologists is directed to the important and interest-

    * I have accompanied these curves with one on a smaller scale, representing ohservations
at the Orkneys by the Rev. C. Clouston. The very striking departure from symmetry is
extremely apparent in this curve by the depression of the 19th sinking considerably below
the readings at any other station. This curve is more in accordance with those from the Irish
stations in the rise from the 7th to the llth, and it appeai-sto be connected with Heligoland
by the depression of the 1 1th being but slightly developed ; in tliis respect it also agrees with
the Stokesley curve. The depression of the llth is very apparent in the S.W. curves, and it
gradually decreases as we approach the N.E., where it is much less. The Orkneys appear
to have been under the anterior slope of the wave coming from the N.W.

--ing problem of the barometric oscillations, one class of philosophers re-

garding them as only the effects of currents of air of unequal temperature
and moisture ; and another as the effects of undulations progressing in the
manner of loaves of sound, and propagating themselves with great velocity over
large portions of the earth's surface (Report, 1845, page 30).

   It is not my intention to enter into an examination of the conclusions and
results which Mr. Brown has arrived at; as the question is open, I apprehend

I shall not be doing an injustice to that gentleman by employing a rather
different process to that which he has used, and further discussing the ob-

servations he has given. I beg to acknowledge the obligations I am under

to him for these observations, and especially for the plates, of which I have
before spoken : they are extremely interesting in the present inquiry.

   In accordance with these remarks, I shall select the following stations from

--Mr. Brown's list : the Orkneys, l3elfast, Shields, Cork, Bristol, Plymouth,

London, Paris, and Christiania. The reason I have omitted Glasgow and
Armagh will be apparent from Mr. Brown's notes. As I intend to discuss
these observations with especial reference to the wave hypothesis, I shall
most cautiously avoid in my future remarks any thing that may at all bear
on Mr. Brown's views. The plan I intend to proceed on is as follows. I
shall select the middle observation of each day ; at those stations where only
two are given morning and evening ; I shall take a mean of them. These
observations I shall so arrange that they may exhibit the distribution of

--pressure over the area for each day the line or lines of the greatest diminu-
--tion of pressure and the relation of such distribution and of such lines to

the aerial currents or winds. As a convenient method of readily expressing
these various relations and giving to the discussion that completeness which
otherwise it would want, I shall adopt the wave hypothesis, and to every line
of barometric maxima apply the term crest and to every line of minima the
term trough. In a word, I shall regard the progress of the barometric and
anemonal phsenomena as the progress of waves. The observations will re-

main the same both in Mr. Brown's and my own discussions, the results only

will be different ; and it will remain for other philosophers, by more closely
investigating the subject, and submitting the observations to a more rigorous
and searching discussion, to advance this interesting inquiry and to become

more intimately acquainted with the causes of these interesting phaenomena.

   Having announced my intention of discussing these observations on the

wave hypothesis, it will be important before commencing such discussion to

supply a deficiency in my two former reports, and endeavour to give a com-

pleteness to them which at present they are destitute of. The nature of the

inquiry occasioned them to be drawn up and presented to the Association in

a fragmentary manner, the first detailing the steps I intended to adopt in the

examination of the great wave of Nov. 1 842, and the second the further in-

formation I had obtained relative to this and other atmospheric undulatory

movements ; and to a certain extent the same remark will apply to the present
report, embodying as it does the progress made since the last meeting of the
Association. The deficiency to which I allude is the notion we form of an

atmospheric wave ; T shall therefore, previous to placing the discussion of Mr.

Brown's observations before you, as clearly as I can, state the idea I entertain

of such a wave, and in introducing it to your attention I shall avail myself of
Mr. Scott Kussell's designation of the elements of a wave as in figure 1, and

then proceed with the definition of an atmospheric wave.

Definition and Phcenomena of an Atmospheric Wave.

When a number of barometric observations are projected on paper accord-

ing to a suitable scale, and continued for months and years, the eye on
contemplating them will recognize a variety of curved forms, some of large
and some of small amplitude ; some rising to a considerable altitude, others
sinking far below the level, representing the mean barometric pressure at the
station of observation. At first there appears but little regularity in these

curvilinear records of the ever-shifting state of our atmosphere, but here and
there the attentive observer will notice some similarity existing between two

or more individual curves, and he may notice some which possess a certain

symmetrical arrangement of the ascents and descents. In consequence of

this similarity and symmetrical arrangement, he examines more carefully the

records of barometric pressure, and not only discusses the observations at
one station, but compares those observations with others made at various
stations ; and here again he finds apparent irregularity and confusion. The
curves to a certain extent agree, but in many minor points they differ often

very considerably, in some cases rising at one station while falling at another

this induces a still more minute and careful investigation : the distribution of
pressure over the largest area he can command is carefully examined ; and
whether his stations are few or many at any given time, he finds on this area

a point of maximum pressure and a point of minimum pressure ; between

these points he finds various pressures, generally increasing from the point of

least pressure to the point of greatest pressure. On some occasions he finds

a line of high pressure, stretching quite across the area, and on others a line of
low pressure. By continuing his inquiries for successive epochs, he finds
these lines of high and low pressure move across the area, or in other words,

the high pressure or low pressure is gradually transferred from one point to

another. He also finds at still more remote epochs other lines of high and

low pressure, some having the same direction with the lines originally noticed,

and others crossing the direction of the original lines at various angles.

The questions which now suggest themselves are the following. What

are these movements? How can they be represented? In what manner

Acan they be explained ?  simple consideration of the curves suggests the

idea of waves as explanatory of the phaenomena, and the term atmospheric

wave has been used to designate that ideal individuality which the mind

attributes to the process which it observes of the successive change of place

which the barometric maxima and minima undergo, and by which they re-

gularly succeed each other over the area under examination ; this ideal in-

dividuality has been employed as a mean of examining the movements just

alluded to. The line of high pressure stretching across the area (the figure

Wbeing supposed to cut this line transversely) has been termed the crest,

the line of low pressure in advance of the crest, the anterior trough, a (the

--origin of Mr. Scott Russell's water wave) ; the line of low pressure succeeding

   The existence of atmospheric currents, especially the equatorial and polar,
has been well-established ; and there is a class of philosophers who attribute

the barometric oscillations entirely/ to the effects of these currents as con-

tra-distinguished to the effects of waves such as we have just mentioned. In
contemplating the transference of the barometric maxima and minima, we

--regard only the wave-motion but very different must be the air-motion.

Prof. Dove, in his letter to Col. Sabine relative to the magnetical and mete-

orological observations, has announced his opinion that the equipoise of the

atmosphere is maintained in the temperate zone by currents on the same level

flowing in opposite directions (Report, 1845, page 61) ; thus we have a bed or

stratum of air moving from the S.W., and on each side of this are strata of

WeN.E. winds.  may here inquire, how are these alternate aerial currents

related to the waves before alluded to ? It is one of the objects of the following

                                                              Fig. 2.

discussion to exhibit this relation, which may be thus briefly expressed, at least
in so far as the examination of the observations has yet extended*. Let the
strata a a a' a', b' b' b b, fig. 2, represent two parallel aerial currents, a a a' a'
being from S.W. and b' b' b b from N.E., and conceive them both to advance
from the N. W. in the direction of the large arrow, that is the strata themselves

will advance with a lateral motion. Now conceive the barometer to com-

mence rising just as the edge b b passes any line of country, and to continue
rising until the edge b' b' arrives at that line, when the maximum is attained.
The wind now changes and the barometer immediately begins to fall, and
continues to fall until the edge a a coincides with the line of country on
which b b first impinged. During this process we have all the phaenomena
exhibited by an atmospheric wave ; when the edge b b, fig. 2, passes the line
of country, the point a, fig. 1, of the wave (the anterior trough) transits that
line of country and the barometer begins to rise with a N.E. wind. During

V Wthe period the stratum b' b b, fig. 2, transits the line the anterior slope a,

Vfig. 1, passes ; when the conterminous edges of the strata a' a' b', fig. 2,
pass, the crest W, fig. 1, extends in the direction of the preceding trough:
the barometer now begins to fall, and when the edge a a, fig. 2, occupies the

place of b b, also fig. 2, the descent of the mercurial column is completed ; the

                     * For this knowledge I am indebted to Mr. Brown's plates.
--136 REPORT 1846.

Wposterior slope tv, fig. 1, has passed, and the posterior trough w, fig. 1, now

occupies the line in which the anterior trough extended.

From these considerations, we readily see that the wave is a convenient

method of representing the barometric fluctuations ; we have already noticed

the wave motion, the lateral transference of the parallel beds of aerial currents.

We have seen that the rise is due to the anterior slope and the fall to tlie

posterior ; and we now further learn that the direction of the aerial current on

the anterior slope is at right angles to the axis of translation directed towards

the left-hand, while on the posterior slope it is the reverse ; still at right angles

to the axis of translation, but directed towards the right-hand.

Having thus noticed the wave-motion with its accompanying air-motion,

Howthese interesting questions suggest themselves.  are the forces of this

air-motion arranged ? Do all the particles move with the same velocity ?

Are there different velocities in different parts of the wave? Our anemo-

meters will answer these questions. In the troughs, the edges b b a a, the

forces are strongest; as the barometer rises, the force gradually subsides; when

the crest passes, it is zero ; and as the barometer falls, it increases until the

trough passes, when it is again strongest.

The examination of the transit of a single wave by means of barometric

and anemonal observations, would be comparatively easy, but it seldom

happens, from the operation of natural causes, that an isolated or solitary

wave is produced. In almost every instance (except in those in which the

generating power is very much greater than any which occasions the pro-

duction of smaller waves) the wave is contemporaneous with others of equal,

if not of greater magnitude, so that different systems are in motion at the

same time, each individual pursuing its own course, and although perfectly

independent of every other, yet greatly modifying the resulting phcenomena

as exhibited by the barometer and anemometer. When therefore we pro-

ceed with the examination of certain barometric and anemonal phsenomena

in the manner above alluded to, we are speedily perplexed with the baro-

metric and anemonal effects of cross tvaves ; the flowing of one set of waves
in a certain direction is apparently interrupted and interfered with by an-

other in a different direction, and before the first set can be exhibited with

its proper proportions, and the true altitudes, amplitudes, velocities, and direc-

tions of its individual waves assigned, all the phsenomena of the other set

must be carefully disentangled and separated from the aggregate phaenomena

presented by the contemporaneous systems. The barometric curve, including

a complete rise and fall at any one station, is not the curve resulting from

the transit of any one wave ; it does not represent the form of any reality

in nature ; but it does represent, and is an exponent of the effects resulting
from the contemporaneous transits of waves, or systems of waves, such as have

been described.

The contemporaneous existence of these cross waves, with their appro-

priate aerial currents, as manifested by the barometer and anemometer, ap-

pears likely to form an experimentum c'rucis between the conflicting hypotheses,

the oscillations of the barometer as dependent on waves, in contradistinction

to that of the same oscillations as dependent only on the aerial currents.

When a current meets with another at any angle, both are altered in direc-

tion ; and if the forces are different, the united current proceeds with an
increased or diminished strength, according to the situation of the station

relative to the separate currents before confluence. This union would of

course influence the barometer ; if the station is in a current of slow pro-
gress, and the air possesses considerable density, the barometer would fall

upon the new current being established ; while at another station, where the
force of the wind is great and the pressure low, it would rise when the con-

fluence took place. These pheenomena, however, could only occur upon the

impinging of currents ; upon M. Dove's theory of parallel currents in oppo-
site directions, it does not appear likely that they can exist. M. Dove has
suggested that these parallel currents may be shifting ones, and we have
supposed that the parallel currents of N.E. and S.W. winds may advance

from the N.W. with a lateral motion. The same cause that produces the

opposite and superposed equatorial and polar currents, will also give rise to

the same opposite but parallel currents in the temperate zone, namely, the

ascending column of heated and consequently rarefied air. Now it is well

known that in stormy weather, when the wind is blowing with great force,

the barometer being nearly at its minimum, upon the xoind changing the

barometer commences rising ; the wind however continues to blow with about
the same force as it did with the previous falling barometer. Upon M.

Dove's view of parallel and opposite currents, somewhere in or near the line

forming the boundary between the currents, towards or in the torrid zone,

we ought to find the point of rarefaction, and to this point the N.E. current

would rush with the greatest force to supply the ascending column of heated

air*. This N.E. current would be compensated by a S.W. current of nearly

or quite the same force, situated just to the S.E.                           pj__ g^

In this way it is easy to conceive tHat a complete barometric wave may be

produced ; the lines of greatest velocity of the parallel currents will indicate

the trough ; the rapidity with which the currents pass in opposite directions

greatly diminishes the pressure, and according to this view somewhere near

the direction of the trough and to the S.W. of it, we ought to find the point

of greatest rarefaction : the velocity decreases on each side this trough,

and with this decrease of velocity the pressure increases, so that we have a

* In attributing the greatest force to the N.E. current, I do not by any means wish to put

forward or support any hypothesis that would at all interfere with the well-known fact, that

the greatest force is usually manifested by S.W. winds. The point to which I wish more par-

ticularly to solicit the attention of the Association is this, the cause which induces the south-

westerly current itself. This must reside in or near the torrid zone. Here we have a suffi-

cient cause ; we are presented with phsenomena fully adequate to explain an influx of cool air

from the N.E. This is the current that must first be established, and in the first instance its

Weforce will be greatest.  have however only to turn to Prof. Dove's letter to Col. Sabine

(Report, 1845, p. CI), and we shall at once find the reason why S.W. winds manifest by means

of our instruments the greatest force. The N.E. currents are narrower, and the force soon

abates as they pass over towards the S.E. ; while on the other hand the same station is not

only oftener, but longer in the S.W. currents, and as the line of greatest force approaches, the

force increases, on some occasions very rapidly, until the wind changes. The line of greatest

force soon passes the station, so that upon a mean of numerous observations the south-westerly

svind exhibits the greatest force.

distribution of pressure of a wave form gradually rising on each side the

trough, the pressure being dependent on the velocity of the parallel currents.

The constant ascent of air at the point of rarefaction would continually

--draw off a quantity of air from the S.E. side of the line of greatest velocity

b b, fig. 3, and this would be attended with two results ; first, there would

be a real hollow or trough formed in the line of junction of the parallel cur-

rents; and secondly, this line would gradually advance towards the S.E.; for

as more air would be drawn oflP from that side, the whole body of air would

advance in that direction to supply the deficiency ; and should the rarefying
process cease, we can readily conceive that not only will the ivave-form be

continued, but also wave-motion. The establishment of the parallel currents

will give the air-motion ; the diminution of pressure towards the lines of

greatest velocity will give the wave-form ; and the drawing-ofl* of air from

the S.E. will induce the tcave-motion.  The wave thus generated is negative
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

it consists of a hollow produced by the ascending current of heated air

carrying off a considerable portion of air set in motion by this ascending

column, and its direction of motion is determined by more air being drawn

off from the S.E. slope than the N.W.

It might be expected that as the trough passed, a motion of the air or

wind from the N.W. (the body of air moving from that quarter to supply

the constant drain in feeding the ascending current) would be observed ; but

so strong must the parallel currents be which give rise to the wave, that

such motion would doubtless be concealed by them.

The barometric and anemonal phsenomena would present very regular

phases, provided there was only one system of waves, one set of parallel and

opposite currents constantly passing from N.W. to S.E. I have however in

former reports shown that different systems have contemporaneously traversed

the area over which the observations have extended, and the discussion of

Mr. Brown's observations has clearly brought to light a set of parallel and

opposite currents at right angles to those we have just been contemplating,

namely, from N.W. and S.E, with a wave-motion towards the N.E., pro-

ducing the cross waves which occasion the complexity before alluded to.

The late Professor Daniell has remarked that the curves increase in range

towards the N.W., and in general the neighbourhood of water presents

curves remarkable for the boldness of their contour and the large extent of

their range. In venturing a speculation on these cross waves from the S.W.
with parallel and opposite currents from N.W. and S.E., I should be inclined

to attribute them to the effect of the solar influence on the terrestrial sur-

face, extending from Cape Verd in Africa to the extreme north of Lapland

in Europe. This surface extends from S.W. to N.E., or somewhat in that

direction. It may be remarked, that to the north-east of Cape Verd is situ-

ated the Sahara or Great Desert of Africa, and here we have a great rarefy-

ing surface. To the north-west or west-north-west of this extensive rarefy-

ing surface, the broadest part of the Atlantic ocean is situated. The relative

positions of the Great Desert and the broadest extent of the Atlantic will

produce a great indraught of cool air from the ocean ; the direction of this

wind will be W.N.W. or N.W. To the north-east of this current, probably

in the neighbourhood of Morocco, Fez, Algiers, Spain and Portugal, and
the north-west portions of the Mediterranean sea, we ought to find the

counter current from the S.E. or E.S.E., the two portions in juxtaposition

moving with the greatest velocity. Somewhere in the Atlantic the turning-

point of these oppositely directed currents should exist. The line of junc-

tion of these parallel currents will determine the trough of the wave, and as

before shown, in consequence of the air being drawn off from the north-east

to supply the ascending current, the wave will progress towards that quarter;
ON ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.                                                139

the barometer first descending with the S.E. wind as the trough approaches
stations to the N.E., and rising with the N.W. as the current produced by
the rarefaction approaches, until the crest passes, when the new counter cur-
rent or slope of the next wave would set in *.

    Pursuing this idea further, there can be no question that Ireland and

Scotland become points, or unitedly constitute a great point of rarefaction,
forming as they do the nearest land to the northern part of the Atlantic, the
land becoming hotter than the neighbouring water, and in consequence a
N.W. current with its compensating current from the S.E. is induced. Not
only will the rapidity of the currents reduce the pressure, but the ascending
column from the land will transfer some of the air into the general current
of the atmosphere, and there will be a real diiFerence in the distribution of

air as well as pressure ; a section transverse to the line of greatest velocity
will exhibit a hollow or trough, and the same phsenomena will result from

this arrangement of the aerial currents as we noticed arising from the N.E.

and S.W. currents, the only difference being in direction.

just advanced, and tracing a wave of this system from the most western

A station in Iceland as an outlier would be very valuable.

Warsaw.                                  Rome.

   In thus considering these rectangularly posited systems of parallel and
opposite currents, many complex anemonal and barometric phaenomena re-
ceive an easy explanation, particularly the revolution of the vane in one

uniform direction, and the barometric wind-rose. When the conterminous

edges of any two currents pass a station, the barometer is either at a maxi-

mum or minimum with respect to that particular system of currents ; the

wind also changes at this time. If the barometer has previously been rising
with a north-easterly wind, it now begins to fall with a south-westerly : the

cross currents are however passing at this time with a lateral motion towards

the N.E. ; in this set of cross currents the barometer will rise with a north-
westerly wind and fall with a south-easterly. Suppose while the posterior slope

of a N.W. wave transits, wind S.W., and before its trough passes, the trough of
the cross wave from the S.W. also transits, and is immediately succeeded by the
following anterior slope with its N.W. current, the wind will paiss from S.W.

to W. Now while this slope continues, upon the trough of the N.W. system

passing, the wind changes to N.E., and the resultant of the two currents is N.
It is easy to pursue this reasoning, and thus trace the changes of the wind
arising from these two cross systems completely round the compass.

   * In the above suggestion I have considered the northern portion of the African continent
as inducing the N.W. current, but of course, the entire surface, as far as the extreme north of
Europe, including Great Britain and Ireland, will act as a rarefying surface.
--140 REPORT 1846.

The two systems of cross currents naturally divide themselves into four

beds of opposite currents, namely, N.E, S.W., N.W. S.E. ; with the first of

each system, N.E. N.W., the barometer rises, and with the last of each, S.W.
S.E., it falls, so that in tlie barometric wind-rose the maximum is found
about the N.E., the prevailing system, and the minimum near the S.W., the

opposite current of this system.

The extent of arc which the wind-vane frequently describes, especially in

stormy weather, also receives an explanation from these systems of ci'oss

Acurrents.  contemporaneous S.W. with a N.W. wind will occasion large

arcs to be described between these points ; the south-westerly gusts prevail-

ing, directing the vane to that quarter; and the north-westerly immediately

following, instantly occasions a change carrying the vane towards the N.W.

These sudden and extensive changes are rendered more distinctly perceptible

by means of a small kite flown with about 250 or 300 feet of string, or even

more ; the distinctness and independence of the direction of the two currents

are readily seen, as well as the difference in their strength.

Col. Sabine has shown in his Report on the Meteorology of Toronto, that

the intensity of the wind increases as the temperature increases. The con-
sideration of these cross currents opens up to us another mode of contem-

plating the force of the wind. It appears probable that the force diminishes

Nowon each side the line of greatest velocity.  in order to obtain the true

expression of this force, its numerical value, it will be important to correct

the results, either anemometric or those obtained by estimation for the daily

period ; this will give the value of the force of the currents then passing, and
will in a great measure test the hypothesis.

                                                Section II.

                           Discussion of Mr. Brown's Observations.

    In the following discussion I have first arranged such of the observations
collected by Mr. Brown, or deductions from them, as indicate the barometric
pressure about the middle of each day at the stations before-named, as near
as the data furnished by that gentleman will allow. These observations or

deductions will be found in Table V. The arrangement is such that the eye
may readily ascertain the barometric state of the atmosphere at any station
on any day embraced by the area and period included in the table. The
changes at any one station are also readily seen, the altitudes above 30
inches being distinguished from those between 29 and 30, and those below
29 also being distinguished from the rest. This table forms the basis of the
following deductions which have been thus arrived at. Tiie values corre-
sponding to each day have been arranged with especial reference to the
maximum and minimum of that day in space, that is, the station exhibiting
the greatest pressure on any particular day has generally been placed first
on the list for that day ; and that exhibiting the least, last. At the head of
each list are placed the directions of the crests as indicated by the observa-
tions. Crests passing from N.W. to S.E. are distinguished by the odd
numbers, and those passing from S.W. to N.E. by the even. When the
observations give two slopes from a crest or trough passing between such

slopes, the observations have been arranged to exhibit this. After the
arrangement of the observations, the lines of the greatest diminution of
pressure corresponding in a majority of cases to tranverse sections of the
waves, and exhibiting either their anterior or posterior slopes, are inserted.
These are succeeded by the direction of the wind on each side of the crests
as given in Mr. Brown's plates, and the discussion of each day's observation
is concluded by a few explanatory notes.

   The progression of the crest, which was so distinctly developed on the 1st
towards the N.E. and the succeeding S.E. current, is most decided. The
altitudes at Belfast and Christiania are nearly equal, indicating that the crest
is between them. The wind, with but few exceptions, is S.E. over nearly
the whole of Great Britain and Ireland, while at Christiania on the anterior

   The line of greatest diminution of pressure this day, Orkneys to Paris,

The crest No. 1 is now approaching Christiania. The observations of

this day oflFera decided contrast to those of the 1st ; the posterior slope of

crest No. 1 is well-developed, the point of greatest pressure being to the

west of Christiania : the point of least pressure is still Paris, where the

barometer has been falling since the 1st: this station appears to be near the

intersection of the troughs of both waves. The progress of the maximum
point is extremely interesting. On the 1st we find it at Belfast, on the 2nd

at the Orkneys, and on the 3rd at Christiania ; the direction of the progres-
sion is consequently undoubted. The general direction of the wind over

England, Scotland and Ireland, is S.E. ; that due to the posterior slope, at

Paris and in the South-east of England, the wind is E. and N.E., the anterior

slope of crest No. 2.

its extending over the whole of the British islands extremely strong ; also the

establishment of its proper wind N.E. ; a few stations exhibit the S.E. wind

as the posterior slope of crest No. 1 is passing off. The line of the greatest

diminution of pressure is identical with that of the 2nd, namely, Orkneys to

Paris, but it is nearly doubled in value, being now equal to -69, showing

that the greatest curvature is approaching.

The crest No. 2 appears on this day to pass from Plymouth towards Bris-

tol and London. The direction of the line of greatest diminution of pres-

sure varies considerably from that of the three preceding days ; this partly
arises from the great fall which commenced on this day at the northern sta-

tions, Orkneys, Belfast and Christiania; and from the anterior slope of the
wave (crest No. 3). The direction of the wind is closely in accordance with

crest No. 2, passing in the direction from Plymouth towards London, being
S.W. on the north-west side of the crest.

   The wave (crest No. 2), with its front towards the south-east, has been
very distinctly developed during the preceding days. The altitude of the
crest appears to have subsided as the wave progressed ; the highest reading
at Belfast was 30*55 on the 5th, at London 30-16 on the 6th, and at Paris
29-90 on the 8th. The following tables exhibit the features of the anterior
slope. Table VI. shows the barometric rise and fall at stations arranged
more or less with regard to a line cutting the crest of the wave transversely.
The depressing influence of the wave, crest No. 1, is clearly seen at London
and Paris on the 5th. Tables VIL, VIIL and IX. exhibit the depression of
the south-easterly stations below those to the north-west of them while the

anterior slope passed.

wind S.W. The altitude of this slope from the Orkneys to Paris is '96.
The greatest altitude of the anterior slope, from Paris to Belfast, was -80.

exhibiting but a very slight oscillation, -17, while that at the Orkneys has
amounted to 1-72.

           Trough succeeding Crest No. 2 now transits Christiania.

The direction of the crest No. 3 is nearly identical with that of No. 1,

which passed Great Britain and Ireland on the 1st. This appears to suggest

that they were either successive crests of the same system of waves, or were

succeeding waves produced by the same disturbing causes. The altitude of

crest No. 3 is about half an inch less than that of crest No. 1 ; but between
the transits of the two crests a wave from the N.W. with a deep posterior
trough has passed the area, which has probably depressed crest No. 3. The

interval between the crests Nos. 1 and 3 is equal to nine days.

It was noticed in the remarks on the 9th, that the great difference in the

oscillation at the Orkneys and Paris most probably resulted from the sub-

sidence of the crest as it progressed. The crest No. 3 came from the S.W.,

so that a line from Plymouth to Christiania would cut it more or less trans-

versely ; the ranges however are nearly the same at both stations. The crest
which traversed England on the 1st arrived at Christiania on the 4th ; at this

time the barometer had commenced rising at Plymouth from the anterior

slope of crest No. 2, and it continued rising until the 7th, when the crest

passed. At Christiania the barometer had fallen from the posterior slope of

crest No. 2. It appears from a careful comparison and consideration of the

barometric movements at Plymouth and Christiania, that crest No. 2 passed

Christiania about a day earlier than it did Plymouth, that is, the longitudinal

direction of the crest was such as to cause it to pass over Christiania while

Plymouth was still under the anterior slope of tjie wave, the sections passing

over Christiania and Plymouth being separate and distinct. The character

of the passing wave is well-determined at both stations, the posterior slope

exhibiting a rapid and deep fall, which took place alike at Christiania and

Plymouth.

    The crest No. 2 passed Cork, Belfast and the Orkneys on the 5th, Ply-
mouth on the 7th, and Paris on the 8th, with a diminution of oscillation.

We find however no diminution of oscillation at Christiania as compared with

Plymouth. It is highly probable, the subsidence of the crest, as it proceeded
towards Paris, resulted from the influence of the land in England, while both
at Plymouth and Christiania the crest was but slightly interfered with by
the influence of land, the difference of level resulting from the anterior slope

of crest No. 3.
    These considerations exhibit a large wave of considerable breadth and slow

motion, extending in a longitudinal direction from the extreme south-west of

--England towards the Swedish capital.
    Nov. 10. Mr. Brown's diagram for this day very distinctly and beautifully
exhibits the change of currents resulting from the transit of crest No. 3, as
well as from the progress of the posterior trough of crest No. 2. The trough
of the latter wave is now between the Orkneys and Paris (the deep trough
before mentioned), the wind in the south-eastern portion of the diagram is
S.W., the strength increasing 'towards the trough. At Thurso and North
Shields the wind is N.W., the anterior slope of crest No. 3 ; in the south-
west of Ireland, the wind is S.E. (posterior slope). The N.E. wind on the
anterior slope of the wave succeeding crest No. 2 is seen on the north-west

side of the trough.

--150 REPORT 1846.

The progressive motion of the two posterior slopes is very discernible.

Crest No. 3 has passed the Orkneys and arrived at Christiania seven days

Weafter crest No. 1 passed that station.       found an interval between the

crests as they passed the central parts of England of nine days. Most pro-

bably a discussion of observations at shorter intervals and more numerous

stations, especially to the north-east of Christiania, would explain the dis-
crepancy. The difference in level is very much greater than that which cha-

racterized the transits of the crests over the centre of England, but in the

interval between the crests passing England and Sweden, the deep trough of

crest No. 2 has advanced, which must very considerably have depressed the

crest at Christiania, as compared with the English stations ; indeed so great

was the depressing influence of the wave, crest No. 2, that no rise is recorded

as crest No. 3 passed Plymouth.

Crest No. 2 is situated considerably to the south-east of Paris, so that its

progress is not perceptible on the area ; but that of its posterior slope is very

clear. On the 9th, the deep posterior trough of this wave passed the Orkneys

--with a depression of 28*80; (bearing in mind that its direction was S.W. N.E.)

another section passed Christiania on the 10th, 29"24' ; and a third passed

Plymouth on the 11th, 29-12.

 --Symmetrical Wave. On this day the great symmetrical wave commenced

at London ; the position of this station was nearly similar under both slopes.

The receding posterior slope of crest No 3, the intervening trough, and

the approaching anterior slope of crest No. 5, are brought fully into view

this day ; the wind also is in close accordance with the transit of these waves.
The wave (crest No. 3) appears to be much smaller than that of No. 1 ; the
interval between the crests, as passing the centre of England, was found to

be nine days ; the epoch of the passage of the intervening trough occurred

on November 7 ; interval between the troughs five days, taking the last in-
terval as the amplitude in time of the wave ; it is cleiirly much smaller than

--the preceding.

   The crest No. 5 now passes over Great Britain and Ireland much in the
same direction as the crests Nos. 1 and 3 (compare Nov. 1 and 10). Its
altitude is about -25 higher than that of the last S.W. crest; the advancing
slope of the second N.W. wave has approached, raising the present crest.
--153 REPORT 1846.

 --Symmetrical Wave. The crest No. 5 forms the second subordinate maxi-

mum on the anterior slope of the great symmetrical wave (see plate 2 ap-

pended to Sir J. Herschel's Report, 1843, and plate 3, illustrating the volume
of Reports, IS^S). The first strongly developed rise and fall on the anterior

slope of the symmetrical wave appears to be a small wave riding in the

trough (A3).

   It appears highly probable that the large wave from the N.W. possessed

both a broad crest and broad trough, with a very slow progressive motion.
The anterior slope of crest No. 4 appears to have commenced riding over

Christiania on the 10th.

   The observations of this day, both barometric and anemonal, indicate the
presence of an anterior slope of a wave succeeding crest No. 4 of the N.W.
system. Crest No. 9 now passes over the Orkneys and between Christiania

and Paris.

  --Symmetrical Wave, two days after transit. London is situated under the

anterior slope of crest No. 6 and posterior slope of crest No. 9.

   On the 16th, two days before transit, London was similarly situated with

respect to waves Nos. 4 and 5, with nearly the same barometric pressure.

   On the 13th a permanent rise took place at London, which continued until

crest No. 4 passed the station. It appears that this should be carefully distin-
guished from the rise and fall of the 16th to 19th, the latter being due to

a separate and distinct wave.
   The curve from noon of the 16th to midnight of the 19th appears to re-

present the form of the N.W. wave riding on the top or superposed on the

normal or great symmetrical wave.

   Crest No. 6, the third of the N.W. system, now passes London five days
after the transit of crest No. 4, the second of this system. Christiania at this

time exhibits the greatest pressure; most probably the crest No. 13 is ap-
proaching this station, and this, combined with crest No. 6, produces the in-
creased pressure. At the transit of crest No. 4 Christiania exhibited the

least pressure ; the difference may probably be explained by the transits of the

--cross waves.

* The barometric fall between the 21st and 23rd, that occurred at all tlie stations except

one, appears to have given rise to an apparent regression of the trough observed in the neigh-
bourhood of Belfast and Shields on the 22nd. It was shown that on the 22nd the anterior

slope of crest No. 6 was coming up from the N.W., so that the fall of the 21st resulted from
the posterior slope of crest No. 9. On the 23rd the crest No. 6 passes London, and we have

at some stations a much more sudden fall than resulted from the passage of the posterior slope

Weof crest No. 9.  may therefore regard the trough in the direction of Cork and Bristol as

an indication of the approaching trough of crest No. 6, rather than a new trough between 13

and 15. Should this view be correct, the line of greatest diminution of pressure, Christiania

to Cork, will be on the posterior slope of crest No. 9.

The advance of the anterior slope of crest No. 15 is well-seen from the

observations of this day. The wind proper to it, N.W., has increased in the

--S.W. portion of the area. It appears that the motion of the waves crests

--Nos. 13 and 15 with the included trough is slower than that of the waves,

crests Nos. 3 and 5 (see Nov. 1 1 and 12). The same arrangement of stations

as to the distribution of pressure which required only one day to establish

in the case of waves 3 and 5, has occupied ttvo days in the case of waves 13
and 15. The distribution of pressure was similar on the 11th and 24th ; it
was also similar on the 12th and 26th.

                       Section IIL

                Results of the foregoing Discussion.

In collecting the results of this discussion, I have arranged in Tables XI. and

XII. the principal lines of diminution of pressure ; the succession of waves

as well as the distinct systems become very apparent from these tables. The

succeeding Tables XIII. and XlV.exhibitthe principal features of the respective

waves of each system. The most prominent result appears to be the con-

firmation of Prof. Dove's suggestion of parallel and oppositely directed cur-

rents. The diagrams of the wind in connection with the barometric obser-

vations clearly exhibit such currents, and we see by a glance at Tables XIII.

and XIV. that the beds of these currents varied considerably in breadth. At

the opening of the observations they were very much broader than at the

close, and the N.W. system ('waves No. 2, 4, 6) were altogether larger than

other at right angles, the individuals in both gradually decreasing in size. In
the speculation which has been ventured relative to the S.W. system, the

mass of terrestrial surface forming the N.W. boundary of the great eastern

continent has been assumed as the rarefying surface, producing the set of
parallel and oppositely directed S.E. and N.W. winds, the currents gradually
shifting towards the N.E. The gradual contraction of the beds of each
system as the observations proceed is a highly interesting feature, which re-

quires a more extensive discussion for its elucidation.

  namely, from N,W. aud S.E. ; and it has been suggested that these two sets

 -- --of oppositely directed currents, N.E. S.W. andN.W. S.E., continually cross-

  ing each other, occasion the complexity of the barometric and anemometric
 phaenomena, and that in future discussions these should be particularly taken

 into account. Should the views thus advanced be substantiated, we are
 beginning to unravel some of the complicated problems of meteorological
 research : still much remains to be done ; we are as yet only on the thresh-
 hold of the vast meteorological arena now opening upon us. The subject, over-
 whelming with interest, naturally divides itself into two branches. First, the

--determination of thephases of the larger undulations, the barometric curves

 which include complete elevations and depressions of the barometer, and
 which represent, and are exponents of, the effects resulting fromcontemporane-
 ous transits of waves or systems of waves such as have been previously
 noticed. These, with the smaller secondary waves superposed on their slopes,
 form the types of the various seasons of the year. Second, the absolute extent
 of each normal wave of each system in space, as it exists with the smaller
 superposed waves riding on its slopes. The direction of its crest, its am-
 plitude in miles, the altitude of its crest above, and the depression of its
 troughs below the surface of general repose of the atmosphere, the place of
 its formation, the manner in which it is propagated, the precise direction and
 extent of its motion, the force with which it is translated from place to place,
 and the locality of its final extinction, are questions which the present state
 of our knowledge is inadequate to resolve.

     These desiderata regarding the waves as resulting from parallel and op-
 positely directed currents, may be thus expressed. The absolute extent, both
 as regards length and breadth of each current with that of its counter and
 oppositely directed current, together forming the two slopes of the wave
 with its included trough ; the points or lines of intersection of the two systems
 of parallel and oppositely directed currents ; the precise direction of the
 conterminous edges of the currents, the lines in which the velocity of the
 wind is greatest answering to the included trough ; the amount of the dimi-
nution of pressure resulting from this velocity below the mean pressure of
 the atmosphere ; the locality of the formation of these currents ; the direction
in which they advance with a latei'al motion ; the force with which they are
translated by means of such lateral motion from place to place, and the

locality of their final extinction or disappearance.

    With respect to the first branch of inquiry, the phases of the larger un-
dulations, the seasonal barometric types, but little has yet been done towards
its accomplishment. There is some hope, as mentioned in the foregoing re-
marks, that we have obtained the type o^fourteen days in November for one
locality only ; and we have also a glimpse of the character of the movements
during a portion of October. This is however very small compared with
the extent of the problem. At the utmost it will only amount to the twelfth
partof the annual type; even the S^th cannot yet be said to be fully established.
Again, the station of observation is to be taken into account ; were the
entire year's observations for one station projected, and year after year such
observations compared, we should onlj"^ have the annual type at that station.
The examination of the symmetrical wave of 1842 has already shown that
there is a line of greatest symmetry as far as that wave is concerned, namely
Dublin, Birmingham, Brussels and Munich ; and the discussion of the equi-
noctial and solstitial observations, 1835 to 1838, has clearly established
Brussels as a nodal point, and we find it situated on this line of greatest
symmetry. At very short distances N.E. and S.W. of the line of greatest
symmetry of 1842, the symmetry is departed from. On the return of the
great wave in the autumn of IS^S, the line of greatest symmetry appears to

--164 REPORT 1846.

have been confined to the southern shores of England : Brussels is not far
removed from this line ; so that while the symmetry on the last return is
considerably departed from at Dublin, it is highly probable that at Brussels

the movements are more in accordance with its nodal character. It is there-
fore important for the complete determination of the problem, not only to
obtain the annual type at one station ; we also require it at numerous stations ;
and we ought to be furnished with local types similar to those, but more ex-
tensive, which Sir John Herschel has established for different stations from

the observations of 1835 to 1838.

It has already been observed that the barometric curves at any one station

do not give sections of waves passing the station, that is, the curve as pro-

jected is not a section of the wave then transiting, but exhibits the effects

of two or more systems of waves passing at the same time. Now as like

causes produce like effects, it is highly probable that there may be a general

flowing of the larger normal waves in the same direction, about the same

season of the year ; and as we have seen in the case of the symmetrical wave

that the secondary waves are erratic, sometimes falling on one point and
sometimes on another of the normal waves, these normal waves may be

crossed at these seasons by similar systems of secondary waves slightly re-

moved from a normal epoch year after year, giving rise to a similarity, within

certain limits, between the combined barometric curves as observed at the

stations. These combined curves furnish us with the local and annual types.

While this labour is accomplishing, and we are in progress of obtaining

annual and local types, we may be accumulating information that will bear

considerably on the second branch of our inquiry. At present we are un-

Weable to answer these questions fully.  have obtained some glimpses of

the vast extent of these waves, and in our contemplation of them we must,

as Sir John Herschel beautifully observes, enlarge our conception till in the

extent of their sweep and the majestic regularity of their progress they

approach in some degree to the tide waves of the ocean ; still our knowledge

of them is very small. The volume of any one atmospheric wave, the extent

of surface it covers, indeed any particular feature we may name and which

we may wish to be exhibited to us in all its details, we must still reckon among

our desiderata.
   In closing this report, I beg to acknowledge the valuable assistance I have

received from the following public bodies and gentlemen.

   To THE British Government I am indebted, through the hands of the

Astronomer Royal and Lieut-Col. Sabine, R.A., for the volumes of Greenwich
Magnetical and Meteorological Observations for the years 184-0 to 1843, and

the volume of similar observations made at the Colonial Observatory, Toronto,
in the years 1840, 1841 and 1842. I am also indebted to both the above-
named gentlemen for the readiness Avith which they have furnished me with
extracts from the records of their respective observatories, and for many

valuable suggestions which I have received, especially from Col. Sabine.

   To the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty I am indebted for
several valuable sets of observations made on board our surveying vessels,

and received through Rear-Admiral Beaufort, our excellent hydrographer.

To this gentleman I am peculiarly indebted for the lively interest he has

taken in forwarding the inquirj-, and also to the officers under whose directions
the observations have been made, for the care and fidelity with which they
have been executed. The names of the respective officers of Her Majesty's

surveying vessels will be found in Table I.

    To the Honourable the Corporation of the Trinity House, I am
indebted for the ready access which has been afforded me to the records of

meteorological observations kept at certain lighthouses ; and I take this op-
                                                                              :

                 ON ATMOSPHERIC WAVES.                            165

portunity of testifying to the care and fidelity with which the observations

are made daily by the lighthouse keepers. The situation of the lighthouses

at which observations have been made especially to assist in this inquiry, will

be found in Table I. ; and I am greatly indebted to the Corporation for certain
modifications in the observations at these lighthouses, which have been made at

my suggestion in order that the subject should receive the fullest investigation.

To THE Royal Society I am indebted for several sets of observations

extracted from records preserved in its archives. In connection with the

Society, I may mention the kind assistance I received from the late Pro-

fessor Daniell ; and I take this opportunity of recording the kindness
and urbanity which he ever manifested, when applied to in reference to this

or any other scientific inquiry.

   To Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., I am under peculiar and

especial obligation : the kindness I experienced from that gentleman while

engaged in discussing the quarterly observations, called for and collected by

himself, demands the most lively gratitude ; and I take this opportunity of ac-

knowledging this kindness, and particularly the publication, in the report

drawn up by Sir John, of the remarks which had been suggested in the course

of my labours, and which I had communicated at intervals. I need scarcely
mention that this report forms the foundation of all my subsequent labours,

and that we must ever regard Sir John as the first individual who has given

an impetus to this inquiry, and who has first trodden the field to which Prof.

Forbes some years since directed the attention of meteorologists. It has been

well-said by Col. Sabine, " that Sir John Herschel is the father of all our

modern researches in meteorology ; to him we owe all our hourly observations,
and to him we are indebted for those systematic arrangements by which

meteorology will take its due place among the sciences." The observation

of the great symmetrical wave in November 18е2, was an immediate con-

sequence of the discussion of Sir John's hourly observations. It resulted in

fact from a continuance (at such intervals as I could command) of the

observations until a complete rise and fall of the barometer had been observed,

and projected in a curve on a similar but reduced scale to that used in the

Myprojections of the quarterly observations.  former reports carry on the

history ; in them I have mentioned the further assistance I have received from
Sir John, which I have now great pleasure in acknowledging.

To Capt. I.arcom, R.E., I am indebted for a valuable series of observa-

tions, accompanied with curves during October, November, and December

1845. I have already alluded to these in the body of the report.

To Professor Phillips and Dr. Stevelly I am indebted for some

valuable series from the north of England and Ireland. I am also indebted

to Dr. Lloyd for several extracts from the records of the Dublin observatory

also to Sir Thomas Brisbane, Professor Nichol and Silvanus Thomp-

son, for observations made at their respective observatories.

To Professor Quetelet I am indebted for a valuable series from the

observatory at Brussels, and for several series of the quarterly observations

collected by himself, which may be most advantageously used in such Inquiries

as the present.

To E. W. Brayley, Jun., Esq., of the London Institution, I am greatly

indebted for the valuable assistance which he has on several occasions in con-

nection with this inquiry most readily afforded me ; especially the great in-

terest which he manifested at the commencement of the discussion of Sir

John Herschel's quarterly observations which materially contributed to the

reductions being entrusted to my hands ; and I take this opportunity of acknow-

ledging, not only such assistance, but also the direction which that gentleman

has given to my earlier studies, and the advice he has offered me in prosecuting
                    ;

--166 REPORT 1846.

my inquiries. The interesting conversations on this and kindred subjects that
I have had with him during the last ten years, have greatly assisted me in my
labours. I am also indebted to George Gwilt, Esq. and to E.Johnston,
Esq., for the assistance afibrded by those gentlemen, in my earliest endeavours

 to observe and trace a complete wave.

   To the gentlemen named in the third column of Table I., I am indebted

 for observations at the stations recorded in the first column of that table,
which have been made with great care, and mostly at the hours named in the

 instructions.

    I cannot close this report without remarking, that many of the observations

which have thus been collected and partially discussed, owe their existence en-

tirely to the auspices of this Association ; and should the further discussion

of them be entrusted to my hands, the same care shall be manifested which
I have endeavoured to exhibit in my previous labours ; and by examining

them in every point of view and under every possible aspect, I trust the re-

sult will be such as fully to accord with the great object of the Association
and should no new facts be elicited, yet it is to be hoped that these observa-

tions, called for as they have been by the Association, will confirm the sug-

gestions, and throw considerable light on the labours of several eminent
meteorologists, so that in these respects subjects at which we have only ob-
tained a glance, may be brought fully into view, and thus by means of these

observations the science in some degree advanced.

   Of the grant of г7 placed at my disposal I have expended г3 3s. 3c?. As

nearly the whole of the observations on the return of the great wave in the

autumn of 184'5, as well as those during the previous October are at present

unreduced, I respectfully request a continuance of the grant.

                                                                           W. R. BiHT.

                                        Postscript, April 10, 1847.

    During the period between the sitting of the Association and this report
passing through the press, I have been furnished, by the liberality of the
Royal Society, with the magnetical and meteorological observations made
during the year 1842 at various stations in the Russian empire. These
stations embrace an area extending over 195 degrees of longitude. The ob-
servations at St. Petersbui-gh, the nearest station to those given by Mr. Brown,

in a great majority of cases fully confirm the results arrived at in the pre-
ceding discussion, and in others the views obtained by means of Mr. Brown's
observations are corrected, and considerable light thrown on the real character
of the smaller waves traversing Great Britain and Ireland. In addition to
these advantages, the Russian observations, in connexion with others, exhibit
to us the vast area over which the slopes of these waves extend, so vast that
they actually approach in the extent of their sweep and the regularity of their
progress to the tide-waves of the ocean. But this is not all ; the records of the
Russian observatories contain ample materials for carrying out the suggestion
of Sir John Herschel, expressed in the close of his Report on Meteorological

Reductions (Report, 184-3, page 98), " that when dealing with undulations of
such extent, it is by no means a visionary speculation to consider the possi-
bility of tracing them over the whole of our globe." The area embraced by
Mr. Brown's and the Russian observations extends over 235 degi-ees of lon-
gitude ; and it is apparent from the observations themselves, that the greater
fluctuations are readily traceable. Our Colonial Observatory at Toronto will
carry on the observations from Sitka, and the stations on the eastern shores
of America will enable us to trace the waves from the eastern to the western
shores of the Atlantic, over the vast continents of Europe and Asia.

   The following table contains the altitude of the barometer at St. Peters-
burgh during the twenty-six days included by Mr. Brown's observations.

Whenever the results obtained by means of Mr. Brown's observations are

either confirmed or illustrated by them, a reference is made to the day on

which the particular wave, a;s indicated by the observations given in page 141,

is either identified with one as developed by my previous investigations, or

more clearly exhibited and its true character more distinctly brought to light.

wave and the vast amount of its amplitude. The direction of the trough is

indicated on plate 42, Report, ISl'i.

  --November 11. Posterior troughs, crests Nos. 2 and 3. On Nov. 5 we

distinctly traced the directions of the crests Nos. 1 and 2, and the observa-

tions at St. Petersburgh assisted us in indicating the locality of their inter-

section. The observations of this day, Nov. 11, indicate the contemporane-

ous existence of the posterior troughs of crests Nos. 2 and 3.

It appears probable, from a consideration of the observations of November

12, that the depression which occurred at Plymouth (see page 150) was oc-

casioned by the crossing of the posterior troughs of crests Nos. 2 and 3. If
so, we are enabled to form a correct estimate of the direction of these contem-
poraneous troughs. The posterior trough of crest No. 2 now passes St.

Petersburgh. Table IX. (Report, 184^5, page 125) clearly indicates that the

depression of this day, in the south of England, was due to the posterior

Wetrough of crest No. 3.  find Paris under the posterior slope of crest No. 2,

so that the intersections of the troughs must have been situated in the neigh-

bourhood of Plymouth, or between Cork and Plymouth : the direction of the

trough of crest No. 3 appears to have extended from Paris towards Cork

while the crest was passing Christiania. It appears the velocity of crest No.

3 was greater than that of crest No. 1, which may, to a certain extent, explain

the discrepancy noticed in page 150.

 --November 12. Crest No. 3. This crest now passes St. Petersburgh, while

its posterior trough passes Belfast and Shields.

 --November 15. Anterior trough, crest No. 5. This trough now transits

St. Petersburgh. The fact of the succeeding crest (No. 5) passing the Ork-
neys at the same time, clearly indicates the wave to be much smaller than the

preceding two.

  --November 17. Crest No. 7. It appears from a comparison of the Chris-

great symmetrical wave, has been very distinctly developed by the discussion

of Mr. Brown's observations. The altitude it attained, especially in the

south-east of England, has contributed to bring it prominently into view.

The observations at St. Petersburgh make us acquainted with the great ex-

tent of its longitudinal direction. Its crest passed Dublin on the 17tb, Lon-

don on the 18th, and Munich on the 19th (see plate 2, appended to Sir John

Herschel's Report on Meteorological Reductions, Report, 1843). In the fol-

lowing table the transit of its crest at the three northern stations, the Orkneys,

Christiania and St. Petersburgh, is readily seen. The direction in which tlie

wave progressed being N.W. to S.E., the section which passed over St. Peters-
burgh was more northerly than the others. The maximum occurred at St.

Petersburgh at least twelve hours later than at Munich, and about two days

later than at Dublin.

Report on the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton.

                            By Prof. Owen, F.R.S.

                              Part I. Special Homology.

                                                           Introduction.

When the structure of organized beings began to be investigated, the parts,

 as they were observed, were described under names or phrases suggested
 by their forms, proportions, relative position, or liiieness to some familiar ob-

ject. Much of the nomenclature of human anatomy has thus arisen, espe-

cially that of the osseous system, which, with the rest of man's frame, was
studied originally from an insulated point of view, and irrespective of any

other animal structure or any common type.
    So when the exigences of the veterinary surgeon, or the desire of the

naturalist to penetrate beneath the superficial characters of his favourite
class, led them to anatomise the lower animals, they, in like manner, seldom
glanced beyond their immediate subject, and often gave arbitrary names
to the parts which they detected. Thus the dissector of the horse, whose

attention was more especially called to the leg as the most common seat
of disease in that animal, specified its 'cannon-bone,' its 'great' and 'small'
.pastern-bones, its ' cofiin-bone,' and its л nut-bone' or 'coronet': some
cranial bones were also named agreeably with their shape, as the ' os qua-
dratum,' for example. The ornithotomist described, in the same irrelative

manner, the ' ossa homoidea,' ' ossa communicantia' or ' interarticularia,'
the ' columella ' and ' os furcatorium.' Petit * had his ' os grele ' and ' os
en massue;' Herissantf his 'os carre'; which, however, is by no means the
same bone with the 'os carre' or 'os quadratum' of the hippotomist. The
investigator of reptilian osteology described ' hatchet-bones ' and chevron-
bones, an ' OS annulare' or ' os en ceinture,' and an 'os transversum': he
likewise defined a 'columella'; but this was a bone quite distinct from that
so called in the bird. The ichthyotomist had also an ' os transversum,' which
again Avas distinct from that in reptiles, and he demonstrated his ' os discoi-

deum,' ' OS ccenosteon,' ' os mystaceum,' ' ossa symplectica prima,' ' secunda,'
'tertia,' 'supreraa,' 'postrema,' &c. Similar examples of arbitrary names might

easily be multiplied ; many distinct ones signifying the same part in different
animals, whilst essentially distinct parts often received the same name from

different anatomical authors, occupied exclusively by particular species.
Each, at the beginning, viewed his subject independently ; and finding, there-
fore, new organs, created a new nomenclature for them; just as the anthro-
potomist had done, of necessity, when, with a view to the cure or relief of
disease and injury, he entered upon the vast domain of anatomical science by
the structure of Man, or of the mammals most resembling man.

--lyO REPORT 1846.

It may well be conceived with what a formidable load of names the me-

mory must have been burthened, if any could have been found equal to it,

had the anatomy of animals continued and made progress under its primitive

condition of an assemblage of arbitrarily described and uncompared facts.
   Happily the natural tendency of the human mind to sort and generalize its

ideas could not long permit such a state of the science, if science it could be

Acalled, to remain.  large and valuable portion of the labours of the com-

parative anatomists who have honoured the present century, has been devoted

to the determination of those bones in the lower animals which correspond

with bones in the human skeleton ; the results being usually expressed by
applying to the parts so determined the same names, as far as the nomen-
clature of anthropotomy allowed. Few, however, of the parts of the human

body have received single substantive names ; they are for the most part in-

dicated by shorter or longer descriptive phrases, like the species and parts of

plants before Linnaeus reformed botanical nomenclature.

The temptation to devise a systematic Nomenclature of Anatomy, generally

applicable to all animals, increases with the advance of the science, and from
the analogy of what has taken place in other sciences it may one day be

yielded to and exercise the ingenuity of some ardent reformer. But the same

analogy, especially that afforded by chemical science since the time of Lavoi-

sier, would rather lead the true friend of anatomy to deprecate the attempt

to impose an entirely new nomenclature of parts, however closely expressive
of the nature and results of tlie science at the period when it might be devised.

For there is no stability in such descriptive or enunciative nomenclature ; it

changes, and must change with the progress of the science, and thus becomes

a heavy tax upon such progress.

If the arbitrary term ' calomel,' which, like ' house' and 'dog,' signifies the

thing in its totality, without forcing any particular quality of its subject

prominently upon the mind, be preferable, on that account as well as its

brevity, to the descriptive phrases 'submuriate of mercury,' 'chloride of

mercury,' or ' proto-chloride of mercury,' in enunciating propositions respect-

ing the substance to which it is applied ; and if it possesses the additional ad-

vantage of fixity, of a steady meaning not liable to be affected, like a descrip-

tive name or phrase, by every additional knowledge of the properties of the

substance; the anatomist, zealous for the best interests of his science, will feel

strongly the desirableness of retaining and securing for the subjects of his

propositions similar single, arbitrary terms, especially if they are also capable

of being inflected and used as noun adjectives.

   The practice of anatomists of the soundest judgement has usually been,
to transfer the anthropotomical term or phrase to the answerable part when
detected in other animals. The objection that the original descriptive or

otherwise allusive meaning of the term seldom applies to the part with equal
force in other animals, and sometimes not at all, is one of really little moment;

for the term borrowed from anthropotomy is soon understood in an arbitrary

sense, and without regard to its applicability to the modified form which
the namesake of the human bone commonly assumes to suit the ends required

in the lower species. No anatomist, for example, troubles himself with the

question of the amount of resemblance to a crow's or other bird's beak in the

'coracoid' bone of a reptile, or with the want of likeness of the kangaroo's

'coccyx' to the beak of a cuckoo; or of the whale's 'vomer' to a plough-

share ; or ever associates the idea of the original mystic allusion in the ana-
tomical term ' sacrum ' with his description of that bone in the megatherium

or other monster. Common sense gratefully accepts such names when they

become as arbitrary as cat or calomel, and when such concretes or adjectives

as 'coccygeal,' 'vomerine' and 'sacral' can be employed to teach the pro-

perties or accidents of their subjects.

   To substitute names for phrases is not only allowable, but I believe it to be
indispensable to the right progress of anatomy ; but such names must be arbi-

trary, or, at least, should have no other signification than the homological one,
if anatomy, as the science of the structure of all animals, is to enjoy the inesti-

mable benefit of a steady and universal nomenclature. I am far from being in-

sensible to the advantages which other sciences have derived from revolutions
in their technical language ; but experience has also demonstrated attendant
evils ; and these, it is to be feared, would preponderate in the case of anatomy,
on account of the peculiar character of its origin, and the fact of its cultivators
being for the most part introduced to the science through the portal of anthro-
potomy. So long, likewise, as due deference continues to be paid to the deep
and vital importance of the practical applications of the parent science in

medicine and surgery, it will be in vain for any man to expect that his sole
authority would suffice for the general reception of an entirely new nomen-

clature, however philosophically devised or clearly enunciative of the highest
and most comprehensive truths of the science at the time of its formation.

    After maturely considering this subject in its various relations, I have ar^
rived at the conviction that the best interests of anatomical science will be
consulted by basing the nomenclature applicable to the vertebrate subking-

dom upon the terms and phrases in which the great anthropotomists of the
16th, 17th and 18th centuries have communicated to us the fruits of their
immortal labours. For it is only on this firm foundation that we may hope

to avoid that ceaseless change of terms which follows the device of a syste-
matic nomenclature significant of a given progress and result of scientific
research. But the names of the parts of the vertebrate animals so based on
or deduced from the language of anthropotomy must divest themselves of
their original descriptive signification, and must stand simply and arbitra-
rily as the signs of such parts, or at least with the sole additional meaning
of indicating the relation of the part in the lower animal to its namesake or
homologue in Man. It is an old maxim accepted by the best logicians, that
no name is so good as that which signifies the total idea or whole subject,
without calling prominently to mind any one particular quality, which is
thereby apt to be deemed, undeservedly, more essential than the rest.

    The chief improvement which the language of anatomy, based upon that
of anthropotomy, must receive in order to do its requisite duty, is the substi-
tution of ' names ' for ' phrases ' and ' definitions ' ; and this is less a change
of nomenclature than the giving to anatomy what it did not before possess,
but which is absolutely requisite to express briefly and clearly, and without
periphrasis, propositions respecting the parts of animal bodies. Such names
should be derived from a universal or dead language, and when anglicized,
or translated into other modern equivalents, ought to be capable of being

inflected adjectively.

   A few examples will suffice to show how greatly the advantage of such

names preponderates over the trouble of substituting them in the memory

for the definitions which previously signified the ideas.
    In the classical Anthropotomy of Soemmerring, a well-defined part of the

skull, which is a distinct bone in the human embryo, and permanently so in

all cold-blooded Vertebrata, is called " pars occipitalis stricte sic dicta partis
occipitalis ossis spheno-occipitalis*." Monro, in his justly-esteemed treatise

* On the Human Bonesf,' defines the same bone as " all the part of the (oc-

cipital) bone above the great foramen." In the ' Elements of Anatomy,' by

Dr. Quaini, a work of repute for its clearness and minuteness of detail, the

part in question is neither named nor described. The term supra-occipitale,

luat. (siq)ra-occipital,Eng.,stir-occipital, Fr.), is obviously a gain to anatomical

science in all propositions respecting this part in the vertebrate series.

Certain parts of a vertebra, distinct bones at an early period in man, and

throughout life in most reptiles, are defined by Soemmerring as 'radices ar-

cus posterioris vertebrae,' or ' arcus posterior vertebrae ' collectively *. Monro

describes the same parts separately, as " a broad oblique bony plate extended
backwards," and together, as " a bony arch produced backwards" : he names,

defines and minutely describes the processes, &c. of these bony plates, which

in the series of Vertebrata are soon found to be non-essential characters ; but

for the plates themselves, which are the most constant and essential consti-
tuents of a vertebra, he has no name. Dr. Quain defines the same parts as " two

plates of bone, the lamellae or arches, which complete the central foramen f."
They are sometimes more briefly but vaguely spoken of in English works
of Comparative Anatomy as " the vertebral lamellae " or " vertebral laminae,"

or " perivertebral elements." The term ' neurapophysis,' Lat. and Eng. (' neur-

apophyse', Fr.), applicable to each element individually, under which all its

properties may be predicated of by the adjective ' neurapophysial,' without

MM.periphrasis, seems by its adoption in the classical works of             Agassiz

and Stannius, to be as acceptable as the term 'sur-occipital' substituted by

Cuvier for the definitions in anthropotomy above cited.

Similar instances of the absence of determinate names, capable of in-

flection, for parts of the human frame, will be seen in the last column of

Table I., and others will occur to the anatomist, even in regard to most

important parts, as the primary natural divisions of the neural axis, for

example, to the great hindrance of brief, clear and intelligible descriptions.

So long as the phrases 'marrow of the spine,' 'chord of the spine,' continue

to usurp the place of a proper name, all propositions concerning their sub-

ject must continue to be periphrastic, and often also dubious. Thus if the

pathologist, speaking of diseases of the spinal marrow, desires to abbreviate

his proposition by speaking of ' spinal disease,' he is liable to be misunder-

stood as referring to disease of the spinal or vertebral column. The vague,

but often-used phrase 'chorda dorsalis' for the embryonic fibro-gelatinous

basis of the spine, adds another source of confusion likely to arise from the

use of the term ' spinal chord,' as applied to that most important part of the

neural axis which I have proposed to call 'Myelou:];,' a term which, if adopted,

would be attended by this advantage, that no ambiguity could arise in speak-

ing of ' myelonal functions,' ' myelonal affections,' or other properties of this

part of the central axis of the nervous system.

Anthropotomy, in respect to its nomenclature, or rather the want of one,

is, as I have already remarked, not unlike v\ hat botany was before the time of
Linnaeus, and we may anticipate the happiest efi'ects from a judiciously re-

formed technical language in the advances ent of the true and philosophic

knowledge of the human structure, from the rapid progress of botany when

the opposition raised by sloth or envy to the Linnaean reforms was overcome.

For a good general anatomical nomenclature, based and regulated upon the

principles above defined, must reflect its benefits upon anthropotomy. 1 dare

not flatter myself that the names adopted or proposed for the Osseous System

of the Vertebrata in my'HunterianLectures'and in the first column of Tablel.

will meet at once with acceptance, but the attempt to establish such a nomen-

clature will be felt to have been an indispensable step in undertaking a general

survey of the homological relations of the vertebrate skeleton.

ox THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  173

   In proposing a definite name for each distinct bone, declaratory of its
special homology throughout the vertebrate kingdom, 1 have sought earnestly
to reduce the amount of reform to the minimum allowed by the exigences
of the case. Agreeably with Aphorism III. of the ' Philosophy of the In-
ductive Sciences' (p. Ixvii.), the nomenclature of anthropotomy forms the
basis, and all the names given to parts by one or other of the great French
anatomists have been accepted, with the modifications of a Latin or an En.
glish termination, wherever such names had not been applied, as is the case
with some proposed by Geoifroy St. Hilaire, to two different parts. In sub-
stituting names for phrases, I have endeavoured, conformably with another
of Dr. Whewell's canons (Aph. XVII. op. cit. p. cxvii.), to approximate the
sound of the name as nearly as possible to those of the leading terms of the
definition or phrase, as e. g. alisphenoid for ' ala media, &c. sphenoidalis ' and
for ' grande aile du sphenoide ' ; orbitosphenoid for ' ala superior seu orbi-
talis, &c. sphenoidalis,' and for 'aile orbitaire du sphenoide*.'

   The corresponding parts in different animals being thus made namesakes,
are called technically ' homologues.' The term is used by logicians as syno-
nymous with ' homonyms,' and by geometricians as signifying ' the sides of
similar figures which are opposite to equal and corresponding angles,' or to
parts having the same proportions t : it appears to have been first applied in
anatomy by the philosophical cultivators of that science in Germany. Geof-
froy St. Hilaire says, " Les organes des sens sont homologues, comme s'ex-
primerait la philosophic AUemande ; c'est-a-dire qu'ils sont analogues dans
leur mode de developpement, s'il existe veritablement en eux un meme prin-
cipe de formation, une tendance uniforme a se r6peter, a se reproduire de la
meme fa9ont." The French anatomist, however, seems not rightly to
define the sense in which the German philosophers have used the term
there is a looseness in the expression ' analogous in their mode of develop-
ment,' which may mean either identical or similar, and also different kinds of
similarity. Parts are homologous in the sense in which the term is used in

this Report, which are not always similarly developed: thus the 'pars occi-
pitalis stricte sic dicta,' &c. of Soemmerring is the special homologue of the

supraoccipital bone of the cod, although it is developed out of pre-existing

cartilage in the fish and out of aponeurotic membrane in the human subject.
I also regard the supraoccipital as the serial homologue of the parietal and
the midfrontal, although these are developed out of the epicranial membrane

in the fish, and not out of pre-existing cartilage, like the supraoccipital.
The femur of the cow is not the less homologous with the femur of the cro-
codile, because in the one it is developed from four separate ossific centres, and
the other from only one such centre. In like manner the compound mandi-
 bular ramus of the fish is the homologue of the simple mandibular ramus of
the mammal, as the compound tympanic pedicle of the fish is homologous
with the simple tympanic pedicle of the bird, the differences expressed by
 the terms ' simple ' and ' compound ' depending entirely on a difference of

 development.

    Without knowing the precise sense in which Geoffroy St. Hilaire under-

    * The happy facility of combination which the German language enjoys has long enabled
 the very eminent anatomists of that intellectual part of Europe to condense the definitions of
 anthropotomy into single words ; but these cannot become cosmopolitan ; such terms as
 ' Hinterhauptbeinkorper,' ' Schlafbeinschiippen.'and 'Zwischenkiemendeckelstiick/are likely
 to be restricted to the anatomists of the country where the vocal powers have been trained
 from infancy to their utterance.

     t This is' the sense in which the term is defined in the French Dictionary and in our
  Johnson's Dictionary.

stood ' analogous development,' one cannot determine how much or how little

it is applicable to the determination of homologies or to the definition of
homologous parts. Dr. Reichert seems to have been unduly influenced by the
idea of ' analogy or similarity of development in the determination of homo-
logous parts ' when he rejected the parietal and frontal bones from the system
of the endo-skeleton, because they were not developed from a pre-existing
cartilaginous basis*, or, because they could be easily detached from subja-
cent persistent cartilage in certain fishes ; the essential distinction between
these and the supra- occipital in regard to development being, that whereas
the cartilaginous stage intervened in the latter between the membranous and
the osseous stages, in the other, usually more expanded, cranial spines, the
osseous change appears to be immediately superinduced upon the primitive
aponeurotic histological 'condition.

   M. Agassiz seems, in like manner, to give undue importance to similarity

of development in the determination of homologies, where he repudiates the
general homology of the basi-sphenoid with the vertebral centrum, and con-
sequently its serial homology with the basi-occipital, because the pointed end
of the chorda dorsalis has not been traced further forwards along the basis
of the cranium in the embryo osseous fish than the basi-occipital f. But the
development of the centrum of every vertebra begins, not in the gelatinous
chord, but in its aponeurotic capsule, and it is in the expanded aponeurosis
directly continued from the 'chorda' along the 'basis cranii' that the thin
stratum of cartilage cells is formed from which the ossification of the basi-
sphenoid, presphenoid and vomer proceeds.

   There exists doubtless a close general resemblance in the mode of deve-
lopment of homologous parts ; but this is subject to modification, like the
forms, proportions, functions and very substance of such parts, without their
essential homological relationships being thereby obliterated. These rela-
tionships are mainly, if not wholly, determined by the relative position and
connection of the parts, and may exist independently of form, proportion,
substance, function and similarity of development. But the connections
must be sought for at every period of development, and the changes of rela-
tive position, if any, during growth, must be compared with the connections
which the part presents in the classes where vegetative repetition is greatest
and adaptive modification least.

    Relations of homology are often not only confounded with those of analogy,
but in some recent and highly estimable works on comparative anatomy the
terms ' analogy ' and ' analogue ' continue to be used to express the ideas of
homology and homologue, or are so used as to leave in doubt the meaning of
tile author. Thus when we read in the latest edition of the ' Le9ons d' Ana-
tomic Comparee ' of Cuvier, " Les branchies sont les poumons des animaux
absolument aquatiques," t. vii. p. 164; and with regard to the cartilaginous
or osseous supports of the gills, " elles sont, a notre avis, aux branchies des
poissons, ce que les cerceaux cartilagineux ou osseux des voies aeriennes sont
aux poumons des trois classes superieures," Ibid. p. 177, we are left in doubt
whether it is meant that the gills and their mechanical supports merely perform
the same function in fishes which the lungs and windpipe do in mammals, or
whether they are not also actually the same parts differently piodified in re-
lation to the diflFerent respiratory media in the two classes of animals. The
deeper-thinking GeoflProy leaves no doubt as to his meaning where he argues

in the ' Philosophie Anatomique' (8vo, 1818, 4ieme memoire, p. 205), that

the branchial arches of fishes are the modified tracheal rings of the air-

breathing vertebi-ates : we perceive at once that he is enunciating a relation

of homology.
. I have elsewhere* discussed the relations, both homological and analogical,
of the respiratory organs of the air-breathing and water-breathing vertebrate

animals, and have here adverted to them merely to illustrate the essential

distinction of those relations. In the ' Glossary ' appended to the first volume

--Aof my ' Hunterian Lectures,' the terms in question are defined as follows :
" Analogue."  part or organ in one animal which has the same func-

--tion as another part or organ in a different animal.
   " HoMOLOGUE." The same organ in different animals under every variety

of form and function-f-."
   The little ' Draco volans ' offers a good illustration of both relations. Its

fore-limbs being composed of essentially the same parts as the wings of a bird
are homologous with them ; but the parachute being composed of different

parts, yet performing the same function as the wings of a bird, is analogous
to them. Homologous parts are always, indeed, analogous parts in one sense,

inasmuch as, being repetitions of the same parts of the body, they bear in
that respect the same relation to different animals. But homologous parts

may be, and often are, also analogous parts in a fuller sense, viz. as perform-
ing the same functions : thus the fin or pectoral limb of a Porpoise is homo-
logous with that of a Fish, inasmuch as it is composed of the same or answerable

parts; and they are the analogues of each other, inasmuch as they have the

same relation of subserviency to swimming. So, likewise, the pectoral fin of
the flying fish is analogous to the wing of the Bird, but, unlike the wing of

the Dragon, it is also homologous with it.
   Relations of homology are of three kinds : the first is that above defined,

viz. the correspondency of a part or organ, determined by its relative position

and connections, with a part or organ in a different animal ; the determination

of which homology indicates that such animals are constructed on a common

<ype: when, for example, the correspondence of the basilar process of the

human occipital bone with the distinct bone called ' basi-occipital ' in a fish

or crocodile is shown, the special homology of that process is determined.

  A higher relation of homology is that in which a part or series of parts

stands to the fundamental or general type, and its enunciation involves

and implies a knowledge of the type on which a natural group of animals,
the vertebrate for example, is constructed. Thus when the basilar process of
the human occipital bone is determined to be the ╖ centrum ' or ' body of the

last cranial vertebra,' its general homology is enunciated.

If it be admitted that the general type of the vertebrate endo-skeleton is

rightly represented by the idea of a series of essentially similar segments

succeeding each other longitudinally from one end of the body to the other,
such segments being for the most part composed of pieces similar in number

and arrangement, and though sometimes extremely modified for special func-

--tions, yet never so as to wholly mask their typical character, then any

given part of one segment may be repeated in the rest of the series, just as

one bone may be reproduced in the skeletons of different species, and this
kind of repetition or representative relation in the segments of the same

skeleton I call ' serial homology.' As, however, the parts can be namesakes

only in a general sense, as centrums, neurapophyses, ribs, &c.; and since

they must be distinguished by different special names according to their par-
ticular modifications in the same skeleton, as e. g. mandible, coracoid, ilium,
&c., I call such serially related or repeated parts ' homotypes.' The basi-
occipital is the homotype of the basi-sphenoid ; or in other words, when the
basi-occipital is said to repeat in its vertebra or natural segment of the ske-
leton the basi-sphenoid or body of the parietal vertebra, or the bodies of the
atlas and succeeding vertebrae, its serial homology is indicated. The study
of this kind of homologies was commenced by Vicq d'Azyr, in his ingenious

memoir ' On the Parallelism of the Fore and Hind Limbs.' If we except

the complex and extremely diversified and modified parts of the radiated
appendages of the vertebral segments, to which Vicq d'Azyr restricted his
comparisons, the serial homologies of the skeleton are necessarily demon-
^trated when the general and special homologies have been determined.

    In the present section of this Report I propose to consider some of those
examples of special homology which are least satisfactorily determined and
respecting which different opinions still sway different anatomists. Such
instances are fortunately few, thanks to the persevering and successful labours
of the great comparative anatomists of the last half-century : pre-eminent

amongst whom will ever stand the name of Cuvier, in whose classical works,

' Ossemens Fossiles,' 'Histoire des Poissons,' ' Le(;:ons d'Anatomic Comparee
(posthumous edition), and ' Regno Animal,' 1828, will be found the richest
illustrations of the special homological relations of the bones in the four classes

of vertebrate animals.

    Second only to Cuvier must be named Geoffroy St. Hilaire, whose
memoir on theBonesof the Skull in Birds as compared with those in Mammals,
in the ' Annales du Museum,t. x. (1807)> forms an early and brilliant example

of the quest of special homologies, which could not fail, with other and similar
investigations of the same ingenious author, to impart a stimulus to that
philosophical department of anatomical inquiry*. In regard to the osteology
of the crocodile, we find Cuvier and Geoffroy engaged in a long parallel series
of rival researches, the results of which have had the happiest effects in de-
termining some of the most difficult questions of special homology.

    Nor was the co-operation of zealous cultivators of comparative anatomy
wanting in the eminent schools and universities of Germany. Goethe, in-
deed, had taken the lead in inquiries of this nature in his determination, in 1787,
of the special homology of that anterior part of the human upper maxillary
bone which is separated by a more or less extensive suture from the rest of
the bone in the f^oetus ; and the philosophical principles propounded in the
great poets famous anatomical essays called forth the valuable labours of the
kindred spirits, Oken, Bojanus, Meckel, Carus, and other eminent culti-
vators of anatomical philosophy in Germany.

    It is not requisite for the purpose I have in view, to trace step bj' step the
progress of the special homological department of anatomy. Its present
state, as regards the skull of the Vertebrata, will be best exposed by the sub-
joined tabular view of the fruits of the latest inquiries.

                          Table I. (See end of the Report.)

    This table gives at one view the general results of the researches into
the conformity of structure of the skull throughout the vertebrate series,

   * Oken's famous "Programm, Uber die Bedeutung der Schadelknochen" was published
in the same year (1807) as Geoffrey's Memoir on the Bird's skull; but it is devoted less to
the determination of ' special ' than of ' general homologies ' : it has, in fact, a much higher
aim than the contemporary publication of the French anatomist, in which we seek in vain
for any glimpse of those higher relations of the l)ones of the skull, the discovery of which
has conferred immortality on the name of Okejt.

by the two great French anatomists who have most advanced this part of

osteological science ; by the authors of two classical German works on
Comparative Anatomy ; and by their countryman Dr. Kallmann, who has

detailed in an elaborate treatise his especial investigations of some of the most

difficult parts of this difficult inquiry. I have added the synonyms of the

bones of the bead of fishes from the great work of the celebrated Swiss na-

turalist, who has, so happily for ichthyology, devoted himself to the advance-

ment of that interesting branch of Natural History ; and also, the antiiropo-
tomical terms for the corresponding parts in the human skeleton. These,

after much comparison and deliberation, 1 have chosen from the justly-cele-

brated work of SoEMMERRiNG, the high reputation of which has been sanc-

tioned by the new edition to which some of the most eminent of the German

professors of anthropotomy and physiology have recently devoted their com-

bined labours. The English teacher of these sciences will find some of the

descriptive designations of the parts by Soemmerring not agreeing with

those which he may be in the habit of using, and which are current in the

later Manuals of Anthropotomy published in this country : the ' ossa la-

teralia lingualia' are more commonly called, with us, the ' cornua majora

Oisis hyoidei' ; the 'os spheno-occipitale' is generally described as two di-

stinct bones, the ' os occipitis' and ' os sphenoide'; the 'pars occipitalis

stricte sic dicta,' &c. is sometimes called ' squama occipitalis,' or occipital

plate ; and other synonyms might easily be multiplied from the osteolo-
gical treatises of Monro and later authors of repute. The fact of such a

conflicting and unsettled synonymy still pervading the monographs relating
to the human structure, should stimulate the well-wisher to the right progress

of anatomy to lend an earnest aid to the establishment of a fixed and deter-

Aminate nomenclature.  little present labour and the example of adoption,

where the reasonableness and necessity of the reform are plain and undeni-

able, will much accelerate the future progress of anatomical science ; and I
would respectfully appeal to the Professors and Demonstrators of Human

Anatomy for an unbiassed consideration of the advantages of the terms pro-

posed in the first column in Table I. It is designed to express the results of

a long series of investigations into the special homologies of the bones of the

head, in simple and definite terms, capable of every requisite inflection to

express the properties of the parts, and applicable to the same bones from

the highest to the lowest of the vertebrate series.

   The degree and extent of the diversity of my determinations from those

of other anatomists are shown in the succeeding columns, headed by their
names ; and I proceed now to give the reasons which have compelled me, in
such instances, to dissent from the high authority of Cuvier, Geoff'roy, Meckel,
Hallmann and Agassiz : these reasons will exonerate me, I trust, from the

reproach of underrating their justly-esteemed opinions, which have been
abandoned only where nature seemed clearly to refuse her sanction to them.

The instances of such dissent are much fewer than they appear to be at first
sight. In most cases, where the names diflPer, the determinations are the

same. For ' basilaire,' which Cuvier exclusively applies to the ' pars basilaris'
of the occiput, and which Geoffrey as exclusively applies (in birds) to the
' pars basilaris' of the sphenoid, I have substituted the term ' basioccipital'

(hasi-occipitale, Lat.) ; a term which, as it is more descriptive of the bone in

question (i figs. 1 to 25), will, perhaps, be the more acceptable to those
who prefer a determinate to a variable nomenclature, since Cuvier himself
has almost as frequently applied to that bone the term 'occipital inferieur'
as the term ' basilaire.' For the descriptive phrase ' occipital lateral,' the
term 'exoccipital' (exoccipifale, Lat.), proposed by Geotfroy, is preferable for
--178 REPORT 1846.

the bones 2,2, figs. 1 to 25; especially since the paroccipital is the ntiost ' lateral'
of the elements of the occipital bone, in the definite sense in which the term
'lateral' is used in the precise and excellent anatomical nomenclature of
Dr. Barclay. For the numerous syno-
nyms borne by the element :╗ of the oc-

cipital segment of the skull, the term

' supraoccipital ' (sitpra-occipifale, Lat.)

seemed to best agree with the truest de-

scriptive phrase of the part, viz. ' occipital

superieur.' The interparietal is no con-

stant cranial element, nor is it a dismem-

berment of one and the same bone of the

skull. It is at best only the largest and

most common of the accidentally interca-

lated ' ossa wormiana.' Sometimes, for

example, in the Cehus monkey, it is a
dismemberment of the backwardly-pro-

duced frontal bone : more frequently it is

the detached upper angle of the supra-

occipital. But by this term ' supraoccipi-

tal,' 1 signify the totality of the bone 3 (in

           apex                     or

superior and posterior apex of the frontal, when it is in like manner detached
and wedged between the parietal bones. The inapplicability of the term ' in-

terparietal' to the whole of the supraoccipital is strongly manifested in those

fishes, e.g. the carp and tench, in which the supraoccipital is withdrawn from

between the parietals to the back part of the skull, leaving those bones to come

into contact and unite by the normal sagittal suture on the mesial line of

the vertex. GeofFroy's error is of the same kind, and scarcely greater than

Cuvier's, where he applies the term ' interparietal' to the whole of the parietal

bones in Birds*. The supraoccipital thus defined can never be mistaken for

the 'sur-occipital' of Geoffroy, who. by this term signifies the elements called

' occipitaux externes' by Cuvier. At the same time the term ' sur- occipital' is

too near in sound to ' supraoccipital,' and too significant of the highest part of

the occipital segment to be retained for elements, which, like the ' paroccipi-

tals'(fig. 1,4,4), are usually inferior in position to the supraoccipital. Geoffroy;

moreover, is not consistent in his application of the term ' sur-occipital.' In

his memoir on the skull of the crocodile in the ' Annales des Sciences' for

1824, he applies that term to a part of the bonef, the whole of which he calls

'exoccipital ' in his later memoir, on the skull of the crocodile, of 1833 J ;
whilst in the memoir illustrated by the skull of the Sea-perch {Serranus

ffigas) in the ' Annales des Sciences' for 1825, the term ' suroccipital' is ap-
plied to the whole of the bones described as ' occipitaux externes' by Cuvier.

I trust, therefore, to have shown the necessity for the definite name of

* paroccipital' (paroccipitale, Lat.) which is here proposed for the elements, 4,
of the occipital segment of the cranium (figs. 1 and 5). The name has re-
ference to the general homology of the bones in question, as ' parapophyses'

or transverse processes of the occipital vertebra. And if the purists who are

distressed by such harmless hybrids as 'mineralogy,' 'terminology' and 'mam-

malogy,' should protest against the combination of the Greek prefix to the
Latin noun, I can only plead that servility to a particular source of the fluc-
tuating sounds of vocal language is a matter of taste ; and that it seems no
unreasonable privilege to use such elements as the servants of thought
and, in the interests of science, to combine them, even though they come from
different countries, where the required duty is best and most expeditiously

performed by such association.
   For the same motive that suggested the term basi-occipital, viz. because

the anthropotomist has been       'S* -"
long accustomed to hear

that and the corresponding

element of the s])henoid

bone described as ' basilar

processes,' I propose to sub-

stitute the term ' basisphe-

noid' (basisphenoideum,\j&t.)

for the three different de-

scriptive phrases applied to

the part (5, figs. 2, 5, 19,&c.)
by Cuvier, for the two ad-

ditional synonyms of Geof-

froy, and for the ' sphenoi-

deumbasilare' of Kallmann.

' Alisphenoid ' (alisphenoi-

deum, Lat., e, 6, figs. 2.5, 19,

&c.) seemed to retain most of     Disarticulated mesencephalic or neuro-parietal arch, viewed

of ' alse majores,' or wings ' par excellence' of the os sphenoideum ; as ' orbito-

sphenoid' (orbito- sphenoideum, 10, 10, figs. 3 and 20) best recalls or expresses

the idea conveyed by the descriptive phrase ' alae orbitales,' or 'ailesorbi-

taires,' often applied to the homologous bones, regarded as processes of the

sphenoid in human anatomy. Here, however, in reference to the alisphenoid,

we find the first marked discrepancy in the conclusions of the anatomists
who have particularly studied its special homologies. The bone which ap-

pears as the 'grande aile du sphenoide' to Cuvier and Agassiz in fishes, is

the ' petrosura' to Hallmann and Wagner ; it is also ' rocher' (petrosal) to

Cuvier himself in reptiles, and is again ' grande aile du sphenoide' in birds

and mammals. The reasons which have led me to the conclusion that the

bones so denominated, as well as the ' ptereal' and ' prerupeal' of Geoffroy,

are homologously one and the same, are so intimately linked with the con-

sideration of the true petrosal and of other elements of the anthropotomist's

' temporal bone,' that I reserve the discussion of these questions until I have
completed the apology for the names proposed in the first column of Table I.

   The 'parietal' (j9amto/e,Lat.,7,7, figs.2,5, 19, &c.)and ' mastoid' (masfoi-
deum, Lat., s, s, figs. 2, 5, 19, &c.) are amongst the few bones that have had
the good fortune to receive, originally, definite names, applicable to then?

throughout the vertebrate series ; although the mastoid, being like the par-

occipital, essentially a parapophysis, loses its individuality sooner than do

other bones of its segment, and becomes, therefore, a ' processus mastoideus
ossis temporis,' in the language of anthropotomy. The homology of the

* parietal' has fortunately been, with a single exception, universally recog-

nised throughout the vertebrate subkingdom ; the exception being furnished
by the eccentric homologist Geoffroy, who is, as usual, inconsistent. with

himself, even on this plainest and least mistakeabie point.
--180 REPORT 1846.

Theterm 'presphenoid'(prespke?ioidum,'La.t.o,^gs.3,5,^0, 2i,25,&c.) ispro-

posed forthe'sphenoide anterieur,'on the principleof substituting, as thebetter

instrument of thought, a definite name for a descriptive phrase. For the same

reason ' postfrontal' (postfron-

tale, Lat., 12, 12, figs. 3,5,20,&c.)

is substituted for Cuvier's ' fron-

tal posterieur' and its sj'nonyms.

The 'frontal' {frontale, Lat. u,

figs. 3, 5, 20, &c.) and ' vomer'

(vomer, l^ai., i3,figs.4, 5, 20, 25),

are among the few bones which

have had their special homolo-

gies recognised unanimously

throughout the vertebrate sub-

kingdom ; in the one case even
without departure from the

original anthropotomical name,

and in the other, with but a

single deviation from the esta-
blished nomenclature. But when

GeoflProy was induced to reject

the term ' vomer' as being ap-

plicable only to the peculiar

form of the bone in a small

proportion of the vertebrata, he

appears not to have considered

that the old term, in its wider

application, would be used with-

out reference  to  its  primary Disarticulated prosencephalic or neuro-frontal arch, viewed

                                                                       from behind: Cod-lish.

allusion to the ploughshare, and

that becoming, as it has, a purely arbitrary term, it is superior and prefer-

able to any partially descriptive one. ' Rhinosphenal,' it is true, recalls the

idea of the vomer forming the continuation in the nasal segment of the skull

of the basi- and pre-sphenoidal series of bones in other segments; but 'vomer,'

used arbitrarily, summons equally every idea derived to form the complex

whole from the general study of the bone throughout the vertebrate series.

╖Prefrontal' {prefrontale, Lat., 14, 14,     Fig. 4.

figs. 4, 5, 21, &c.) claims the same pre-
ference over anterior frontal, and its

foreign equivalents, as does postfrontal
over its synonymous phrases. There is

also another reason for proposing the
term ; viz. because it is applied to bones
in the vertebrate series generally, accord-
ing to conclusions as to their homologi-
cal relations, which differ from those to
which Cuvier and GeofFroy had arrived.

The discussion of the discordant deno-

minations at present applied to this im-

portant element of the skull will be fully

carried out in the sequel. 'Nasal' Disarticulated rhinencephalic, or neuro-nasal arch,

                                                                                                          viewed from behind : Cod-fish.

(nasale, 15, figs. 4, 5, 21, &c.) is another
of the few instances in which it is possible to retain and generally apply an

old and received anthropotomical term. No one, it is presumed, will con-

tend for the perpetual expression or insertion of the understood generic word
'bone' or 'os' in this case any more than in the parietal, frontal, &c., which,
from being originally specific adjectives, have been properly and conveni-

ently converted into definite nouns.

   In conformity with this mode of acquiring an improved as well as briet
and precise expression of anatomical facts, I have substituted for 'pars petrosa
or ' OS petrosum' the substantive term 'petrosal' (Lat.petrosum,;Rgs.5,^5,lb).
The necessity for some such designation for an essentially and often physically
distinct bone in the vertebrate skull has been felt by both Cuvier and
Geofl'roy, when they respectively proposed the names ' rocher and ' rupeal
for the element in question. ' Petrosal' has appeared to me to be the best
EnMish equivalent of Cuvier's ' rocher' ; as containing the most character-

istic vocable of the old anthropotomical descriptive phrase ' pars petrosa
ossis temporis,' &c. ' Rupeal' unfortunately has no determinate meaning : it
is applied by its author with certain prefixes to several distinct bones, which

 already had their proper names. ' Sclerotal' (sclerofale, Lat., figs. 5, 22, 23, 17)
 for ' ossicula sen laminse osseae membranse scleroticse,' is proposed on the same
 grounds as exoccipital, postfrontal, &c., viz. the substitution of a name for a
 phrase. The sclerotals have not been usually included amongst the bones ot
 the head, though they have precisely the same claims to that rank as the pe-
 trosals, or other bony capsules of the organs of special sense. Retaining the

 old anthropotomical term ' ethmoid,' I restrict its application to the very irre-
 gular and inconstant developments of bone in the cartilage or membrane
 which is applied to the anterior outlet of the cranium proper, for the support
 or defence of the cranial part of the organ of smell. The ' ossa turbinata supe-
 riora,' and the ' cellulae sethmoideae' are parts of the capsule of that sense, ex-

 tensively developed in the mammalia, to which the term ethmoid may properly
  apply ; but they must always be distinguished from the modified though con-
  stant neurapophyses of the nasal vertebra, called ' prefrontals,' with which the
 above developments of the olfactory capsule usually coalesce in birds and mam-

mals. 'Turbinal' (<Mr6ma/e,Lat.,figs.5, 25,19), like petrosal, is a substitute for

the phrase 'os turbinatum inferius,' and its synonym 'os spongiosum inferius.

    ' Palatine' {palatinum, Lat., ib. 20) is another of the few fortunate instances

of the general recognition of the homologous bone throughout the vertebrate
kingdom, with the further advantage of a steady retention of a good old name.

' Maxillary' (maxilla, Lat., ib. 21) is a similar instance ; but Geofl'roy, as

usual, makes himself singular by adding an uncalled-for synonym. If

Soemmerring's term 'mandibula' for the lower jaw were universally adopted
and constantly understood to signify the totality of that part of the tympano-
mandibular arch throughout the vertebrate series, it would be unnecessary

to encumber ' maxilla' 'with the distinctive epithet 'superior,' which, indeed,

expresses a character peculiar only to  Man and a few  mammalia                                          in the ver-
                                                                                                      :

tebrate series the ' maxilla' is more commonly anterior than superior to the

' mandibula.'
    I have adopted the term ' premaxillary ' (premaxillare, Lat. ib. 22), as used

by M. de Blainville and some other distinguished continental osteologists, in

preference to ' intermaxillary ;' because that term has already been applied
(by Schneider) to another bone of the skull (the tympanic in birds), of which
it is more accurately descriptive, than it is of a bone which is^ more com-

monly before than between the maxillary bones. ' Entopterygoid' {entoptery-
goideum, Lat.) claims preference to the phrases 'pterygoide interne' of Cuvier
and Agassiz, on the same logical grounds as have already been urged in favour

of ' exoccipital,' ' prefrontal,' &c. But I have also another reason for pro-

posing a definite term for the bone 23, fig. 5, which I regard as a peculiarly
182 REPORT-- 1846.

ichthyic development. Cuvier has applied the term * pterygo'ide interne*
to another part of the diverging appendage of the palato-maxillary arch,
which part, 1 concur with Dr. Kostlin in regarding as homologically distinct
from the ' entopterygoid' of fishes. For the part in question, viz. the ' os
transverse' of Cuvier in the skull of fishes (24, fig. 5), and its homologue in
reptiles, which he calls ' pterygoidien interne' (24, fig. 22), I retain the terra
'pterygoid' { pterygoideum, Lat.), meaning pterygoid proper: and to the
bone which Cuvier calls 'transverse' in reptiles (24', fig. 22), I apply the
term 'ectopterygoid' {ectopterygoideum, Lat.); but this, as the table demon-
strates, does not signify Cuvier's 'os transverse' in the skull of fishes. En-
topterygoid, pterygoid and ectopterygoid, have, therefore, both the advantages
of substantive terms, and of being applied steadily each to a distinct bony
element. The ' herisseal' of Geofi'roy, like the ' pterygoTde interne' of Cuvier,
means one thing in a fish and another in a crocodile ; GeofFroy has also en-
cumbered the latter bone with a third synonym. ' Malar' {malare or os mala,
Lat.) is preferable to 'jugal,' because Cuvier applies that name to one bone
in a fish, to another in a mammal, and to two essentially distinct though
coalesced bones in a bird. Malar is also the name most commonly applied
by English anthropotomists to the bone, to the true homologue of which I
would restrict its application throughout the vertebrate series.

   With regard to the 'squamosal' (s5'?<a??io5M?M, Lat. pars squamosa, &c., figs.
22--25,2?), it may be asked M'hy the term ' temporal' might not have been re-
tained for this bone. I reply, because that term has long been, and is now uni-
versally, understood in human anatomy to signify a peculiarly anthropotomical
coalesced congeries of bones which includes the 'squamosal' together with the
' petrosal,' the 'tympanic,' the ' mastoid,' and the ' stylohyal.' It seems prefer-
able, therefore, to restrict the signification of the term ' temporal' to the whole
(in Man) of which the ' squamosal' is a part. To this part Cuvier has unfor-
tunately applied the term 'temporal' in one class and 'jugal' in another : and
he has also transferred the term ' temporal' to a third equally distinct bone in
fishes; whilst to increase the confusion, M. Agassiz has shifted the name to a
fourth different bone in the skull of fishes. Whatever, therefore, may be the
value assigned to the arguments which will be presently set forth, as to the spe-
cial homologies of the ' pars squamosa ossis temporis,' 1 have felt compelled to
express the conclusion by a definite term, and, in the present instance, have
selected that which recalls best the accepted anthropotomical designation of the
part, although 'squamosal' must be understood and applied in an arbitrary
sense, and not as descriptive of a scale-like form, which, in reference to the bone
so called, is rather its exceptional than normal figure in the vertebrate series.

   The term ' tympanic' (tympanicum, Lat.) appears to have received the most
general acceptance as applied to that bone which the early ornithotomists have
called 'OS quadratum' and ' os intermaxillare,' (fig. 23, 2s) and which as a pro-
cess of the human temporal, sometimes called 'external auditory,' supports the
tympanic membrane (fig. 25, 2s). 'Caisse' is the French and 'pauke' the Ger-
man equivalent ; but Cuvier more commonly uses the phrase ' os tympanique.'
The chief point, in reference to that term, as applied by Cuvier, from which
I find myself compelled to dissent from the great and ever-to-be-revered
anatomist, relates to the view which he has taken of the large and long pe-
dicle which supports the mandible in fishes, and which, in that class, is sub-
divided into sometimes two, sometimes three, and commonly into four pieces.

I regard this subdivisiori of the elongated supporting pedicle as explicable
chiefly, if not solely, by reference to a final purpose, viz. to combine strength
with a certain elastic yielding and power of recovery, in the constant and

powerful movements to which it is subject in the transmission of the respi-
ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                               183

ratory currents, and in the prehension and deglutition of the food. Cuvier

himself regards in the same light the analogous subdivision of the mandibular

or lower half of the arch, and both Conybeare* and Bucklandf have well

illustrated the final purpose which the subdivision of the lower jaw of the

Crocodile into overlapping pieces, subserves. Cuvier has given distinct and

convenient names to these several pieces of the mandible, but he views them
collectively as answering to the simple mandible of the mammal and the bird.

I, in like manner, regard the subdivided pedicle supporting the mandible in

fishes as answering to the undivided pedicle supporting the mandible in ophi-

dians, lizards and birds. There is the same necessity or convenience for a

distinct name to each distinct part of the tympanic pedicle, or upper part of the

tympano-mandibular arch, as for the divisions of the mandible or lower part of

that arch. But Cuvier unfortunately persuaded himself that the subdivisions

of the tympanic pedicle in fishes represented other bones in higher vertebrates

besides the tympanic, and applied to them the names of such bones. I have

been compelled, therefore, in dissenting from this view to propose new names

for the peculiar ichthyic subdivisions of the tympanic, and in doing so I have

been careful to retain the dominant term, and to distinguish the parts by

prefixes indicative of their relative position. Time and the judgement of

succeeding homologists will determine the accuracy or otherwise of thi.s

view; and, should it be ultimately adopted, I feel great confidence that the

terms 'epitympanic' (epitympanicum, Lat., fig. 5, 28a), mesotympanic {ineso-

tympanicum, 286), pretympanic (^pretympanicum, asc) and hypotympauic

{hypotympaniciim, 2sd), will be preferred to the names proposed by Geoffroy

St. Hilaire for the same parts. With regard to the subdivisions of the man-

dible in cold-blooded vertebrates, I adopt most of those proposed by Cuvier.

As, however, ' operculaire ' had been applied by the great anatomist to a

distinct bone in fishes, it was necessary, in order to avoid its use in a double

sense, to substitute a distinct name for the part of the jaw in question, and as

it is always applied, like a surgeon's splint or plaster to the inner side of most

of the other pieces, that of ' splenial' (splenium, Lat., figs. 22,23, 31) suggested

itself to me as the most appropriate name. For an obvious reason I have

restored the term ' coronoid' (coronoideicm, 31') in place of ' complementary,'

for the piece into which the crotaphite muscle is always more or less inserted

in the mandible of reptiles. There is no ground for disturbing the appropriate

names given by Cuvier to the parts of the diverging appendage of the tym-

pano-mandibular arch in fishes; and the same principle which he has adopted

in distinguishing the different opercular bones (fig. 5, 34--37), has guided me

in naming the different parts of the bony pedicle which supports them.

I have gladly adopted as many of the well-devised terms which Geoff"roy

proposed for the elements of the hyoid arch, as his unsteadiness in their ap-

plication would permit to be retained. They are obviously preferable to the

descriptive phrases by which Cuvier designates the homologous parts.

The substantive terms applied to the corresponding divisions of the bran-

chial arches have been modelled on those of the hyoid system ; but I have

deviated in one instance from the rule which has governed throughout my

nomenclature of the bones, in proposing a second name for a modified homo-

logue in the air-bi-eathing animals, of a part of the branchial apparatus in

fishes, viz. that part which is retained even in the human hyoid, and which
is known in anthropotomy as the ' os laterale linguale,' or ' cornu majus ossis
hyoidei ;' for this part I have proposed the name 'thyrohyal,' for the reasons

assigned in the note (2) to Table I.

   The names assigned to the bones of the scapular arch (figs. 5, 22, 23, 24-, 25,

23, 50-52) and its appendages (ib. as-ss) agree so closely with those which
they have always borne as to require no explanation here. The chief
surprise of the anthropotomist will be occasioned by their being included
amongst the bones of the head. That the upper or pectoral extremity
and its supporting arch form actually integrant parts of the occipital seg-
ment of the skull, will be proved in the memoir on the general homologies
of the bones of the head. I may, here, however, in reference to the terms
' ulna' and ' radius,' request the anatomist to compare the skeletons of the
perch or cod with that of the porpoise. The pectoral extremity is in the

form of a fin, and in both fish and marine mammal it is applied, in a state of

rest, prone to the side of the trunk ; in this position it will be seen in the
Delphinus, that the radius is downward, and the ulna with its projecting
olecranon upwards. I take this as the guide to the homology of the two bones
that support the carpal series of the pectoral fin in fishes. Cuvier, however,

gives the name of 'cubital,' perhaps on account of its angular olecranoid
prolongation, to the lower bone, and 'radial' to the upper bone: and in
these determinations he is followed by M. Agassiz. Both bones coalesce
with the supporting arch in the lophius and some other fishes ; and since, in
the lophius, two of the carpal bones are unusually elongated, Geoffroy mistook
these for homologues of the radius and ulna. The condition of the pelvic
member or ventral fin is, in fact, here repeated in the pectoral ; there being
no homologous segment of thigh or leg interposed in any ventrals between
the supporting (pelvic) arch and the fin-rays representing the tarso-me-
tatarse and phalanges. The earlier stages in the development of all loco-

motive extremities are permanently retained or represented in the paired fins
of fishes. First the essential part of the member, the hand or foot, appears :

then the fore-arm or leg ; both much shortened, flattened and expanded, as
in all fins and all embryonic rudiments of limbs : finally comes the humeral
and femoral segments ; but this stage I have not found attained in any fish.
It is with considerable doubt that I place, qualified by a note of interroga-
tion, Cuvier's " troisieme os qui porte la nagoire pectorale" as the homologue

or rudimental representative of a ' humerus.' Normally, I believe this proxi-

mal member of the radiated appendage of the scapular arch not to be di-
stinctly eliminated from that arch in the class of fishes. The Siluroids are

examples of a similar confluence of the first segment (preoperculum) of the
diverging appendage of the tympanic arch with that arch. With regard to
the lower, distal or apical element of the scapulo-coracoid arch, always the
largest bone of the arch in fishes, Cuvier's idea that it is the ' humerus,' far
less accords with the law of the development, the connections, and the essen-
tial nature of that bone, than the more prevalent view, that it represents the
clavicle: a view entertained by Spix, Meckel, and Agassiz, by Wagner,

who calls it ' vordere Schliisselbein,' and by Geoffroy, who calls it ' furculaire.'

I have, however, been induced to regard the lower element of the scapular
arch, in fishes (fig. 5, 52), as homologous with that bone, the ' coracoid,' which
progressively acquires a more constant and larger development in descending

fiom mammals to fishes, and which is manifestly a more essential part of the
arch than the clavicle, since it is more constant in its existence, and always
more completely developed in birds and reptiles ; and especially since it con-
tributes more or less of the surface of attachment for the radiated appendage,
which the clavicle never does. With reference, also, to the Cuvierian deter-

mination of the haemapophysial portion of the occipital inverted arch in fishes,
this is unquestionably as essential an element of the arch as is the ' coracoide'
in other vertebrates ; and it is the most important part in the piscine class, in

no member of which does it present the slightest approach to the character of

a diverging appendage, such as the humerus essentially is, whenever it lias an
independent existence. I3y some ichthyotomists, the Ijone which I call cora-
coid (52) has received the special name of ' ccenosteon.'

    Cuvier's usual judgement and acumen seem to have been in abeyance,
when, having determined the rays of the pectoral fin to represent the bones
of the hand, and the two bones which support them in fishes to be those of
the fore-arm, he concluded that, therefore, the great bone which completed
the scapidar arch "repondra done necessairement a I'humerus." Hist, des
Poissons, ^to. i. p. 274. The great anatomist assigns no other reason : but
the arch supporting the ventral fin does not necessarily answer to the tibia
or the femur, because neither of these segments are interposed between the

--arch and its appendage the modified foot*. The scapula of many reptiles,

especially of the batrachia, is manifestly, he proceeds to state, composed of
two bones. But in those reptiles the arch is completed below by a third
bone, which neither Cuvier nor any other anatomist has called ' humerus.'

Now Cuvier's 'humerale' in fishes precisely ans\\ers to that third bone in

reptiles which he rightly calls the 'coracoid' in that class.
   The coracoid of fishes being thus determined, it necessarily follows that

that inconstant bone, or pair of bones (ss) posterior to it on each side, cannot
be, as Cuvier, Geoftroy, Meckel and Agassiz have supposed, the representa-
tive of the ' OS coracoidien' of the reptile and bird. It holds, indeed, as they
have said, the same relative position to the bone 52, here called coracoid,
which the coracoid in the lizard and bird holds to the clavicle in those ani-
mals. But is no account to be taken of the remarkably though normally ad-
vanced position of the scapulo-coracoid arch in fishes? Granting, as I shall
give evidence to prove in treating of the general homologies of the bones,
that the bone (ss) called by Cuvier 'coracoidien' in fishes appertains to a
vertebral segment posterior to the occipital one, yet in the extraordinary back-
ward displacement which the true scapulo-coracoid arch undergoes in the

air-breathing vertebrates, may not its relative position to that arch become
reversed, and the part which is behind in fishes become before in birds ? I
entertain no unmeet confidence in the correctness of my view of the special
homology of Cuvier's ' os coracoidien' in fishes with the furculum or ' clavicle'
of air-breathing vertebrates: the argument against such a view, from its pos-
terior position in fishes, has not, however, the same weight with me as it ap-
pears to have had with Cuvier and his followers : and, leaving this as one of

the undecided points in special homology, with the proposition of the pro-
visional name of ' epicoracoid ' (epicoracoidettm, Lat.) for the bone in ques-
tion, I proceed to consider other mooted points of special homology, of which
there are better and surer grounds for the determination.

   The first discrepancy, demanding special consideration, which meets the
eye in the Table I. is that which relates to the determination of no. e. The
German authorities regard what I believe to be the homologue of the human
' ala major sphenoidalis' in the cold-blooded Vertebrata, to be the homologue
of the ' pars petrosa ossis temporis.' Cuvier recognises the 'grande aile du

sphenoide' in mammals, birds and fishes, but regards my 'alisphenoid' in

reptiles as the ' rocher ' or ' pars petrosa.' GeofTroy concurs with Cuvier and

the German anatomists so far as to view my 'alisphenoid' in the Crocodile

as a dismemberment of the petrosal, calling it ' pr^rupeal ;' but he recognises,
like Agassiz and Cuvier, the true alisphenoid in fishes, and with them differs
in that respect from the German homologists. It does not appear that the
alisphenoid has been mistaken for any other bone than the petrosal, and the

question to he determined, therefore, is, what are the essential characters re-
spectively of the 'alisphenoid' and the 'petrosal' in the vertebrate series?

  --Those of the alispherioid appear to me to be the following : 1st, its con-

nection below with the basisphenoid and behind with the petrosal, where it
forms the forepart of the ' otocrane' or cavity for the reception of that osseous
or cartilaginous immediate capsule of the labyrinth or internal organ of hear-
ing: the alisphenoid is also commonly, but not constantly, joined before
with the orbitosphenoid, and above with the parietal : it has other less con-
stant connections with the squamosal, the exoccipital, the supraoccipital and
the basioccipital : 2ndly, with regard to its essential functions, the alisphenoid
protects more or less of the side of the mesencephalon, or (in mammals) of
the middle lobe of the hemisphere : it gives exit, by notches or foramina, to
the third, and usually, also, to the second divisions of the trigeminal or fifth
pair of nerves.

   The essential character of the petrosal is to envelope immediately the
whole of the vascular and nervous tunics of the labyrinth or internal organs
of hearing, either in a membranous, a cartilaginous or an osseous state
its histological condition being much less constant than that of the alisphe-

noid.

   On viewing the alisphenoid on the interior surface of the human skull

(fig. 6, e), it seems to be ihe least significant and important part of the lateral

walls of the cranial cavity : it forms their smallest portion : it is much sur-
passed in extent by the squamosal (ib. 27) and the supra-occipital (ib. 3),
and still more so by the enormously expanded parietal (7) and frontal (u).
Nevertheless we find it connected, anchylosed indeed, below to the basisphe-
noid (5), bounding anteriorly the space into which the petrosal (le) is
wedged ; connected in front with the orbito-sphenoid (10), and usually
articulating by its superior apex with the parietal : I purposely omit the
mention of other connections of the alisphenoid in Man which are less
constant in the vertebrate series. But it is important to observe, notwith-

standing the displacement which the alisphenoid has undergone through the
intercalation of the extraordinarily developed squamosal into the lateral walls

of the cranium, that it is still perforated by the third (ib. tr) and second

divisions of the fifth or trigeminal nerve.

   In tracing the alisphenoid downwards through themammalian series, wecan-
not but be impressed with the conviction of its true character and importance
as an essential part of the cranium, from its constancy in the formation of its

--walls, and by observing that, whilst the share which the squamosal takes in them

progressively decreases, until in the sheep, for example, it is quite excluded

                                                                  Fig. 7.

Veitical longitudinal sectioa of the cranium of a sheep (Obi's Aries).

--from the cranial cavity, that of the alisphenoid (fig. 7, e) increases as the

cavity itself diminishes in size ; and, further, that this increase is not accom-

panied with any material change in the relative size of the alisphenoid to the

basisphenoid. The share which the alisphenoid takes in forming the ante-

rior boundary of the otocrane increases; as does also the extent of its supe-

rior connections, especially of that with the parietal (7). It is important,

in tracing these modifications, to note, also, the change in the relative position

of the foramen ovale in the mammalian series. In Man the foramen ovale

(fig. 6, tr) is close to the hinder border of the alisphenoid ; and in some

quadrumanes the third division of the fifth escapes through a notch in the

same border. This position of the foramen ovale relates to the alisphenoid

being pushed forward by the intrusion not only of a large ossified petrosal

(le), but of a still larger squamosal (27). In the sheep, however, the fora-

men ovale is no longer at the posterior margin ; but, the alisphenoid, having
retrograded by the recession of the squamosal towards its more normal ex-

terior position in the vertebrate series, the third division of the trigeminal

now perforates its middle part (fig. 7, tr). It may be observed that, con-

comitantly with this retrogradation of the alisphenoid, the orbito-sphenoid

Man{ib. lo) acquires larger propoi'tional dimensions than in            (fig. 6, 10).

In the bird the alisphenoid (fig. 8, e) is recognizable by the repetition of

the connections which it presented in the sheep; the squamosal being quite

excluded from the cranial parietes, and, indeed, never again presenting itself
in the capacity of a cranial bone in any of the oviparous vertebrates. The

alisphenoid (fig. 23, 0) is in contact posteriorly with the petrosal (ih. le),

which soon becomes anchylosed with it, as well as with the exoccipital (2),

mastoid (s), and other bones forming the cavity for its reception, in all birds.

The alisphenoid further manifests its true homology in the bird by its other

constant character of transmitting the third and also the second or maxillary

division of the trigeminal nerve ; which divisions, in the young ostrich, I

found distinctly perforating the middle of its lower border (fig. 8, 6, tr). The

alisphenoid is deeply impressed by the chief ganglions of the mesencephalon,
viz. the optic lobes. The prosencephalon or hemispheres are still defended
principally by expanded parietals (ib.r) and frontals (ib. ii)*.

   In the crocodile these spinal elements of the cranium are much restricted

in their development, and a larger proportion of the hemispheres is defended
by the orbitosphenoid (fig. 9, lo), which here surpasses the alisphenoid (ib. e)
in size. This, however, still performs its essential and characteristic func-

                                                                  Fig. 9.

petrosal (le), and the retention by a great proportion of this capsule of the

acoustic labyrinth of its primitive cartilaginous state, it occupies a smaller

interval between the alisphenoid (e) and exoccipital (2). It no longer pro-

trudes as a large bony wedge (as in figs. 6 and 7, lo) into the cranial cavity,

but permits the alisphenoid to come into connection with the exoccipital.

The result of this further retrogradation of the alisphenoid, in regard to the
relative position of the outlet of the third division of the fifth, is analogous
Weto that which occurs in the sheep.  saw in that mammal, through the

recession of the squamosal, the foramen ovale advanced from the posterior to

the middle part of the alisphenoid ; in the crocodile, through the further re-

moval from the cranial cavity of the interposed petrosal, the foramen ovale is

advanced to the anterior border of the alisphenoid ; which border, in fact, it

notches, the nerve escaping by a common foramen or ' trou du conjugaison'

between the alisphenoid and the orbitosphenoid, the hole, however, being

principally formed by the alisphenoid (fig. 9, tr). This position of the ' fora-

men ovale' loses all its value as an argument in favour of the petrosal cha-
racter of no. 6, by analogy with the position of the foramen ovale in man
or the ape, when we take into consideration the necessary consequences of
the successive withdrawal of the squamosal and true petrosal from the inner
surface of the cranium in descending to the reptiles. The orbitosphenoid

(fi-^. 9, 10), notwithstanding its great relative size, retains all its essential cha-
racters: it is perforated or notched for the exit of the optic nerves (op) and

first division of the fifth pair (5); it rests upon the presphenoid (9) Uelow,
and likewise, through its backward development, partly upon the basisphe-
noid, and it articulates with the frontal (n) above, and also through the

same backward extension with the parietal (7) ; it constitutes the anterior

border of the lateral bony parietes of the cranium, which are interrupted
by the orbits, and separated by their interposition in saurians and fishes
from the rhinencephalic part of the cranial cavity (at i4, fig. 9). The cha-

racters, in fact, of the orbitosphenoid are so clearly manifested 111 the cro-
codile, that Cuvier, having been led by the increased share, as compared

with mammals, which the crocodile's alisphenoid (fig. 9, e) takes in the form-

ation of the otocrane, to regard it as the petrosal, and yet perceiving the

essential characters of the orbitosphenoid in the bone (ib. 10) anterior to it,

was driven to the conclusion that that bone represented both orbitosphe-
noid ('aile orbitaire du spheno'ide') and alisphenoid (aile temporaie du sphe-

noide). The cold-blooded crocodile, however, is not exactly the animal in

which we should expect to find so unusual an instance of obliteration of
sutures, as that between the alisphenoid and orbitosphenoid *. The actual

and most characteristic modification of the orbitosphenoid in the crocodile's
skull, is its retrogradation together with the alisphenoid, or rather the main-

tenance of its normal connection therewith by increased antero-posterior

development, whereby it comes into communication above with the parietal

(7) and below with the basisphenoid (5); whilst the alisphenoid, in like
manner, gains a connection with the supra-occipital (3) above and the basi-

occipital (1) below ; although it still retains its more normal relations with the
parietal, and rests in great part on the basisphenoid (5), as the orbitosphe-

noid rests in great part upon the pre-sphenoid (9.) The superior connec-

   * No one better appreciated the characteristic persistence of the sutures in the crocodile
than Cuvier, when his attention was not diverted from it by a favourite hypothesis. " Le

crocodile a cela d'avantageux a I'etude de son osteologie, que ses sutures ne s'effacent point,
du moins n'en a-t-il disparu aucune dans nos plus vieilles tetes," is the remark with which
he commences his article on the determination of the bones of the head of that reptile
(Ossemens Fossiles, 4to. v. pt. ii. p. 69) : but at p. 76, a suture is assumed to be effaced,
which is present in most mammals and all cold-blooded vertebrates, where a wider space
does not intervene between the alisphenoid and orbitosphenoid.
--192 REPORT 184G.

tions of the orbitosphenoid and alisphenoid are always less constant than
tiieir inferior ones. By these latter characters, and still better by their nerve-
outlets and their relations to the primary divisions of the eucephalon, are
they rightly and truly determinable. The German authors who have fol-
lowed Cuvier in his views of the special homology of the alisphenoid in rep-
tiles, are more consistent than the great French anatomist in regard to the
alisphenoid of fishes. Dr. Kallmann, accepting Cuvior's characters of the pe-
trosal, taken from its internal position and lodgement of the whole or part
of the labyrinth*, naturally applies them to the alisphenoid in fishes, and
adds to the grounds for regarding that bone as the ' petrosal,' that it is in
some fishes perforated by the opercular branch of the great trigeminal nervef.
But, admitting the homology of the opercular nerve with the facial nerve of
mainmals, yet its wider homology and essential character as a motor division
of the great ti-igeminal nerve must not be lost sight of: its origin in close
contiguity with tlie great sensory portions of the trigeminal in fishes accords
better with the character of that nerve as the great spinal nerve of the brain,
than it usually presents in higher classes; and it is surely no important de-
jjarture of the alisphenoid from its normal character, that it should give exit
to both motory and sensory divisions of the great nerve with which it is so

intimately associated from man down to the fish. Indeed, the progressive
withdrawal of the bony petrosal from the interior of the skull and the con-
comitant backward extension, or retrogradation of the alisphenoid, ought to
prepare us to expect that nerves which traverse the petrosal in mammals
should perforate the alisphenoid in reptiles and fishes. And so we find

in the carp that the glosso pharyngeal even perforates the posterior border
of the alisphenoid ; but its origin close to the acoustic and facial nerves
in fishes diminishes the force of the argument which might be drawn from
tills exceptional perforation, in favour of the petrosal character of the ali-

sphenoid I concur entirely with Cuvier and M. Agassiz in their determi-
nation of the alisphenoid in fishes ; but, if the great share which that bone
in reptiles (figs. 9 and 10, e) contributes to the formation of the otocrane,
if the anterior position of the foramen ovale, and the superior connection of
the bone with the supra-occipital, are proofs (as Cuvier believed) of its ho-
mology with the petrosal in the class Beptilia, they ought also, as Kallmann
and Wagner contend, to establish the same special homology of the bone (o)
in the class Pisces. But none of these are essential characters of the petrosal.
The petrosal is a conttntum and not SLparics, or any part of the parietes of the
 cranial chamber or otocrane lodging the organ of hearing : it is the outermost
 tunic, membranous, gristly, or bony, of the labyrinth or essential part of the
acoustic organ. Kad the above-cited anatomists clearly appreciated the
 general homology of the petrosal, they could scarcely have failed to detect
its special homologies in the vertebrate series. Cuvier was evidently guided
 to the true determination of the alisphenoid in fishes, less by its own essen-
 tial characters, than by observing in certain fishes, the perch and cod for ex-

 ample, a ])artial ossification of the acoustic capsule, to which, therefore, he
 assigned the name 'rocher.' And, having thus satisfied himself of the ex-
 istence of the homologue of the ' pars petrosa,' &c., he could not but assign
 to the bone which rested below upon the basisphenoid, which protected late-
 rally the optic lobes and gave exit to the third division of the trigeminal nerve,
 the name of ' grande aile du sphenoide.' But all these characters equally
 coexist in the bone which Cuvier calls ' rocher' (petrosal) in the crocodile and

other reptilia. Ke was not aware, however, that in both gavials and cro-

 coililes a distinct ossicle, the veritable homologue of the intra-cranial p) ra-

midal-shaped petrosal oF mammals and birds, makes its appearance between
the alisphenoid, exoccipital and basioccipital, as at id, fig. 9. Here, however,
it is necessary to offer a few observations on the sense in which I use the
term 'petrosal' as applied to that ossicle.

    The petrosal, properly so called, considered in its totality, as the immediately

investing capsule of the labyrinth or internal organ of hearing, is wholly carti-

laginous in many fishes and saurians, and in all batrachians, ophidians and
chelonians, and is contained in a cavity or orbit (otocrane) which most, or all

Aof the elements of the occipital and parietal vertebrae concur in forming.

part of the ear-capsule remains cartilaginous in the crocodile; but several
portions become ossified around the semicircular canals and rudimental
cochlea, which ossifications contract slender adhesions to the smooth oto-
cranial surfaces of the supraoccipital, exoccipital and alisphenoid ; and to
one of these portions (on the principle on which Cuvier applies the term

'rocher' in fishes) the name petrosal might more particularly be given, as it
is more distinct and moveable than the other partial ossifications of the cap-
sule, and contributes to form the ' meatus internus' towards the cranial cavity,
surrounds nearly the whole of the ' fenestra rotunda', and one-half of the ' fe-
nestra ovalis' towards the tympanic cavity. Looking upon the inner surface
of the lateral walls of the cranium (as at fig. 9), one sees at the bottom of
the T-shaped suture* uniting the otocranial laminae of the exoccipital, ali-
sphenoid, and supraoccipital bones, a fourth osseous element (le), presenting
a convex extremity towards the cranial cavity, and completing, with the exocci-
pital, the lower half of the foramen for the nervus vagus. If this little bone
be pressed upon with a needle or probe, it yields and moves, being divided
by smooth harmoniae from both the exoccipital (2) and alisphenoid (e).

    The protuberance in question, which thus projects into the cranial cavity,
is the rounded angle of the border of the inferior plate of the petrosal, which

joins the exoccipital. This lower horizontal plate of the petrosal forms the
upper wall of the ' fissura lacera posterior,* and the lower wall of the ' fenestra
cochleae': the fore-part of the horizontal plate bends upwards, twisting
and expanding into a vertical oval plate, articulated by its anterior surface to

a corresponding sutural surface of the alisphenoid. The lower margin of
this plate forms the upper boundary of the ' fenestra cochleae,' and is con-
tinued into a thin plate of bone which divides the ' fenestra cochleae' from the
' fenestra vestibuli' above. This thin plate of the petrosal joins and is usually

anchyiosed to the exoccipital : it is the only part of the true petrosal noticed

by Cuvier, who describes it as a slender filament of bone which separates
the two fenestraef. Seen edgewise, looking into the tympanic cavity, the
plate appears like a filament : and this plate forms the sole connection, wlien
any exists, between the petrosal and the exoccipital. I have always found
the sutures persistent between the petrosal and the alisphenoid. The upper
border of the 'fenestra vestibuli' is formed by a petrosal, or rather otocra-

nial, process of the alisphenoid.

    The part (fig. 9, le) entering into the formation of the lateral walls of the
brain-case, and which is here specially indicated by the name of ' petrosal,'
seems to have been overlooked : it is, however, relatively to the alisphenoid

or exoccipital, as large as is the petrosal (Cuvier's rocher) in the perch: it
has a true osseous texture, and is quite distinct from the lenticular mass of
calcareous matter in the adjacent cochlear chamber which Cuvier compares
to starch (' amidon durci ').

his 'Comparative Anatomy of the Temporal Bone' (taf. iii. fig. 49), give any
indication of this, in the determination of the homology of the alisphenoid

and petrosal, most significant and important ossicle. The proof of its normal

character will be afforded by comparisons of the description and figure of

the part here given with a section of the cranium of any true CrocodUvs,

Alligator or Gavial. In the latter, the otocranial plates of the alisphenoid,

exoccipital and supra-occipital, project considerably into the cranial cavity.

Any one of these plates might be called ' petrosal,' for such reasons as have

induced Cuvier to apply that name to the alisphenoid in the crocodile and

Weother reptiles*.  find, indeed, that Geoffroy has applied the equivalent

term, by turns, to each. But the true idea of the petrosal should include all

those gristly and bony parts of the immediately investing capsule of the la-

byrinth which occupy the otocranial excavations of the exoccipital, supraoc-

cipital and alisphenoid ; and as the ossified portions of the true petrosal, in the
crocodile, usually contract a bony union with the parietes of the otocrane,

all these bony portions of the immediate capsule of the labyrinth might be

called 'petrosal processes' of the bones to which they respectively adhere.

That portion which unites to the exoccipital is attached by two lamellae ; it

forms a great part of the cochlear cavity, the lower half of the posterior semi-

circular canal and the hinder half of the external or upper semicircular canals:

that plate which belongs to the supra-occipital is attached to its otocranial

surface by three points, and forms the upper third part of the anterior semi-

circular canal and the crus of the posterior canal which communicates there-

with : that part which adheres to the alisphenoid forms the anterior crus of the

anterior (in Man superior) semicircular canal and the anterior beginningof the
external canal. The proper and usually distinct bony portion of the petrosal

(fig. 9, le), which articulates with both alisphenoid and exoccipital, forms

part of the ' meatus internus,' nearly the whole of the ' fenestra cochleae,' and

half of the ' fenestra vestibuli ' : it can only be regarded a ' petrosal process'
of the exoccipital by virtue of the very limited anchylosis occasionally con-

tracted by the thin plate dividing the two ' fenestrse,' along with the true

petrosal process of the exoccipital above described.

cessory to the formation of the floor of the ear-chamber : the three principal

bones are united, as in the crocodile, by a triradiate suture. The petrosal,

which, like the squamosal, was gradually more and more withdrawn and

shut out from the cranial cavity, as we decended from mammals, now entirely

disappears from view : and it retains its primitive cartilaginous state in ser-

pents as it does in chelonians, lizards and batrachians. The essential cha-

racters of the exoccipital (2) are manifested by its relative position and con-

nections; by its affording exit for the vagal (v) and hypoglossal (/ig) nerves,

and by its protecting the sides of the epencephalon. The alisphenoid (e) is

not less clearly indicated by its constant and essential characters ; it rests below
upon the basisphenoid (5), it articulates above with the parietal (7), and
behind with the cartilaginous petrosal ; but the otocranial plate being, as in

the crocodile, unusually extended backwards, unites with the basioccipital

(1), exoccipital (2) and supraoccipital (3), in almost equal proportions, and
becomes directly perforated by the acoustic nerve (ac). Its chief foramen

(<r), however, is, as usual, that which answers to the foramen ovale in the
human alisphenoid, and which gives passage, as in fishes, to the great third

division of the fifth, and to the branch which is homologous with the

contribution by the fifth to the 'nervus lateralis' in many fishes, and at

the same time with the nerve called ' chorda tympani ' in anthropotomy.

In the frog I have given an external view of the alisphenoid (e) and the

cartilaginous petrosal (le) in their undistui'bed connections, in fig. 13, with

the surrounding bones. The alisphenoid is here perforated, as in Man, by

both a foramen ovale and foramen rotundum (tr.) : it forms posteriorly the

fore-part of the chamber for the cartilaginous petrosal, and usually coalesces

with the mastoid (s), which overarches the petrosal : the back wall of the

otocrane is contributed, as usual, by the exoccipital (2) ; the floor by the

homologue of the coalesced basisphenoid and basioccipital. Had the outer

part of the petrosal (le) been the seat of a partial ossification, a bone would

have resulted corresponding precisely with Cuvier's ' rocher ' in the cod and

perch : but the immediate capsule of the labyrinth retains the same histolo-

gical condition in the batrachia as it does in the carp and pike, and as in the

salamandroid polypterus and lepidosteus : in the latter fish, at most, the only

ossified part of the petrosal forms a small bony cup covering the posterior

extremity of the outer semicircular canal*.

The attention of the justly celebrated ichthyotomist of Neuchatel appear*

to have been too exclusively occupied with the persistent embryonic condi-

tion of the ' petrosal ' in these highly organized fishes, to gain that true and

clear idea of the essential nature of the petrosal of which its partial ossifica-

tion in the perch and cod is indicative. Adopting the opinion of Cuvier, in

preference to that of Meckel and Kallmann, touching the special homology
of the alisphenoid, M. Agassiz originally diverged into the opposite extreme

of repudiating altogether the existence of a petrosal in the class of fishes.

Thus, he says, " II devrait suffire ce me semble de voir I'organe de I'ouie

presenter des modifications graduees dans toute la serie des vertebres, pour

se convaincre que le rocher n'existe pas du tout chez les poissons, par plus

que les osselets de la cavite du tympan. S'il y avait un rocher chez les

poissons, ce devrait etre un os qui entourerait le labyrinthe et les canaux

seniicirculaires; mais nous avons vu que ces parties de I'oreille interne se

trouvent dans la cavite du crane sans enveloppe osseuse particuliere, et pro-

--196 REPORT 1846.

   M. Agassiz is perfectly accurate in his character of the petrosal, according

to its relative position, as completelj' investing the entire labyrinth (of which,
by the way, the semicircular canals are an integrant part in all vertebrates
and form almost the whole in fishes) ; but he takes a narrow view of its

histological characters. The sclerotic is not less essentially a sclerotic in the
shark, where it is cartilaginous, tlian it is in the cod, whore it is osseous; neither
is it less the eye-capsule and homotype of the petrosal in the mammal because

it retains the earliest histological condition of tiie skeleton, viz. that of a fibrous
membrane. And, in point of fact, in those fishes where the essential parts of
the internal organ of hearing appear to be protected solely by the parietes of

the bones, which, in the animals where the petrosal is ossified, or, as M. Agassiz

expresses the fact, ' exists,' surround such petrosal, the vascular and nervous
parts of the labyrinth are actually in such fishes more immediately enveloped

by the petrosal in its membranous or cartilaginous states. What is peculiar

to the petrosal in fishes is, that it is never entirely ossified ; and, furthermore,
that whenever it is partially ossified, the bony part is external and appears on
the outside of the skull instead of the inside, as in the crocodile and birds.

    In the chelonia, a larger proportion of the petrosal intervenes between the
alisphenoid and exoccipital upon the inner wall of the cranial cavity than in
the crocodile ; but it is wholly cartilaginous. In the bird, on the contrary, the
whole petrosal capsule of the organ of hearing soon ossifies and becomes
firmly anchylosed to the parts of the exoccipital, mastoid, alisphenoid and
basisphenoid that form its primitive chamber or otocrane ; owing, however,
 to the larger relative size of the ossified part of the proper capsule (petrosal
 proper) which penetrates the cranial cavity, none of the surrounding bones
which contribute accessory protection, have received the name of ' rocher,'
 or pars petrosa. It is chiefly from not recognizing or appreciating the general
 nature or homology of the ' petrosal ' that Cuvier failed to perceive its special
 homology in reptiles. Speaking of the skull of the crocodile, he says that
 the petrosal, or ' rocher,' is not less recognizable than the ' tympanic ' and
 other so-called dismemberments of the temporal by its internal position,
 by its lodging a great part of the labyrinth, and by its contributing essen-
 tially to the formation of one of the fenestrae (/. c. p. 81). But the part in
 the crocodile which I regard as homologous with Cuvier's ' rocher ' in the
 perch, is more completely internal in position than is Cuvier's so-called
 ' rocher ' in the crocodile : it contributes a greater share to the formatiou
 of the ' fenestra vestibuli,' and it forms almost the whole of the ' fenestra
 cochleae.' It is not true of the alisphenoid (Cuvier's 'rocker'^ in the cro-
 codile, that it lodges a great proportion of the labyrinth*: the otocranial
  or petrosal process of the alisphenoid lodges a part only of the anterior
 semicircular canal, and no part at all of the other semicircular canals. The
 exoccipital is that tributary of the otocrane which lodges the major part
 of the labyrinth ; it contains, for example, parts of two semicircular canals,
 and the rudimental cochlea: and, when the middle, usually distinct part

 of the petrosal is joined to it, the exoccipital may be said to form the

 Wewhole ' fenestra cochleae ' and a greater part of the ' fenestra vestibuli.'

 see, then, that the characters by which Cuvier deems his 'rocher' to be so
  easily recognizable, are more prominent in the exoccipital than in the ali-
  sphenoid : and the choice of the latter by Cuvier as the representative of
  the ' rocher,' seems chiefly to have been influenced by the more obvious and
  unmistakeable essential (neurapophysial) characters of the ' occipital lateral
  (fig. 9, 2), whilst the accessory character which this bone derives from its
  lodging and becoming confluent with part of the true petrosal, was not allowed

to prevail, as in the case of the alisphenoid, in the determination of its special

homologj'.

   The supraoccipital, by virtue of its internal position and lodgment of part
of the labyrinth, has equal claims to the name of ' rocher,' according to the
Cuvierian characters of that bone, and Geoffroy St. Hilaire did not make a

less arbitrary choice in singling out this element as 'le seul rupeal*,' than
Cuvier did in choosing the alisphenoid, or, as any other anatomist would do

in preferring any other element of a cranial vertebra in the crocodile to
represent the ossified ear-capsule of the fish or mammal, because portions of
that ossified capsule are protected by, or have coalesced with, such vertebral

elements. Had Cuvier looked beyond the special homology of the bones of

the head of the crocodile, and permitted himself to appreciate their higher and
more general relations, he could scarcely have failed to perceive the corre-
spondence of his so-called 'rocher' in batrachians, ophidians, chelonians and
saurians, to the bone which he so well recognizes as ' the great wing of the

sphenoid' in the perch and cod-fish.

  --The Mastoid. In the human embryo of the fifth month a centre of ossi-

fication is established on the outer surface of the mass of cartilage occu-

pying the interspace between the basioccipital (fig. 11, i) and exoccipital

(2) below, the tympanic (2s) and squamosal (27) in front, the supraoccipital
(3) behind, and the parietal (7) above: this mass of cartilage incloses the
membranous labyrinth, about which a light osseous crust has begun to be

formed ; and, from the centre (s) established near the outer border of the

posterior semicircular canal, ossification radiates to complete that part of the
cranial parietes, which, in the adult skull, is impressed on its inner surface by

the great venous channel called ' fossa sigmoidea,' and developes from its

outer surface the ' processus mastoi-      Fig. 11.

more significance than its brief and

transitory manifestation would lead
the anthropotomist to divine. The

loped, as a rare anomaly, on one or both sides, into a process like a second

but smaller posterior mastoid*. The more constant and essential (tharacters

of the mastoid are its contribution to the walls of the acoustic chamber,
carried to anchylosis with the petrosal in birds and mammals, and its sutural
connection in the latter with tiie exoccipital, parietal, and squamosal (the

squamo-mastoid suture becoming obliterated in many species, e. g. the hog,

fig. 2-t, 8, 27) : it is also grooved, notched or perforated by a greater or less
proportion of the lateral venous sinus, whether this is continued to the ' fora-

men jugulare,' as in man, or sends a large division to escape by the 'meatus
temporalis ' Mhich forms the large orifice between the mastoid and squamosal
above the meatus auditorius in the horse and ruminants, and which directly

perforates the mastoid in the echidna (fig. 12, tri).

    It is important to keep these essential characters steadily in view,and to avoid
giving undue importance to the apophysial character of the mastoid, which has

led to so common a transference of its name, in the great osteological works of
Cuvier and De Blainville, to a quite distinct element (paroccipital) of the

ci-anial wallsf. It is necessary, also, to be prepared for that change of the

it in the skull of a New Zealander and in that of an Irishman, preserved in the iluseum of
Anatomy in Richmond Street, Dubhn. Believing it to be the homologiie of the ' paroccipital

it must not be confounded w ith that ar.gle of the occipital which projects into the ' foramen

some systems of anthropotomy.

 connections of the mastoid, which results from the gradual withdrawal, in the

 mammalian class, of the squamosal from the proper cranial walls. With much
 inconstancy of relative size in the mastoid, of which the dugong and the walrus
 offer two extremes, we discern upon the whole a progressive increase in de-
 scending through the mammalian class: in the walrus, for example, the mastoid,

 or petromastoid, forms as large a proportion of the outer lateral walls of the
 cranium as does the squamosal ; and, in the sheep, the removal of the squamosal

--exposes the connection of the petromastoid with the alisphenoid, a return to a

relation common in the oviparous vertebrata : it is shown from the inner side
 of the cranium in the sheep, in fig. 7, le and e. The mastoid of the echidna

 (fig. 12, s) presents a most interesting and instructive combination of both the
 modification of expansion and of that of direct union with the alisphenoid (o),
 which is here effected by the mastoid plate independently of the petrosal (le).
 In fig. 12 these characters are well exposed by the removal of the squamosal
2r, and tympanic as, which retain their primitive independence throughout
life in the echidna. If now we compare the bone s and le with the carti-
laginous and osseous mass s and lo in the skull of the human embryo (fig. 11),
and allow for the change produced in the position of the alisphenoid (e) by
 the gradual withdrawal of the squamosal (27), traceable in the intervening
 forms of mammalia, the special homology of the petromastoids at the two ex-
tremes of the mammalian class will be obvious and unmistakeable. The bone
8 and 16 in the echidna, fig. 12, is connected below and behind with the basi-
occipital and exoccipital (2), behind and above with the supraoccipital (3) and
parietal (r), in front with the tympanic, the squamosal, and also, as a conse-
quence of the modified position of the latter and of its own increased deve-

lopment, with the alisphenoid (e). ╖ All the connections, save that with the

alisphenoid, are identical with those of 8 and 16 in the human embryo ; and

the supervening alisphenoidal connection in the echidna affords an additional

light to the determination of the bone in the lower vertebrata, since it is a
.consequence of the progressive advance to a lower (oviparous) type, in the
descent through the mammalian scale. In regard to the essential functions
of the petromastoid, we find the petrosal portion inclosing the membranous
labyrinth, and the mastoidal portion giving exit to the blood from the great
lateral venous sinus and supporting the tympanic*. It will be unnecessary
to dwell further on the broad and obvious characters by which the homology
of the bone s and le in the echidna is established with the equally independent
petromastoid in the sheep and walrus, and with the petromastoid portion of

the human 'temporal bone.'
    The continuators of the ' Le9ons d'Anatomie Comparee,' influenced by the

large proportional size of the petromastoid in the echidna and the share

--which it consequently takes in the formation of the cranial parietes, supposed

it to be the squamosal: "le veritable temporal, qui n'aurait pour toute
apophyse zygomatique qu'un tres petit tubercule pres de la facette glenoide,"

do we find the alisphenoid concerned in immediately protecting the semicir-

ex- and supra-occipitals. In the echidna, as in every other mammal and bird,

the alisphenoid (e) exists, exclusively exercising its essential function of trans-

mitting the third division of the fiith pair by the large vacuity (tr) and with

its normal connections modified onlj', as in the sheep and some other inferior

mammalia, through the recession of the squamosal, by joining the mastoid,

in addition to those which it unites with in man. I confess that I can perceive
no other gain to anatomy by Dr. Kostlin's new determination of s and le in

the echidna as 'hintere Abtheilung des Schlafenfliigels ' or 'hintern Schla-

fenfliigel*' (posterior alisphenoid), than an additional phrase to the synonyms

of the mastoid.

The discussion of the homologies of this bone under its modifications in

the mammalia, and especially in the monotremata, will not be deemed super-

fluous or too detailed, when it is remembered how valuable a key the cranial

organization of the implacental monotremes with their bird-like heads becomes

to the comprehension of the modifications of the cranial structure in birds

themselves. If we pass from the comparison of the echidna's skull, as re-
presented in fig. 12, to that of the ostrich (fig. 8), we shall find there a bone

(s) articulated in front to the alisphenoid (b), behind to the exoccipital (2),
below to the basi-occipital and basi-sphenoid, above to the parietal 7, and

coalescing by its inner surface with the petrosal. The sole modification of

note in regard to connective characters, as compared with the mammalian

petromastoid, is the loss of the connection with the squamosal, for which we

have been progressively prepared by the conditions of that bone in rodents, ru-

minants and monotremes. In the bird this least constant element of the cranial
walls (fig. 21,27) has undergone a further degradation, is now dismissed en-

tirely from any share in the formation of even the outer surface of the cranial

parietes, and is reduced to its mere zygomatic form and function, serving

exclusively to connect the jugal (fig. 21, 25) with the tympanic (28); which
function it performs in the echidna and in man, besides other superadded
offices arising out of its peculiarly mammalian expansion into a scale-like

lamina, or as compensatory of the reduction of the tympanic bone. Dr.

Hallmann, however, in his elaborate monograph on the temporal bone, con-

siders the bone s (fig. 8) to be the squamous or zygomatic element, and cites

--the following characters of the bone, in the young cassowary f, as establishing

its homology with the squamosal: "its junction above with the parietal, in

front with the alisphenoid and post-frontal and behind with the occipital ; also

its formation of the upper border of the meatus auditorius externus, and its

 contribution of the articular surface for the tympanic bone," which surface
 he regards as homologous with the glenoid cavity of the squamosal for the
 lower jaw in mammals.

    Cuvier, whose homology of no. s he thus adopts, describes it in the bird
 as being on the outer side of the parietal, advancing also to beneath the
 frontals, occupying the region of the temporal fossa and giving origin to the
 temporal muscle, and as forming the superior border of the tympanic cavity.
 " The temporal fossa," adds Cuvier, " is in great part excavated in the tem-
 poral bone, and is bounded behind by a special process which might be re-
 garded as the analogue of the zygomatic did it not remain far removed from
 the malar bone*." The annotators add, " that there are some species of bird
 in which, nevertheless, such zygomatic process does approach very close to

 the jugal-f-."
    First, then, with regard to the character which appears to have most

 weighed with Cuvier, from his twice citing it in the above brief definition

--of no. 8, the marks of the origin of the temporal muscle. To conclude that

 the bone impressed by the so-called ' temporal fossa' in the skull of the bird,
 is therefore the temporal bone, because such fossa impresses a bone called
 ' temporal ' in the mammal, is an example of that fallacy which logicians call
 arguing in a circle. The two propositions by no means reciprocally prove
 each other. Suppose, for example, that the bone no. s in the bird had been
 determined, bj' way of ascensive comparison from the fish (fig. 5) and cro-
 codile (fig. 16), to be the homologue of the bone no. s in those animals, which
 we will assume to have been rightly called ' mastoid ' by Cuvier, and that he
 had arrived at the determination of no. s in the bird by this surer method,
 than by the descent from placental mammals ; and supposing that, having thus
 recognized no. s as the mastoid, the fossa and muscle with which it is im-
 pressed in the bird had been called ' mastoidal ' instead of ' temporal '; then,
 ascending to the mammalian cranium, Cuvier might with equal reason have
 said that the bone 27, figs. 1 1 and 22, was the ' mastoid,' because it occupied the
 region of the mastoidal fossa and gave origin to the mastoidal muscle. The
 origins of muscles are not, however, sufficiently constant to be included amongst
 the characters of connection or function determinative of special homologies.
 The transference of the * stern o-raastoideus ' from the true mastoid process
 (Man, Carnivoraand Rodentia) to the angle of the mandible (horse), and to
 both this part and the second cervical vertebra (Ruminants), shows that the

 attachments of a muscle must be determined after the recognition of the bone,
 and not the homology of the bone by muscular attachments. With the very

 case in question the uncertainty of the character is illustrated : in the skull
 of the ostrich, for example (fig. 8), the temporal fossa is chiefly formed by the
 conjoined portions of the parietal (7) and alisphenoid(6), which intervene be-

 tween the mastoid (s) and the post-frontal, the mastoid forming not more of

 the posterior part of the fossa than the post-frontal does of the anterior part.
 Dr. Kallmann probably appreciated the unsoundness of the argument from

 the muscular impression, since he does not cite it ; he repeats, however, the
 character adduced by Cuvier, from the relation of no. s to the tympanic
 cavity, or as Hallmann expresses it, the meatus auditorius (aussern Gehor

 offnung), the value of which therefore I next proceed to consider.

     In the skull of the ostrich, with the tympanic bone and ear-drum in place,
 the upper border of the meatus, as defined by the periphery of the membrana
. tympani, is formed, not by no. s, but by the tympanic anteriorly, and by the

paroccipital process (4) posteriorly. When the tympanic bone and mem-

 brane are removed, then the descending process of no. s overarches the

upper and forepart of the tympanic cavity so exposed. So much for the

facts of the argument*.

  We may next ask, Is the formation of the upper boundary of the meatus

externus an essential character of the squamosal in mammals; or is it not

rather a secondary consequence of the expansion and application of that bone

to the side of the cranium in this particular class? If we were desirous of

obtaining a homological character by comparison of the contour of the

meatus externus or the tympanic cavity in mammals and birds, ought we

not rather to select tli lowest and most ornithoid of mammals, as best cal-

culated to throw light upon the real nature of the modifications of this part

of the skull in the respective classes? In the echidna, then, we find that

the squamosal does not form the whole of the superior border of the shallow

tympanic cavity, but that the mastoid forms the posterior half of that border,

and sends a short obtuse process downwards (at le, fig. 12), which overhangs

the cavity and gives attachment to the tympanic (2s). Behind the mastoid

Nowis the exoccipital.  in birds the antero-posterior extent of the cranium

between the exoccipital and post- frontal bones is much shortened as compared

with mammals, and this modification I interpret as the result, in a great de-

gree, of the entire removal of the squamosal from the cranial parietes. Of

the homology of no. 4 as a part of the exoccipital there has been no question,

although its development, and the share it takes in the lateral parietes of the

head, is increased, as compared with most mammals, rather than diminished.

The exoccipital constantly unites anteriorly with the mastoid in mammals,

from man down to the echidna; but the extension of the squamosal back-

wards to articulate with the exoccipital is far from being a constant character

Wein mammals.  ought on that ground therefore to conclude that the bone 8,

which articulates with the fore-part of the exoccipital in the bird, is the

' mastoid,' rather than that it is the ' squamosal.' It overhangs the tympanic

cavity by a longer or shorter process ; but being more advanced in position,

partly by the development of tlie exoccipital behind, and the non-interposition

of a squamosal between it and the alisphenoid in front, it overarches the

middle of the upper instead of the posterior part of the upper border of the

tympanic cavity in the bird ; but it is still in great part posterior to the tym-

panic pedicle, a relative position which is foreign to the squamosal. The

process of no. s resembles the mastoid process in mammalia, inasmuch as

it terminates freely in most birds ; and in those, the parrot for example, in

which it joins another process to form a zygoma or bridge over the temporal

fossa, that process answers to the post-frontal, the very bone which the mas-

toid similarly joins in the crocodile, and does not answer to the malar bone,

which the squamosal joins in both mammals and crocodiles.

The mastoid always coalesces with the petrosal, rarely with the squa-

mosal, in the mammalia ; such coalescence is therefore a more constant cha-

racter of the mastoid than of the squamosal, and the argument becomes

cumulative in favour of the mastoid or petromastoid character of no. s in the

bird. When we remove the squamosal in the sheep we bring away the man-

dible which articulates with it, but we leave the distinct and independent tym-

panic closely articulated to the petromastoid. Precisely the same thing

happens in the rodentia, in the marsupialia, and especially in the echidna,

in which the tympanic has the slightest connection with the squamosal. The

articulation of the tympanic therefore with the petromastoid is a more con-

stant character than its articulation with the squamosal ; therefore the arti-

culation of the unquestioned tympanic bone in birds with the bone no. s is a

 stronger proof of no. 8 being the petromastoid than of its being the squamosal
 and for the same reasons that the articulation of no. s with the exoccipital, and
 its coalescence with the petrosal, are more essential characters of the petro-
 mastoid than they are of the squamosal, so I regard the articular surface
furnished by no. s to the tympanic bone to be homologous with the articular
surface of the petromastoid for the tympanic in the ruminants, rodents

and other mammals, and am compelled to dissent from Dr. Kallmann's idea

of its answering to the articular surface furnished by the squamosal to the
mandible in mammals. In the ostrich a part of the articular cavity for the
tympanic is excavated in the exoccipital, and would afford as good an argu-
ment to prove that bone to be the squamosal as the one which Dr. Kallmann
has deduced from the same character in favour of the petromastoid in the
bird being the squamosal. Dr. Kallmann cites the junction of no. s (his t,
taf. i. fig. 5, op. cit.) with the post-frontal in a young cassowary as evidence
of its squamous character. I have not met with this union in the young
ostrich nor in the young emeu, in which latter bird there is a distinct post-
frontal : the anterior inferior angle of the parietal descends and meets the
alisphenoid in both these StruthionidcB, at the part where the post-frontal is
marked (a.tf") in Dr. Kallmann's figure above cited. The extremity of the
mastoid process does, however, arch over the temporal fossa to join the post-
frontal process in certain birds, as above mentioned ; but this junction, when

we ascend in our pursuit of the homologies of the elements of the composite
temporal bone of mammals, as it is safest to do, from fishes to reptiles,
and from these to birds, forms a repetition of a very characteristic feature
of the mastoid in the cold-blooded classes, and one that is quite intelligible
when we rise to the appreciation of the higher relations of both mastoid and

post-frontal as parapophyses of their respective vertebrae.

   In every mammal the squamosal is applied to the cranial parietes, and at-
tached by a peculiar suture called squamous ; the outer surface of the bone

exceeding the inner surface. In no bird is the mastoid so united to the sur-
rounding bones, but joins them by harmoniae vertical to the surface, as the
other true cranial bones are joined before they coalesce; and the outer very
little, if at all, surpasses the inner surface, to which the petrosal is confluent.

The petromastoid of the mammal resembles that of the bird in this respect.

    There is no difficulty in the ascensive survey in appreciating the special

homology of no. s in the bird (fig. 23) with no. s in the crocodile (fig. 22)
and in the fish (fig. 5) ; and Dr. Kallmann, retaining a firmer and more

consistent view of their common characters than Cuvier, enunciates clearly

this homology : but having persuaded himself that the ' mastoid ' of the bird
was its ' squamosal,' he concludes that the bone which Cuvier had called mas-
toid in the crocodile and fish must also be their squamosal. I believe Cuvier
to have rightly determined the bone (no. s) in the cold-blooded classes to be
the mastoid ; but he is not consi^tent with himself when he adopts a different
conclusion with regard to no. s in the bird. The greater development of
the bird's brain, as compared with the crocodile's, requires a greater expan-

sion of the cranial part of the mastoid, just as the still greater development
of the brain in mammals calls forth a peculiar expansion and application of

the cranial end of the squamosal, involving a transference of the mandibular
joint to that expanded end.

    Cuvier, in descending from mammals to the consideration of the homolo-

gies of no. 8 in the bird, passed too abruptly to the comparison, lacking the
instructive link furnished by the monotremes. It might have sufficed for
the present report to have demonstrated the homology of no. s in the bird,

ascensively, with Cuvier's well-determined mastoids in fishes and reptiles;

                                                                          p2

but since both Cuvier and Dr. Hallmann have elucidated their views of its
homology by characters drawn from the mammalian class, I have endeavoured,
and I trust satisfactorily, to meet their objections and to determine the true
homology of the bone by other arguments drawn from modifications of the

petiomastoid in the same class.
    Pursuing therefore the comparison descensively, I proceed in the next place

to consider the characters of the mastoid in the crocodile (figs. 19 and 22, s).
Cuvier premises his determination of the bone in that reptile by citing the

--following as its characters in the mammalia : " La partie niasto'idienne qui

recouvre le rocher en arriere de I'ecailleuse et de la caisse, mais qui se sonde
de si bonne heure a ce rocher que Ion paroient a peine a la reconnaitre

comme distincte dans les plus jeunes fetus ou elle est quelquefois double*."
The squamosal he defines as a bone " qui devient de plus en plus etrangere

au crane a mesure qu'on descend dans I'echelle des quadrupedes, en sorte
que dans les ruminans elle est plutot collee dessus qu'elle n'entre dans la
composition de ses paroisf." If we pause to apply these characters to the de-
termination of nos. 8 and it respectively in the bird, before proceeding to
the crocodile, we shall see how far they sustain the conclusions I have ar-
rived at, in opposition to the views of Cuvier and his followers, in reference
to the true homologue of the mammalian squamosal in birds. With regard
to the mastoid in the crocodile, Cuvier says, " Le mastoidien des crocodiles

proprement dits et des gavials a cela de particulier, qu'il s'avance laterale-
raent jusqu'a s'unir au frontal posterieur, et a entourer avec lui et le pari-
etal le trou de la face superieure du crane qui communiq!ie avec la fosse

temporale ; dans quelques caimans il s'unit meme a ces trois os pour couvrir

entierement cette fosse en dessus, et dans les tortues de mer, non-seulement

lis font la meme chose, le temporale et le jugal venant aussi a s'unir au mas-
toidien et au frontal posterieure, ils eouvrent la fosse temporale, meme par

dehors." J

   Doubtless the German anatomists who dissent from Cuvier's determination
of the bone s in the crocodile (fig. 22) have been influenced in some degree
by the little conformity between the character above assigned to the mastoid
in that reptile and the character Cuvier had previously assigned to the mas-
toid in mammalia. The confluence of the mastoid with the petrosal, for
example, is a modification peculiar to the warm-blooded vertebrates, whilst
the relative position of the mastoid, above and external to the petrosal and
behind the squamosal and tympanic, is a constant character in all vertebrates;
to which nmst be added, that in most mammals and all other vertebrates the
mastoid affords an articular surface for the tympanic bone, and developes an
outstanding (mastoid) process for the attachment of strong muscles moving

the head upon the trunk.
   With regard to the relative position of the mastoid process to the cranial

walls, its origin ascends as the expansion of the parietal diminishes with the

decreasing size of the cerebrum : in mammals, the process, when present,
extends from the lower border of the postero-lateral wall of the cranium
in birds it projects from near the middle of that wall, and nearer the upper
surface in the flat-headed Dinornis: in the crocodile it has ascended to a
level with the upper surface of the cranium, and forms the posterior angle of
that surface. The paroccipital presents a similar progressive ascent, but later

in the series traced descensively ; it does not gain the level of the mastoid

until we arrive at the class of fishes.
   The mastoid, thus determined in the crocodile, is recognized with ease

and certainty in chelonia, lacertia and ophidia. It is a distinct bone in all

these reptiles, and preserves with singular constancy its normal relative po-

sition anterior to the exoccipital, superior to and supporting the tympanic,

and anterior to the squamosal when this is present. In lizards the mastoid

is much reduced in size : in serpents it attains a considerable length. In the

python and most serpents it forms no part of the proper wall of the cranium,

but overlaps the contiguous parts of the parietal, alisphenoid, supra-occipital,

and exoccipital, projecting backwards beyond the latter. It is large in the

serpentiform batrachia, but presents in CcBcilia (Cuvier, Regno Animal, 1817,
&pi. 6. figs. 1 2, ^) its normal connections with the occipital (/), parietal
(e), tympanic (Ji), and also with the post-frontal, which has coalesced or is

connate with the frontal (at d, 1. c). Cuvier does not admit of this conflu-

ence in the caecilia ; and although he assigns the character ' point des fron-

taux posterieures' to the typical batrachia*, gives the name ' posterior frontal

with a note of doubt, indeed, to g, and assigns to the bone h, which suspends
the mandible, the name of "mastoidiens et caisses reunisf." There is no

actual necessity for assuming so rare a confluence to characterize the caecilia.

The mastoid exists with all its normal connections, and beautifully manifests

by its independence and large size the affinity of the caecilia to the true

ophidia. In the typical batrachia, where the cranium is remarkably cha-

racterized by instances of confluence which seem borrowed from the warm-

blooded classes, the mastoid sometimes loses its independence, and appears

as an exogenous process from the external and posterior part of the parietal,

retaining however its normal office of suspending the tympanic : but in a skull

of the Rana hoans now before me, the suture between the mastoid (fig. 13, s)

and parietal (7) is not obliterated, and it further articulates with the exocci-

pital (3) behind and the alisphenoid (e) in front. Cuvier, in his description of

the tympanic of the Rana esculentaX, says, that its upper branch articulates

with the ' rocher.' In Rana loans that branch articulates exclusively with

the truncated extremity of the broad outstanding mastoid, which mastoid

overhangs, as in all fishes, the petrosal, which is chiefly cartilaginous in the

Rana boons (ih. id). In Rana esculenta the mastoid (Duges, Recherches

sur les Batrachiens, fig. 1, 12) appears to have coalesced with the alisphenoid

&(ib. figs. 2, 6  7, 12) ;  and  the  compound bone  has  received  the  name of

'rocher' from Cuvier and that of ' rupeo-ptereal ' from Duges. The fora-

men ovale however marks the alisphenoidal part (a distinct bone in my Rana

boans), and the suspension of the tympanic marks the mastoid, which, with

its other connections, overhangs also in Rana viridis that mass of cartilage з
which immediately invests the membranous labyrinth and forms the ' fenestra

ovalis' against which the plate of the columelliform stapes is applied.

Prof. J. MuUer has well recognized the homologue of this sense capsule in

the CcBcilia hypocyanea, in which he describes it as " petrosum cum operculo

fenestras ovalis Ij." It is situated further back than in Rana, and appears poste-

rior to the tympanic (л) and the large suspending mastoid (Ji), to which Muller
gives the name of ' temporale.' In the singularly modified cranium of the

Tythlops the mastoid articulates above with the parietal and supraoccipital,

behind with the exoccipital, coalesces in front with the alisphenoid, as in

some batrachia, and aff'ords the usual articulation below to the tympanic.

How necessary it is to retain a clear and consistent appreciation of these evi-

dences of the homology of the mastoid is shown by the second synonym, ' os
petrosum,' which it has received from the justly-celebrated author of this
instructive memoir (pi. 20. figg. 10, 12, 13, H,/>). The actual capsule of
the membranous labyrinth is covered by the mastoid and exoccipital, and
remains wholly cartilaginous, as in other ophidia ; and as it likewise does in
Rhinophis, where its name ' petrosum ' is in like manner transferred by Prof.
MuUer to the coalesced mastoid and alisphenoid. In Cheirotes the course
of confluence proceeds to obliterate not only the suture between the mastoid
and alisphenoid, but that between the mastoid and parietal ; as also of those
between the frontal, parietal and supra-occipital; the whole cranium pre-
senting almost the extent of coalescence which characterizes the hot-blooded
bird. Only the immediate covering of the membranous labyrinth remains

cartilaginous.

    The sides of the superior surface of the cranium of bony fishes usually
extend outwards as a strong irregular ridge, from which three processes more
particularly project, which are supported by three distinct bones, suturally
united, and each impicssed with an articular glenoid cavity. And here I
cannot avoid remarking how beautifully the principle of vegetative repe-
tition* is exemplified in the lowest class of the Ve cebrata, where conse-
quently the relations of serial homology of the parapophyses in question are
unmistakeable. The posterior process or bone which sustains (in part) the
scapular arch is the paroccipital (fig. 5, 4) ; the anterior one, which sustains
in part the tympano-mandibular arch, is the post-frontal (i6. 12) ; and the
intermediate and usually most prominent bone (ib.s), which sustains in part
the epitympanic (-isa), and through that the hyoid arch, is the homologue of
the bone whose essential characters have been discussed under the name of
' mastoid.' The paroccipital having now risen to a level with the mastoid,

 this forms the second strong transverse process at each side of the cranium.

The process is developed from the outer margin of the mastoid ; the inner
side of the bone is expanded, and enters slightly into the formation of the

 walls of the cranial or rather the otocranial cavity, its inner, usually cartila-
 ginous surface lodging the fibro-cartilaginous continuation of the petrosal

 which immediately covers the external semicircular canal. It is wedged into
 the interspace of the ex- and par-occipitals, the petrosal, the alisphenoid, the
parietal and post-frontal bones. The projecting process lodges above the
 chief mucous canal of the head, and below affords attachment to the epi-
 tympanic or upper piece of the bony pedicle from which the mandibular,
 hyoid, and opercular bones are suspended : its extremity gives attachment to
 the strong tendon of the dorso-lateral muscles of the trunk.

     It might have been supposed that this contribution to the walls of the
 cranial cavity, this articulation to the occipital and tympanic bones, all of
 which are constant characters of the mastoid in mammals, and but occasional

--ones in the squamosal not to speak of the apophysial form and functions of
--the bone in question in the skull of fishes would have made the balance in-

 cline to the choice of the ' mastoid ' rather than of the ' squamosal ' elements

 of the human temporal in the judgement of every unbiassed investigator of
its homologies. The German anatomists, however, in falling with Cuvier
 into the mistake respecting the homology of the 'mastoid' (no. s) in birds,
 with the squamosal in mammals, adhere more consistently to their error and
 continue to apply the name 'squamosal' or its equivalents to the homologous
 bone in reptiles (fig. 22, s) and fishes (fig. 5, s).

  plified.
ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  207

    The high repute which M. Agassiz has so justly earned in ichthyotomy
renders the accession of his name in support of Drs. Hallmann, Reichert,
and Kostlin's determination of the bone in question, one to which those able
homologists and their followers will naturally attach great weight, and which
indeed has caused me to pause and retrace more than once, and with the
utmost pains and care, every step in the series of comparisons which have

finally brought conviction of the accuracy of the Cuvierian determination of

no. s in fishes.

   I am not aware that any anatomist has replied to the objections to the
Cuvierian view propounded by M. Agassiz. Drs. Hallmann and Kostlin,
who have published the most elaborate monographs on the temporal and

other bones of the skull since the time of Cuvier, concur entirely with the
learned Swiss naturalist. Dr. Reichert, in giving the name of ' squama tem-
poralis' to no. 8, and that of 'processus temporalis posterior' to its process,
transfers the name ' processus mastoideus' to the paroccipital (no. 4, fig. 5)*.
It becomes then necessary to consider the arguments of M. Agassiz in favour
of the homology of no. s. in fishes with the squamosal no. 27 in mammals.
In the valuable monograph on the osteology of the pike (Esox) in the 15th
'Livraison' of the ' Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles,' the author says

(p. 66), " Un OS de la tete plac6 entre le frontal posterieur, le frontal prin-

proprement dit. C'etait deja I'opinion de Spix, qui est tombe juste sur ce
point." To this I reply that, in regard to the connections of the mastoid, those

with the parietal, alisphenoid and exoccipital, are more constant than that
with the frontal, which is interrupted in mammalia by the interposition of

the expanded squamosal, peculiar to that class ; but the mastoid retains its

piscine connection with the postfrontal in many reptiles and some birds. On

the other hand, the union of the squamosal with the frontal is by no means
a constant character in mammalia : it is rarely found in the orang, still more
rarely in man, never in the cetacea and monotremes, nor in certain ruminants,
nor in the myrmecophaga, &c. The connection of the mastoid with the
frontal is more common than is the connection of the squamosal with the
exoccipital. It is a bold leap to take from the mammal to the fish in the de-

termination of a variable bone like the squamosal : nevertheless, 1 would re-
quest the unbiassed reader to glance at fig. 12, whilst he reads M. Agassiz's
precis of the character of the squamosal above cited, and see how far no. s de-
viates from it, save in regard to the frontal connection. Spix, who appears
not to have traced the beautiful gradation of the mastoid in the mammalia,
and who was unacquainted with the decisive step to its normal condition in

--the oviparous vertebrates made by the monotremes, and who was influenced,

therefore, by seeing that bone in higher mammals pushed back from any con-
 nection with the alisphenoid and postfrontal by the interposed squamosal,
 which usurps these connections and combines them with others, as with the

--parietal and tympanic, which the mastoid (no. s) presents in fishes, not un-

 reasonably concluded that no. 3 represented the squamosal in that class ; and
 it is probable that M. Agassiz, who received his anatomical rudiments at
 Munich, and was early engaged in describing the fishes collected in Brazil by
 the author of the ' Cephalogenesis,' might have derived a bias in favour of this

 view which prevented his assigning their due value to the connection of no. s
 in fishes with the paroccipital, and its contribution to the otocranial cavity.

   lu urging a reconsideration of the value and significancy of these charac-

ters, I may repeat that in mammals the mastoid constantly presents them,

whilst the squamosal very rarely has the first, and not often the second cha-

racter. It must also be remembered that the squamosal loses its connection
with the frontal and progressively decreases in the manmialian class to less than

the dimensions of the mastoid itself, as e. g. in echidna (fig. 12), whilst in this
monotreme the mastoid, s, besides its connections with the parietal and exocci-

pital, extends forwards to articulate with the alisphenoid, 6. If ossification

were restricted in mammals to no. s, fig. 11, in reference to i6, which re-
mained cartilaginous, then no. s would have the same relation to the otocrane,
or in other words, would contribute the same protection to the acoustic laby-
rinth, which no. s, fig. 5, performs in fishes; the external semicircular
canal at least would be protected in the mastoid by both : only in mammalia
the mastoid would also extend over the posterior canal. The petrosal loses
 no part of its essential character as the capsule or outer tunic of the laby-
rinth by becoming ossified, nor is it less recognisable in fishes within the
 mastoid, by remaining membranous or cartilaginous, than is the sclerotic
 capsule of the eye in its chamber or orbit ; which capsule, in like manner,

 presents all the corresponding histological modifications in one or other part
 of the vertebrate series. The mask which has concealed the true features of

 resemblance in the human mastoid to that of fishes, is simply the petrosal
 ossified and cemented to it. But the squamosal presents no such relations to
 the bony capsule of the semicircular canals in any mammal. Even the
 connection of the squamosal with the tympanic bone is, as we have seen, far
 less constant and intimate in mammals than the connection of the mastoid

 with the tympanic*.

    In the anatomical description of the existing ganoid fishes which M.

  Agassiz has unfortunately called ' Sauroidf,' the bone no. s is described as

* From the remark in p. 53, t. ii. pt. ii. ' Rechercbes sur les Poiss. Foss.,' it vrould seem

that the circumstance of the extension of the tympanic air-cells into the mastoid, in certain

mammalia, had weighed with M. Agassiz in determining its homological characters.

   t All the characters by which these highly organized fishes approximate the Reptilia are
found, not in the highest, but in the lowest order of that class, viz. in the batrachia, and herein

more especially in the salamanders. The air-bladder of Lcpidosteus resembles the lung of

the serpent in its singleness, and those of the salamander in the degree of its cellularity ;

some parts of the structure being peculiarly piscine. The bifid air-bladder of Polypterns

resembles the lungs of the salamandroid menopome and proteus, in the want of cellular

walls. The characteristic large bulbus arteriosus and its numerous rows of valves, which

distinguish the ganoids from most other osseous fishes, are retained in the menopome, but

are not present iu any siiurian. The anterior ball and posterior cup of the vertebrae of Le-
pidosteus are repeated in the salamander and pipa, but in no existing saurian. The laby-

rinthodont character of the teeth of Lcpidosteus was developed to its maximiim in the great

extinct reptiles {Salamandroides, Jager), which, by their double occipital condyle, denti-

gcrous double vomer, and biconcave vertebrae, were essentially Batrachia, not Sauria ; and

which combined characters now found in the lower salamandroid Batrachia, with the dental

ones borrowed from fishes, and but feebly manifested by the most fish -like of saurians

(Ichthyosaurus). All the so-called sauroid fishes retain the characteristic piscine articular

concavity on the basioccipital for the. atlas :  it is,  however, very shallow in  the polyptenis
                                                                                                                                                 ;

and is also extended transversely, with the lateral borders or angles so prominent, that, as

M. Agassiz well remarks, " it needs very little to change this transverse articulation with its

two lateral ridges into two distinct articular condyles," /. e. p. 71. But this would convert,

pro tanto, the polypterus into a batrachian, not into a saurian. So far as the character of a

single convex occipital condyle is valuable as a mark of affinity to the Sauria, it is present

in a fish of a different order from the ganoids, and with much fewer approximations in other

respects to the reptilian class, viz. in the Fistularia tabaccaria. There remains, therefore,

only the character of the enamelled scales which the polypterus and lcpidosteus present in

coramon with all the lower organized ganoids, and which to a certain extent resemble the

bony scutes of the crocodilia. If the deposition of calcareous matter in and upon the skin

were not essentially a retention of a very low type of skeleton ; if it were not presented by

taking part, by its large size, in the formation of both the internal and ex-
ternal surfaces of the cranial* box, which size depends essentially on the
degree of development of the frontals, parietals and occipitals : it is further
urged that the suborbitals ('apophyse jugale') are likewise attached to it; that
the preopercular(' apophyse styloide') diverges, and is directed or abuts against
it ; that, finally, the bone in question (no. 8, fig. 5) is, with the exception of the
petrosal, the sole part of the temporal bone which takes a direct part in
the formation of the cranial box. " D'apres ces considerations," M. Agassiz
proceeds, "il est impossible de prendre I'os No. 12 [no. s, in fig. 5], que

Cuvier a uomme mastdidien, pour autre chose que pour la veritable 6caille du

temporal. II prend part a la formation de la boite cerebrale, il donne inser-
tion a I'arcade zygomatique, enfin, il prete une articulation au preopercule,

que nous regardons maintenant comme le veritable representant de I'apo-

physe styloide du temporal," I. c. p. 63. Admitting, for the sake of the argu-
ment, that the preopercular is the homologue of the stylohyal, and that it arti-
culates with the so-called ' ecaille du temporal,' which is not the case in the
majority of fishes, yet this would prove more for the 'mastoid' than for the
' squamosal' character of no. s, fig. 5. The stylohyal unquestionably articu-
lates in many mammals with the mastoid or petromastoid, between which
and the tympanic it is anchylosed in man, and it rests with M. Agassiz to
demonstrate the species in which it articulates with the true squamous part

 of the temporalf.

    With regard to the connection with the suborbital chain of ossicles, which
M. Agassiz regards, with Geoffroy, as the jugal or zygomatic arch, even
 admitting such connection to be the rule and not the exception, all its
 force as an argument in favour of the squamosal character of no. s will

 depend on the ultimate decision of comparative anatomists as to the respect-
 ive claims of the upper and lower zygomata in the macaw's skull, for

 example, to a special homology with the zygomatic arch in man and other
 mammals. The orbit in the bird cited, as in other Psittacidce, is circum-
 scribed below by a bony frame continued from the lacrymal to the post-
 frontal, and thence to the bone (no. s) which I regard as the mastoid.
 Below this frame, the slender bone, considered by Cuvier as the jugal, and
 by me as the coalesced jugal (26) and squamosal (27, fig. 23), extends from
 the maxillary (21) backwards to the tympanic (23), and forms a second arch
 or zygoma. According to the Cuvierian and generally-received view of the
 homology of no. s in the bird, the bridge which it sends forward over the

 temporal fossa to join the above-described inferior boundary of the orbit,
 in the macaw, would be the zygomatic process ; and that boundary would be

 what M. Agassiz calls its homologue in fishes, viz. the jugal or ' arcade zygo-
 matique.' But what then is the parallel zygomatic arch below, connecting

 many fishes of different grades of organization, and by some, as the sturgeons and siluroids,
 e. g. under a scattered arrangement, more like that in the crocodiles than is seen in the scale
 armour of the typical ganoids, it might have some weight in proving the affinity of such

 ganoids to the highest order of reptiha ; but, viewing this character under all its relations,

 I am not disposed to regard it as establishing that affinity more directly, than it would the
 affinity of the crocodile to the mammalian genus Dasypus. It is for the reasons above assigned
 that I have been accustomed to treat, in my Lectures, of the anatomical characters of the

  group represented by the Polij]iterus and Lepidosteus, as those of a Salamandroid, rather than
  of a Sauroid family of fishes ; the characters being carried out in the direction of the batra-
  chian order by the remarkable genera Protopterus and Lepidosiren.

     * More properly ' otocranial,' in lepidosteus at least.

    t In my notes on the osteology of Mammalia, I find that the stylohyal sometimes artieu-

  lates with the petrosal, sometimes with the mastoid, exclusively, as in most mammals,
  sometimes with the tympanic, sometimes with the paroccipital process : but no instance is
  recorded of its articulation witii the squamous portion of the temporal.

the maxillarj' with the tympanic, and marked лTM' in fig. 7, taf. i. of Dr. Kall-
mann's monograph ? If Cuvier had been correct in regarding no. 8 as the
squamosal, the name 'jugal' ought to have been transferred from the lower
zygoma to the upper one connected with such squamosal in the macaw : and
with a like consistency the name '.jugal' ought to have been retained for the
suborbital chain of dermal bones in fishes, to which it had been applied by
Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and to which it has been restored by M. Agassiz. But,
in truth, there may be clearly discerned in the beautiful modification which
has been adduced from the Psittacidce, a proof of Cuvier's erroneous homo-
logy of the bone no. 8 in the class of birds, and at the same time of his
accurate homology of the same bone in that of fishes.

    Is there no significance in the fact of the bone anterior to the orbit, which
we call lacrymal in man down to the lowest reptile, being constantly per-
forated by a mucous duct ? Can we not recognize in this function and
glandular relation, as in the commonly thin scale-like character of that bone,
and its connections in front of the orbit, the repetition of the characters of
the largest, most anterior, and most constant of the suborbitals in fishes ? If
the rest of that chain be sometimes wanting, but more commonly present in
that class ; if it should present the condition occasionally of a strong conti-
nuous bony inverted arch, spanning the orbit below from prefrontal to post-
frontal, as in the right orbit of the Hippoglossus and the left orbit of Rhombus;
ought we to lose our grasp of the guiding thread of ' connections' by being
confronted with a repetition of that condition in the skulls of certain birds,
caused by a continuous ossification from the lacrymal to the post- frontal,
seeing that a diverging bony appendage of the maxillary arch, unknown in the
class of fishes, has there established a second and true ' zygoma' below the
suborbital one ? The extension of the ossification from the post-frontal crus
of the suborbital arch to the mastoid is, in truth, a beautiful repetition of an
ichthyic cranial character, not unknown however in the reptilia ; and whilst
 it adds a proof of the mastoidal character of no. 8 in the bird, it reflects
reciprocal confirmation of the accuracy of Cuvier's determination of that

bone in fishes.
     The true signification and homologies of the bones in that interesting

 class could never have been elicited from an exclusive study of it, however
 extensive, detailed or profound ; nor will the feeble rays reflected from an-
 thropotomical reminiscences lend sufficient light in their determination : they
 can be clearly discerned only by the full illumination of the beams concen-
 trated from all the grades of organic structure. M. Agassiz, descending to
 the determination of the squamosal in fishes from its characters in man, con-
 cludes that it must be the bone no. s, fig. 5, because that bone takes part in
 the formation of the inner as well as the outer walls of the cranial cavity. But
 this protective function is an exceptional one in the squamosal (fig. 6, 27);
 it is peculiar to that bone only in one class, and, as we have seen, is not con-
 stant even there ; whilst, on the other hand, the mastoid is recognizable

 from the inner surface of the cranial walls of the highest mammal (in the
 human cranium where it is impressed with the fossa sigmoidea, fig. 6, s), and
 in a still greater degree in that of the lowest mammal (^Echidna, fig. 12, s)
 whilst in almost every mammal, by its coalescence with the outer surface of

 the petrosal, it closely repeats the protective character in relation to the ex-

--ternal semicircular canal, which it presents in fishes, a function which is

 altogether foreign to the squamosal in every mammal. I have dwelt thus
 long, perhaps tediously, and it may be thought unnecessarily, on the true
 characters and homologies of the petrosal and mastoid. But their determina-
 tion is essential to, and, indeed, involves that of the squamosal and other

 dismemberments of the human temporal bone ; and we cannot climb to the

 higher generalizations of anatomical science, except by the firm steps of true
 and assured special homologies. There are more important subjects than
 homologies, no doubt ; but nothing is more important than truth, in whatever

--path we may be in pursuit of her.
     Orhitosphenoid. As evidence will be given in the section on ' General
 Homology' that both squamosal and tympanic belong to a quite distinct
 category of bones from the parts of the 'temporal' which have just been

 discussed. I shall proceed next to the neurapophyses that precede the

 alisphenoid.

    As the determination of this bone (e in all the figures) involves that of
 the orhitosphenoid (lo), which has rarely been mistaken* for any other bone
 than 6, there remains little to be added in proof of its homology after
 what has been advanced respecting the alisphenoid. The most constant
 character of the orbitosplienoid is its relation to the optic nerve, which either
 perforates or notches it, whenever the ossification of the primitive cartilage
 or membrane holding the place of the bone is sufficiently advanced, which
 is not always the case in fishes, especially those with broad and depressed
 heads, and still more rarely in lacertine saurians. The recognition of the

 orbitosphenoid is also often obscured by another cause, viz. the tendency in
 the class Reptilia, and especially in ophidians and chelonians, to an extension
 of ossification downwards into the primitive membranous or cartilaginous
 neurapophysial walls of the brain-case, directly from the parietal and frontal

 bones.
     In the fishes with ordinary-shaped, or with high and compressed heads,

 the orbitosphenoids are usually well-developed : they are, however, repre-
 sented by descending plates of the frontal in the garpike ; and they are, like the
 alisphenoids, mere processes of the basisphenoid in the polypterus, which thus

 oflTers so unexpected a repetition of the human character of the correspond-

 ing parts f. In the cod (fig. 5, lo) they are semielliptic, raised above the pre-
 sphenoid (9), suspended, as it were, between the alisphenoid (e) and the
 frontal (n), and bounding the sides of the interorbital outlet of the cranium :
 the optic nerves pierce the unossified cartilage closing that aperture, imme-
 diately beneath the bone itself. In the malacopterous fishes with higher
 and more compressed heads, the orbitosphenoids are more developed ; they are
 directly pierced or deeply grooved by the optic nerves, and are pierced also
 by the ' nervi pathetici' in the carp. The crura of the olfactory ganglions
 (rhinencephala) pass out of the interorbital aperture of the cranium by the
 upper interspace of the orbitosphenoid, into the continuation of the cranial
 cavity which grooves the under surface of the frontal, in their course between
 the orbits to the prefrontals. The orbitosphenoids protect, more or less, the
 sides of the prosencephalon ; and this function, their transmission of the optic
 nerves, their anterior position to the alisphenoids, and their articulation
 above with the frontals, establish their special homology from the-fish up to
 man.

     In certain fishes a distinct centre of ossification is set up in the median
 line of the fibrous membrane or cartilage, closing the interorbital aperture
 of the cranium, below the orbitosphenoids, and extending forwards as the in-
 terorbital septum. The bone (represented in outline in fig. 5, at 9') extends
 downwards to rest upon the presphenoid {ib. 9), and bifurcates, as it ascends,

    * Geoffroy in his memoir on the skull of birds (Ann. du Mus. x.), indicates the orbitosphe-
'iniooiid at P, fig. 2, pi. 27, as the 'rocher': and Cuvier describes it as part of his 'os en cein-

 tuurre ' in anourous batrachia.

to join and prop up the elevated orbitosphenoids in the perch and carp (not
in the cod). The relations of this ossicle are precisely those of the part
forming the conjoined bases of the orbitosphenoids in mannnals, and usually
called the ' body of the anterior sphenoid," in them ; though this is deve-
loped from two distinct centres. In the young whale I found it supported
by a direct extension of the basisphenoid forwards, which joins the back-
wardly prolonged vomer, as in fishes. The common base of the orbitosphe-
noids is peculiar, as a distinct bone, so far as I know, to fishes. It has been
called by Bojanus* the ' basis alarum minorum sphenoidei seu rostrum sphe-
noidei'; by GeofFroy ' entosphenal' ; and by Cuvier 'le sphenoide anterieure.'

M. Agassiz opposes these determinations by the following remarks, founded

--on the embryological researches of the ingenious Dr. Vogt : "In fishes

with a short and thick muzzle, the cartilaginous embryonal plate (' plaque
faciale' of Vogt), which serves as the base of support to the prosencepha-
lon and the nasal fossae, is transformed into an independent bone, " se trans-
forme integralement en os." It is then, he says, " represented by the cranial
ethmoid (le sphenoide anterieure of Cuvier), an azygous bone, ' os impair,'
short, of an almost square form, in which are pierced the canals for the
transmission of the olfactory nerves. But in the fishes with elongated
muzzles, and of which the eyes in place of preserving their primitive lateral
position at the sides of the mesencephalon are carried forwards in advance
of the cranium between that and the nasal fossae, the relations of the
'plaque faciale' are necessarily altered: part of the plate remaining in its
primitive situation is transformed into the ' cranial ethmoid,' the other part
is carried forwards, but is never transformed into a distinct bone : it re-
mains cartilaginous as the nucleus of the muzzle; or if, indeed, the ossifi-
cation of the muzzle is completed, it disappears by virtue of the progressive

encroachment of the exterior ossification. This is tiie reason why fishes
have never a true ' nasal ethmoid' (the bones called ethmoid by Cuvier are
the nasals), but only a cranial ethmoid f." Influenced by the deservedly
high authority of M. Agassiz, I adopted his homology of the bone 9' in the
' Hunterian Lectures on Vertebrata,' delivered in ISli. But since the notes of
those lectures were printed, having been charged with the formation of a new
Osteological Catalogue of the Hunterian Museum, I have carefully reconsi-
dered this question. Passing over, for the present, the assertion that the homo-

logue of the ' nasal ethmo'ide' does not exist in fishes, I would first observe,
that if the orbital aperture (or what appears to those who deem the rhinen-
cephalic crura to be olfactory nerves, the anterior aperture) of the cranium
were homologous with the aperture closed by the cribriform plate in man, then
any bony bar or place tending to close that aperture might be held to be homo-
logous with the cribriform plate or crista galli of the ethmoid : but the inter-
orbital aperture of the cranium is always bounded laterally, in fishes, by the
orbitosphenoid ; and the rhinencephala and their crura extend forwards, to a
considerable distance in most fishes, before the olfactory nerves sent oflT from
the rhinencepliala escape by those perforations in the prefrontals, which are the
true homologues of the single foramina of the olfactory nerves in the so-called
ethmoid of birds, and of the cribriform foramina in n>ammals. The inter-
orbital groove or canal in the skull of fishes, which is continued from the
presphenoidal or interorbital aperture to the prefrontal foramina, is as essen-
tially a part of the cranial cavity as is that contracted anterior olfactory
chamber of the cranium of mammals, which, in the thylacine, for example,
extends forwards, from where the orbitosphenoids sustain the frontals, ex-

panding, to where the frontals and the modified prefrontals (ethmoid) form

the actual anterior boundary wall of the cranial cavity ; the chief distinc-

tion between the condition of this boundary in the mammal and the fish,

being, that whereas it is perforated by numerous apertures in the mammal,

the olfactory nerves in the fish escape each by a single foramen or groove

in the homologous bones. As beautiful as true was that clear perception

by Bojanus of the homology of the simply perforated prefrontal of the fish,

with its sieve like homologue in the class in which the olfactorj"^ sense reaches

its maximum of development and activity, and modifies all around it. The

coalesced bases of the orbitosphenoids, forming the anterior boundary of the

bed of the optic chiasma, answer to the separate ossification called ' eth-

mo'ide cranien' by Agassiz, in fishes : it has the same relation with that con-

tracted area of the cranium answering to the interorbital aperture of the cra-

nium in fishes, which the so-called лranial ethmoid (entosphenoid) presents

in fishes ; and this same entosphenoid (fig. 5, 9') has as little relation to the

formation of the canals pierced by the olfactory nerves in fishes, as the

orbitosphenoid has in mammals. The olfactory, rhinencephalic or anterior

division of the cranial cavity in most fishes has its lateral bony walls incom-

plete, and it opens freely, in the dry skull, into the large orbital chambers

below, which are then said to have no septum : we see a similar want of de-

finition of the cranial cavity in relation to the great acoustic chambers in most
fishes. But in mammals the orbits are always excluded from the rhinence-

phalic, or olfactory compartment of the cranium*; and a like exclusion

obtains in some of the highly organized ganoid fishes and in the plagiostomes.
As the prosencephalic parts of the brain progressively predominate, and the

rhinencephalic parts diminish, in the higher mammals, the compartment of

the cranium appropriated to the latter loses its individuality, and becomes

more and more blended with the general cavity. In the elaborate ' Icono-

graphy of Human Anatomy' by Jules Cloquet, for examplef , the small pe-

culiarities of the 'trou borgne' and the 'apophyse crista galli' are both in-

dicated, and very properly; but tlie rhinencephalic or olfactory division of

the cranial cavity, though defined by the suture between the orbitosphe-

noids and prefrontals and lodging the olfactory ganglia or rhinencephala,

so important an evidence of the unity of organization manifested in man's

--frame and traceable in characters, strengthening as we descend to the lowest

osseous fishes is wholly unnoticed. Thus, very minute scrutiny, con-

ducted with great acuteness of perception of individual features, qualities

highly characteristic of the anthropotomists of the school of Cloquet, being

directed from an insulated point oif view, prove inadequate to the apprecia-

sides of the membrane forming the orbital aperture, rudiments of the orbi-

a slender osseous filament on each side, slightly bent inwards and bifurcate

above, in a large Australian lizard {Cyclodus gigas). In the crocodile (figs.

9, 20, and 22, lo) the orbitosphenoids attain their maximum of development,
but retain all their typical characters: tney bound the orbital aperture of the

cranium ; are notched below, as in many fishes, by the optic nerves (op)

are perforated by the pathetic and other orbital nerves at the ' foramen spheno-

orbitale' (л) ; they protect the sides of the prosencephalon ; support above the
frontals (and by their backward development also the parietals) ; and they

rest below upon a peculiar development of the presphenoid (9), which seems

to answer to the entosphenoid in fishes.

Some salient points of resemblance between the cranial organization of fishes

and birds have elicited remarks from more than one comparative anatomist.

Not to dwell upon the more obvious correspondence arising out of the mo-

bility of the upper jaw, chiefly through its connection with the pedicle of the

lower jaw, I may indicate the overhanging position of the orbitosphenoid

(figs. 8, 23, 10), raised high above the presphenoid (9), at the back part of the

interorbital septum : we see exactly the same position of the orbitosphenoid

in many fishes. Cuvier accurately represents it in the skull of the perch*.
This beautiful trait of unity of organization is completely put out of sight by

the false homology of the orbitosphenoid in fisiies with the alisphenoid in

birds and mammals. The progressive recession of the orbitosphenoid and
alisphenoid, as we descend from mammals to fishes, transfers indeed their

characteristic nerve-notches or foramina from their posterior to their ante-

rior margins. But the notch {op, fig. 8; at the posterior margin of the orbito-
sphenoid in the bird for the escape of the optic nerve by a foramen common
to it and the nerves of the orbit, is not less significant of its true homology

than is the anterior notch in the crocodile or fish ; the osseous connections
w'ith the sphenoid below, with the frontal above, and with the alisphenoid

behind, being the same.

Prefrontals If the cranium of a cod-fish be bisected horizontally and

longitudinally, its most contracted part will be found at the upper part of
the interorbital aperture, bounded by the orbitosphenoids, which mark the
division between the prosencephalic and rhinencephalic compartments of the
cavity : the latter extends as a triangular channel or groove on the under
part of the frontal, opening below into the orbits, gradually expanding as it
advances forwards, and dividing into two canals, which diverge to the inter-

spaces left on each side of the nasal, between it and the bones (fig. 4, 14), that,
meeting behind the anterior expanded end of the nasal, bound the anterior
extremity of the true and entire cranium. The diverging canals of the rhi-

nencephalic compartment are formed by the two bones in question: the rhinen-

cephalaor olfactory ganglions are sometimes lodged at the extremities of these

canals, and they send out the olfactory nerves Ijy the apertures formed be-

tween the bones 14 and 15, which then ramify upon the vascular olfactory sacs,

supported by the bones lo, fig. 5. For the arguments by which the olfactory
ganglions in the cod are shown to be homologous with the olfactory ganglions
that rest upon the cribrii'orm plate in man, and by which the medullary cords
or crura connecting them to the rest of the brain are shown to be homologous
with the so-called ' olfactory nerves' in the human cranium, and for the ge-
neral homology of both as primary divisions and peduncles of the encephalon,
the reader is referred to Dr. Desmoulins, 'i\natomie des Systemes nerveux
des Animaux a Vertebres,' 1825, 8vo. t. i. p. 169 ; to Mr. Solly's excellent

treatise 'On the Human Brain,' 1836, p. 78; and to my 'Lectures on the
Vertebrata,' 1836, p. 184. I there adopt the expressive name applied by

MM. Vogt and Agassiz to this most anterior of the four primary divisions

of the brain of fishes, and apply to the peduncles of the ' rhinencephala,'
which are frequently of great length in fishes, the name of ' rhinencephalic
crura,' since they are serially homologous with the prosencephalic or cerebral
crura; and I call that division of the cranial cavity which specially lodges
these crura and their lobes the 'rhinencephalic' chamber or compartment.
The right appreciation of the above essential characters of the most anterior
division of the brain and the brain-case is indispensable to the accurate pur-
suit of the homologies of the bones is, 14 and 15, whose development, espe-
cially of the pair no. u, is governed by that of the rhinencephalon. In man
the all-predominating cerebrum, overarching the mesencephalon and epen-
cephalon behind, and the rhinencephalon in front, so modifies the surround-

ing cranial bones as to obliterate every part of the rhinencephalic division,

save the terminal fossa that immediately supports the so-called ' olfactory
ganglia,' which fossa seems, as it were, to be unnaturally drawn in and
blended with the great prosencephalic chamber, by reason of the enormous
outswelling development of the proper spines or roof-bones of that chamber,
the frontals. Still, even here, through the absence of any commissural band
connecting together the rhinencephala, a fibro-membranous process of the
endoskeleton extends between them, and into this septum ossification extends
from below, called the 'crista galli.' In the cod-fish the homologous parti-

tion between the rhinencephala is cartilaginous, and it extends some way back
between their crura, not being opposed by a coextended overhanging cere-
brum with great transverse commissures. In many fishes (e. g. Xiphias) the
outlet of the olfactory nerves, which notches the inner side of no. 14 in
the cod, is converted into a foramen by the extension of ossification around
the mesial surface of the nerves. Where the olfactory nerves are sent off
from the ganglions in great numbers (e. g. Raia), they perforate a mem--,
brane before reaching and ramifying upon the vascular pituitary sac. In
man, the homologous membrane, or basis of the olfactory capsules, is ossi-
fied, and called from its numerous apertures the cribriform plate. The holes
which these cribriform plates fill up are homologous with the foramina, or
grooves forming the outlets of the olfactory nerves in the bones no. 14 in fishes
(figs. 4 and 5).

   The grounds for this homology are so plain that we cannot be surprised
that they should have been early appreciated, as e. g. by the painstaking and
philosophic Bojanus in 1818*. I never could comprehend the precise mean-

-- Ming of the statement with which Cuvier opposed his view : " Bojanus, par-

tant sans doute du trou qu'il a dans plusieurs poissons pour le nerf olfactif, en
fait une lame cribleuse de I'ethmoide ; mais cette ojinion, qui n'a pas ce soutien
dans toutes les especes, est refutee d'ailleurs par les autres rapports de cet os
avec les os voisinsf ." Cuvier seems to have thought the ground of Bojanus's
opinion to be cut away by the fact that in the cod and some other fishes the

olfactory nerves groove instead of perforate the bones no. 14. But the trige-
minal still determines tiie alisphenoid, whether it perforates or notches that

neurapophysis in its escape : the relation of the alisplienoid to the division
of the 5th, including the gustatory nerve, and that of the orbitosphenoid to
the nerve of sight, are not more constant than is the relation of no. 14 to the

--nerve of smell. The differences of connection of no. 14 ' les autres rap-

--ports' -are not specified by Cuvier, and I know none that affect its essential

character.

    No. 14 is however the. most anterior of the neurapophysial or lateral
bones of the true cranium, and is in relation with the anterior terminal divi-
sion of the encephalon and with the first or anterior terminal pair of nerves.
Like all extreme or peripheral parts, it is subject, as we should be prepared
to find it, to a greater extent and variety of modifications than the more
central neurapophyses. The difference between its connections in the fish

and that of the cribriform plates and their sustaining basis in man may

therefore be expected to reach the extremes of possible homology. It will
be interesting to inquire whether there are intermediate modifications by

which the nature of that difference may be appreciated, and how many of

such links are permanently retained in the intervening species.

  We might anticipate the smallest amount of departure from the fun-

damental vertebrate type, as respects form, size and connections of the bones
in question, in that class where the principle of vegetative repetition most
prevails and the archetypal plan is least obscured by teleological adaptations.
Adopting the name modified from the phrase applied to these bones by Cu-
vier in those vertebrata in which they present their most typical characters,
we find the ' prefrontals' in all bony fishes resting below upon the vomer (figs.
4 and 5, u) and on part of the presphenoid (9), sustaining by their mesial and
upper surfaces the nasal (15) and fore-part of the frontal (11), aflTording the
whole or part of the surface of articulation for the palatine (-20) or the palato-
maxillary arch, and giving attachment exteriorly to the large suborbital or
laci-ymal bone (figs. 22 and 25, 73), when this exists. Besides their protec-
tive functions, in relation to the olfactory ganglions and nerves, they close the
cranial cavity and bound the orbits anteriorly. The most constant and cha-
racteristic connections appear to be with the vomer, nasal, palatine and frontal.
In the muraenoid fishes, where confluence begins to prevail in the cranial bones,

we find that the prefrontals coalesce with the vomer and nasal, not with the

true frontal. This fact, though not of a class materially affecting relations
of homology, is not devoid of significancy in regard to the real character of
the bone usually described as one of the ' deux demembremens du frontal*.'

A clew not to be neglected in tracing the homologies of the prefrontals is

their histological progress, although the value of such embryonic characters
has been overrated and their application sometimes abused. The substramen
of their ossification, like that of the exoccipitals, mastoids and post-frontals,
is a cartilaginous mass, a part of that which M. Duges has called ' cartilage

cranio-faciale,' and M. Vogt ' plaques protectrices laterales.' The frontals
and parietals, being ossified in supra-cranial fibrous membrane with so rapid
and transitory a cartilaginous change as to have escaped general recognition,

have been, on that account, rejected from the vertebral or endo-skeletal system
of bones by Dr. Reichert, and with as little real ground as the rejection of the

vomer and sphenoid from the same system, because they are ossified in mem-

brane extended from the under and fore-part of the sheath of an evanescent
subcranial ' chorda dorsalis,' like the homologous basal ossification beneath
the coalesced anterior abdominal vertebra of the siluroids.

   M. Duges, who has accurately figured the 'cranio-facial' cartilage of a
gadoid fish in pi. ii. of his valuable Monograph*, gives as accurate a figure
of the same cartilage in the Rana viridis (pi. i. figs. 6, 7, of the same work),

out of which has been ossified a bone which transmits the olfactory nerve to
its sense-capsule : this bone (is in the figures cited) rests below upon the di-
vided vomer and on the end of the presphenoid, sustains above the nasal and
forepart of the frontal, affords an articular surface ou its outer part for the
palatine, and only fails to repeat every characteristic connection of the pre-
frontals in fishes, because (as likewise happens in certain of that class) there
is no lachrymal bone developed in the Batrachia. The sole modification

of any consequence tending to mask the homology is this ; that whereas we
find in many fishes ossification extending into the persistent part of the cra-

niofacial cartilage connecting, whilst it separates, the prefrontals, so as to
circumscribe the canals for the transmission of the olfactory nerves, such ossi-
fication proceeds in the anourous batrachia to anchylose the prefrontals with

each other, and convert them into a single bone. This difference however

--sufficed with Cuvier to make of it a new and peculiar bone an л os en cein-

turef .' It would have been as reasonable to have given a new name to the

supraoccipital in the Lepidosteus, because it is divided in the middle line in-
stead of being single, or to the frontal in the species where it is single instead
of being divided, or to the vomer in the fro^ because it is double instead of
single, or to the exoccipitals in the same reptile, which manifest the same
mesial and annular confluence as the prefrontals. But, adds Cuvier, in refer-

ence to the single bone (fig. 13, u) resulting from this modification, " Je ne
I'ai pas trouve divise, meme dans des individus tres-jeunes qui avoient encore
un grand espace membraneux entre les os du dessus du crane." Nor did the
great anatomist ever find the rudiments of the radius and ulna distinct at any
period of development of the single bone of the Batrachia, which he never-

theless rightly describes as representing both bones of the fore-arm : nor
did he ever find a division of the single parietal in the embryo crocodile,
which he equally well recognized, nevertheless, as the homologue of the two

parietals, which in most fishes have been subject to greater modifications in

their connections and relative position than the single prefrontal presents in
the anourous batrachia. These are not the only instances where relations of
homology are by no means obscured, nor ought to be, by reason of the con-
fluence or even connation;}: of essentially distinct elements. The capsule of
the olfactory organ, partly protected by the anterior infundibular expansions
of the connate prefrontals, undergoes no partial ossification homologous with

the 'turbinal' (19, fig. 5) of fishes, but remains cartilaginous, like the scle-
rotal and petrosal.

   The prefrontals, however, are not only connate with each other in the

--frog, but coalesce with the contiguous neurapophyses the orbitosphenoids

(10, fig. 13). And this modification has led Cuvier, notwithstanding the

connection of the bone 10 with the presphenoid below, with the frontal
above, and with the prosencephalon, optic nerve (op) and orbit, to charac-
terise the batrachian skull as having " un seul sphenoide sans ailes tempo-
rales ni orbitaires ;" the true and distinct ' alisphenoid ' (e, fig. 13), with its

typical connections and nerve-perforations (tr), being described as the pe-

trosal, 'rocher*.' But the real difficulties which beset the quest of general
truths in comparative osteology ai'e such that we maj' well dispense with any
over-statements of the amount of deviation from the cranial archetype which
much -modified skulls like those of the anourous batrachia may present.
Fortunately the light which the development of such skulls throws upon
their mature characters, is aided by the persistent larval stages manifested
by the perennibranchiate species.

    In the menopome, for example, the prefrontals remain distinct, both from
each other and from the orbitosphenoidsf , their characteristic connections
and functions being the same as those of their coalesced homologues in the
frog, except that they are notched, instead of being perforated by the olfac-
tory nerve, which grooves their inner border, as in the cod and some other
fishes. Cuvier just hints at the possibility of his ' os en ceinture ' in the frog
representing " a la fois le frontal principal et I'ethmoiideJ," or as having an
equal pretence to one or the other name.

    The suture, however, which marks the limits between the frontal u and
parietal 7 is persistent in the menopome, and indeed in all batrachians but
the anourans ; and even in the very young larvae of these, Cuvier admits
(and the observations of M. Duges warrant the admission) " que Ton separe
une partie posterieure de forme ronde de I'anterieure qui est allongee" (Ibid.
p. 387). The permanently distinct frontals present a similarly elongated form
in the urodeles, and are therefore recognized by Cuvier in the salamander,
e. g. at c, pi. xxv. fig. ] , op. cit. ; in the newt, pi. xxvi. fig. 6 ; in the menopome,
fig. 4 ; in the axolotl, pi. xxvii. fig. 24 ; in the siren, ib. fig. 2 ; and in the am-
phiuma, ib. fig. 6. In all these crania the true frontals are indicated by the
same letter c ; in none of them do they close the cranial cavity or bound the
orbits anteriorly, or are perforated by the olfactory nerves, or articulate with
the vomer below, or perform any of the essential functions, or combine the cha-
racteristic connections of the prefrontals of fishes, all of which concur in the
' OS en ceinture.' But the frontals do present the chief connections and occupy

--the relative position of the anterior half of the bone (11 7, fig. 13) which

Cuvier calls the parietal in the frog. The evident tendency to coalescence of
essentially distinct bones which pervades the skeleton in the adult anourans
greatly diminishes the difficultj^, through the loss of the suture between the
parietal and frontal, of recognizing the homology of the latter bone, which,

with that exception, not only repeats the characters of the frontals in fishes,
but of those in most tailed batrachians.

    Next, then, with regard to the ethmoid, the second of the two bones to
which Cuvier restricts the choice of the homologues of the ' os en ceinture,'

no. 14. No name has been applied more vaguely or with a less definite

meaning than this same ' ethmoide.' In the sense in which Cuvier would
permit its application in the present instance, it is a bone which forms the

    * Op. cit. p. 386.
   t The menopome, which represents a gigantic tadpole of the tailless batrachia, manifests
a lieautiful conformity to the general type, and well illustrates the real nature of the apparent
deviations which take place in the course of the remarkable metamorphoses of the anourans.
At first sight the orbitosplienoids seem to be barred out from their normal connection with
the frontal by the junction of the parietal with the prefrontal in the menopome, as appears,
for example, in the figure given by Cuvier in the ' Ossemens Fossiles,' v. pt. ii. pi. xxvi. fig. 4,
where c h divides c from u. Remove, however, the -prefrontal h from the parietal c (which

may be readily done, the suture, which is not indicated in the figure cited, being persistent),
and the anterior and mesial half of the orbitosphenoid {ti) is then seen extending inwards
(mesiad), beneath the parietal and prefrontal, to join a triangular surface formed by a de-

scending process from the middle of the outer edge of the frontal.

anterior and antero-lateral walls of the cranium, defends the rhinencephala
and transmits the olfactory nerves, but is altogether distinct from and pos-
terior to the capsules of the organs on which those nerves are ramified.
In the crocodile Cuvier restricts the term ethmoid to the cartilaginous

laminae, capsules, or supports of the olfactory ramifications after the nerves

have left the cranium. In mammals the ethmoid is made to include both the
bones that close the cranium anteriorly, support the rhinencephala, give exit
to the olfactory nerves, and those which defend and sustain the enormously
developed and complex superior parts of the organ of smell*. Whilst this

confusion is permitted to vitiate osteology, it is plain that no intelligible

homological or other proposition can be predicated of the ' ethmoid.'

   When Cuvier, with. reference to the hypothetical possibility of the homo-

--logue of the frontal forming part of the bone 7 u in the frog, adverts to

the second chance of bringing the ' os en ceintnre' into the ordinary cate-
gory of cranial bones, by viewing it as the 'ethmoide,' he adds, that it would

then be "un ethmoide ossifie, ce que sera une grande singularite" (ib.
p. 388). Here it is obvious that the predominating idea of the ethmoid was
that presented to his mind by the capsules of the olfactory organ in the

crocodile^and other reptiles.'which he had so called, and which are wholly or
in great part cartilaginous. But the parts of Cuvier's ethmoid in birds and
mammals, which are in functional and physical relation with the cranial cavity,
rhinencephala and olfactory nerves, are ossified : the bone, also, to which he
gives the name * ethmoid' in fishes (fig. 5, is) is ossified ; and, what is more
to the purpose, the bones (14) in fishes, ophidians, chelonians and saurians,
which repeat the essential characters of the batrachian ' os en ceinture,' are

likewise ossified.

    General homology teaches that the bone or bones in relation to the defence
of the rhinencephala and the transmission of their nerves belong to one class,
and that the parts of the skeleton, whether membranous, gristly or bony,
which form the capsule or sustain the olfactory organ itself, belong to another
and very different class of parts of the skeleton. But, not to anticipate what
belongs more properly to a subsequent section of this report, observation

shows the two parts to be physically distinct in all vertebrates except mam-
mals, and to be distinct in the foetus of these. Whether we restrict the term
< ethmoid ' to the neurapophysis or to the sense-capsule (which in mammals

constitutes the ' conchae superiores' and cells of the ethmoid), the term must
be applied arbitrarily in its extended or homological signification, since the
neurapophysis dismisses the nerve by a single foramen or groove in all the
vertebrates below mammals. The multiplied foramina in the neurapophysial
or cranial part of the anthropotomical ' ethmoid,' whence that name, as well
as the special designation of the part called ' lamina cribrosa,' are modifica-
tions peculiar to the mammalian class, but not constant here, and they form
no essential homological character of the bone in question. It appears to

me preferable, since we have two essentially distinct parts of the skeleton
combined in the mammalian and human ethmoid, to restrict the term to the

   * Objecting to Oken's idea, that the prefrontal in the crocodile was homologous with the
part of the ethmoid called ' os planum' in anthropotomy, Cuvier says, " Or I'os planum ne

un petit point dans les galeopitheques et dans quelques chats. Dans tons les autres mam-

part which appertauis to the sense-capsule, i. e. which is directly concerned
in the support of the membrane and cells of the olfactory organ.

    But leaving for the present the question of names, and returning to things,
let us pursue our search and comparisons of the bones which continue in the
higher classes to repeat the essential characters of those called ' prefrontals
in fishes. Were it necessary to add to the reasons above assigned for regarding
no, 14, fig. 13, as the homologues of i4 in the fish; notwitlistanding they are
connate in the batrachian, I would cite the structure and relations of those
bones in the sword-fish. The whole of the anterior part of the, extensive
interorbital space is occupied by the prefrontals, which join each other at the
median line by an extensive vertical cellular surface : they form the anterior
border of the orbit, and the posterior wall of the nasal fossa; they close the
cranial cavity anteriorly, and transmit the olfactory nerve to the capsule by
a central foramen. They are almost entirely covered by the frontals above,
which they support by a broad flat surface ; a very small portion only ap-
pearing on the upper surface of the skull at the anterior angle of the orbital
ridge. Were the frontals separated, the prefrontals would then appear, as in
the frog, at the median line : were the suture between the two prefrontals
 to be obliterated in Xiphias, an ' os en ceinture' would be produced like that
of the frog. The nasal bone of the sword-fish, which Cuvier calls * ethmoide,'
 presents a cellular structure of its base, designed to break the force of the
concussion arising from the blow which is delivered by the ' sword.' But the
prefrontals manifest more extensively this peculiar cellular structure, which
Cuvier well says, "I'on prendrait presque pour les cellules de I'ethmoide d'un
 quadrupede*."

    Cuvier, not perceiving or not appreciating the grounds of the homology of
 the 'os en ceinture' with the prefrontals, describes the divided nasal (is, fig.
 13), in the batrachia as the ' frontaux anterieures' ; and reciprocally, having
 called the bones in fishes, homologous with the bone i4, (which he thought
 might represent the ethmoid in the frog) 'frontaux anterieures,' he gives the
 name ' ethmoide ' to the bone is, fig. 5, whether single or divided, in 'fishes.

It is not necessary to add anything to the arguments by which M. Agassiz

 has sustained the conclusion of Spix, that Cuvier's ' ethmoid ' in fishes is the

 ' nasal.' And it needs, I think, only to compare the connections of the

 bones is, fig. 13, wath either the single or the divided nasals in fishes, and to

--glance at the obvious homology of the bones h in Cuvier's pi. xxiv. fig. 1 6,

 with the bones g g'm figs. 4 & 6 of pi. xxvi. (' Ossemens Fossiles,' t. v. pt. 2),

 to ensure the acceptance of the conclusion, that his ' frontaux anterieures
 in the frog and the other anourans are the true nasal bones.

    In the python Cuvier transfers the name ' frontaux anterieures ' to the
 lacrymal bones. The bones in this serpent, which are in neurapophysial
 relation with the olfactory nerves, and which present other essential charac-
 ters of the prefrontals (14) in fishes, are also two in number, in the form of
 thin osseous plates, intervening on each side, anterior to the frontal, between
 the vomerine and nasal bones, bent outwards, in the form of a semicylinder
 about the olfactory nerves, which they support and guide to the cartilaginous
 capsule of the organ of smell, and having the palatine bones articulated to
 their under and outer sides. The bones, which thus present every essential
 character of the prefrontals, are those (5 s in pi. ix. figs. 1 , 2, 3, ' Regne
 Animal,' t. iii. 1830) which Cuvier there calls 'cornets inferieures.' But

  the true ' cornets ' (turbinals) are cartilaginous in serpents as in every other

 reptile, and give attachment to the palatines in no animal. The bones bb \n

the same figures, to which the name of 'anterior frontal' is given, have no

relation whatever to the protection of the rhinencephala or the exit of the

olfactory nerves, but they have a large perforation for the passage of the

muco-lacrymal duct from the eye. They repeat indeed the single and

\east essential character of the prefrontals, in standing anterior to the fron-

tals and the orbits ; but these are characters common to the great anterior

--mucous scale-bone in fishes, whose essential function the transmission of a
--mucous duct they superadd to the repetition of its connections, viz. with

the prefrontal, nasal and superior maxillary bones*.

The bones, which more resemble the anchylosed prefrontals in the frog, are

the frontals of the python ; but the resemblance is confined to one character

only, and that an exaggeration of a character common to the frontal bones of

many birds, and of the ornithorhynchus among mammals, viz. a develop-

ment of a median bony partition from the line of the frontal suture into the

median interspace of the encephalon. In the python each frontal sends

down at the fore-part of this suture such a partition, which is therefore double,

as the falx essentially is in man and the mammalia, in which it retains its

primitive histological condition of a fibrous membrane. The ossified laminae

of the falx in the python bend outwards and coalesce below with the external

or orbitosphenoidal plates of the frontal, and thus surround the lateral divi-

sions of the fore-part of the brain ; in fact, the olfactory nerves, drawn back
in the progress of the concentrative movement of the cerebral centres, so as

also to occupy the prosencephalic segment of the cranium, the prosencepha-

lon being, in like manner, protected chiefly by the mesencephalic bony arch.

The change is precisely analogous to that which takes place at the opposite

extremity of the neural axis in higher animals. In the python every segment

of the spinal chord retains its primitive relation to the segment of the endo-

skeleton, through which it transmits its pair of nerves. In the mammal the

concentrative movements of the spinal chord draw its segments in advance

of their proper vertebrae, and the primary relation is indicated by the nerves

which these vertebrae continue to transmit, and by which alone we are guided

from the segment of the endoskeleton to that of the neural axis which origi-

nally governed its development.

So, likewise, at the opposite end of the skeleton, we trace the relation of

the anterior osseous segment, which transmits the olfactory nerves to their cap-

sule, to its proper segment of the neural axis, by following those nerves back

to the retracted ganglions (rhinencephala) from which they take their origin.

The connections of the annular frontals of the python with the parietals

and post-frontals behind, with the connate orbitosphenoids, and through

them with the presphenoid below, prevent  their  homology being  mistaken
                                                                                                     ;

for they are far from completely representing or repeating the essential cha-

racters of the coalesced annular prefrontals of the frog.

Not to lengthen unnecessarily this exposition of the homologues of the pre-

frontals (i4, figs.4 and 5) in fishes, I pass at once to the highest of existing rep-
tiles, the crocodile. Here we find, in the dry skull, the condition of the cranial

perforation in a homological discussion than Cuvier, when the more obvious features of the
prefrontals of fishes were so repeated in any higher animal as to have led him to distinguish

the prefrontals in that animal from the lacrymal bone. Thus with regard to the pre-
frontals of the crocodile, Cuvier says, " Quant a M. Spix, entraine par un autre systeme et

negligent le trou lacrymal, qui cependant est bien visible, et qui, specialement dans le cro-

codile, est perce tout entier dans I'os auquel je donne ou plutot auquel je maintiens le meme

cavity in the fish beautifully and closely repeated : the prosencephalic part
opens freely by the aperture bounded by the orbitosphenoids (fig. 9, lo) into

the common orbital cavity (o?-), and the rhinencephalic division of the cranium
is prolonged, as a groove upon the under surface of the coalesced frontals

(ib. ii) above the orbits, expanding as it advances, until it is arrested by a
boundary formed by two bones (ib. 14), which rest below upon the vomer
and give attachment there to an ascending process of the palatines (20), which
sustain by their mesial and upper expanded surfaces the nasal (15) and fore-
part of the frontal (n) ; and articulate exteriorly with the large lacrymal
bone (fig. 22, 73) perforated as in the fish and serpent by a mucous duct from
the orbit. They are each grooved on their inner or mesial surface (indicated
by the numerals 14, in fig. 9) by the olfactory nerve, where it escapes from
the cranium to spread upon the membranes sustained by the cartilaginous
capsules anterior to the bones in question ; below these grooves the bones
(14) extend inwards and meet at the mesial line; but do not coalesce there
as in the frog, nor extend their mesial union upwards, so as to convert the
olfactory grooves into two complete canals. They, therefore, retain or resume

much more of their primitive piscine character than do their homologues in

the frog or serpent, and manifest it conspicuously by developing a subtrian-
gular external plate which appears on the upper surface of the cranium at
the anterior angle of the orbit between the frontal, the lacrymal and the
nasal bones. In short, the homology of the bones 14 in the crocodile (figs. 9,
21, 22) with those so numbered in the fish (figs. 4 and 5), was quite unmis-
takeable ; and, with the exception of Spix, all anatomists have concurred in
this respect with Cuvier : only some of them have extended further and
expressed differently the homologies of the bones in question.

    Now, bearing in mind the small brain of the cold-blooded crocodile, and
the concomitantly restricted development of the spine or roof-bone in special
relation with the cerebrum, viz. the frontal (11), which is aided in its se-
condary function in relation to the orbit by distinct supraorbital bones in all
crocodiles, and contrasting the condition of the part of the brain which
chiefly governs the development of the frontal bone with that of the same

--division of the brain of mammalia, let us proceed to make the comparison

which Cuvier recommends*, in order to trace the homologues of the croco-
dile's prefrontals in the mammalian class.

   We place the skull of a ruminant (the red deer, e. g.) by the side of that

of a crocodile, and delineate a suture which would detach a portion from the
frontal, having the same superficial connections as the upper peripheral plate
of the prefrontal has in the crocodile. It appears to be far from presenting
the same figure ; but most assuredly such artificially detached portion of
the ruminant's frontal has not the same functions (' emploi') as the pre-
frontal has in the crocodile. For if we even include with the part so
detached the anterior portion of the descending orbital plate of the frontal,
we find it joining below the orbitosphenoid without any connection with the
vomer, or any attachment to the palatine : it forms no immediate part of the
supporting plate of the rhinencephalon, nor of the foramina for the exit of
the olfactory nerves. Such artificially detached portions of the mammalian
frontal are entirely separated from each other ; whilst one of the important

    * " II suffit en effet de placer une tete de mammifere, de ruminant par example, a cote
d'une tete de crocodile, pour s'assurer qu'il s'est fait ici (' du frontal anterieur') un demem-
brement du frontal. On pourroit, sans rien deranger, dessiner sur le frontal du mammifere
la suture qui existe dans le crocodile, et on detacheroit ainsi dans le premier un frontal

--anterieur qui auroit la meme position, presque la meme figure, et absoluraent le meme emploi

que dans le crocodile." Ossem. Fossiles, v. pt. ii. p. 73.

points of resemblance between the prefrontals of the crocodile and those of

--the fish are the mesial approximation and junction of their descending (neu-

ropophysial or rhinencephalic) plates the most constant and important parts

of the bones in question.

   If the frontal of the ruminant or other mammal were expanded only at

the parts corresponding with the detached bones called " frontaux ante-
rieures" in the crocodile, there might then be a, prima facie probability that

such expansions were connate parts, dismembered in the crocodile's skull.
But the vastly increased lateral as well as anteroposterior development, and
the more or less vertical convex expansion of the frontal in the highest
vertebrate class, naturally indicate, in the first place, an inquiry into the
concomitant modification of the nervous centres by which the development
of that bone is mainly governed ; and if such modification should then be
found to exist, in the cerebrum, for example, which, from the ascertained
correlative progress of the frontal in other classes, ought to cause or be

associated with such a general development of that bone as characterises the
skull in the mammalian class, it must surely be superfluous and gratuitous
to explain that development by the hypothesis of a coalescence of another
essentially distinct element of the cranial parietes : especially if that element
be proved by a similar tracing of its relations to the progressive development
of the cerebral centres, to have as essential and exclusive a dependence
upon the rhinencephalon as the frontal bone has upon the prosencephalon.

   The position of the upper peripheral part of the prefrontal in the situation
in which it is seen in the crocodile, is, in fact, the least constant and import-

ant of the characters of that bone. In the bull-frog, for example, the ex-

posed part of the prefrontal is mesiad of the conjoined parts of the nasals

and frontals instead of being lateral : in the sword-fish the prefrontals barely
appear, and in the python they do not appear at all upon the upper surface

of the skull ; but they retain in each their more typical neurapophysial po-
sition, M'ith all their more constant and essential characters. The enormously

developed frontal of the mammal masks these characters, and usurps the

less constant and least important one, viz. superficial position, on which alone
Cuvier insists as proving the prefrontal of the crocodile, with its complex
functions and connections, to be such a dismemberment of the true frontals

of the ruminant, as may be marked off with the pen on the upper surface of

the skull.

   The descending [rhinencephalic] plates of the prefrontal in the crocodile
(fig. 9, 14) are subcompressed in the axis of the skull, and expanded laterally,
especially at their upper part ; where, in the alligator, I find them forming a

shallow cup, concave forwards for the lodgment of the cartilaginous olfactory

--capsule, of that part, namely, which is ossified in mammalia, and there de-

veloped into the great labyrinth of the superior turbinals and ethmoidal cells.

The vertical plates, continued forwards from the prefrontals, which extend

above to the nasal suture and descend into the vomerine groove below, to aid
in forming the ' septum narium,' are cartilaginous in the crocodile : they are

more or less ossified, and form the 'lamina perpendicularis ethmoidei' in
mammals. The median plate, dividing the olfactory nerves at their exit, and
developed backwards as a partial septum of the rhinencephalic chamber of

the cranium, and continued into the simple interorbital septum of the croco-

dile, also remains cartilaginous: when ossified in mammals, it forms the

Now' crista galli.'  not one of these cartilaginous representatives of the parts

of the compound bone called ' ethmoid' in anthropotomy, is united or con-
nected with the portions of the frontal in mammals which Cuvier has assumed

to be the homologues of the prefrontals in the crocodile ; those bones being

in that reptile, as the prefrontals are in fishes, chiefly concerned in closing
the anterior end of the cranial cavity, in giving exit to the olfactory nerves,
in suspending the palatine arch, in connecting the vomer with the nasal ver-
tically, and the nasal with the frontal and lacrymal horizontally, repeating in
the crocodile for the latter purpose the development of the upper or horizontal
plate which had almost or entirely disappeared in some of the intervening
forms of reptiles. In most chelonians this portion of the prefrontal coalesces
or is connate with the short nasal : but I have found the instructive exception
presented by the existing freshwater tortoise {Hydromedusa) of the persistent
suture between the nasals and prefrontals, repeated in two fossil chelonians
{Chelone playiiceps and Chelone pulchriceps)*

    Proceeding in the ascensive track of the homologies of the prefrontals,
I have selected from the class of birds the skull of the ostrich (figs. 8 and 23),
the representative of an aberrant order, in which every deviation from the
type of the class that has been supposed to tend towards the Mammalia, tends
equally or more towards the Repti.lia\, and in which, conformably with the
lower development of the respiratory system, the original sutures of the
cranium, or in other words, the signs of the vertebrate archetype on which it

is constructed, are longest retained. Were we to cut off the corresponding an-
terior angles of the frontals, no. n, to those supposed to represent in mammals
the bones we are in quest of, we should have even fewer of their characters

 than in the higher class alluded to, because the descending orbital plate is

less developed, and the frontal, though its general size is much augmented,
 retains more of its oviparous horizontality as an expanded spine or roof-bone

 of the cranium.
    There is a large bone (fig. 23, 73) bounding the anterior border of the orbit,

 and from which, as we have seen in the parrots, ossification sometimes extends
 backwards along the inferior contour of the orbit to the postfrontal. But this
 bone, besides its repetition of the connections of the lacrymal in the fish and
 crocodile, resting as in the latter animal upon the true malar bone, is either
 perforated or grooved by the lachrymal duct, which it defends in its course
 from the eye to the nose, and has none of the essential characteristics of the
 prefrontal. But we see on the exterior of the skull of the ostrich and other
 struthious birds J, a distinct rhomboidal plate of bone interposed between the
 frontals and nasals, precisely in the situation in which the upper surface of

 the coalesced prefrontals appears in the skull of the frog and other anourous
 batrachians. In a nearly full-grown ostrich's skull, I removed the left fron-
 tal, nasal, lacrymal and tympanic bones, and the zygomatic arch, as in fig. 8,
 and found the facet in question to be the upper and posterior expanded
 surface of a large irregularly subquadrated compressed bone (ib. 14), consist-
  ing of two vertical compact plates coalesced at their periphery, and including
 a loose cancellous texture. The upper and posterior expanded surface of the
 bone extends a short way back beneath the frontals, descends and closes the
  anterior aperture of the cranium, and sends out from each side a plate of
  bone which arches over the olfactory nerves and forms the canals by which
 they are conducted along the upper part of the orbits. The anterior and upper
  surface of the bone again expands (at 14', figs. 8 and 23), and there sustains,
  and is covered by, the nasal bones, and again overarches, and is sometimes

perforated by the olfactory nerves (the course of which along the rhinen-
cephalic continuation of the cranial cavity, is shown by the arrows, ol. 14,
figs. 8 and 23) prior to their final expansion on the olfactory organ ; the
main body of the bone forms the fore-part of the interorbital septum and
the back part of the nasal septum, a slight outstanding ridge or angle
dividing the two surfaces : it rests below upon the rostral prolongation of
the presphenoid, which, however, barely divides it from the semicylindrical
grooved vomer (13) which sheathes the under part of that process. The
posterior extremities of the palatines develope broad horizontal plates mesiad
and upwards (fig. 23, 20), which join the lower border of no. 14, where it rests
upon the presphenoid. The outer margins of the anterosuperior expansion
of no. 14 come into contact with the lacrymals : the posterior border of the
vertical or rhinencephalic plate joins and soon coalesces with the orbitosphe-
noids (10). Thus we have all the essential characters of the prefrontals in
the fish, the frog and the crocodile, with a repetition of their first important
modification in the tail-less batrachians, viz. that of median confluence ; and
it is not unimportant to observe that this is associated with the obliteration of
other cranial sutures, by which also those batrachians resemble birds. The
first step in the progress of this median approximation of the prefrontals, is

the development of the plates which, in certain fishes, convert the olfactory
grooves into foramina; these mesial plates next come into contact at the middle
line, e. g. in Xiphias and Ephippus ; they proceed to coalesce in the frog, and

the prefrontals are so much further compressed in the bird that the olfactory
grooves open upon the outer or lateral instead of the inner or mesial surfaces of

the rhinencephalic plates : they are, however, very deep grooves in the ostrich,

and in the apteryx are canals protected by a distinct external plate. The
interruption of the direct vomerine connection by the prolonged presphenoid
is the chief secondary modification of the prefrontals in the bird. No other
bone in the bird's skull repeats the more essential characters of the prefrontals
in fishes and reptiles, save the bone no. 14, figs. 8 and 23. Cuvier calls this bone
the ' ethmoide '; but blames the clear-sighted and consistent German anato-
mists who applied that name to the prefrontals in fishes and reptiles ; yet the
 part of Cuvier's ethmoid in the bird answering to the ' lamina cribrosa' of the
 mammal, sometimes gives passage to the olfactory nerve by a single foramen,
 sometimes by merely a groove, a difference which does not prevent him
 adopting the homology here, though he opposes it to the adoption, by
 Bojanus, of the homology of the same part in the fish (ante, p. 215). The
 smooth plate forming, with the orbitosphenoid, the interorbital septum, is

 the ' OS planum,' or papyraceous plate of the bird's ethmoid, with Cuvier

 the masking of this part in most mammals by the downward development
 of the orbital plates of the frontal, offered no difficulty to the ethmoidal de-
 termination of no. 14 in the bird ; and it forms as little valid objection to
 Oken's mode of expressing the ethmoidal homology of the prefrontals in the

 cold-blooded ovipara.

     For the reasons before assigned, viz. that the terms ' frontal anterieur'
 had been given to the bone in question, no. 14, in those animals in which it
 deviates least from its general type, as the nasal neurapophysis, I retain the
 name prefrontal for it under all its metamorphoses. Cuvier, after balancing

 mthe characters of the bones nos. 15, and 73 (fig. 23) in birds, inclines to the

 opinion that 15 is the true nasal, and 22' an essential part (nasal process) of
 the premaxillary : with regard to 73, he says, " les os externes et plus voisins
 de I'orbite seraient presque comrae on le voudrait, ou des frontaux ante-
  rieurs ou des lacrymaux," In which case, no. 14 having been described as
 the ' ethmoid,' one or other of the above-named bones would be wholly absent

 in birds. " Ce que pourrait faire croire que c'est le frontal anterieur qui
 manque, c'est que dans les oiseaux il n'y a point de frontal posterieur, et que
 la paroi anterieur de I'orbite, a I'endroit ou le frontal anterieure se trouve
 ordinairement, est raanifestenient formee en grande partie par une lame
 transverse de rethnioide*." But the postfrontal is not always absent in
 birds : it is present as a distinct bone, though small, in the emeu's skull,
 figured in the ' Memoir on the Dinornis' above-cited ; and it is still more
 developed in the remarkable extinct (?) genus, the immediate subject of that
 memoir. Besides, to anticipate the subject of a subsequent part of this report,
 a parapophysis always disappears from a typical segment of the skeleton
 sooner than a neurapophysis. The rest of Cuvier's difficulty in the recog-
 nition of the prefrontal in birds was more nominal than real.

    The ethmoid, in the restricted sense in which Cuvier applies the term in the
 crocodile and other animals with divided prefrontals, and in which I would
 apply it in those animals also in which the prefrontals have coalesced, is
present but remains cartilaginous in the bird. In the mammal it becomes
 bony and contracts anchyloses not only with the still more reduced debris of
the coalesced prefrontals, but also, in consequence of the change of position
of the prefrontals through the further progress of concentration, whereby
they are drawn backwards closer to the prosencephalic part of the cranium,

--and in consequence of the concomitant expansion of the true frontals, with

the orbital plates of the frontals ; whereby these plates usurp in most mammals
the oflHice and the position of the external parts of the prefrontals in the cold-

blooded vertebrataf

   &The posterior part of the coalesced prefrontals (figs. 24 25, u) divides

the anterior aperture of the cranium into two outlets, upon the inner circum-
ference of wiiich tile rhinencephala rest ; each ontlet being commonly closed
by part of the olfactory capsules, which are ossified and perforated to receive

the divisions of the olfactory nerves. When the prefrontals extend backwards

and beyond the cribriform plates, they form what is termed the ' crista galli':
this exists in comparatively few mammalia ; but is as large in the seal tribe
as in man. In the tapirs the prefrontals expand above and overarch the ol-
factory capsules, but their upper horizontal plates are overlapped by the
nasals and true fi'ontals. In the DelphinidcE, where the olfactory capsules
are absent, the prefrontals expand posteriorly, and diverge from their median
coalesced portions constituting the septum of the nasal passage, in order to
form the posterior boundaries of those passages and the anterior wall of the
cranial cavity. They again expand and form a thick irregular mass anterior
to the nasal passages in some DelphinidcE, and in Ziphius ossification extends
along the fibrous continuation of the prefrontals forwards to near the end of
the premaxillariesj. They are connate with the orbitosphenoids behind, and
soon coalesce with the vomer below ; they rise anterior to the frontals and
support the stunted nasals which are wedged between the prefrontals and
frontals. The cetacea are the only mammalia in M'hich the prefrontals appear
upon the exterior of the skull, and which in this respect resemble the reptilia.

   f Cuvier takes this gi-ound in objecting to Oken's ethmoidal homology of the prefrontal
in the crocodile, and says, "the ethmoid coexists in a cartilaginous state with, and is enve-
loped hy, the prefrontal, ' comme la partie anterieure du frontal enveloppe rethmoide des

--ruminans.' " Hist, des Poissons, v. p. 235. The correspondence is exaggerated, but it

matters not. There are other characters of the mammalian ethmoid, as the closing of the
cranium anteriorly, the transmitting the olfactory nerves, &c., which are nowise manifested
by Cuvier's cartilaginous ' ethmoide' in the crocodile, and are very satisfactorily so by the

prefrontals in that animal.

   Cuvier describes the posterior aud superior expanded and diverging plates
of the prefrontals as "la lame cribreuse de I'ethinoide :" the coalesced part
forming the septum, he ascribes to the vomer*. Dr. Kostlinf, also, who
rightly recognises the ethmoid to be no proper bone of the skull, but only
an ossified organ of sense, yet describes, after the anthropotomists, tiie coa-
lesced prefrontals as the cribriform and azygos processes of the ethmoid
(' Siebplatte' and ' Scheidewand des Siebbeins,' pp. 85. 89) in cetacea which
have no organ of smell. In a young balaenoptera, in which tlie frontals, the
vomer and the nasals were ossified, I find the prefrontals as two cartilaginous
plates, extending from the nasals above to the groove of the vomer below. In
the manatee the essential parts of the prefrontals which close the cranial
cavity anteriorly, and give exit to the olfactory nerves, are thick and unu-

sually expanded. But in no mammal do these parts, with their continuation,

the ' lamina perpendicularis,' which, as the coalesced neurapophysial plates
of prefrontals, bring the vomer below in connection with the nasals above,
ever undergo such modifications as to obliterate their true and essential ho-

niological characters.
    In proceeding next to consider the special homologies of the bones of the

arch closed by the premaxillaries (22) and constituting the ' upper jaw,' I
commence with the palatines (20), because they form, throughout the verte-
brate series, the most constant medium of suspension of that arch to the
anterior cranial segment formed by the vomer, prefrontals and nasal. This
' secret affinity,' as Goethe would have termed it, before the knowledge of
the general type had revealed its nature, is manifested by the process of the
palatine in man, which creeps up, as it were, into the orbit to effect its wonted
union with the prefrontal, to that part of the bone, viz. of which Cuvier had
recognised the homologue in his 'ethmo'ide' of tlie bird J. It is the very
constancy, indeed, of these and other connections which has exempted the

palatine from the diff"erent determinations and denominations attached to
other bones, and which renders further discussion of its special homology

unnecessary here.

    Passing over, for the same reason, the maxillary (21) and premaxillary (22),
and referring to the excellent treatise by Dr. Kostlin з for the grounds of
the determination of the 'pterygoid' (24), I proceed to notice other bones
which, diverging from the maxillary arch, serve to give it additional fixation
and strength in the air-breathing vertebrates. The first of these is the malar
bone (fig. 11, 26), the homology of which has been traced without difference
of opinion throughout the mammalian class ; where, however, the inconstancy
of its proportions, number of connections, and very existence, is sufficient to

 indicate its comparative unimportance as an element of the maxillary arch.

It is absent in many insectivores (Ce?ifetes, Echinops, Soi-ex): it has not
been detected as a distinct bone in the zygomatic arch in the monotremes, on

 account perhaps of its early coalescence, as in birds, with the maxillary

m(fig. 12, 21, 26) : Myr7necophaga gigantea and Manis, it projects back-

 wards, as a styliform appendage, from the maxillary, but does not attain the
 squamosal; whilst in the sloths and their extinct congeners the gigantic

megatherioids, the malar presents its maximum of development and complex-
 ity y. In the DeJphinidcB, again, the malar is much reduced : its slightly ex-

 panded maxillary end forms part of the orbit and joins the frontal ; the rest
 extending backwards, as a verj-^ slender style, beneath the orbit to the squa-

mosal. The malar joins the post-orbital process of the frontal in the Mana-
tus senegalensis, the hippopotamus, the solipeds, and ruminants, some carni-
vores and the lemurs ; in the true quadrumanes and man it joins the alisphe-

noid, and sometimes also the parietal.

   The presence, form and connections of the malar are much more constant
in the class of birds ; where, however, it must be sought for as an indepen-
dent bone at an early period. In the young ostrich (fig. 23, le) it is reduced

to the form of a simple, straight, slender style, and coalesces first with the
similarly-shaped squamosal (27), and next with the malar process of the
maxillary (21"). In the crocodile the malar bone (fig. 22, 26 ) becomes more
developed, and adds the connections with the postfrontal (12) and the ecto-
pterygoid (24') to the more constant ones with the maxillary (21) and squa-
mosal (27), which alone sustain it in birds. In most of the chelonians the
malar presents the same connections as in the crocodile, but is transmuted
from a ' long' to a ' flat' bone. It retains the expanded shape in the agama
but in most other lizards it resumes the styloid form ; being broadest, how-
ever, in those genera, e. g. Iguana, Thorictes, Tejus, in which it extends from
the maxillary to the postfrontal and squamosal ; in the Varani it projects
freely backwards, like a styliform appendage of the maxillary, as in the
toothless mammalian JBruta, above-cited.

   There is no malar bone in ophidians and batrachians. The lower portion
of the tympanic pedicle in the Anoura sends forward a process which joins a
backward prolongation of the maxillary : in all other batrachia the lower
portion of the tympanic pedicle is restricted to its normal connections and to
its function of affording articulation to the lower jaw. With regard, there-
fore, to the zygomatic modification of this portion of the pedicle in anourous
Batrachia, some may deem it the homologue of the malar ; and, in marsu-
pial quadrupeds, the malar actually forms part of the glenoid cavity for the
lower jaw : or it may be regarded as the squamosal, which constantly sup-
ports the lower jaw in mammals : or it may be viewed as the coalesced homo-
logue of both bones : or finally, as a simple modified dismembennent of the
tympanic pedicle of the higher reptiles and birds ; effecting a union with
the maxillary bone which makes it analogous to, but not, therefore, homolo-
gous M'ith, the distinct malar and squamosal in those higher vertebrates. This
is a question of special homology on which I am unwilling at present to
express a decided opinion : but viewing the inconstancy of the squamosal in
reptilia, and its deprivation of the function of exclusively supporting the
mandible in all ovipara, I am disinclined to adopt the idea of its sudden resti-
tution to that mammalian function in frogs and fishes ; yet, if either of the
bones 20 and 27 are to be selected as the homologue of the hypotympanic (28^)
of batrachians and fishes, I should regard the claims of the squamosal to be
stronger than those of the malar, which Cuvier has chosen. The further sub-
division, however, of the tympanic pedicle in fishes, prepares us, in the as-
censive comparison, for the simple division of the pedicle in batrachia, and
for recognising in the lower articular portion a vegetative dismemberment of

23 in the crocodile.

   The characters and chief changes, in respect of connections and functions,
of the squamosal (27) in the mammalia have already been noticed in the dis-
cussion of the homologies of other elements of the complex ' temporal bone'
in that class. In birds the bone (fig. 23, 27) undergoes the same change of
form which has been noticed in the jugal, viz. from the squamous to the
styloid. It continues, however, to connect the malar with the tympanic as
it does in figs. 11 and 12, but it has no connections with other bones. Cu-
vier having been led to recognise the squamosal in the mastoid (fig. 23, ╗) of
ox THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                         229

birds, does not distinguish 27 from 26, the true ' jugal :' and Geoffroy v iewing

the ' portion ecailleuse' of the temporal in that cranial bone of the bird, which

he figures under the letter R, fig. 17, pi. 27 (Annales du Museum, x.), calls

the true squamosal, the original separation of which from the malar he had

Henoticed in the chick, ' jugal posterieure.'  did not admit that this division

of the zygomatic style was constant or common in the osteogeny of the skull

of birds : but I have always found such division in the embryo, and it con-

tinues longer than usual in those very species, e. g. the duck and ostrich

(fig. 23, 26, 27), in which Geoffroy denies its existence {I. c, p. 361). Oken

accurately describes the two constituents of the zygoma in the skull of the

goose, in his characteristic and original Essay*, where he calls the posterior

piece (27) the humerus, and the anterior one (26 ) the radius of the head.
Bojanusf, who also recognised the fact of the essential individuality of the
bone (27) in birds, but who saw the homologue of the squamosal rather in the
tympanic (23), calls it ' os zygomaticum posterius.' I could cite other testi-
monies to the primitive existence of the distinct bone in birds connecting the

malar with the tympanic ; but the fact which chiefly concerns us here is, that

if the special homology of no. s with the mastoid, and that of no. 28 with

the tympanic be proved, we then have a bone presenting the most constant
connections of the squamosal in no. 27 : if, however, that name be transferred,

as has been done by Cuvier, BojanusJ and Geoffroy, to other bones, then a

new bone and a new name must be introduced into vertebrate craniology,

for which, as I trust I have shown, there is no sufficient ground.

Both Oken and Bojanus rightly discern in the permanently distinct bone

which, in the crocodiles (fig. 22, 27) and chelonians, connects the malar (25)
with the tympanic (as), the homologue of the bone they call ' cranial hume-

rus,' or ' zygomaticum posterius' in the bird. Cuvier is more accurate in his

determination of this bone (fig. 23, 27) as the ' squamosal' in reptiles ; but

again at the expense of his consistency in regard to the characters of his

squamosal in the bird: for the homology of no. s (Cuvier's 'squamosal') in

fig. 22 with no. s (Cuvier's ' mastoid') in fig. 23, is as obvious and unmistake-

able as is that of no. 27 (Cuvier's ' squamosal') in fig. 22 with no. 27 (his dis-

memberment of the jugal) in fig. 23. The squamosal is relatively stronger in

crocodiles than in birds, and in many chelonians resumes its flat, scale-like

form ; although, as Cuvier well observes, it answers, in function, only to the

--zygomatic part of the mammalian squamosal : " c'est un temporal dont la

partie craniale a disparuз." In lizards the squamosal again resumes the zy-

gomatic or styloid shape, connecting the mastoid and tympanic with the

postfrontal, and usually also with the malar ; the posterior connections being

here, as in mammals, the more constant ones.

As the squamosal varies in form with the malar, so it likewise disappears

with it in ophidians ; unless the anatoftiist, tracing it descensively, prefers to

see it again in the peculiarly developed hypotympanic of the anourans. Ac-

cording to this view of the sudden resumption of its mammalian function in

regard to the lower jaw in batrachia, the name 'squamosal' may be trans-

--ferred to the hypotympanic in fishes ; and, if we must view the pedicle

(2s a d, fig. 5) as ' homologically compound,' and not, like the mandibular

ramus, ' teleologically compound,' i^d seems to me a less arbitrary selection

from the pieces of that long and subdivided pedicle, for the representative

of the squamosal, than the proximal or uppermost piece (na) to which Cu-
vier has applied that name. If, indeed, Bojanus could have determined to
his own satisfaction or that of other anatomists, that the pedicle (2s, tig. 23),
articulated by one end to the mastoid, and by the other to the mandible, in
birds, was the ' squamosum,' then there would have been some ground for
regarding the bone (28a, fig. 5) connected in fishes, with the mastoid as the
' squamosum.'

   But when Cuvier had persuaded himself that the bone no. s, fig. 23, in
birds, to which the tympanic pedicle is articulated, was the * ecaille du tem-
poral,' we feel at a loss to know on what principles special homologies can
be traced, when we find the name transferred to the upper part of the tym-
panic pedicle in fishes (fig. 5 28 a), which is articulated to the bone (s) un-
equivocally answering to Cuvier's ' ecaille du temporal' in birds. M. Agassiz
is more consistent, and abandons with reason the Cuvieriau determination of
the squamosal in fishes : if, however, the grounds assigned are conclusive as

to the homology of no. 8, figs. 8 & 23 in birds with the mastoid of mammals

and reptiles, M. Agassiz cannot be correct in regarding the bone no. 8, fig.

5 in the fish, as the ' ecaille du temporal.'
   With reference to the idea entertained by Spix, GeoflProy and Agassiz, of

the homology of the suborbital muciferous scale- bones in fishes with the malar

bones of higher vertebrates, I may refer to what has already been said in

regard to the actual repetition of the osseous arch connecting the prefrontal
with the postfrontal in certain birds, where that arcii coexists with, and in-
dependently of, the bone recognised as the 'malar' by both Spix and Geof-

frey. The connection of the malar with the lacrymal and post-frontal is
less constant and characteristic of the bone than that with the maxillary and
squamosal. And it may further be remarked, that the functional character
of circumscribing a mucous duct, manifested by the lacrymal or anterior
end of the upper zygomatic or suborbital arch in the parrot, is superadded to
the character of connections in proof that such arch, and not the true zygo-
matic arch below, is homologous with the suborbital chain of bones in fishes.

All these discrepancies as to the jugal and squamosal in fishes arise, in my

opinion, out of the circumstance that those bones are normally absent in
that class; both 26 and 27, figs. 11, 22, 23, 24, 25, being accessory parts, de-
veloped only in saurians, chelonians, birds and mammals, for additional fixa-
tion of the upper jaw, or for additional expansion of the cranium, or for both

purposes*.
    According to this view, I regard the tympanic (2$) as essentially charac-

 terized in the oviparous vertebrates (fishes, reptiles, birds) by its free articu-
lation by a convex condyle with the mastoid above, and by a convex condyle
 with the mandible below ; and I regard its subdivisions in the lowest of
 these vertebrates, in the same light as the subdivisions of the mandible itself.
 The formation of the tympanic cavity and support of the tympanic membrane
 are secondary functions. The tympanic pedicle is essentially a single cranial
 element, and actually so in all air-breathing vertebrates above batrachians.

We see plainly, even in the frog, that the portion which supports the ' mem-

 brana tympani ' is a mere exogenous process of the pedicle : it has still less the
 appearance of a distinct part or process in the saurians, chelonians and birds :
 and when the tympanic is excluded by the squamosal in manmials from its
 normal office of supporting the mandible, it still manifests its character of

    * The inconstant ossicle suspended to the back part of the free extremity of the maxillary
 in the percoid fishes would have the best claim to homology witti the malar, if the further
 subdivision of the maxillary in the herring and lepidosteus did not indicate it to be a vege-
 tative dismemberment of that bone.

unity, whether it be expanded into a ' bulla ossea,' extended into a long tube
or meatus, or both, as in fig. 24', 2S, or whether, as in fig. 25, it be reduced to
a mere ring or hoop supporting the tympanic membrane, until it coalesces
with other parts of the temporal, to form the tympanic or ' external auditory
process' of that bone. In no air-breathing vertebrate have I ever found, or
seen described, the separation of the part of the tympanic forming the wall
of the tympanic chamber from the part supporting the tympanic membrane,
or this distinct, save in batrachia, from the part supporting the lower jaw*.

The tympanic pedicle is still further subdivided in fishes; but M. Agassiz's
original idea of the 'epitympanic' as a dismemberment of the pedicle, which
he proposed to call ' os carre superieur,' is, in my opinion, much more consist-

ent with nature than his later determination of that bone as the ' mastoid,'
or than Cuvier's attempts to find the homologues of both the mammalian
'squamosal' and 'jugal' in the piscine subdivisions of the same pedicle.
There is as little ground for making the zygomatic process a distinct element
from the squamous portion, as for severing the annular process from the rest
of the tympanic. This idea of the zygomatic as an independent piece, which
Dr. Kostlin has also adopted, seems to rest only on the mal-determination
by Bojanus and Oken of the true squamosal in birds and reptiles as the
'zygoniaticum' or 'jugale posterius': and the idea was perhaps further
strengthened in the mind of M. Agassiz, by what he deems to be the essen-
tial and characteristic function of the squamosal. But its protective cere-

bral or cranial scale is a peculiarly mammalian development ; much reduced

in the ruminants and cetacea, and totally disappearing in the oviparous ver-

tebrates. The zygomatic functions and connections are, notwithstanding a
few exceptions, as in the scaly manis and a few lizards, the essential homo-
logical characters of the ' squamosal.' The necessity for ibrming an opinion

of the essential nature and general homologies of the parts blended together
in the human ' os temporis' by the ascensive or synthetic method, is strikingly
exemplified by the results of the application of M. Agassiz's id^a of its nature

to his determination of the bones in the head of fishes.

    As the palato-maxillary arch in most air-breathing vertebrates supports, ac-
cording to my views, certain appendages, e. g. the malar and squamosal, which
are not present in fishes ; so, I believe, with Cuvier, that the tympano-man-

dibular arch supports in fishes, certain appendages, which are not developed
in any other class. It is this fact, chiefly, that has led to so much discrepancy

in the attempts to determine by reference to bones in higher vertebrates the

--opercular bones of fishes, the chief battle-field of homological controversy.

All the four opercular bones forming the diverging appendage of the tym-
pano-mandibular arch (fig. 5, 34 to ar) were deemed by Cuvier to be peculiar
ichthyic super-additions to the ordinary vertebrate skeleton ; whilst by Spix,

GeotFroy, and De Blainville they are held to be modifications of parts which

exist in the ordinary or endo-skeleton of other vertebrata. The learned
Professor of Comparative Anatomy in King's College, London, who regards
this as "the more philosophical mode of considering them*," has briefly
stated the homologies proposed by the supporters of this view, viz. that the

opercular bones are gigantic representatives of the ossicles of the ear (Spix,

--Geoffroy, Dr. Grantf): or that they are dismemberments of the lower jaw

(De Blainville, Bqjanus), a view refuted by the discovery of the compli-
cated structure of the lower jaw in certain fishes, which likewise possess the

opercular bones : he then cites a third view, viz. that they are parts of the
dermal skeleton ; " in short, scales modified in subserviency to the breathing
function ;" an opinion which Professor Jones correctly states that he derived

from my Lectures on Comparative Anatomy, delivered at St. Bartholomew's

Hospital in 1835, and which he adopts, although its accordance with his first

proposition is not very clear. I have subsequently seen reason to modify that
view, though it has received the sanction of the greatest ichthyologist of the

present day, M. Agassiz ; and, as I have since found, had presented itself so

early as 1826, under a peculiar aspect to the philosophical mind of Professor
Von Baer. In his admirable paper on the endo- and exo-skeleton, M. Von Baer

expresses his opinion, that the opercular bones are (dermal) ribs or lateral

portions of the external cincture of the head J. The idea of the relationship
of the opercular flaps to locomotive organs is presented by Carus, under the
fanciful view of their homology with the wing-covers of beetles and the valves
of a bivalve shell з. In 1836, M. Agassiz propounded his idea of the relation
of the opercular bones to scales in a very precise and definite manner;
though, as I have elsewhere shown ||, the chief ground of his opinion is erro-

neous. He says, "Les pieces operculaires des poissons ne croissent pas,
comme les os des vertebres en general, par irradiation d'un ou de plusieurs

points d'ossification ; ce sont, au contraire, des veritables ecailles, formees,

comme celles qui recouvrent le tronc, de lames deposees successivement

   An analogous idea of the relation of the opercular bones to the inferior or costal arches was

proposed by Geoffroy St. Hilaire (Annales des Sciences, t. iii. pi. 9), and Cuvier (Hist, des
Poissons, i. p. 232), and has been adopted by the learned Professor of Comparative Ana-
tomy in University College, who, speaking of the occipital vertebrae, says, " The two external
and the two lateral occipitals form the upper arch, and the two opercular and two sub-

opercular bones constitute the lower arch." (Lectures, Lancet, 1834, p. 543.) He subse-

quently, however, adopts and illustrates (p. 573) the homology of the opercular bones with
the ' ossicula auditus' of mammalia; and in the ' OutUnes of Comp. Anat.' cites only the

Spixian and Blainvillian hypotheses (pp. 64, 65). In my Hunterian Lectures (vol. ii. 1836,
pp. 113, 130), I have adduced the grounds which have led me to the conclusion that the

opercular bones are neither ribs of the exo-skeleton, nor inferior arches of the endo-skeleton,
but persistent radiating appendages of an inferior (haemal) arch ; not, however, of the occipital
vertebra, but of the frontal ; just as the branchiostegal rays are the appendages of the haemal
arch of the parietal, and the pectoral fins of that of the occipital vertebrae. That parts of

both endo- and exo-skeleton may combine to constitute the opercular fin is the more pro-
bable, inasmuch as we see the same combination of cartilaginous and dermal rays in the
pectoral fins of the plagiostomes, and in the median fins of most fishes.

 premiere 6caille de la ligne laterale, dont le bord est egalement dentele. On

 pourrait dire aussi que le scapulaire n'est qu'une tres grande ecaille de la

 leur egard prouve que je suis loin d'admettre les rapports que Ton a cru
 trouver entre les pieces operculaires et les osselets de Toreille internet."

     I apprehend that the idea of the development of the opercular bones by
 the successive excretion or deposition of layers, one beneath the other, ac-
 cording to the mode in which M. Agassiz supposes scales to be formed, was
 derived merely from the appearance of the concentric lines on the opercular,
 subopercniar, and interopercular bones in many fishes. I have examined
 the development of the opercular bone in young gold-fish and carp, and I
 find that it is effected in precisely the same manner as that of the frontal and
 parietal bones. The cells which regulate the intussusception and deposition
 of the earthy particles make their appearance in the primitive blastema in
 successive concentric layers, according to the same law which presides over
 the concentric arrangements of the radiated cells around the medullary canals
 in the bones of the higher vertebrata : and the term ' successive deposition,'
 in the sense of excretion, is inapplicable to the formation of the opercular
bones. The argument in favour of their dermal character drawn from the
phaenomena of the development of the opercular flap, would equally apply to
prove the bones (ulna, radius, carpus, &c.) supporting the pectoral fin, to be

'dermal' bones J.

    The interopercular as well as the preopercular bones exist in the Lepi-

dosiren annectens with all the characters, even to the green colour, of the rest
of the ossified parts of the endo-skeleton ; the preopercular, as an appendage
to the tympanic arch, retaining its primitive embryonal subcylindrical form,

the interopercular being partly attached to the hyoid arch. Of the supra-

scapular there is no trace in the lepidosiren ; but in the sturgeon it plainly
exists as part of the cartilaginous endo-skeleton, under the same bifurcate
form, and double connection with the cartilaginous skull, which it presents
in most osseous fishes. The large triangular bony dermal scale firmly adheres
to its broad, triangular, flat, outer surface. The epi- and meso-tympanic
cartilages in like manner expand posteriorly, and give a similar support to

the large opercular ganoid scale. Were the supporting cartilages of the
opercular and suprascapular scales to become ossified in the sturgeon, they
might become anchylosed to the dermal bony plates, and bones, truly homo-

logous with the opercular and suprascapular in ordinary osseous fishes,
would thus be composed of parts of the endo- and exo-skeleton blended
together. I cannot, therefore, concur with Von Baer in the opinion that the

opercular bones are ribs of the exoskeleton, nor with Agassiz that both the

opercular and suprascapular bones are merely modified scales. In explaining

my views of the opercular bones, I am compelled, believing them to have no

special homologues in higher animals, to express those views in the terms of
a higher generalization. The suprascapular bone (fig. 5, 40) is the upper or
first part of the haemal arch of the occipital segment of the skull, and corre-
sponds in serial homology with the epi-tympanic portion (28 a) of the mandi-
bular arch, and with the palatine portion (20) of the maxillary arch. The
opercular bones are the diverging appendages of the tympauo-mandibular

of the hyoid and the pectoral appendages of the scapular arches, and have
the same title to be regarded as cephalic fins, and as parts of the normal
system of the vertebrate endo-skeleton ; but neither opercular bones nor

diverging appendages of vertebral segments make their first appearance in
the vertebrate series as ' rays '; and the opercular bones are actually repre-
sented by cartilaginous rays, retaining their primitive form in the plagio-
 stomes. In the conger the subopercular still presents the form of a long and

 slender fin-ray.

    The opercular and subopercular, in ordinary osseous fishes, may frequently

 coalesce, like the suprascapular, with their representative scales of the dermal
 system ; but they are essentially something more than peculiarly developed

 representatives of those scales. M. Agassiz, indeed, excepts the preoper-

 cular bone from the category of "pieces cutanees," believing it to be the
 homologue of the styloid process of the temporal bone in anthropotomy, or
 the 'stylo-hyal' of vertebrate anatomy, as the piece, viz. which completes the
 hyoid arch above. " C'est en effet," he says, " cet os a la face interne duquel
 I'os hyoide des poissons est suspendu, qui s'articule en haut avec le mastoi-

 dien et tres sou vent meme snr I'ecaiile du temporal." So far as my obser-

  vation has gone, it is a rare exception to find the hyoid arch suspended to
  the preoperculum ; the rule in osseous fishes is to find the upper styliform
  piece of the hyoid arch (fig. 5, as) attached to the epi-tympanic (28 a) close
  to its junction with the meso-tympanic bone (236). It is equally the rule to
  find the preopercular (34) articulated with the epi-, meso-, and hypo-tym-
  panics ; and it is an exception, when it rises so high as to be connected with
  the mastoid (' ecaille du temporal ' of Agassiz). If the styio-hyal be not the
  upper piece of the hyoid arch displaced, and if the upper piece connecting
  that arch with the mastoid is to be sought for in osseous fishes, I should
  rather view it in the posterior half of the epi-tympanic (as л), which is usually
  bifurcate below and very commonly also above, when the posterior upper
  division articulates with the mastoid, and one of the lower divisions with the

   hyoid arch.

      The normal position, form, and connections of the preoperculum clearly
   bespeak it to be the first or proximal segment of the radiated appendage of
   the tympano-mandibular arch : the opercular, subopercular, and interoper-
   cular bones form the distal segment of the same appendage.

      M. Vogt, in supporting M. Agassiz's views of the Ganoid order, reiterates

   his original idea that the preopercular bone is the proximal piece (styloid)
   of an arch distinct from the tympano-mandibular one ; but as the chief ground
   of this opinion rests on a simple question of fact easily determinable, viz.
   whether, as a rule, the hyoid arch is suspended from the preoperculum, and

  this from the mastoid in fishes, neither of which accord with my observation
   of their connections of those parts, the verdict may be left to the experience
   of other observers. From a remark of M. Vogt's*, viz. that " M. Miiller

   attache, a ce qu'il parait, trop peu d'importance a ce fait, que toujours le
    preopercule, et cela aussi chez les Siluroides, sert de point d'attache a Tare
   hyoidien," it would seem that, perhaps, the accomplished physiologist and
   ichthyologist of Berlin had not found the fact; and, therefore, gave not more
    than its due importance to the rare exceptional circumstance of such an at-
   tachment. The preopercular can be removed in most fishes, except where,
    as in the siluroids, it coalesces with the tympanic arch, without dislocating

                                                  * Annales des Sciences, 1845, p. 56.

or disturbing the connections of the true stylo-hyal (fig. 5, ss) with the epi-
tympanic (asa) from which it is normally suspended.

   M. Vogt correctly observes that the ' temporal' ^epitympanic, 2s a), ' sym-

plectique' (mesotympanic, 2s 6), and ' jugulaire' (hypotympanic, 2S rf), "a

eux seals forment deja un arc suspensoir complet, a la face posterieure
duquel le preopercule est seulement accole*." But this only proves that the

preoperculum is an appendage to such arch, not that it is a suspensory pier

of a second arch.

   The only essential modification which the siluroids present is the confluence

of the preoperculum with the true tympanic pedicle, here reduced to a single
piece. But this does not disprove its character as an appendage of the
tympano-mandibular arch, any more than does the confluence of the ulna and

radius with the scapular arch in the sturgeon disprove the character of those
elements as appendages of that arch. 1 have not been able to trace in the
siluroids the primitive boundaries of the coalesced preoperculum to such an
extent as to justify the statement, that it is intercalated between the epitym-
panic and hypotympanic, replacing the mesotympanic : but, if the preopercular

should extend in any siluroid fish so far as M. Vogt describes, this excep-
tional development would rather prove it to belong essentially to the tym-

panic and not to the hyoidean arch : at least it is only through this abnor-
mal encroachment that the preopercular can detach the stylohyal from the

epitympanic.

   As the otosteals, or ' ossicula auditus,' have borne a prominent share in the

discussions of the special homologies of the tympanic pedicle and its append-

ages, I may here remark that the extension in the embryo mammal of the

long and slender process of the malleus in the direction of the mandible, and

its continuation or connection with the cylindrical cartilage (haemal portion
of the tympano-mandibular arch) from which the lower jaw is subsequently
developed, is a circumstance which renders the idea of the malleus, at least,

being a modified element of the tympano-mandibular arch in batrachiaiis
and fishes, worthy of consideration. The prolongation from the mesotym-

panic of the cylindrical cartilage, described by Meckel, and around which

the mandible is ossified in fishes, and the characteristic cylindrical or styloid

form of the mesotympanic, have induced M. Vogtf to view that bone, the
'symplectique' of Cuvier, as the homologue of at least part of the malleus;
and at the same time of the bone called * tympano-malleal' by Duges (my
'hypotympanic') in the batrachians. M. Vogt offers no other reasons for

the determination. I find that the cartilage which in the batrachians forms
the medium of communication between the semi-ellipsoid ossicle (stapes)

closing the fenestra ovalis and the tympanic membrane, is repeated or repro-
duced in the more malleiform cartilage connecting the columelliform stapes
of the saurian reptiles to the membrana tympani. In birds a portion of the
cartilage attached to the tympanum becomes ossified and coalesces with the
columelliform stapes ; and at the angle of union one or two cartilaginous^
processes exist, which some anatomists have compared with the incus. But
all anatomists have concurred in recognising the homology of the peripheral
bent-down portion of the long columella, which adheres to the membrana
tympani, with the part of the malleus called ' manubrium,' or handle, in
mammalia. The superadded modifications characteristic of the otosteals in
this class, have their seat between the manubrium mallei and the stapes, and
chiefly result in the development of the new bone called ' incus ' and its epi-
physis, which has been termed the ' os orbiculare.' Notwithstanding, there-
fore, the connection of the ' processus gracilis mallei' with the embryonic

haemal or visceral cartilage of the mandibular arch in mammals, the homo-
logy of the malleus is so clearly traceable down ta its first independent ma-
nifestation in coexistence with the tympanic membrane of the batrachia, to
which it connects the unequivocally acoustic ossicle representing the ' stapes,'
that the reference of all the additional ossicular mechanism of the ear-drum

to the same system of the skeleton as the petrosal itself, appears to me to be

most consonant with the recognised facts in their development and compara-

tive anatomy.

   M. Agassiz has never countenanced the idea of the reproduction of the
mammalian tympanic ossicles in a magnified form in either the tympanic

arch or its opercular appendages. Returning to the consideration of these
bones in the last volume (p. 68) of his admirable ' Recherches,' he reaffirms
his opinion, that the opercular, subopercular, and interopercular are ' osse-
lets particuliers de la peau ;' but calls them ' branchiostegal rays.' If he
had meant that they were parts essentially distinct, but comparable to the
true branchiostegals, he would have accurately enunciated their 'serial ho-

mology.' M. Agassiz, however, expressly repudiates this idea of represen-
tative relation, and affirms them to be part of one and the same series of
ravs. " Mais en disant que les pieces operculaires sont des rayons branchio-
stegues, je n'entends point faire une simple comparaison, mais bien affirmer,
que je considere ces plaques osseuses simplement comme les rayons bran-

chiostegues superieurs*." This idea is, in fact, a necessary consequence of

M. Vogt's conclusion, that the preoperculum is the upper or styloid element
of the hyoidean arch. The combination of the opercular rays or bones with
the branchiostegals in the support and movements of the continuous gill-
cover and gill-membrane, does not prove them to be diverging appendages
of the same arch, any more than the similar combination of the rays of the

pectoral and ventral fins in the sucker of the Cycloplerus proves those rays

to be parts of the same arch. And I may repeat that, admitting the humerus

to be, as Bakker surmised, confluent in all fishes with the bone 52, fig. 5
and since in the plagiostomes, sturgeons and lophioids, the second segment of
the rudimental fore-limb is not liberated from the supporting arch ; so, like-
wise, the proximal member of the opercular limb may remain, or become in
some instances confluent with its sustaining arch, without that exceptional
state invalidating the determination deduced from its more constant and re-
gular character as the proximal element of the free appendage to that arch.

   The third inverted arch of the skull is suspended in fishes by a slender
styliform bone, the 'stylohyal' (fig. 5, ss), from the lower end of the epi-
tympanic (2s a) close to the joint of the styliform 'mesotyrapanic' (i%b);
and it is connected, through the medium of the posterior division and
joint of the epitympanic, with the mastoid (s). Now, either that division
of the epitympanic may be viewed, by virtue of its proper articular condyle
above, and its connection with a distinct inverted arch below, as the proximal

piece of that arch, coalesced with the proximal piece of the next arch in

advance, which articulates with the post-frontal; or, it may be viewed as an

excessive development of the proximal piece of the tympano-mandibular arch,
which, extending backwards, has displaced the hyoid from the mastoid, just
as the squamosal, by a similar backward development, in mammals, displaces

the mandibular arch from the tympanic.
    According to the first view, the bone no. 38 would be a dismemberment

of the proximal element of the hyoid arch ; according to the second view, it
would be the entire element reduced and displaced : in both cases it would
be homologous with the proximal slender piece of the hyoid arch in all

                               * Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles, v. pt. ii. p. 68.

vertebrata, and to which piece the term 'styloid' or 'stiliform' has been
given from the fish up to man (see Table!.). The homology, indeed, is so

obvious, that M. Agassiz, in accepting the conclusion of M. Vogt, that the

bone (fig. 5, 34), peculiar to osseous fishes, which so rarely articulates di-
rectly with the mastoid or with the hyoid arch, and so constantly sustains
the distal segment of the operculum, was the homologue of the 'processus
stiliformis ossis temporis,' nevertheless retains the name 'styloide' for the

part no. ss in question.

   The true homology of no. 34, already explained, removes the anomaly of
viewing that peculiarly piscine bone as the homologue of a constant element
of the hyoid arch in all the vertebrate classes, and the greater anomaly of

-- --the introduction of a new element a styloid piece of the os hyoides in

addition to the 'styloid process of the temporal' in fishes. The 'stylohyal'
articulates below to the apex of a triangular piece (39), which is pretty con-
stant in fishes, and to which I give the name of ' epihyal,' as being the upper
of the two principal parts of the cornu or arch : the third longer and stronger

piece is the ' ceratohyal ' (ih. 40).

   The keystone or body of the inverted hyoid arch is formed by two small
subciibical bones on each side, the 'basihyals' (ib. 41). These complete the
bony arch in some fishes : in most others there is a median styliform ossicle,
extended forwards from the basi-hyal symphysis into the substance of the
tongue, called the ' glossohyal ' (ib. 42), or ' os linguale'; and another symme-
trical, but usually triangular, flattened bone, which expands vertically as it
extends backwards, in the middle line, from the basihyals ; this is the ' urohyal'
{ib. 43). It is connected with the symphysis of the coracoids, which closes below
the fourth of the cranial inverted arches, and it thus forms the isthmus which
separates below the two branchial apertures. In the conger the hyoidean
arch is simplified by the persistent ligamentous state of the stylohyal, and
by the confluence of the basihyals with the ceratohyals : a long glossohyal
is articulated to the upper part of the ligamentous symphysis, and a long
compressed urohyal to the under part of the same junction of the hyoid arch.
The glossohyal is wanting in the MurcBnophis.

   The appendages of the hyoidean arch in fishes retain the form of simple,

elongated, slender, slightly curved rays, articulated to depressions in the outer
and posterior margins of the epi- and cerato-hyals : they are called " bran-
chiostegals," or gill-cover rays, because they support the membrane which

closes externally the branchial chamber. The number of these rays varies,
and their presence is not constant even in the bony fishes : there are but
three broad and flat rays in the carp ; whilst the clupeoid Elops has more
than thirty rays in each gill-cover : the most common number is seven, as
in the cod (fig. 30, 44). They are of enormous length in the angler, and
serve to support the membrane which is developed to form a great receptacle

--on each side of the head of that singular fish.
    Branchial Arches. In the class of fishes, certain bony arches, which ap-
pertain to the system of the visceral skeleton, succeed the hyoidean arch,
with the keystone of which they are more or less closely connected. Six of

these arches are primarily developed, and five usually retained ; the first four
of these support the gills, the fifth is beset with teeth and guards the opening

of the gullet : this latter is termed the ' pharyngeal arch,' the rest the ' bran-

 chial arches.'

    The lower extremities of these arches adhere to the sides of a median chain

 of ossicles, which is continued from the posterior angle of the basi-hyal, or
 from above the uro-hyal, when this is ossified : the bones which form those

 extremities are the ' hypobranchials'; and they support longer bent pieces,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

called ' cerato-branchials.' It is with these elements of the branchial arches

in fishes and perennibranchiate batrachians that we are chiefly concerned
in tracing the homology of the liyoid apparatus in the air-breathing verte-
brates. With regard to the branchial and pharyngeal arches, which attain
their full development only in the class of fishes, I regard them as appertain-

ing to the system of the splanchno-skeleton, or to that category of bones to
which the heart-bone of the ruminants and the hard jaw-like pieces support-
ing the teeth of the stomach of the lobster belong. The branchial arches
are sometimes cartilaginous when the true endo-skeleton is ossified : they are
never ossified in the perennibranchiate batrachians, and are the first to dis-
appear in the larvae of the caducibranchiate species ; and both their place

and mode of attachment to the skull demonstrate that they have no essential
homological relation to its endo skeletal segments.

    The hyoid arch or apparatus retains most resemblance to that of fishes in

the Siren lacertina ; the basihyal is simplified into a single osseous spatu-
late piece, with the bowl of the spoon anterior, and supporting a broad and

flat semicircular glossohyal. A strong and thick ceratohyal is articulated

by means of a small cartilage to the side of the expanded part of the basi-

Ahyal, and a cartilaginous epihyal arches backwards from its upper end.

cartilaginous urohyal extends from the hind end of the basihyal, and ex-
pands into a radiated disc, which supports the membranous trachea and the
simple glottis. One pair of bony ' hypobranchials' is articulated to the
basi-uro-hyal joint and a second pair to the sides of the urohyal : and to the
upper and outer ends of these are attached four pairs of cartilaginous ' cerato-
branchials.' The fimbriated branchiae are attached to the three anterior

ceratobranchials.

    In the proteus the urohyal is absent, and it is not again developed in any
batrachian. The long subcylindrical basihyal supports a subcircular carti-
laginous discoid glossohyal, and at the angle of union the bony ceratohyals

Aare sent ofiP. pair of hypobranchials diverge from the end of the basihyal

to which a second small pair of basibranchials are loosely connected by an
aponeurosis. These support three ceratobranchials on each side, which are
bony.

    In the newts there is neither a glossohyal nor urohyal, or but a rudiment
of the latter, to each side of which are articulated two hypobranchials, whose
distal ends converge on each side to support a single cartilaginous gill-less
rudiment of a ceratobranchial. The special homologies of all those parts of
the complex hyoid, rendered more complex by the retention of part of the
branchial skeleton, are clearly demonstrated by pursuing the metamorphoses
of the hyo-branchial skeleton in the larvae of the anourous batrachians. In
the fuU-gilled tadpole a short and simple basihyal supports laterally two
thick and strong ceratohyals, and posteriorly two short and broad hypo-
branchials, to which four ceratobranchials are attached : all the parts are
cartilaginous. The type of this stage is retained in the siren, with the histo-
logical progress to bone in the hyoid and hypo-branchial pieces. The second
well-marked stage in the tadpole shows an extension of the external and
posterior angles of the hypobranchials, with progressive absorption of the
cartilaginous ceratobranchials. The growth and divergence of the posterior

angles of the hypobranchials refer to the development of the larynx, now
commencing, which part they are destined to support. That period may be
described as the third stage at which the ceratobranchials have disappeared,
and the posterior angles of the hypobranchials increase in length and assume
the character of posterior cornua of the os hyoides. The last and adult

stage shows the ossification of the elongated angles of the hypobranchials,
            ON THE VfiRTEBBATE SKELETON.                        239

the coalescence of their cartilaginous bases with the basihyal, the expansion

of the basihyal and extension of its anterior and external angles ; in front of

which the now long and slender ceratohyals usually coalesce with the basi-

hyal ; their opposite ends having shifted their attachments and retrograded,
like other haemal arches of the skull, in the course of the metamorphosis.

In the case of the hyoid arch of the frog, the change of place is from the

tympanic pedicle backwards to the persistent cartilaginous petrosal : and

this is a very suggestive and significant change. All the parts of the hyoid

remain cartilaginous except the appended and persistent detachments from

the visceral system of the brancliial arches: these long 'hypobranchials'

(' comes thyroidiennes' of Cuvier and Duges) diverge and include the larynx

in their fork. The relative position, connexions and office in subserviency

to the larynx, to which the retained parts of the splanchno-branchial arches

are introduced in the lowest of the air-breathing vertebrates, are preserved in

all the higher classes. The 'hypobranchials' are as constant in their ex-

istence, therefore, as the upper larynx itself, and attach themselves more

Weespecially to the thyroid element of that larynx.  recognise them by this

relation in birds and man (46, figs. 23 and 25), where they always much ex-

ceed the parts of the true hyoid arch (cerato- and epi-hyals) in length ; and

in birds, where these elements (40, fig. 23) are sometimes obsolete and always

rudimental, the hypobranchials have been mistaken by both Cuvier and

Geoffroy * for the ceratohyals or anterior cornua.

For the modifications and special homologies of the complex hyoid appa-

myratus in lizards, I refer to  ' Lectures on the Vertebrata.'  The crocodiles

offer a well-marked ordinal difference from those inferior sauria in this as

in most other parts of their structure. The basihyal and thyrohyals have

coalesced to form a broad cartilaginous plate, the anterior border rising like a

valve to close the fauces, and the posterior angles extending beyond and sus-

Ataining the thyroid and other parts of the larynx. long bony ' ceratohyal'

(fig. 22, 40), and a commonly cartilaginous 'epihyal' (ib. 39), are suspended

by a ligamentous 'stylohyal' to the paroccipital process ; the whole arch

having, like the mandibular one, retrograded from the connection it presents

in fishes.

In birds as in chelonians, the ceratohyals are much reduced, and the chief

'cornua' of the hyoid are represented by the hypo- and epi-branchials (thy-

rohyals), which here attain their maximum of length and tenuity. The basi-

hyal (fig. 23, 41), as in Chelys, is long and slender, but is always a simple

piece ; and, as in lizards, is usually most expanded posteriorly, from which

expansion the thyrohyals (40) are sent off. Conforming with the long and

slender tongue in most birds, the basihyal extends forwards, and is articu-

lated with the rudimental ceratohyals (40), when these exist, at some distance

Afrom the thyrohyals.  commonly long and slender, sometimes spatulate

glossohyal (42), is articulated to the fore-part of the basihyal ; and a con-

stantly long, slender and pointed urohyal (43) is articulated with the posterior
end of the basihyal, and extends backwards beneath the trachea. The thyro-

hyals (46) diverge and include the larynx in their fork ; and support at their

extremities a bony or gristly (cerato-branchial) style (47). This is never

attached by ligament to the base of the skull, but is suspended freely, as in

the chelonia, by the glossohyoid and omohyoid muscles ; it, however, curves

over the back and upper part of the cranium in the woodpeckers, and the

extremities of both cerato-branchials are inserted, by way of rare exception

in that bird, into the right nostril.

   * Duges appears to have first pointed out tliis error, but without, however, perceiving the
true homology of his ' comes thyro'idiens ' with the hypobranchials of fishes.

   In mammals the normal completion of the hyoidean arch, as it first ap-
pears in fishes, is again resumed, and that not by a slender cartilage, as in
the frog, but by a chain of bones, in which we again recognise the cerato-
(fig. 24, 4o), epi- (39) and stylo- (as) hyals suspending the basihyal (41) and

the tongue to the base of the skull, often to the petrosal, sometimes to the
tympanic, or to the mastoid, or to the exoccipital. The ungulates and the
true carnivora best display this type.

   In man (fig. 25) the ceratohyals are reduced, as in birds, to mere tuber-
cles of bone (40), and the extent of the arch between them and the stylo-
hyals, which become anchylosed to the temporal bones, retains its primitive

ligamentous condition. Occasionally, however, ossification extends along
the stylohyoid ligament, and marks out, as in the specimen figured by
GeoflTroy St. Hilaire (Philosophic Anatomique, pi. 4, fig. 87), the more nor-
mal proportions of the ceratohyal, and also the epihyal. Other examples of

this ' monstrosity' are recorded in works on anthropotomy. The thyro-

-- --hyal (40) the last remnant of the branchial arches maintains more con-

stancy in its existence and proportions ; but manifests its true character of
free suspension below the skull, and an articulation by short ligaments to the

angles or horns of the thyroid cartilage.

   The remarks already made on the special homologies of the parts of the
scapular arch and its appendages, preclude the necessity of further extending

the present part of this Report.

                           Part II. General Homology.

   On taking a retrospect of the results of the researches of anatomists into
the special homologies of the cranial bones, the student of the science, how

little soever practised in such inquiries, cannot but be struck with the amount
of concordance in those results. It must surely appear a most remarkable
circumstance to one acquainted only with the osteology of the human frame,
that so many bones should be, by the common consent of comparative ana-
tomists, determinable in the skull of every animal down to the lowest osseous
fish. This fact alone, so significant of the unity of plan pervading the ver-
tebrate structure, has afforded me, at least, a large ground of hope and
much encouragement to perseverance in the reconsideration of those points
on which a difference of opinion has prevailed ; and in the re-investigation of
what is truly constant and essential in characters determinative of special

homologies.
    In this, as in every other inquiry into nature, the first labours are neces-

sarily more or less tentative and approximative : but if errors have to be
eliminated in the course of successive applications of fresh minds to the

task, truths become confirmed and established. And I regard the body of
such truths (see Table I.) to be now so great, in respect of the determination

of the homologous bones in the heads of all vertebrate animals, as to impe-
ratively press upon the thinking mind the consideration of the more general
condition upon which the existence of relations of special homology depends.

    Upon this point the anatomical world is at present divided, lacking the
required demonstration. The majority of existing authors on comparative
anatomy have tacitly abandoned*, or with Cuvier and M. Agassiz, have

Zoologie,' 8vo, 1834. Prof. Rymer Jones, ' Outline of the Animal Kingdom and Manual

directly opposed the idea of ' special homology ' being included in a higher

law of uniformity of type.

Yet the attempt to explain, by the Cuvierian principles, the facts of special

homology on the hypothesis of the subserviency of the parts so determined

--to similar ends in different animals, to say that the same or answerable bones
--occur in them because they have to perform similar functions involve many

Wedifficulties, and are opposed by numerous phsenomena.                                            may admit that

the multiplied points of ossification in the skull of the human foetus facilitate,

and were designed  to  facilitate,  childbirth                                     yet  something  more than such  a

final purpose lies beneath the fact, that most of those osseous centres repre-

sent permanently distinct bones in the cold-blooded vertebrates. The cra-

nium of the bird, which is composed in the adult of a single bone, is ossified
from the same number of points as in the human embryo, without the pos-

sibility of a similar purpose being subserved thereby, in the extrication of

the chick from the fractured egg-shell. The composite structure is repeated

in the minute and prematurely-born embryo of the marsupial quadrupeds.
Moreover, in the bird and marsupial, as in the human subject, the different

points of ossification have the same relative position and plan of arrange-

ment as in the skull of the young crocodile, in which, as in most other rep-

tiles and in most fishes, the bones so commencing maintain throughout life

their primitive distinctness. These and a hundred such facts force upon the

equal and knowing anatomist the inadequacy of the teleological hypothesis

to account for the acknowledged concordances expressed in this report by

the term ' special homology.' If, therefore, the attempt to explain them as

the results of a similarity of the functions to be performed by such homo-'

logous parts entirely fails to satisfy the conditions of the problem ; and if,
nevertheless, we are, with Cuvier, to reject the idea of their being manifes-

tations of some higher law of organic conformity on which it has pleased

the divine Architect to build up certain of his diversified living works,

there then remains only the alternative that special homologies are matters

of chance.

This conclusion, I apprehend, will be entertained by no reasonable mind

and reverting, therefore, to the more probable hypothesis of the dependence

of the special resemblances upon a more general law of conformity, we

have next to inquire, what is the vertebrate archetype? The gifted and

deep-thinking anatomist, Oken, obtained the first clew to this discovery by

on this subject. " It is not by any means our intention to engage our readers in discussing

all the conflicting and, sometimes, visionary opinions entertained by different authors re-

lative to the exact homology of the individual bones forming this part of the skeleton ; and

we shall, therefore, content oiu'selves by placing before them, divested as far as possible of

superfluous argumentation, Cuvier's masterly analysis of the labours of the principal inquiries
-- Aconcerning this intricate part of anatomy." p. 494.
                                                                                        later English author, who has em-

bodied a most valuable amount of careful and exact osteological observation in the article
" Zoology" of the ' Encyclopaedia Metropolitana' (4to, 1845), seems scarcely to regard even

the determination of special homologies as a necessary object of anatomical research. Thus,

in discussing the differences of opinion respecting the coracoid (fig. 5, 4S). he says, " Bakker's

view, however, if it be absolutely necessary to hunt up analogies, seems more correct."

p. 302.

This reserve is, however, perhaps less obstructive to the philosophical progress of anatomy

and to the requisite resumption of original inquiry to that end, than the mere reproduction

of the transcendental views of others without criticism or attempt to explain or refute the

objections to such views which have been promulgated by so great authorities as Cuvier and

Agassiz. Thus Bojanus's 4-vertebral theory of the cranial part of the skull is adopted by

M. De Blainville (Osteographie, 4to) ; -whilst Dr. Grant (Outlines of Comparative Anatomy,

8vo, 1835, p. 63) deems the composition of the skull, in fishes, to correspond nearly with

Geoflfroy's theory of this part of the skeleton being composed of seven vertebrae, each con-

sisting of a body with four elements above and four elements below.

the idea of the arrangement of the cranial bones of the skull into segments,

like the vertebrae of the trunk. He informs us that walking one day in the

Hartz forest, he stumbled upon the blanched skull of a deer, picked up the

partially dislocated bones, and contemplating them for a while, the truth

flashed across his mind, and he exclaimed " It is a vertebral column !*" Oken

afterwards tested and matured this happy inspiration by examining the skulls

of a cetacean, a chelonian, and a cod-fish in Dr. Albers's museum at Bremen

and on his return to Jena in 1807, he published his beautiful generalization in

a now very scarce Introductory Lecture, or " Programm beim Antritt der Pro-

On Hefessur," entitled '
the signification of the bones of the skull't-  illus-

trates his views by reference to the skull of a ruminant. " Take," he says,

" a young sheep's skull, separate from it the bones of the orbit, also those

cranial bones which take no share in the formation of the ' basis cranii,' e.g.

the frontal, parietal, ethmoid and temporal, and there will remain an osseous

column which any anatomist, at first glance, would recognise as three bodies

of a kind of vertebrae with transverse processes and foramina. Replace the

cranial bones with the exception of the temporals, for, without these, the

cavity is still closed, and you have a cranial vertebral column, which diff"ers

from the true one ('von der wahren') only by its more expanded neural

canal (Ruckenmarkshohle). As the brain is a more voluminously developed

spinal chord, so is the brain-case a more voluminous spinal column. As

the cranium includes, then, three vertebral bodies, so must it have as many

vertebral arches. These are next to be sought out and determined. One

sees the sphenoid divided into two vertebrae ; through the foremost pass the

optic nerves, through the hindmost the maxillary nerves {par trigeminurn).

I call one the 'eye-vertebra' (Augwirbel), the other the 'jaw-vertebra'

(Kieferwirbel). Upon this latter abuts the basilar process of the occipital

bone and the petrous bones : both belong to one whole. As the optic nerve

perforates the ' eye-vertebra,' and the trigeminus the 'jaw-vertebra,' so the

acoustic nerve takes possession of the hindmost vertebra. I call it, there-
fore, ' ear-vertebra' (Ohrwirbel) : and I regard this as the first cranial ver-
tebra ; the jaw-vertebra as the second, and the eye-vertebra as the third."

ih. p. 6.

   After entering upon the difficulties which beset him in determining whether

the petrosal belonged to the first (Ohrwirbel) or the second (Kieferwirbel),

and enunciating his views on the essential relations of each cranial vertebra
with a single special sense (excluding, however, smell and taste, as being

--inferior in dignity to the others), Oken proceeds, in his characteristic bold

metaphorical language : " Bones are the earthy hardened nervous system :

--Nerves are the spiritual soft osseous system Continens et contentum."

   " Between the sphenoid and occipital, between the sphenoid and petrosal,
between the parietal (the temporal being removed) and the occipital, theie
runs a line which defines the anterior boundary of the first vertebra. In the
line between the two sphenoids, or that which in man extends anterior to

the pterj'goid processes laterally and upwards through the fissura orbitalis

superior, anterior to the great ala, and finally between the frontal and the
parietal bones, we trace another line, which divides the second from the
third vertebra " {ib. p. 7).

   " Now," says Oken, " take the ear-vertebra from a foetus of any mammal

or of man, place near it an immature dorsal vertebra, or the third cervical

of a crocodile, and compare the pieces of which they consist, their form, their
contents, and the outlets for the nerves.

 --" According to Albinus and all anthropotomists, each vertebra of the

foetus consists of three distinct parts the body and the two neurapophyses
(bogentheile). You have the same in the occipital bone, but more clearly
and more distinctly: the 'pars basilaris' is separated as the body of the ver-
tebra from the ' partes condyloideae,' which form the lateral parts : these
are still more distinct from the ' pars occipitalis' which forms the spinous

process : even this part is often bifid, like the spinous processes in spina

bifida."

   " Since then the foramen magnum is the hinder or lower opening of a

vertebral canal, the condyles true oblique vertebral processes, the foramen

lacerum an intervertebral foramen, and the crista occipitalis a spinous pro-
cess, proved to be such by both its position and the muscles inserted into it,

--since lastly the whole occipital bone in relation to its form as well as its

function inclosing the cerebellum as a production of the spinal chord, is
a true and in every sense characteristic vertebra, it is unnecessary to dwell

more diffusely on parts, the bare mention of which suffices to make their

nature recognizable." ih. p. 7.

    This will serve as an example of the close observation of facts, the philo-

sophical appreciation of their relations and analogies, and, in a word, of the
spirit in which Oken determines the vertebral relations of the cranial bones

of the skull : and I refer to Table II. for his conclusions as to the parts of

the second and third cranial vertebrse.

  --Reverting to the petrosal, Oken thus beautifully and clearly enunciates

its essential nature and homology : " You will say I have forgotten the

' pars petrosa.'  No !  It seems not to belong to a vertebra, as such                                                                                                                                                                                         but to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

be a 'sense-organ' (Sinnorgan), in which the vertebral- or ear-nerve loses

itself; and, therefore, is as distinct an organ from a vertebral element as is

any other viscus (Eingeweide), or as is the eyeball itself. The (cause of)

delusion (as to the homology of the petrosal) lies in this, viz. that it must be

ossified agreeably with its nature (wesen),just as the eye must be crystallized."

Although Oken does not in this essay formally admit a fourth vertebra

anterior to the ' eye-vertebra,' he recognises the vertebral strijcture as being

carried out rudimentally or evanescently, by the vomer, as the prolongation

of the cranio-vertebral bodies, by the lacrymal bones, as their neurapo-
physes, and by the nasal bones, as the spinous process. His ideas of a
vertebra have evidently at this period not extended beyond the ordinary
anthropotomical one of centrum and neural arch with its transverse, oblique,

and spinous processes. When he indicates (beautifully and truly) the general

homology of the palatine bones, as pleurapophyses, under the name of an-
chylosed or immoveable ribs of the head, it has reference to the transcen-

dental idea of the repetition in the head of all the parts of the body. Thus
the squamosal in mammals and the tympanic in birds represent the 'scapula'
of the head, and at the same time, also, the ilium. The homologue of the
squamosal (fig. 21, 27) in the bird is the 'humerus capitis': the malar (ae)
and the maxillary (21) are the ' oberarm' (i-adius and ulna capitis) : the pre-
maxillary (22) is the ' manus capitis.' The segments of the hind limb are
--244 REPORT 1846.

represented by divisions of the compound lower jaw in the crocodile and
embryo bird (see Table, No. III.). The pterygoids (24), the essential di-
stinction of which from the sphenoid Oken clearly recognises, are his ' clavi-
culae capitis.' Oken hints at, without accepting, the (serial) homology of
the hyoid arch with the pelvis ; but he regards the stylohyal (ss) as the
' sacrum capitis' (ib. p. 16).

   The year after the publication of Oken's famous ' Introductory Lecture,'
Prof. Dumeril, apparently unacquainted with its existence, communicated
to the French Institute a memoir entitled ' Considerations generales sur
I'analogie qui existe entre tons les os et les muscles du tronc dans les ani-
maux,' the second paragraph of which is headed *' De la tete consideree
conime une vertebre, de ses muscles et de ses mouvements." In this para-
graph, repeating the homological correspondences, demonstrated by Oken,

between the basioccipital as a vertebral centrum, the condyles as ' obli(|ue
processes,' and the occipital protuberance as a spinous process, he adds, that

the mastoid processes are entirely conformable to transverse processes. And
M. Dumeril has, I believe, here the merit of having first enunciated the

general homology of the mastoids, although he does not aim at showing to
which vertebral segment of the skull they properly belong. Nor, indeed,
with the exception of an observation that " very often the body of the splie-
noid, like the ' apophyse basilaire' of the occiput, resembles the body of a
vertebra," does he push the transcendental comparisons further. GeofFroy
St. Hilaire tells us*, that even the moderate and very obvious illustrations
of the general homologies of the cranial bones, which M. Dumeril deduced
from the anatomy of the occiput, excited an unfavourable sensation in the
bosom of the ' Academic;' and that the phrase ' vertebre pensante,' which a
facetious member proposed as an equivalent for the word ' skull,' and which
circulated, not without some risibility, along the benches of the learned
during the reading of the memoir, reaching the ears of the ingenious author,
the dread of ridicule checked his further progress in the path to the higher
generalizations of his science, and even induced him to modify considerably
many of the (doubtless happy) original expressions and statements in the
printed report, so as to adapt it more to the conventional anatomical ideas
of his colleagues.

   As the truth of Oken's generalization began to be appreciated, it was remem-

bered, as is usually the case, that something like it had occurred before to
others. Autenrieth and Jean-Pierre Frank had alluded, in a general way, to
the analogy between the skull and the vertebral column : Ulrich, reproducing,
formally, Oken's more matured opinions on the cranial vertebrae, says,
" Kielmeyerum praeceptorem pie venerandum quamvis vertebram tanquam
caput integrum considerari posse in scholis anatomicis docentem audivi."

And the essential idea was doubtless present to Kielmeyer's mind, though
he reversed M. Dumeril's proposition, and, instead of calling the skull a ver-

tebra, he said each vertebra might be called a skull. But these anticipations
detract nothing from the merit of the first definite proposition of the theory.
It would rather be an argument against its truth, if some approximative idea
had not suggested itself to other observers of nature, who only lost the merit
of developing it, from not appreciating its full importance. He, however,
becomes the true discoverer who establishes the truth : and the sign of the
proof is the general acceptance. Whoever, therefore, resumes the investiga-
tion of a neglected or repudiated doctrine, elicits its true demonstrations,
and discovers and explains the nature of the errors that have led to its tacit

or declared rejection, may calmly and confidently await the acknowledgments

of his rights in the discovery.

 --It has been unfortunate for Oken, that, with one exception the gifted
--Bojanus his successors in the development of the vertebral theory of the

skull have hitherto exaggerated rather than retrenched the errors of their

guide. Spix* lends an almost servile aid to Oken in endowing the artist's
symbol of the cherub with all that it seems most to want, a thorax, abdomen
and pelvis, arras, legs, hands and feet. He adopts Oken's original number
and composition of the cranial vertebrae, and gives them new names, which

being dissociated from Oken's peculiar idea of the essential subserviency of

the cranial segments to certain organs of sense, are likely to be retained,

Bojanusf seems first to have determined the true elements of the neural

arch of the nasal vertebra; and was as happy in perceiving the pleurapo-

physial relations of the tympanic pedicle, as Oken had been in reference to

the palatine bone. He was less accurate in his idea of the vertebra to which

it belonged. The analysis of Bojanus' craniovertebral system given in Table

III. precludes the necessity of dwelling upon it in the brief historical sketch

here attempted.

   The modifications of his original idea which Oken has introduced into his

edition of the ' Natur-philosophie ' of ISIS, bring it into close accordance with

--that of Bojanus, excepting that Oken conceives the cranial neurapophyses to

answer also to ribs : " An den Seiten eines jeden Korpers liegen Fliigel-

fortsatze, welche den Querfortsatzen der Halsvvirbel oder den Rippen ent-

sprechen : 'die Gelenkkopfe des Hiuterhauptsbeins' (exoccipitals), 'die

grossen ' (ali-) 'undkleinen Fliigel' (orbito-sphenoids), ' und die beiden

Seiten des Siebbeins ' (prefrontals)," p. 304. With regard to the facial bones

of the skull, Oken still includes the explanation of their general homology in

his original idea, that " the head is (a repetition of ) the whole trunk with all

its systems  The encephalon is the myelon (riickenmark) ; the cranium,

the vertebral column ; the mouth is intestine and abdomen ; the nose, lungs

and thorax ; and the jaws, limbs (glieder)." Op. cit. p. 300. An idea which

vitiated his original essay, and which has had the effect of obscuring a great

truth in nature in the smoke of a sacrifice to a false system.

This seems the place to notice a virtual testimony to the general accuracy

of the Okenian cranial system, published in 1816 by the present eminent

-osteologist who holds the chair of Comparative Anatomy in the ' Jardin des

Plantes.' In a note to his ' Prodrome d'une Nouvelle Distribution Systema-

tique du Regne Animal,' published in the 'Bulletin des Sciences par la So-
ciete Philomathique,' 1816, p. 105, M. de Blainville says, " J'essayerai de
montrer(!)que la tete dans les animaux vertebres est composee, 1░ d'une suite

d'articulations ou de vertebres soudees, chacune developpee proportionnelle-

ment au systdme nerveux particulier qu'elle renferme, comme dans le reste

de la colonne vertebrale ; 2░, d'autant d'appendices paires qu'il y a de ces
fausses vertebres, et pouvant avoir des usages differens " (p. 108). M. de

Blainville does not (like Bojanus) expressly mention the general homology

of any of these appendages to the ribs, or parial appendages of the true ver-

tebrae ; but he leaves it to be so understood by his subsequent enumeration

and classification of the ' appendices paires ou symmetriques,' which he de-

scribes as being always in relation with a vertebra or median piece. He

says, e.g. " lis peuvent etre divises en simples ou en composes, ou peut-etre

d'apres leurs usages. Les appendices simples sont les cotes. Les appendices

composes sont les membres, les machoires, les appareils des organes des

tebres ; d'ou il resulte ce qu'on norame 'sternum' dans les mammiferes,
appareil branchial des poissons, hyo'ide, sternum des oiseaux," etc. (ib. 1817,
p. 110). Reserving the consideration of some of these propositions for a
subsequent part of the present Report, I shall only notice, en passant, the
complete concordance between these views of the general homology of the

--locomotive members with those which Oken expresses witli his usual apho-

ristic brevity : " Freye Bewegungsorgane konnen nichts anderes als frey

gewordene Rippen seyn."
   Cuvier includes amongst the general characters of the class Mammalia the

arrangement of their cranial bones into three annular segments, corresponding

essentially with those of which Oken had demonstrated the vertebral relations.
" Leur crane se subdivise comme en trois ceintures formees ; I'anterieure,
par les deux frontaux et Tethmoide ; I'intermediaire, par les parietaux et le

sphenoide ; la posterieure, par I'occipital : entre I'occipital les parietaux et
le sphenoide, sont intercales les temporaux, dont une partie appartient propre-
ment a la face*."

   What M. de Blainville (1816) pledges his efforts to demonstrate, Oken
(Isis, 1817) was exulting in the reception of, ' not only in Germany but all
Europe.' " Seit Erscheinung dieser Schrift und nun 10 Jahre verflossen.
Man spricht nun von Kopfwirbeln, Kopfarmen und Fiissen, von Bedeutung

der einzelnen Skeletknochen wie von einer uralten Sache ; die schon in der
Bibel und den Propheten gestanden," p. 1204. The chief differences, as
compared with Oken's definition, are, that Cuvier, finding the frontal arch
to rest upon both ethmoid and presphenoid, assigns to the former bone the
completion of the anterior cranial cincture below ; and completes, in like

manner, the parietal cincture by the sphenoid in its anthropotomical sense,
making no distinction between the anterior and the posterior divisions of the
bone. Cuvier does not apply this principle of arrangement of the cranial
bones to the skull of the lower classes of vertebrata (in which, nevertheless,
it is more clearly manifested than in mammals) : in generalising on the con-
stitution of the vertebrate skull, he classifies the bones, after the anthropoto-
mists, into 'those of the cranium which encompass the brain, and those of
the face, which consist of the two jaws and the receptacles of the organs of
sense.'t With regard to the skull of fishes, in which Bojanus had found so
clear an illustration and confirmation of the Okenian views, Cuvier merely
says, it is almost always divisible into the same number of bones as that
of other ovipara. The frontal is composed of six pieces ; the parietal of
three ; the occipital of five ; five of the pieces of the sphenoid and two of each
 of the temporals remain in the composition of the cranium J.

    In his great works the ' His^oire des Poissons ' and the ' Lemons d' Ana-
tomic Comparee,' posthumous edition, he expresses more decidedly his ob-
jections to the views of the segmental or vertebral structure of the skull.

he published in the year 1820, entitles the 8th, " Can the bones of the skull

planation of their forms and functions ? " He states that the idea of the

three facial vertebrae occurred to him in the year 1790, prior to which time

--he savs " die drei hintersten erkennt ich bald." The idea is developed in his

essay" as follows: "The skull of mammalia is composed of six vertebrae;

three for the hinder division inclosing the cerebral treasure ; three composing
the fore part which opens in presence of the exterior world, which it seizes

and introduces.
    " The first three vertebrae are admitted (he alludes to Oken and Spix) :

they are,

    " The occipital.
    " The posterior sphenoid.
   "The anterior sphenoid.
    " The three others are not yet admitted ; they are,
    " The palatine bone.
    " The upper maxillary.
    " The intermaxillary.

 feel interested by this simple enunciation of the problem, and would illus-
 trate it by some figures indicating by signs and ciphers the mutual relations
 and secret affinities of the bones, its publication would strongly draw the
 thinking mind in that direction, and we may, perhaps, one day, ourselves
 give some notes on the mode of considering and treating these questions."
     Professor Carus of Dresden has best responded to this appeal of his im.
 mortal countryman : but it must be admitted that the detailed and complex
 exposition of the theory of the six vertebrae and intervertebrae, of which the

 general results are given in Table III., have yielded to anatomical science a
 result which is hardly equivalent to the zeal and pains manifested in the at-
 tempt, or to the artistic merit of the illustrations, published by the accom-
 plished author of the * Urtheilen des Knochen und Schalengeriistes ' (fol.

  1828).
     GeofFroy St. Hilaire deems the skeleton of the head to be composed of

 seven vertebrae ; and he has the merit of having more steadily sought the

  homologies of the inferior arches of the cranial vertebrae than his predeces-

 sors, who seem not to have sufficiently appreciated the essential character of

  these portions of the primary segments of the vertebrate endo- skeleton.

 Nevertheless it must be admitted that Cuvier has made good the grounds of
  his rejection of Geoffroy's theory, as one based less on observation than on
  purely a priori views, according to which the bones of the skull, real or
  imaginary, are arranged into seven vertebrae, composed of nine pieces each*.
  The cranio-vertebral system of GeofFroy is liable to the further objection,
  that he has combined, as in the case of his typical vertebra from the tail of

  the flounder, parts of the exo-skeleton (e.g. the suborbitals) with parts of
  the endo-skeleton to which alone the vertebral theory is applicable.

      In the fasciculi of the magnificent ' Osteographie ' with which Professor de

  Blainville has enriched his science, the descriptions follow the plan of the

  classification of the bones of the skeleton propounded in the above-cited Me-
  moirs in the ' Bulletin des Sciences ' for 1816 and 1817. In the Prospectus of
  the ' Osteographie', M. de Blainville briefly refers to the great questions of
  comparative anatomy, which the German organologists have comprehended
  under the name of ' Signification of the Skeleton,' in allusion only to the
  " gross errors and opinions almost extravagant, of some of the persons who
   have occupied themselves with these questions :" whilst he reprobates, on the

other hand, in equally general terms, " those who have been unable to elevate

themselves to these kind of questions, partly on account of the nature of their
minds, partly from the want of proper and sufficient subjects of contempla-

tion *╖'

    Neither the first step, the most difficult of all, nor any of the succeeding
steps in the acquisition of such views of the ' Signification of the Skeleton

as M. de Blainville adopts are noticed : no objection to tlie vertebral system
of the skull is answered: no error that may have opposed itself to a reception

of the doctrine is explained or refuted : of the particular labours and dis-
coveries of individual homologists the author of the ' Osteographle' is silent.

He defines a vertebra, in the language of anthropotomy, as a single bone :
" Une vertebre, consideree d'une maniere generale, et par consequent dans

son etat complet, est un os court, median, symmetrique, formant un corps,
partie principale de la vertebre, aux deux faces opposees de laquelle, externe
on dorsale, interne ou ventrale, s'applique un arc plus ou moins developpe,
d'ou resultent deux canaux, I'un au dos, I'autre au ventre." {ib. fasc. i. p. 6.)

We discern the influence of the ideas of his ingenious contemporary, GeofFroy

St. Hilaire, in the admission of the ventral or inferior, as well as the dorsal or

superior arch ; and, like GeofFroy, he recognises the physiological relation
of the upper arch to the protection of the nervous system, and that of the
lower arch to the protection of the vascular system : but, overlooking or re-
jecting the idea of the relation of the ribs as the inferior protecting arches of

the expanded central organ of the vascular system, he considers the ventral

(haemal) arches as arriving at their maximum of development in the tail. The

 dorsal and thoracic vertebrae are, accordingly, characterized as those which are
 provided with costiform appendages diversely articulated to them ; over-

lookino-, I mav remark, the costal appendages of the cervical vertebrae in the

 saurians and "those which become anchylosed to the cervical vertebras in

 birds, as do, frequently, their serial homologues to the dorsal vertebrae in the

sarae'class. ' M. de Blainville seems, also, wholly ignorant of the fact that the
 bent-forward ends of the long transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae of

 the hares, cavies, and many other rodents, are primarily developed as distinct
 costal rudiments : the same rudiments of lumbar ribs are found in the foetus
 of the hog, and in the first lumbar vertebra of many mammals f. " Les lom-
 baires," says M. de Blainville, " n'ont plus de cotes, meme incompletes."

    The ribs not being regarded as essentially parts of the inferior or haemal
 arches of vertebrae, the sternal bones which complete these greatly expanded
 arches are accordingly regarded as a distinct series of bones, and called
л sternebers.' M. de Blainville, as we have seen, had before (1817) compared

 them to vertebral bodies. In the ' Osteographie,' however, he rightly regards
 the body of the hyoid as their serial homologue, but does not extend his com-
 parison to the bones that in like manner complete the mandibular and max-
 illary arches. These, with the cornua of the hyoid, and the sternal and verte-
 bral ribs, he classes with the bones of the extremities, under the name of
 appendages (appendices), adopting, in his larger work, as in his original essay,
 essentially the idea of Oken, that the locomotive members are liberated ribs.

    After much additional research and comparison since the first publication
 of my ideas of the constitution of the typical vertebra or primary segment

 of the endo-skeleton J, I have found no reason for modifying them, but have
 derived additional evidence of their accuracy ; and I therefore reproduce the

 diagrammatic figure with which they were originally illustrated (fig. 14).

       ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                  249

 Although my investigations of the fundamental type of the vertebrate

 skeleton were first made upon the class ol" fishes, where vegetative uniformity
  or irrelative repetition most prevails, and where, therefore, the type is least
  obscured by the modification of one part in mutual subserviency with an-
 other, I soon found that I should be led astray by confining my observations
 to fishes, and by borrowing my illustrations from that class. Comparison

 of the piscine skeleton with those of the higher animals demonstrates that
 the natural arrangement of the pai-ts of the endoskeleton is in a series of
 segments succeeding each other in the axis of the body. These segments are
 not, indeed, composed of the same number of bones in any class or throughout
 any individual animal. But certain parts of each segment do maintain such
 constancy in their existence, relation, position, and offices, as to enforce the
 conviction that they are homologous parts, both in the constituent series of the
 same individual skeleton, and throughout the series of vertebrate animals.
 For each of these primary segments of the skeleton I retain the term ' verte-
 bra'; but with as little reference to its primary signification, as a part

specially adapted for rotatory motion, as when the comparative anatomist
speaks of a sacral vertebra. The word may, however, seem to the anthro-
potomist to be used in a different or more extended sense than that in which
 it is usually understood ; yet he is himself, unconsciously perhaps, in the
habit of including in certain vertebrae of the human body, elements which he
excludes from the idea in other natural segments of the same kind, influenced
by difiierences of proportion and coalescence, which are the most variable
characters of a bone. Thus the rib of a cervical vertebra is the ' processus

transversus perforatus,' or the ' radix anticus processus transversi vertebrae

colli ' *: whilst in the chest, it is ' costa,' or ' pars ossea costae.' But the ulna
is still an ulna in the horse, although it be small and anchylosed to the radius.

    The osteology of man, therefore, cannot be fully or rightly understood
until the type of which it is a modification is Jcnown, and the first step to
this knowledge is the determination of the vertebral segments, or natural
groups of bones, of which the myelencephalous skeleton consists.

    I define a vertebra, as one of those segments of the endo-skeleton which con-
stitute the axis of the body, and the protecting canals of the nervous and

vascular trunks : such a segment may also support diverging appendages.

Exclusive of these, it consists, in its typical completeness, of the following

elements and parts :

--250 REPORT 1846.

The names printed in roman type signify tiiose parts which, being usually

developed from distinct and independent centres, I have termed ' autoge-

nous' elements. The italics denote the parts, more properly called pro-

cesses, which shoot out as continuations from some of the preceding elements,

and are termed 'exogenous': e.g. the diapophyses or upper ' transverse

processes,' and the zygapophyses, or the ' oblique ' or ' articular processes ' of
human anatomy.

The autogenous processes generally circumscribe holes about the centrum,

which, in the chain of vertebrae, form canals. The most constant and exten-

sive canal is that (fig. 14, w) formed above the centrum, for the lodgment of

the trunk of the nervous system (neural axis) by the parts thence termed
' neurapophyses.' The second canal (fig. 14, h), below the centrum, is in

its entire extent more irregular and interrupted ; it lodges the central organ
and large trunks of the vascular system (haemal axis), and is usually formed

by the laminae, thence termed ' haemapophyses.' At the sides of the cen-

trum, most commonly in the cervical region, a canal is circumscribed by the

pleurapophysis or costal process, by the parapophysis, or lower transverse

process, and by the diapophysis, or upper transverse process, which canal

includes a vessel, and often also a nerve.

    Thus a typical or perfect vertebra, with all its elements, presents four
canals or perforations about a common centre ; such a vertebra we find in
the thorax of man and most of the higher classes of vertebrates, also in
the neck of many birds. In the tails of most reptiles and mammals, the

haemapophyses (as in fig. 14) are articulated or anchylosed to the under

part of the centrum ; space being needed there only for the caudal
artery and vein. But where the central organ of circulation is to be

lodged, an expansion of the haemal arch takes place, analogous to that which

the neural arches of the cranial verte-     Fig. 15
brae present for the lodgment of the

brain. Accordingly in the thorax, the

pleurapophyses (fig. \5,pl) are much

elongated, and the haemapophyses (fig.

15, h) are removed from the centrum,

and are articulated to the distal ends

of the pleurapophyses ; the bony hoop

being completed by the intercalation

of the haemal spine (fig. 15, hs) be-

tween the ends of the haemapophyses.

And this spine is here sometimes as

widely expanded (in the thorax of birds

and chelonians, for example) as is the

neural spine (parietal bone or bones)

of the middle cranial vertebra in mam-

mals. In both cases, also, it may be

developed from two lateral halves, and

a bony intermuscular crest may be ex-

tended from the mid-line, as in the

skull of the hyaena, and the breast-bone

of the bird (fig. 15, hs). To facilitate

the comparison of the merits of the

preceding view and nomenclature of

the typical vertebra with those of other

comparative anatomists, I have thrown

the results into the form given in          Natural typical vertebra : thorax of a bird.

                 ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                 251

To the question why I should have invented new names when Geoffrey St.

Hilaire had already proposed others for the vertebral elements, I can only re-

peat the regret with which I found myself compelled to that invidious step,

after having arrived at the conviction, that the learned Parisian Professor had

sometimes applied the same term to two distinct elements, and sometimes

two distinct names to one and the same element : and I am glad to be able to

cite the authority of Cuvier for the propriety and advantage of such a step.

His words are in reference to an analogous case, " Donner a un mot connu un

sens nouveau est toujours un procede dangereux, et, si Ton avoit besoin

d'exprimer une idee nouvelle, il vaudroit encore mieux inventer un nouveau

terme, que d'en detourner ainsi un ancien*." Now there is scarcely one term

in the first column in Table II. which is synonymous with its opposite in the

second column, or which expresses exactly the same idea ; and the discrepancy

becomes greater in regard to the terms applied to the vertebral elements of the

head, in columns 1 and 5 of Tablelll. The respective concordance of the views

of the vertebral archetype entertained by Geoffroy and myself with Nature will

be determined and judged of by succeeding impartial and original observers.

With regard to the term cycUal, " de kvkXos, cercle, pour rappeler sa

forme annulaire, permanentes chez les premiers," (Articulata, Dermoverte-

br6s, Geoff.) " et, au contraire, non perseverante chez les derniers " (Verte-

brata, Hants- vertebres, Geoff.), it is understood by its author to apply to the

annular segment of the crust of the insect, as well as to the ' centrum ' of the

endoskeletal vertebra. Geoffroy's primary division of the parts of a vertebra

is into the centre or nucleus (noyau) and the lateral branches. The upper

' branches laterales' or 'periaux' are equivalent to my neurapophyses and

myalso to  neural spine, in fishes : the lower lateral branches or ' paraaux ' are

sometimes  free  and  floatingfj when              they  answer  to  my  ' pleurapophyses
                                                                                                                                          ';

but they are sometimes so united as to form a canal, when they answer

myto ' parapophyses ' in the tail of fishes I, and to my ' hsmapophyses ' in

the tail of cetaceans. Geoffroy supposed, for example, that the haemal canal

in the tail in all fishes was formed by the ribs, bent down and anchylosed

at both endsз, and that the haemal canal in the tail of the crocodile and

whale was constituted by a like metamorphosis of the same vertebral elements.

He, also, argued that, as the small spinal chord of fishes did not demand

so great a development in breadth of the neurapophyses, they were permitted

to attain to unusual length ; and that, coalescing together, they thus consti-

tuted not only the neural arch but the neural spine, to which latter, therefore,

he extended the name 'perial' ; whilst to the corresponding part in mammals

he gives the name of ' epial '. But, again, in fishes, he calls the dermal

spines developed in the embryonic median fold of integument which is meta-

morphosed into thedorsal fins, 'epiaux' ; and the corresponding dermal spines

of the ventral fin ' cataaux.' The lepidosiren, however, manifests the neural

spine distinct from both the neurapophyses below and the dermo-neural spine

above : and such neural spine is unequivocally homologous with the anchy-

losed neural spine in osseous fishes ||. It is quite in harmony with the position

of the class of fishes at the bottom of the vertebrate scale that they should

present a greater degree of calcification of the parts belonging to the same

category of the skeletal system as the shells and crusts of the invertebrates

hence it is that whilst the median dermal fins of the marine mammalia have

their supporting skeleton in the primitive histological

fibrous state, the corresponding parts are ossified in fishes:

rarely, however, are such parts in answerable number to

the vertebrae ; and the true spines of these vertebras,
when the median fins and their bony spines are removed,

in fishes, show as little indication of the place or existence

of such fins, as do the vertebrae in the porpoise of the

existence of its dermal fin. In proportion as ossification

has extended into the dermal system of fishes it has been

arrested in the vertebrae, which in the trunk and tail of

fishes present their least complex condition. Two of the

autogenous elements, the ' haemapophyses,' are absent, and

are commonly represented, in the tail, by the modified

' parapophyses.' The seeming complexity of a fish's ver-

tebra arises from the intercalation of bones appertaining

to the system of the dermo-skeleton : it would have been an

unusual exception to the general course of development if

the lowest of the vertebrate classes should have presented

the  vertebral  skeleton            in  its highest state  of complication
                                                                                                                                         ;

and Geoffroy St. Hilaire was unfortunate in taking a fish's

vertebra with its extrinsic evertebrate complications, as the

perfect type of that primary segment of the myelencepha-

lous skeleton (fig. 16). He was still more unlucky in having

for the subject of his figure* a specimen from which two

of the pieces. had been accidentally lost, as Cuvier after-

wards pointed   out                 yet Geofi'roy's  mutilated  caudal ver-
                                 ;

tebra of the plaice continues to be copied in some

compilations of comparative anatomy, as the type of a

vertebra ! To obtain the dermal spines (pro-epial and pro-

cataal) of the vertically extended caudal vertebrae of fishes,

Geoffroy had recourse to a hypothetical division length-

wise of the interneural and interhaemal spines (which are

represented as being single in his figure), and to as gra-

tuitous a displacement of one of the halves from the side

to the summit of the other t- Now the interneural and

interhaemal sjiines are actually double in relation to the

neural and haemal spines ; yet they coexist with a dermo-
neural and dermohajmal ray, which therefore needs no

imaginary change of place of either of its supporting

spines to account for its existence. I subjoin in fig.

figured by Geoffroy ; and for the better understanding of

ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETOX.  253

    The trunk of fishes, in respect of its viscera and the degree of development
of the endoskeleton, answers to the lumbar and caudal regions of air-breath-
ing vertebrates, where the vertebrae usually lose some of their elements, at
least as bones. The heart and respiratory organs are placed in the head of
the fish ; and it is only in this region that the vertebral segments attain to
typical completeness in that class. GeofFroy, in studying the special and
general homologies of the bones of the head of fishes, blends indiscrimi-
nately, as in the supposed typical vertebra from the tail, elements of the
derraoskeleton (suborbitals and lacrymals, e. g.) with those of the endo-
skeleton ; and also presses the capsules of the special organs of sense into the

composition of the seven cranial vertebrae of his system. It needs only to
compare the synonyms of the elements of these vertebrae in Table III. to

perceive how impossible it would have been to have expressed the ideas
which I wish to expound and illustrate in this Report by the use of the names
for the vertebral elements proposed by Geoffroy, or of English equivalents.
The prefrontals, e. g. (no. 14), which I regard as the neurapophyses of the
nasal vertebra, are, according to Geoff"roy, epials of the 2nd or labial vertebra

in the class of fishes; but are epials of the 1st or nasal vertebra in the cro-
codile, according to the tables given in the ' Annales des Sciences,' t. iii. pi. 9,
and 'Atlas,' p. 44; whilst they are the perials of the 2nd vertebra in the
scheme of 1825, cited in the fifth column of Table III.

   I have deemed it requisite to enter the more fully into the grounds for
abandoning the analysis and nomenclature of the typical vertebra proposed
by GeoflTroy, because they have received the sanction in this country of the
learned Professor of Comparative Anatomy at University College. Dr. Grant*
converts the French names into English equivalent phrases; 'cyclo- vertebral
element' for cycleal, 'perivertebral element' for perial, &c. ; and abandons
the advantage of a definite name, without remedying the disadvantages of
the double employment of the same names for two distinct elements, and of
the application of diffierent phrases for the same element. If, for example,
the neural spine of the reptile or mammal be, in nature, the homologue of
the neural spine of the fish, then the latter is called an ' epivertebral element,'
whilst the former is called a ' perivertebral element.' If the dermo- neural
spines of the dorsal fin of a fish be, in nature, homologous with the fibro-
ligaraentous tissue supporting the dorsal fin of the dolphin, then the term
' epivertebral element ' is applied to a spine of the exoskeleton in the fish, and
to a spine of the endoskeleton in the mammal, which spine co-exists with such
dermal spine in the fish (see fig. 16). If the parapophysis or inferior transverse
process in the fish be a distinct element from the diapophysis or superior
transverse process in the mammal, the same phrase, ' paravertebral element,'
is applied to each. Dr. Grant, moreover, gives the same name, 'catavertebral
elements,' to the free vertebral ribs in fig. 28, B.g. p. 58, op. cit, as he applies
to the haemapophyses in the tail of the reptile or cetacean, in fig. 28, C. g.
he. cit. ; whilst GeoflTroy applies the name ' cataaux ' to the sternal ribs,
and not to the vertebral ribs : and it is precisely with the sternal ribs that
the chevron bones in the tails of reptiles and cetaceans are homologous, and

both are, therefore, the ' hsemapophyses ' in my system. The transference

of the term ' catavertebral elements ' (for cataaux), from the ' cotes sternales
to the pair of ribs extended from the ends of the parapophyses of the abdomen
of fishes, is a deviation from the original vertebral system of Geoff'roy, which
seems to lead further away from nature. If it is meant that the outstretched

   Devehpment of vertebra. Before applying the idea of the archetypal
vertebra, or primary segment of the endo-skeleton, given in figs. 14 and 15,

to the elucidation of the modifications of those segments in the different ver^

tebrate classes, I shall premise a few observations on the mode of develop-

ment of the vertebrae in those classes.

The chief condition of the development of distinct vertebrae in the trunk

is the conjunction of nerves with, or their progress from the spinal chord :

at least, this circumstance, with the concomitant exit of blood-vessels from

the neural canal, seems to determine the development of the neurapophyses :

and the vertebral bodies are not slow in coinciding in number with those im-

portant arches ; and in determining with the regular primary pairs of (inter-

Wecostal, lumbar, &c.) arteries, the inferior or haemal arches.         may learn how

much the development of the neurapophyses and vertebral bodies depends,

in the trunk, upon the conjunction of nerves with the spinal chord, by the

fact that, in the regenerated tails of lizards, the vertebral axis remains con-

tinuous and unjointed, because there is no co-extensive spinal chord giving

off pairs of nerves.

   An extremely delicate fibrous band, with successively accumulated gelati-

nous cells, compacted in the form of a cylindrical column, and inclosed by a
membranous sheath, is the primitive basis, called 'notochord* {chorda dorsa-

lis seu gelatinosa, Lat., gallertsdtde und ruckensaile, Germ.), in and around

which are developed the cartilaginous or osseous elements by which the

vertebral column is established in every class of Myelencephala.
   The earlier stages of vertebral development are permanently represented,

with individual peculiarities superinduced, in the lower forms of the class of

fishes f. In the Dermopteri or cyclostomous fishes, the neural and hsemal

canals are formed by a separation of the layers of the outer part of the apo-

neurotic sheath of the gelatinous chorda : in the lancelet {Amphioxus) there

is no distinction of structure in the cranial part supporting the anterior end

of the neural axis, with which the trigeminal, optic and olfactory nerves com-

municate, and the rest of the rudiniental vertebral column : a labial carti-

laginous arch supporting the tentacula is, at least, the only lineament of

development which sketches out the skull. In the myxinoids the skull in-

cludes a complex system of cartilages, but the vertebral colunm of the trunk

has not advanced beyond the gelatino-aponeurotic stage. In the lamprey

cartilaginous laminae are developed in the outer layer of the fibrous sheath,

and give the first indication of neural arches J. In the sturgeons (Siurio,
Polyodort) the inner layer of the fibrous capsule of the gelatinous notochord

has increased in thickness, and assumed the texture of tough hyaline carti-

lage. In the outer layer are developed distinct, firm, and opake carti-

lages, the neurapophyses, which consist of two superimposed pieces on each

side, the basal portion bpunding the neural canal, the apical portion the

parallel canal filled by fibrous elastic ligament and adipose tissue; above this

is the single cartilaginous neural spine. The parapophyses are now di-

stinctly developed, and joined together by a continuous expanded base, form-

ing an inverted arch beneath the notochord for the vascular trunks, even in

the abdomen. Pleurapophyses are articulated by ligament to the ends of the

laterally projecting parapophyses in the first twelve or twenty abdominal ver-
tebrae : in the anterior ones these ' vertebral ribs ' are composed of two or
three distinct cartilages* : the posterior pleurapophyses are short and simple.
The parapophyses gradually bend down to form haemal arches in the tail, at
the end of which we find haemal cartilaginous spines corresponding to the
neural spines above. The tapering anterior end of the notochord is con-
tinued forwards into the basal elements of the cranial vertebrae. Vegetative
repetition of perivertebral parts not only manifests itself in the composite
neurapophyses and pleurapophyses, but in a small accessory (interneural) car-
tilage, at the fore and back part of the base of the neurapophysis; and by a
similar (interhaemal) one at the fore and back part of most of the parapo-

physes f.

   Amongst the sharks {Squalidce) a beautiful progression in the further
development of a vertebra has been traced out, chiefly by J. Miiller;}:. In
Heptanchus (Squalus cinereus) the vertebral centres are feebly and vege-
tatively marked out by numerous slender rings of hard cartilage in the noto-
chordal capsule, the number of vertebrae being more definitively indicated by
the neurapophyses and parapophyses ; but these remain cartilaginous. In
the piked dog-fish (Acanthias) and the spotted dog-fish {Sct/llium) the ver-
tebral centres coincide in number with the neural arches, and are defined by
a thin layer of bone, which forms the conical articular cavity at each end:
the whole exterior of the centrum is covered by soft cartilage, except at the
concave ends ; the two thin funnel-shaped plates of osseous matter coalesce
at their perforated apices, and form a basis of the vertebral body like an
hour-glass ; the series of these centrums protecting a continuous moniliform
remnant of the gelatinous notochord. In the great basking-shark (Selache)
the vertebral bodies are chiefly established by the terminal bony cones, the
thick margins of which give attachment to the elastic capsules containing
the gelatinous fluid, which now tensely fills the intervertebral biconical spaces.
Four sub-compressed conical cavities extend, two from the bases of the
neurapophyses, and two from those of the parapophyses, towards the centre
of the vertebral body, contracting as they penetrate it. These cavities always
remain filled by a clear cartilage : the central two-thirds of the rest of the
vertebral body contain concentric, progressively decreasing, and minutely
perforated rings or cylinders of bone, interrupted by the four depressions :
the peripheral third of the vertebral body contains longitudinal bony laminae,
which radiate, perpendicularly to the plane of the outermost cylinder, to the

circumference ; these outer laminae lie, therefore, parallel with the axis of the
vertebra, and the intervening fissures, like those between the concentric cylin-
ders within, are filled by clear cartilage, which shrinks, and leaves them open

in the dry vertebra з.
    In Cestracion, the intermediate part of the centrum between the terminal

cones is strengthened by longitudinal radiating plates only ; in Squatina by
concentric cylinders only. In the tope ( Gakus) all the space between the
terminal bony cones is ossified, except the four conical cavities, the bases
of which are closed by the neur- and par-apophyses ; so that the whole
exterior of the centrum appears formed by smooth compact bone.

    In the osseous fishes I find that the centrum is usually ossified from six
points, four of which commence, as Rathke describes, in the bases of the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ||

 two neurapophyses and the two parapophyses ; but the terminal concave plates
 of the centrum are separately ossified. They coalesce with the intermediate
 part of the centrum, which is sometimes completely ossified, but commonly a
 communicating aperture is left between the two terminal cones ; and in
 many cases, the plates by which calcification attains the periphery of the
 body leave interspaces permanently occupied by cartilage, forming cavities
 in the dried vertebra, especially at their under part, or giving a reticulate
 surface to the sides of the centrum. The expanded bases of the neur- and
 par-apophyses usually soon become confluent with the bony centrum ; some-
 times first expanding so as wholly to inclose it, as, for example, in the tunny,
 where the line of demarcation may always be seen at the border of the arti-
 cular concavity, though it is quite obliterated at the centre, as a section
 through that part demonstrates.

     Miiller correctly distinguishes a 'central' from a 'peripheral' (cortical) part
 or seat of the ossification of the vertebral bodies of fishes. The peripheral
 ossification which takes its rise from the outer layer of the fibrous sheath of
the notochord sometimes extends into broad plates beneath the anterior ver-
tebrse of the trunk, and tends to fix or anchylose a certain number of them

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

 when they are commonly represented by the partially distinct central parts
 of the bodies, together with the neur- and par- and pleur-apophyses.

    The batrachia follow closely the stages above-cited in fishes ; the centrums

being arrested at the biconical stage in the perennibranchiates, but converted
into ball-and-socket vertebrae by the ossification of the interposed gelatinous
ball* and its adhesion, either to the fore-part of the centrum {Pipa, Sala-

mandra), or the back part {Rana, Hufo). The mode of ossification of the
centrum varies somewhat in batrachia. MiiUerf describes annular ossifi-
cations in the sheath of the notochord of the liana temporaria and R. escu-
lenta, which support, at first, the neurapophyses. Duges, apparently in-
fluenced by M. Serres' so-called ' law of centripetal development,' describes
two cartilaginous nuclei, side by side ; but the more obvious and better-de-

termined development of the vertebrae of fishes gives no countenance to this
bilateral beginning of ossification of the centrum as a general law. The first
distinct bony nucleus in the centrum observed by Duges was bilobed, and
afterwards cubical ; but excavated before and behind, as well as beneath J.

The ossification of the centrum is completed by an extension of bone from
the bases of the neurapophyses, which effect, also, the coalescence of these
with the centrum. In Pelobates fuscus, and Pelobates cultripes, Miiller found
the entire centrum ossified from this source, without any independent points

of ossification.

   The vertebrae of the tail of the larvae of the anourans are represented di-
stinctly only in the aponeurotic stage. Even when the change to cartilage
takes place, the tendency to coalescence has begun to operate, and only two

long neurapophyses are established on each side : the ossification of these
plateo extends into the fibrous sheath of the remnant of the coccygeal noto-
chord, and they coalesce when the perishable parts of the tadpole-tail have
been absorbed, and the fore- and hind-legs developed, constituting the long,
often hollow, and inferiorly grooved coccygeal bony style.

    In saurians, birds and mammals, the notochord is inclosed by cartilage
before ossification begins ; which cartilage is continuous with the cartilagi-
nous neurapophyses з. In birds, the two histological processes, chondrifica-

tion and ossification, do not precisely follow the same route. In the centrums

of the dorsal and cervical vertebrae of the chick chondritication is centripetal:

it begins from two points at the sides and proceeds inwards, the middle line

of the under surface of the primitive notochord resisting the change longest.

But, when the lateral cartilages have here coalesced, ossification begins at

the middle line and diverges laterally ; the primitive nuclei of the bony centres
appearing as bilobed ossicles, and its direction is centrifugal. The lobes

ascend to embrace the shrivelled remnant of the chorda, like the hollow ver-

tebral centres in fishes. Only in the sacral vertebrae has ossification been
seen to begin from two distinct points at the middle line. The bases of

the separately ossifying neurapophyses extend over much of the centrum,

and soon coalesce with it. In reptiles a greater proportion of the centrum

is ossified from an independent point, and the bases of the neurapophyses

often remain permanently distinct and united to the centrum by suture. In

mammals, as in fishes, the centrum is ossified from an anterior and posterior

centre, establishing tiie articular surfaces, as well as from an intermediate

point. This is considerably overlapped by the bases of the neurapophyses,

before they coalesce with the centrum. The three primitive parts of the

centrum remain longest distinct in the cetacea. The body of the human

atlas is sometimes ossified from two, rarely from three, distinct centres placed

side by side *. From these ascertained diversities in the mode of formation

of the central element of the vertebra, it will be seen how little developmental

characters can be relied on as affecting the determination of homologous parts.

are formed by the gradually bent-down ribs*, which are formed in the
abdomen either by unusally elongated 'parapophyses' (if they be inter-
preted by the condition of those elements in the cod-fish), or by pleurapo-
physes articulated directly to the fibrous sheath of the notochord ; which
interpretation of the mode of formation of the haemal arches is supported by
Professor Miiller's discovery of the nature of those arches in the Lepidosteusf.
Whether we adopt the analogy of the Anacanthini, or the Ganoidei (and
the general affinity of the Protopteri to the ganoids would incline the choice

to the latter), the constitution of the haemal arches in the lepidosiren is

strictly piscine ; at least if we take the skeleton of the tailed batrachia
(fig. 28) as our guide to the homology of the caudal inferior arches in
higher reptiles and mammals. The unusual size and length of the abdo-

minal parapophyses in the cod-tribe ( Gadidce), the flat-fishes {Pleuronsclidee^,
and the genus Ophidium, evinces the natural character of the ovAer Anacan-
thini, in which they have been grouped together by Professor Miiller : the
pleurapophyses are, conversely, very short and slender in this order. In all
bony fishes the costal arch in the abdomen is completed by the aponeurotic
septa between the ventral portions of the myocommata:};, which there repre-
sent the ' haemapophyses' {cartilagines costce, inscriptiones tendinece muse, recti

abdominis of anthropotomy). Indeed, when we reflect that the trunk of
the fish, by reason of the advanced position of the heart and breathing organs,
answers to the abdominal and caudal regions of the trunk of higher verte-
brates, we could hardly expect the typical vertebra to be there carried out in
osseous tissue ; but rather be prepared to find the haemapophyses retaining
the same primitive histological state which they present in the abdomen of
mammals and man (fig. 25, h").

    Immediately behind the coracoid arch, it is usual to find along and slender
rib-like bone, sometimes composed of two pieces, on each side ; it gives a
firmer implantation to the portion of the myocommata immediately behind
the pectoral fin ; and is obviously the ossified serial homologue of the haenia-
pophysial aponeuroses between the succeeding myocommata. It is usually
detached from its centrum and articulated superiorly to the inner side of the
coracoid : when it rises higher, as in the Batrachus, it becomes attached to
the atlas, and in the Argyreiosus vomer it meets and joins its fellow below,
forming a true inverted or haemal arch, parallel with, but more slender than

the coracoid arch. No other idea of the general homology of this arch pre-

sents itself than as a heemal one, completing the costal arch as an ossified
haemapophysis, differing from the typical vertebra (fig. 15) only by the non-
development of a sternum or haemal spine : and there appears to be as little
ground for hesitation as to the particular segment of the endoskeleton to which
to refer this costal or inverted arch ; its immediate succession to the correspond-
ing arch attached to the occiput, as well as the occasional direct attachment,
indicating that segment to be the atlas or first vertebra of the trunk.

   The best-marked general character of the vertebral column of the trunk in
the class Pisces is that which Professor J. Miiller first pointed out ; viz. the
formation of the haemal arches in the tail by the gradual bending down and
coalescence of the parapophyses ; the exceptions being offered by the ganoid
polypterus and lepidosteus and the protopterous lepidosiren. The pleurapo-
physes are, sometimes, continued in ordinary osseous fishes from the parapo-
physes after the transmutation of these into the hsemal arches. The dory,

tunny, and salmon yield this striking refutation of the idea of the formation
of those arches in all fishes, by displaced, curtailed and approximated ribs. In
some fishes, however {e.g. the cod), reduced pleurapophyses coalesce with the
parapophyses to form the haemal arches of the caudal vertebrae. The meno-
pome, amongst the lowest or perennibranchiate reptiles, yields a clear disproof
of the formation of the haemal arch in the tail by the pleurapophyses (the
parts, viz. called by Geoffroy ' paraux,' and by Dr. Grant ' catavertebral ele-
ments ' in the abdomen of fishes)*. The vertebral ribs or pleurapophyses in
the menopome (fig. 21, pi) are short and simple and suspended to the extre-
mities of the diapophyses (rf) at the beginning of the tail, where they coexist
with haemal arches (h, h) : these must be formed, therefore, by different ele-
ments, which, since no trace of parapophyses exists in any part of the spine,
I conclude to be the ' haemapophyses.' The young crocodile and the adult
enaliosaurs give the same evidence of the nature of the haemal arches in the
tail, with which the corresponding arches or chevron-bones, in cetacea and
many other mammalia, are homologous.

   Thus the contracted hsemal arch in the caudal region of the body may be
formed by different elements of the typical vertebra : e. g. by the parapophyses
(fishes generally) ; by the pleurapophyses (lepidosiren) ; by both parapophy-
ses and pleurapophyses (^Suclis,Lepidosteus), and by haemapophyses, shortened
and directly articulated with the centrums (reptiles and mammals)f . The
caudal vertebrae of some flat-fishes (PleuronectidcR, fig. 16), and the mu-

raenae, would seem to disprove the parapophysial homology of the haemal arches
in such fishes, since transverse processes from the sides of the body coexist
with them, as they do in the cetacea. But, if we trace the vertebral modifi-
cations throughout the entire column in any of these fishes, we shall find that
the haemal arches are actually parts of the transverse processes ; not independ-
ent elements, as in the cetacea ; but due to a progressive bifurcation : this, in

Murana Helena, for example, begins at the end of the transverse processes

of about the twenty-fifth vertebra, the forks diverging as the fissure deepens,

until, at about the seventy-third, the lower fork descends at a right angle to
the upper one (which remains to represent the transverse process), and,
meeting its fellow, forms the haemal arch, and supports the antero-posteriorly
expanded haemal spine. In the plaice a small process is given off from the
expanded base of the descending parapophysis of the first caudal vertebra,
which increases in length in the second, rises upon the side of the body in
the third, becomes distinct from the parapophysis in the fourth, and gradually

diminishes to the ninth or tenth caudal vertebra, when it disappears. These

spurious transverse processes never support ribs.

   The neurapophyses are often directly perforated by the nerves in fishes,
but are sometimes notched by them, or the nerves issue at their interspaces.

   The neurapophyses, which do not advance beyond the cartilaginous stage in
the sturgeon, consist in that fish of two distinct pieces of cartilage; and the an-
terior pleurapophyses also consist of two or more cartilages, set end on end : and
this interesting compound condition is repeated in cases where the pleurapo-
physial element is ossified and required to perform unusual functions in the
bony state in other fishes. Amongst the more special or exceptional modifi-
cations of the vertebrae of the trunk of fishes, which indicate the extent to
which their normal segmental character may be marked, I would cite those
of the anterior vertebrae in the pipe-fishes, in the loaches, and in certain

siluroids.

    In the Fistularia tabaccaria the four anterior vertebrae are much-elongated;
the second one even to eight times the length of the ordinary abdominal ver-
tebrae : and their centrums are firmly interlocked together, by very deeply

indented sutures. The parapophyses are co-extended with the centrums, and
overlap each other, forming a continuous outstanding horizontal ridge on each
side ; and the neural spines form a similar vertical continuous crest.

    In the Cobitis fossilis and C. barbatula the par- and pleur-apophyses of
the second and third vertebrae coalesce and swell out into a large ' bulla ossea
on each side, inclosing the small air-bladder of these fishes : they also lodge
the little ossicles which bring this vertebral tympanum into communication
with the prolongations or atria of the labyrinth *.

    In a large South American siluroid fish, I found the fore-part of the verte-
bral column of the trunk apparently formed by one large vertebra, the body of
which sent a broad triangular plate outwards on each side, giving it a rhom-
boidal figure, viewed from below: these plates in this fish support and coalesce
with five parapophyses, which ascend and increase in breadth as they approach
the skull, where they join the paroccipitals, as they are, themselves, joined to-
gether so as to form a continuous broad oblique outstanding plate of bone.
Above these, the continuous bony neural arch is perforated for the exit of five
pairs of nerves ; the dorsal and ventral roots escaping separately, as in the
sacrum of birds. The coalesced neural spines send up a lofty pointed plate

to the overhanging supraoccipital. On vertically bisecting this specimen, I

found the central parts of the bodies of five vertebrae, which had been deve-
loped in the notochord, distinctly marked out, and preserving in their an-
terior and posterior deep concavities the persistent gelatinous remains of the
notochord; although the rest of the circumference of such centrums were
anchylosed to the cortical or peripheral parts developed from the capsule of
the notochord, viz. to the continuous expanded plate of bone below, to the
parapophyses laterally, and to the neurapophyses above. The body of the
first vertebra, or atlas, presented the exception of being quite detached from
its elevated parapophyses, as well as from its neural arch ; it was anchylosed
only to the bony plate below. The body of the second vertebra was six times
as long as that of the atlas : yet the apices of the two deep terminal jelly-
filled cones extended to and met in its centre. The bodies of the third and
 fourth vertebrae were elongated, but less so than that of the axis : the body
 of the fifth vertebra was singularly modified; its anterior half presenting the
 long and slender character of the antecedent vertebrae ; whilst the posterior
 half was suddenly shortened, but extended in depth and breadth so as to
 adapt its shallow posterior concavity to that of the short and broad body of
 the first free vertebra of the trunk, which is followed by others of similar
 character. I have seen few better instances of adherence to type, irrespective
 of obvious function, than the persistence of the biconcave articular cavities,
 with the elastic capsules and contained fluid, in the centrums of these five
 rigidly fixed anterior vertebra; of the siluroid fish.

    The continuous bony plate supporting those centrums was perforated
 lengthwise by the aorta, offering another mode of formation of a haemal canal,
 viz. by exogenous ossification in and from the lower part of the outer layer

 of the capsule of the notochord : the carotid haemal canal in the necks of
 birds seems to be similarly formed ; and the neck of the ichthyosaurus derives
 additional strength and fixation from apparently detached developments of
 bone in the lower part of the capsule of the notochord, at the inferior inter-
 space between the occiput and atlas, and at those of two pr three succeeding

 cervical vertebrae f.

   I ain inclined to regard the ' odontoid process ' of the mammalian axis as the
horaologue of one of these subvertebral wedge-bones, or peripheral develop-
ments of the outer layer of the notochordal capsule. It cannot be the pecu-
liarly developed anterior articular epiphysis of the second vertebra, since this
is represented by a distinct centre of ossification between the odontoid process
and the body of that vertebra, according to Professor Miiller's observation

in a foetal foal *.

   The diverging appendages of the haemal arch in the abdominal vertebrae of
fishes present the form of long and slender spines (fig. 17, a a), usually at-
tached to, or near the head of the ribs, and extending upwards, outwards
and backwards, between the dorsal and lateral portions of the muscular
segments, to which they afi"ord a firmer fulcrum or basis of attachment
acting, therefore, as so many pairs of rudimental and concealed limbs. They
are termed the 'obere rippe' by Meckel, and at the fore-part of the abdomen

of the polypterus they are stronger than the pleurapophyses themselves.

As the vertebrae approach the tail these appendages are often transferred

gradually, from the pleurapophysis to the parapophysis, or even to the cen-
trum and neural arch.

    In the air-breathing vertebrata, in which the heart and breathing organs
are transferred backwards to the trunk, the corresponding osseous segments
of the skeleton are in most instances developed to their typical complete-
ness, in order to encompass and protect those organs. The thoracic haemapo-
physes in the crocodiles are partially ossified, and in birds (fig. 15, h, K) com-
pletely so; in which class the haemal spines of the thorax (hs) coalesce together,

become much expanded laterally, and usually develope a median crest down-

wards to increase the surface of attachment for the great muscles of flight.
This speciality is indicated by the name ' sternum ' applied to the confluent
elements in question. The abdominal haemapophyses and spines retain their
primitive aponeurotic condition, though still preserving their characteristic
expansion f. In the crocodiles and enaliosaurs the abdominal haemapophyses
are also ossified; and, in the latter, they manifest the same composite character
which has been noticed in the pleurapophyses of the sturgeon, consisting of
three or more pieces, which overlap each other J. The abdominal haemal
spines, in the Plesiosaurus Hatokinsii, are transversely extended, they are
marked c c in the figure quoted below : the compound haemapophyses them-
selves are marked b b \n the same figure.

   The typical thoracic vertebrae of most birds support diverging appendages
(fig. 15, a, a), either anchylosed or articulated, as in Ihe penguin and apte-
ryx, to the posterior border of the pleurapophysis (/?/). The function of the
appendages in this form of typical vertebra is to connect one haemal arch
with the next in succession, so as to associate the two in action, and to give
firmness and strength to the whole thoracic cage. (A portion of the next
rib so overlapped is shown &i pi, a, fig. 15.)

   With regard to the connections of the pleurapophyses, we have seen that,
in fishes, they may be directly attached to the centrum, or to the ends of the
parapophyses (fig. 17,/>), or they may be quite detached from their proper seg-
ment, and suspended to the haemal arch of an antecedent vertebra, as in the
case of the clavicle or epicoracoid, no. 28. In batrachians, ophidians, and
lacertians, the proximal end of the pleurapophysis is simple, as in fishes,
but is articulated to an exogenous tubercle or transverse process from the

side of the centrum or the base of the neural arch, called 'diapophysis/a di-
stinct part from the autogenous parapophyses in fishes. The anterior verte-
brae of crocodiles have an exogenous inferior transverse process from the side
of the centrum, answering to the 'parapophysis,' as well as an upper transverse
process or ' diapophysis ' developed from the base of the neurapophysis : and
the proximal end of the pleurapophysis bifurcates and articulates with both
transverse processes, circumscribing with them a foramen at the side of the
centrum. The same structure obtains in the cervical and anterior thoracic
vertebrae of birds and mammals: thus the rib {pi) in fig. 15 articulates to the

parapophysis p and the diapophysis d. Very few, however, of the thoracic
ribs in the cetaceans offer this structure ; the first or second may reach the

centrum, but the rest are appended to the ends of the long diapophyses, and
a character of affinity to the saurians is thus manifested. The cervical re-
gion is distinguished by the brevity of the pleurapophyses and the absence
of bony haemapophyses, in saurians, birds, and mammals ; but in the warm-
blooded classes the short floating vertebral ribs soon anchylose to the diapo-
physes and parapophyses, and constitute thereby the ' anterior roots of the
perforated transverse process ' of anthropotomy*. The cervical pleurapo-
physes are indicated diagrammatically at pi, in the neck of the embryo skele-
ton (fig. 25): those of the seventh cervical vertebrae sometimes attain in
the human subject proportions which acquire for them the name of ' ribs.'
The pleurapopliyses retain their moveable articulation in the ninth, and
sometimes the eighth, vertebrae of the elongated neck of the three-toed

sloths f.

  The thoracic or dorsal vertebrae of mammalia are characterized by the free ar-
ticulations of the pleurapophyses (fig. 25, pi) : most of these are much-elon-
gated, and most, if not all, support haemapophyses (ib. h) ; which, in a greater
or less number of the anterior vertebrae, articulate with haemal spines (ib. ^5),
completing the arch : these spines commonly remain distinct, and are called,
some ' sternebers,' others ' manubrium,' and ' xiphoid appendage,' and to-
gether they constitute the ' sternum.' In most mammals the thoracic haema-
pophyses are cartilaginous : they become ossified in Dasypiis, Myrmecoplmga,
the megatherioids and monotrenies. The hinder pleurapophyses, which pro-
gressively diminish in length, also, usually become simply suspended to the
diapophyses : all the ribs are so attached in Balcena longimana, according
to Rudolphi. The lumbar vertebrae, which in some mammals show, in the
fcetal state, distinct rudiments of pleurapophyses more minute than those
in the neck, have them soon anchylosed to the extremities of the diapo-
physes, which are thus elongated; and the vertebra is characterized in anthro-
potomy as ' having no ribs, but simple imperforate transverse processes.' The
haemapophyses of these segments of the skeleton are represented by the
* inscriptiones tendineae' (fig. 25, h") ; they do not advance even to the state
of cartilage, but retain the primitive condition which they presented in the

corresponding part of the trunk in fishes.
    If a vertebra succeeding the lumbar or abdominal ones have its haemal

arch completed, as in the thorax, by pleurapophyses and haemapophyses,
with diverging appendages, forming the * pelvic arch and hind or lower
limbs,' it is called a ' sacrum ' (fig. 28, d', h, a). If two or more vertebrae
anchylose together, without such completion of the typical character, they
likewise are said to form a ' sacrum,' of which an example may be found in

the two or three anterior caudal vertebrae of certain flat-fishes {Pleuro-
nectidcB*), characterized as usual by the simple parapophysiiil haemal arch.
In most air-breathing vertebrates the sacrum is characterized by both modifica-
tions, which are carried out to their extreme in birds : in no other class is so
large a proportion of the vertebral column converted into a ' sacrum ' by
coalescence (e. g. seventeen vertebrae in Struthio) : in none is the diverging
appendage developed to such enormous proportions (e. g. Apleryx, Zyinornis).
The centrums of the middle sacral vertebrae (fig. 27, c 1-4) are expanded
transversely, but depressed, and converted into horizontal plates : the neur-
apophyses (ib. w 1-4) are lofty, expanded, and arch over the dilated part of
the neural canal, lodging the great sacral enlargement of the myelon, with
its ventricle. In the young ostrich, before the general anchylosis is completed,
the bases of these neurapophyses are found to cross the interspaces of the
centrums, and to rest equally upon two of those elements. This modifica-
tion was retained throughout life, unobliterated by anchylosis, in the sacrum
of the extinct dinosaurs {Igiuinodo?i, 3Jegalosaurus, Hgleeosaurus), and it
obtains in the dorsal vertebra of the chelonians. The adjoining portions
of the centrums and neurapophysis extend outwards into a short parapo-
physis, which affords an articular surface of three facets for the short pleur-
apophysis. One of these elements is figured in situ at pi, fig. 27 ; it expands
at its distal end, and coalesces there with the contiguous pleurapophyses :
the long diapophyses (c?, d) abut against the inner side, and the ilium applies
Itself to the outer side of these expanded and anchylosed ends of the short
sacral ribs. The spinous processes of the sacral vertebrae (s, s) are developed
antero-posteriorly, and soon coalesce into a lofty longitudinal crest of bone.
In the chelonians, the dorsal spines develope horizontal plates from their ex-
tremities, which unite by suture to the similarly united and expanded pleura-
pophyses, forming with them the ' carapace.' The ' plastron ' is formed of
the flattened and expanded haemal spines, which are divided in the middle
line, and have an intercalated bone (entosternal) between the halves of the
central pieces. Professor Miiller has noticed the sacral pleurapophyses in
the human and other mammalian embryos f-

    As the segments of the endo-skeleton approach the end of the tail, in the
air-breathing vertebrates, they are usually progressively simplified ; first by
the diminution, coalescence and final loss of the pleurapophyses ; next by the
similar diminution and final removal of the haemal and neural arches ; and

sometimes also by the coalescence of the remaining central elements, either
 into a long osseous style, as in the anourous batrachia, or into a shorter
flattened disc "which has the shape of a ploughshare i," as in many birds.
The coalesced representative of the terminal vertebral centrums is developed

 principally from the outer layer of the fibrous capsule of the primitive noto-
 chord. In fishes, however, the seat of the terminal degradation of the verte-
bral column is first and chiefly in the central elements, which, in the homo-
 cereals з, are commonly blended together and shortened by absorption, whilst
 both neural and haemal arches remain, with increased vertical extent, and
indicate the number of the metamorphosed or obliterated centrums.

  --Summary of modifications of corporal vertebrcB. To sum up the kind and

 degree of modification to which the several elements of the primary segments
of the endoskeleton of the trunk are subject, without masking their general
homology, we may commence with the centrum; and first, as to its existence.
It is wanting, as an ossified part, in the atlas of the wombat and koala*, in
which it remains permanently cartilaginous : in the petaurists, kangaroos,
and potoroos, ossification extends from the bases of the neurapophyses into
this cartilage, but the neural arch or ring long remains interrupted h\ a me-

dian fissure below. In man the rudimental body of the atlas is sometimes
ossified from two or even three distinct centres t- The centrums at the oppo-
site extremity of the vertebral column in homocercal fishes are rendered by
centripetal shortening and bony confluence fewer in number than the per-
sistent neural and haemal arches of that part. The centrums do not pass
beyond the primitive stage of the notochord in the existing lepidosiren, and
retained the like rudimental state in every fish whose remains have been found
in strata earlier than the permian oera in Geology, though the number of
vertebrae is frequently indicated in Devonian and Silurian ichthyolites by the
fossilized neur- and haem-apophyses and their spines J. The individuality of

the centrums is sometimes lost by their mutual coalescence without short-

ening.

   Although the normal form of the centrum is cylindrical, it may be cubical,

conical, hour-glass shaped, like a longitudinal bar, like a transverse bar, like

a depressed or a compressed plate, like a ploughshare, &c. The co-adapted
terminal surfaces of the centrum may be flat, slightly concave, deeply con-
cave, cupped or conical, concave vertically and convex transversely at one
end and the reverse at the other endз ; or the fore-end may be concave and
the hind-end convex|| ; or the reverse^ ; or both ends may be convex**;
or both ends produced into long pointed processes with intervening deep fis-
sures, so as to interlock together by a deeply dentated sutural surfacett╗

   The centrum may be quite detached from its neural arch (atlas of siluroid
and many fishes), and from its haemal arch (atlas of most fishes).

   The centrum may develope not only parapophyses but inferior median

exogenous processes, either single, like those of the cervicAl vertebrae of
saurians and ophidians (which in Deirodon scaber perforate the oesophagus,
are capped by dentine, and serve as teeth XX) ; or double (atlas of Sudis gigas^^

and the lower cervical vertebrae of many birds) ; or the fibrous sheath of the
notochord may develope a continuous plate of bone beneath two or more nuclei
of centrums, formed by independent ossification in the body of the notochord ;
these nuclei being partially coherent to the peripheral or cortical plate. The
vertebral centrum often shows the principle of vegetative repetition by its
partial ossification in the form of two or three bony rings, which answer to a
single neural arch (^Hepta7ichus\\\\), or by three osseous discs, one for each

articular surface, and a thicker intermediate piece, as in all foetal mammals,

and throughout life in some cetaceans.

With respect to function, the centrum forms the axis of the vertebral

column, and commonly the central bond of union of the peripheral elements

of the vertebra : as a general rule it supports, either immediately or through

the medium of the approximated or conjoined bases of the neurapophyses,
the neural axis (in the trunk called myelon, or spinal marrow, and its mem-
branes) ; the terminal centrums being usually deprived of this function by

the witlidrawal of that axis from them in the course of its centripetal or con-

centrative movement.

The neurapophyses are more constant as osseous or cartilaginous elements

of the vertebrae than the centrums ; but they are absent, under both histolo-

gical conditions, at the end of the tail in most air-breathing vertebrates, where

the segments are reduced to their central elements. The neurapophyses lose

their primitive individuality by various kinds and degrees of confluence ; as

e. g. first, of the bases of each pair with their supporting centrum ; secondly,

--of the apices of each pair with one another and with the neural spine, the

lepidosiren affording a rare exception of the persistent individuality of this

element and of each neurapophysis throughout the trunk ; thirdly, of two

or more neural arches with one another, as in the neck of some fishes, cetacea,
and armadillos, and in the sacrum of birds and mammals ; where they also
often coalesce with the pleurapophyses, as they do in the neck of most mam-

mals and birds. The neurapophyses rarely depart from the form of plates,

either broad or high, or both ; sometimes they are straight, sometimes arched,
sometimes bent ; sometimes by the inward extension of their bases, they form
together a bony ring above the centrum, excluding both that and the spine

from the neural canal. The neurapophyses may develope, as exogenous pro-

cesses, either diapophyses or zygapophyses, and the latter are sometimes

double from both the anterior and posterior borders of the plates ; as e. g. in
the vertebrae of Mugil, in some serpents, and in the lumbar vertebrae of some

mammals. The observed extent of variation of position of the neurapophyses

is from the upper surface of their own centrum to above the next intervertebral

space, so as to rest equally on two centrums ; or they may be uplifted bodily

from their centrum, and wedged or suspended between the two contiguous

neural arches, as e. g. in the atlas of ephippus and other deep-bodied fishes.

   Except in the cartilaginous neurapophyses of the sturgeon, I am not aware

of any instance of the subdivision of this element into two pieces, placed

vertically upon each other. Some plagiostomes show the principle of vegetative

repetition in two or three star-like centres of ossification, side by side, in the

primitive basis of the neurapophysis, but the second of the two cartilaginous

plates on each side of the neural canal, coextensive with the single centrum,

in most sharks, which second piece has the form of a wedge with the small

end directed down over the intervertebral space, seems to answer, as Prof.

Miiller has suggested, to the intercalary or interneural piece in bony fishes.

The most constant functional relation of the neurapophysis is to protect

the spinal nerve in its exit from the spinal canal, either by a direct perfora-

tion of the neurapophysis (many fishes, and some mammals), by a notch in

the margin, or by the interspace between two neurapophyses. This function

alone is performed, in reference to the nervous system, at the posterior part

of the vertebral column in many animals, where the place of the shortened

myelon is occupied by the lengthened roots of the nerves : in the rest of the
trunk the neurapophyses protect also the neural axis. The original relation

of each neurapophysis to the segments of that axis is determined by the place

of connection of the perforating nerve with the shortened myelon.

266 REPORT-- 1846.

   The neural spine commonly retains in the trunk the form indicated by its
name ; but in the atlas of the crocodile, where it is distinct froui the neur-
apophyses, it is a depressed plate. In the thorax and abdomen of chelonians
it becomes sHll more expanded and flattened, and its borders unite by dentated
suture to contiguous spines and to the similarly expanded pleurapophyses.
The neural spine is absent in the thin annular cervicals of the mole ; it is
unusually developed and forms a thick square columnar mass of bone in the
cervicals of the opossum. It is double in the anterior vertebrae of some

fishes : in the barbel one stands before the other ; in the tetrodon they
stand side by side : and various other minor modifications of this peripheral
element might be cited.

    The parapophyses of the trunk-vertebrae manifest their autogenous cha-
racter in fishes alone ; and in most species the character is soon lost, the par-
apophyses becoming confluent with the centrum ; and, in the tail, either with
the pleurapophyses also, or with each other and the haemal spine, thus comple-
ting the haemal canal (fig. 16). Amongst air-breathing vertebrates the par-
 apophyses of the trunk-segments are present only in those species in which
 the septum of the heart's ventricles is complete and imperforate, and here
 they are exogenous and confined to the cervical and anterior thoracic vertebrse,
or to the sacrum (as in the ostrich, figs. 15 and 27, p). The parapophyses are
 subject to a certain extent of variation as to form : they are either mere
tubercles; or simple, shorter or longer, transverse processes ; or they may take
 the form of long plicated laminae (in the tails of some pleuronectidae): they
 are longer and broader than the pleurapophyses in the cod-tribe ; and are
 sometimes much expanded in the anterior vertebrae of fishes, where they
 ascend in position, and in the siluroid species above described, coalesce to
 ibrm a broad outstanding ridge, directed outwards and a little upwards, and
 rising as they approach the cranium, where they are joined by close suture to

 the paroccipitals.

    The normal function of the parapophyses is to give attachment to muscles
 and articulation to ribs, and, occasionally, additional strength and fixation to
 anchylosed portions of the vertebral column. As a rare and exceptional in-
 stance, the expanded and excavated parapophyses of the second and third
 vertebrae in the genus Cobitis perform an office closely analogous to one of
 those of the mastoid in man, since they inclose air-cells brought into com-
 munication with the acoustic labyrinth by a chain of small ossicles : and these
 singularly modified rudiments of the swim-bladder seem to have no other func-

 tion in the groveling loaches than that in connection with the sense of hearing.

     The pleurapophyses are less constant elements than the neurapophyses
 they exist as free appendages or ' floating vertebral ribs ' in the trunk, and
 sometimes at the fore-part of the tail, in fishes, serpents, and certain batra-
 chians (fig. 28, pi). The atlas has its pleurapophyses in most fishes, but they
 are often detached from their centrum, and sometimes joined to long bony
 haemapophyses, as is well-seen in the Argyreiosus, and other deep-bodied
 scomberoids. Ossified haemapophyses are not present in any other vertebrae

 of the trunk in fishes. In batrachians the pleurapophyses of the single pelvic
 vertebra are similarly connected with haemapophyses, and the costal arch is
 there completed. In the menopome, the pleurapophysial element of the sacrum,

 ib.pl', is ossified from two centres. Such typical vertebrae are more common
 in the higher air-breathing classes. Here the pleurapophyses have generally
 the long and slender form understood by the word ' rib ;' but they expand into

  broad plates in the thorax of the apteryx, in the anterior thoracic vertebra of
  whales, and more especially in the carapace of chelonians, where they are
 joined to each other by suture, and also to the expanded neural spines. These.

broad pleurapophyses are occasionally ossified from two centres in the great
land-tortoises of India and the Galapagos isles. The free extremities of the
short cervical pleurapophyses of crocodiles and plesiosaurs are expanded and
produced forwards and backwards, like axe-blades, whence the name of
' hatchet-bones,' applied to them prior to the recognition of their true homo-

logy.

   The pleurapophyses are appended sometimes simply to the ends of par-
apophyses ; sometimes to the ends of diapophyses; sometimes by a head and

tubercle to both kinds of transverse processes ; sometimes directly to the
side of the centrum; and sometimes they are shifted backwards over the in-
tervertebral space, and are articulated equally to two centrums ("human
thorax), and sometimes to two centrums, to a neurapophysis and to a long
diapophysis, as in the sacrum of the ostrich (fig. 27, pi). In the atlas of
some fishes the pleurapophysis is detached from its centrum, and is suspended,
with its haemapophysis, from the antecedent haemal arch (scapulo-coracoid).
In some sturgeons the abdominal pleurapophyses are composed of two or
more cartilaginous pieces. I have observed some of the expanded pleurapo-
physes in the great Testvdo elephantopus ossified from two centres, and the

resulting divisions continuing distinct but united by suture. The pelvic
pleurapophysis is in two pieces, as a general rule (fig. 28, pV attached to
D') ; and the lower piece is the seat of that most common and simple kind
of modification, viz. increase of size with change of form from the cylindrical
to a flat bone (as indicated by the dotted line in fig. 27), whereby it comes

into connection with the pleurapophyses of other vertebrae besides the proxi-

mal piece of its own ; such pleurapophyses having their development stunted

so as not to exceed in size the proximal portion of the pelvic pleurapophysis,
whose expanded distal portion (ea) receives the special name of ' ilium.' This
bone retains its rib-like shape however in the chelonians, as in the batrachians:
in most species it unites below with two haemapophyses, called, on account

of their modifications of form and proportions, 'ischium ' and ' pubis.* The

pleurapophyses defend the haemal or visceral cavity ; they are the fulcra of
the moving powers which expand and contract such cavity in respiration,
when its walls admit of those movements ; they frequently support ' diverging
appendages,' and give origin to muscles moving such appendages, or acting
upon the vertebral column. In some exceptional cases the pleurapophyses

become, themselves, locomotive organs, as in serpents and the Draco volans.
   The hamapophyses, as osseous elements of a vertebra, are less constant than

the pleurapophyses ; although they sometimes exist in segments, e. g, the
lumbar vertebrae of certain saurians, and in the case of the ischium, or second
pelvic haemapophysis, in which the corresponding pleurapophyses are absent,
or short, or anchylosed to the transverse processes. The only true bony
haemapophyses in the trunk of fishes appear to be those of the atlas, forming
the lower piece of the epicoracoid ; and of the last (?) abdominal vertebra,
forming the ischial or pubic inverted arch supporting the appendages called
' ventral fins.' It is at least to the last abdominal vertebra solely that the

homologous arch and appendages are connected, by the medium of the
pleurapophyses (iliac bones) in the batrachians, and it needs but the removal
of the pleurapophysis, or of its second complementary portion {jpV in fig.
28), to reduce that vertebral segment to the condition which it presents in an
abdominal fish. The so liberated inferior (haemapophysial) portion of the

pelvic (last abdominal costal) arch is subject, in fishes, to changes of position
far more extensive than have been observed in the neurapophyses or pleur-
apophyses of the trunk-vertebrae, without however preventing the recognition
of the segment to which such shifted haemapophyses actually and essentially

belong. The homologous haemal arch exists in the same free and detached
condition in cetaceans and enaliosaurs ; but in all other air-breathing verte-
brates it is connected with the iliac bones and completes the typical character
of the proper sacral vertebra. The bony haemapophyses of the lumbar vertebrae
are found suspended in the fleshy abdominal walls of certain saurians : but in
the region of the thorax in these and higher vertebrates, the haemapophysis
(fig 15, h) articulates by one end to the pleurapophysis (pi) and by the
other to the haemal spine (sternal bone, hs) ; or its lower end is attached to a
contiguous haemapophysis ; or it is suspended freely from the pleurapophyses
(as in the ' floating ribs ' of man and mammals), or it may be joined below
to the sternum, and have its upper end free, as in the seventh dorsal vertebra

of the Ciconia Argala. When the upper end of the haemapophysis articulates

with the pleurapophysis in birds, it is usually by a distiuct condyloid joint,
with smooth articular cartilage and a synovial capsule.

   Where haemapophyses exist in the tail, they articulate directly to the
under part of the centrum, or to two centrums at the intervertebral space ;
and are either free at the opposite end, as in some caudal vertebrae of ser-
pents and in those of the enaliosaurs, or they are confluent with each other
at their distal ends ; when each pair of haemapophyses forms the so-called
V-shaped or chevron-bone. The changes of position of that detached ' pubic
arch ' or ' chevron-bone ' which supports the ventral fins in fishes afforded

Linnaeus the characters of the orders ' Abdominales,' ' Thoracici,' and
'Jugulares' in the ' Systema Naturae '; and its immortal author, in giving the
name ' Apodes ' to those fishes in which the ventral fins were absent, con-
cisely indicates his perception of their relation to the hind-legs of batrachia
and the lower limbs of man. If, then, mere change of relative position,
however extensive, failed to conceal the special homology of the detached por-
tion of the pelvic arch and its appendages from the keen-sighted naturalist,
still less ought such a character to blind the philosophic anatomist to the
general homology of such detached vertebral elements, or prevent his tracing

them, wherever he may find them, to the remainder of their proper segment;
especially when its place is so clearly and beautifully indicated, as it is by the

condition of the pelvic arch in the perennibranchiate reptiles (fig. 28).

    The function of the haemapophyses is to complete, with or without a haemal
spine, the haemal arch of the vertebral segment ; and, in so far to protect the
haemal or visceral cavities and support their contents. They give attachment
to the lower or ventral portions of the primary muscular segments ' myo-
commata'*, called ' intercostals' in the thorax, and 'recti abdominis' in the
abdomen of the higher vertebrata; and they thus serve as fulcra to the
muscles that expand and contract the abdominal or thoracic-abdominal cavity
and sometimes more directly aid in these movements by the elasticity resulting
from an arrest in their histological development at the cartilaginous stage, e.g.
in the thorax of most mammals. Haemapophyses may support or aid in sup-
porting diverging appendages ; and in giving attachment to the muscles of
those appendages. The haemapophyses are usually slender, longer, or shorter
simple bones ; but are broad and flat, overlapping each other in the thorax
of monotremes : they become broader and shorter in the expanded and fixed
thoracic abdominal bony case of chelonians, and are still broader where they
close the pelvic arch in the plesiosaurs. In the abdominal region of these ex-
tinct saurians and in crocodiles, the freely suspended haemapophyses are com-
pounded of two or more overlapping bony pieces.

ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  269

    The JuBmal spine is much less constant as to its existence, and is subject
to a much greater range of variety, when present, than is its vertical homo-

type above, which completes the neural arch. Long, slender, and ' spinous '
in the tail, the haemal spine is reduced to a short and thick bone, often
flattened, in the thorax of mammals, a series of thirteen such modified spines
forming the so-called ' sternum ' in the two-toed sloth : the thoracic haemal
spines are few in number, and are expanded and perforated in the whales
the horizontal extension of this vertebral element is sometimes accompanied
by a median division, or in other words, it is ossified from two lateral centres

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

this is seen in the development of parts of the human sternum : the same vege-

tative character is constant in the broader thoracic haemal spines of birds
though, sometimes, as e. g. in the struthionidae, ossification extends from the
same lateral centre lengthwise, i. e. forwards and backwards, calcifying the
connate cartilaginous homologues of halves of four or five haemal spines,
before these finally coalesce with their fellows at the median line. In some
other birds, however, there are two or more lateral centres, and usually,
also, a median one, from which the ossification of the keel extends down-
wards, prior to its confluence with the rest of the ' sternum.' In the thorax
of chelonians four haemal spines are established, each by two lateral centres
of ossification, forming four pairs of sternal bones with a ninth 'entosternal'

piece between the first and second pairs. The ' plastron ' is the result of

--this extreme development of the haemal spines : the modified moieties of

which, remaining permanently distinct and united by suture, have received
from Geoff"roy St. Hilaire* the convenient special names of ' episternals,'
╖ hyosternals,' ' hyposternals ' and ' xiphisternal?,' respectively, as they suc-
ceed each other from before backwards.

   The diverging appendages are, as might be expected, of all the elements
of the vertebral segment, the least constant in regard to their existence, and
the subjects of the greatest amount and variety of modification. Simple
slender spines or styles in fishes (fig. 17, aa^, simple plates retaining long

their cartilaginous condition in crocodiles, short flat slightly curved pieces in
birds (fig. 15, a a), in some of the lowest species of which, e. g. Aptenodytes,
they become expanded, like their homologues in the crocodile ; such, with
one exception, is the range of the variety of form to which these parts are
subject in the segments of the trunk. Bat that exception is a remarkable
one : even under its normal ichthyic condition, as a simple style or filament,
the diverging appendage of the insulated haemapophysial portion of the pelvic

arch in theprotopterusf and lepidosiren| is composed of many cartilaginous
segments, and projects freely from the surface, carrying with it a smooth

covering of integument. In other fishes similar filaments or jointed rays are
progressively added to the sustaining arch, which cause a progressive expan-

sion of the common investing fold of skin, forming the organ called the
' ventral fin,' which is accordingly described by the ichthyologist as having
two rays (^Blennius), three rays (^Zoarces), up to more than twenty rays, (as

Acipenser in the sturgeons).

   When we quit the piscine class we find the diverging appendage of the pel-

phique, p. 69. pi. 2, fig. 21. Here Geoffrey contends that the parts of the hyoid arch (39,
40 and 43) are the homologues of the modified haemal spines which he calls episternals, hyo-
sternals and hyposternals in the plastron of the turtle : but these names may well be retained,
that of ' hyosternal ' being used in an arbitrary sense, without reference to the hypothesis
which first suggested it.

vie arch resuming its primitive unity, and with fewer joints than in lepidosiren,
but manifesting the principle of vegetative repetition by a bifurcation of the
distal segments. Such is its form in the Proteus anguinus and in the Amphi-
titna didactylum : in another species of amphiume, the radiated type is more
strongly marked by the subdivision of the last segment into three rays, the
homology of which with certain of the five terminal rays, called toes or
digits in the human foot, is signified by Cuvier's specific name ' tridactylum'
applied to this species ; the middle segment of the appendage is bifid, the

first one is undivided. In the menopome (fig. 28), the proximal segment
(es) is likewise single, the second segment (ee, 6?) double, and a mass of carti-
lage (es) separates this from the last segment which branches into five jointed
rays (m). In the frog two styliform bones are developed in the position of

the cartilage (es in fig. 27), forming a fourth segment of the division : they
are replaced by more numerous and shorter bones in higher vertebrates, in
which it will be unnecessary to pursue the metamorphoses of the appendage
as it is adapted for swimming, steering, balancing and anchoring, for explora-
tion, for burrowing, creeping, walking and running, for leaping, seizing,
climbing, or sustaining erect the entire frame of the animal. Its parts under
these endless and extreme modifications have necessarily received special
names : the first segment (es) is the ih'\gh, femur \ the second is the leg, and
its two rays or bones are called tibia (ee) and fibula (ez) : the segment (es)
is called ankle or tarsus, each of its component ossicles having its proper
name ; and the last radiated segment (eo) includes the metatarsus and pha-
langes : the segments es and 09 ai-e termed collectively, the foot, j9es*.

   The primitive function of the simple diverging appendages (fig. 17> a, a)
of the abdominal vertebrae in fishes is closely analogous to that of the more
developed appendage of the pelvic vertebra, viz. to aid in locomotion, as
fulcra to the muscles concerned in that act. In crocodiles and birds they

serve to connect one costal arch with the next arch in succession, associating
them in action or giving fixity and strength to the whole thoracic cage.

   Any given appendage might, however, have been the seat of such develop-

ments as convert that of the pelvic arch into a locomotive limb : and the true
insight into the general homology of limbs leads us to recognise many poten-
tial pairs in the typical endo-skeleton. The possible and conceivable modi-
fications of the vertebrate archetype are far from having been exhausted in
the forms that have hitherto been recognised, from the primaeval fishes of
the palaeozoic ocean of this planet up to the present time.

   The beneficent Author of all, who has created other revolving orbs, with
relations to the central source of heat and light like our own, may have willed

that these also should be the seat of sentient beings, suited to all the condi-
tions of animal enjoyment existing in such planets ; basking, perhaps, in the
solar beams by day, or disporting in the soft reflected light of their earth's

satellites by night. The eyes of such creatures, the laws of light being the
same, would doubtless be organized on the same dioptric principles as ours
and, if the vertebral column should there, as here, have been adopted as the
basis of the higher animal forms, it may be subject to modifications issuing
in forms such as this planet has never witnessed, and which can only be con-
ceived by him who has penetrated the mystery of the vertebrate archetype,
and recognised the kind and mode and extent of its modifications here.

   It is, for example, by no means essential to that organic type that it should
be 'tetrapodal' : although it best accords with the force of attraction and other

conditions of our globe, that not more than two pairs of the latent limbs or
appendages of the vertebral segments should be developed to react, as loco-
motive instruments, upon its waters, its atmosphere and its dry land.

    The views of the essential relations of such limbs to the vertebrate type
which suggest these and similar reflections, may not be accepted by all anato-
mists : some may be disposed to regard the parts 62 and 64 in fig. 28 as pecu-
liar superadditions, rather than a reappearance of normal elements completing
the costal or haemal arch of a segment of the endo-skeleton and restoring it
to its typical condition : and, in the same spirit, they may deny the special
homology of the radiated appendage A, with the hinder filamentous fin of
the lepidosiren, and the ventral fins of other fishes, and consequently, will re-
pudiate its general homology as the diverging appendage of such haemal
arch, and its serial homology witii the simple diverging appendages of thfe
thoracic-abdominal vertebrae of fishes, crocodiles and birds.

   I am sensible how large a demand is made on the most philosophic faith iri

general laws of organization, by seeking acquiescence in the view of the parts
of the hind-limb, so variously and definitely modified for special functions, as
having for their seat the homologues of segments and rays, which are the

result in the first instance of the common course of vegetative repetition of a

--single vertebral element an element under all circumstances compounded

teleogically, and, therefore, essentially one bone.
- But here I must explain what I mean by ' teleological composition.' Indi-^

-- --vidual parts of a skeleton, what are commonly called ' bones,' are fre-

quently ' compound ' or composed of the coalescence of several primarily
distinct osseous pieces. In human anatomy every single and distinct masiS

of osseous matter entering into the composition of the adult skeleton is called

' a bone' ; and Soemmerring, who includes the thirty-two teeth in his enumera-
tion, reckons up from 259 to 264 such bones. He counts the os spheno-

occipitale as a single bone, and also regards, with previous anthropotomists,

the OS temporis, the os sacrum, and the os innominatum, as individual bones

the sternum, he says, may include two or three bones, &c*. But in birds

the OS occipitale is not only anchylosed to the sphenoid, but they both very
soon coalesce with the parietals and frontals ; and, in short, the entire cranium

proper consists, according to the above definition, of a single bone. Blu-
menbach, however, applying the human standard, describes it as composed
of the proper bones of the cranium consolidated, as it were, into a single

piecef. And in the same spirit most modern anthropotomists, influenced by

the comparatively late period at which the sphenoid becomes anchylosed to
the occipital in man, regard them as two essentially distinct bones. In direct-
ing our survey downwards in the mammalian scale, we speedily meet with
examples of persistent divisions of bones which are single in man. Thus it

is rare to find the basioccipital confluent with the basisphenoid in mamma-
lian quadrupeds ; and before we quit that class we meet with adults in some

of the marsupial and monotrematous species, for example, in which the supra-
occipital, ' pars occipitalis proprie sic dicta,' of Soemmerring, is distinct from
the condyloid parts, and these from the basilar or cuneiform process of the

OS occipitis : in short, the single occipital bone in man is four bones in the
opossum or echidna ; and just as the human cranial bones lose their indivi-

duality in the bird, so do those of the marsupial lose their individuality in the
ordinary mammalian and human skull. In many mammals we find th6
pterygoid processes of anthropotomy permanently distinct bones ; even in

birds, where the progress of ossific confluence is so general and rapid, the
pterygoids and tympanies, which are subordinate processes of other bones in
man, are always independent bones.

   In many mammals, the styloid, the auditory, the petrous, and the mastoid
processes remain distinct from the squamous plate of the temporal, through-
out life ; and some of these claim the more to be regarded as distinct bones,

since they obviously belong to different natural groups of bones in the skeleton
as the styloid process, for example, to the series of bones forming the hyoi-

dean arch.

    The artificial character of that view of the os sacrum, in which this more

or less confluent congeries of modified neural arches is counted as a single

component bone of the skeleton, is sufliciently obvious. The os innominatum
is represented throughout life in most reptiles by three distinct bones, answer-
ing to the iliac, ischial, and pubic portions inr anthropotomy. The sternum
in most quadrupeds consists of one more bone than the number of pairs of
ribs which join it ; thus it includes as many as thirteen distinct bones in the

 Bradypiis didactylus.

    The arbitrary character of the definition of a bone, as ' any single piece of
 osseous matter entering into the composition of the adult skeleton,' the com-
plex nature of many of such single bones, and the essential individuality of
some of the processes of bone in anthropotomy, are taught by anatomy, pro-
 perly so called, which reveals the true natural groups of bones, and the modi-
 fications of these which peculiarly characterise the human subject.

    It will occur to those who have studied human osteogeny, that the parts of
 the single bones of anthropotomy which have been adduced as continuing
 permanently distinct in lower animals, are originally distinct in the human

 foetus : the occipital bone, for example, is ossified from four separate centres;
 the pterygoid processes have distinct centres of ossification ; the styloid, and
 the mastoid processes, and the tympanic ring, are separate parts in the foetus.
 The constituent vertebrae of the sacrum remain longer distinct ; and the ilium,
 ischium, and pubes are still later in anchylosing together, to form the ' name-

 less bone.'

     These and the like correspondences between the points of ossification of
 the human foetal skeleton, and the separate bones of the adult skeletons of
 inferior animals, are pregnant with interest, and rank among the most stri-

 king illustrations of unity of plan in the vertebrate organization.

     The multiplication of centres from which the ossification of an ultimately
 single bone often proceeds has especially attracted the attention of the philo-

  sophical anatomists of the present century with reference to the right or

 natural determination of the number of the constituent parts of the verte-
 brate skeleton. Geoff'roy St. Hilaire, in his memoir on the skull of birds, in
  1807, says, " Ayant imagine de compter autant d'os qu'il y a de centres d'os-
 sification distincts, et ayant essaye de suite cette maniere de faire, j'ai eu
 lieu d'apprecier la justesse de cette idee*." Cuvier adopted and retained
 the same idea to the last. Commenting in the posthumous edition of the
  ' Lemons d' Anatomic Compareef ' on the character of some of the defini-
  tions of single bones in anthropotomy, he, also, concludes that, in order to
 ascertain the true number of bones in each species, we must descend to the
  primitive osseous centres as tiiey are manifested in the foetus. But according
  to this rule we should count the humerus as three bones and the femur as four

bones, in the human skeleton ; for the ossification of the thigh-bone begins at

four distinct points, one for the shaft, one for the head, one for the great
trochanter, and one for the distal condyles : such deference, however, to the
judgment of the great Comparative Anatomist has been withheld by the most
devoted of his admirers ; whose disinclination to regard these parts and pro-
cesses as distinct bones is justified by the fact that in birds and reptiles the
femur is developed from a single centre.

   The rule laid down by the French authorities above-cited fails in its appli-
cation to the diflScult question of the nature and number of bones in a skeleton,

because they did not distinguish between those centres of ossification that
have homological relations, and those that have only teleological ones ; i. e.

between the separate points of ossification of a human bone which typify
vertebral elements, often permanently distinct bones in the lower animals; and

the separate points which, without such signification, facilitate the progress
of osteogeny and have for their obvious final cause the well-being of the grow-

ing animal. The young lamb or foal, for example, can stand on its four legs as
soon as it is born ; it uplifts its body from the ground and soon begins to
run and bound along. The shock to the limbs themselves is broken and
 diminished at this tender age, by the divisions of the long bones, and by the
 interposition of the cushions of cartilage between the diaphyses and epiphy-
ses. And the jar that might affect the pulpy and largely developed brain of
 the immature mammal, is further diffused and intercepted by the epiphysial

 articular extremities of the bodies of the vertebrae.

   We thus readily discern a final purpose in the distinct centres of ossifica-

 tion of the vertebral bodies and the long bones of the limbs of mammals
 which would not apply to the condition of the crawling reptiles. The dimi-
 nutive brain in these low and slow cold-blooded animals does not demand
 such protection against concussion ; neither does the mode of locomotion in
 the quadruped reptiles render such concussion likely : their limbs sprawl out-
 wards and push along the body which commonly sweeps the ground ; there-
 fore we find no epiphyses at the ends of a distinct shaft in the long bones
 of saurians and tortoises. But when the reptile moves by leaps, then the
 principle of ossifying the long bone by distinct centres again prevails, and the

 extremities of the humeri and femora long remain epiphyses in the frog.

   A final purpose is no doubt, also, subserved in most of the separate centres

 of ossification which relate homologically to permanently distinct bones in

 the general vertebrate series ; it has long been recognised in relation to faci-

 litating birth in the human foetus ; but some facts will occur to the osteo-
  genist, of which the teleological explanation is by no means obvious.

    One sees not, for example, why the process of the scapula which gives at-

 tachment to the pectoralis minor, the coraco-brachialis, and the short head of
 the biceps should not be developed by continuous ossification from the body
 of the blade-bone, like that which forms the spinous process of the same

 bone. It is a well-known fact, however, that not only in man, but in all mam-

  mals, the coracoid process is ossified from a separate centre. In the mono-
  tremes it is not only autogenous, but is as large a bone as in birds and reptiles,
 in which it continues a distinct bone throughout life. Here, then, we have

  the homological, without a teleological explanation of the separate centre for

 the coracoid process in the ossification of the human blade-bone.
      This distinction in the nature and relations of such centres is indispen-

  sable in the right application of the facts of osteogeny to the determination
  of the number of essentially distinct bones in any given skeleton.

      All those bones which consist of a coalescence of parts answering to di-

  stinct elements of the typical vertebra are ' homologically compound.'
--274 REPORT 1846.

    All those bones which represent single vertebral elements are * teleologi-
cally compound,' when developed from more than one centre, whether such
centres subsequently coalesce, or remain distinct, or even become the subject
of individual adaptive modifications, with special joints, muscles, &c. for par-

ticular offices.

   In the human skeleton, the clavicles, the (thoracic vertebral) ribs, are in-
stances of simple and truly individual bones. The occiput, sphenoid, eth-

moid, temporal, superior maxilla, mandible, hyoid, scapula, the so-called true
vertebrae, the sacrum and coccyx, the sternum, and ossa innominata are

' homologically ' compound bones.
    The two parietals are essentially like the frontal and vomer, one 'teleologi-

cally ' compound bone : so, likewise, are the two nasals. And, if the view of
the homology of the jointed filamentary skeleton of the rudimental ventral
fin of the lepidosiren with the simple diverging appendages of the costal
arches of the abdominal vertebrae be correct, then is not merely the mam-
malian femur a teleologically compound bone, but the whole skeleton of the
hind-limb from the femur to the distal phalanges inclusive must be regarded

as representing the essentially single vertebral element, here called 'diverging
appendage,' subdivided according to the law of vegetative repetition of centres;

which law is progressively overruled and masked by the supervention of the
higher law of special modification and adaptation of such vegetative subdivi-
sions to the exigences and habits and sphere of life of the species.

   In many animals all the parts of the skeleton of the limbs, and in all ani-
mals some of the parts, are simple bones, in the sense of being developed
from a single centre ; but in none can they claim that essentially individual
character which the clavicles and osseous parts of the ribs are entitled to, as

being primary vertebral elements.

   To trace the mode and kind and extent of modification of the same ele-

mentary parts of the typical segment throughout a large natural series of
highly organized animals, like the vertebrata ; and to be thus led to appreciate
how, without complete departure from the fundamental type, the species are
adapted to their different offices in creation, brings us, as it were, into the
secret counsels that have directed the organizing forces, and is one of the

legitimate courses of inquiry by which we may be permitted to gain an in-
sight into the law which has governed the successive introduction of specific

--forms of living beings into this planet.
     Vertebra: of the Skull. Since it has been found that the bones of the trunk
maintain through every kind and degree of adaptive modification, whether as
' thorax,' ' carapace ' or ' sacrum,' an arrangement into segments in the con-
stitution and relative position of the parts of which the vertebral type has been

--universally recognised let us next examine, without bias, and, if possible,

without reference to or recollection of previous attempts, in the first instance,
whether such type be traceable through the remaining anterior part of the
axis of the endo-skeleton, which, like the thorax and pelvis, has received, on

--account of its degree of coalescence and other modifications, the special col-

lective term of ' skull ;' or, whether nature has, in this part of the endo-ske-
leton, so far departed from the pattern on which all the rest is constructed,
that we cannot, without manifest violence to her arrangements, demonstrate
the segmental composition ; or refer, without admitting modifications distinct
in kind as well as degree from those that mark the vertebral character in the
trunk, the constitution of such segments to the vertebral type.

 --Taking the conical skull of an ordinary osseous fish that of the cod (ilSfor-
--rhua vulgaris) for example, if we detach the bones which form its hinder

extremity, or base, and which immediately precede and join the atlas, from
ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  275

those next in advance, we have the circle, or the base hone (i)and arch
(2, 3, 4), represented in figure 1, and we also bring away, articulated therewith,

an inferior or inverted arch with its appendages, represented in profile outline
in fig. 5, 50-57 : the arrow indicating the course of convergence, and its head
the point of union, of the two flanks or crura, forming the closing point or

crown of such inverted arch.

  We have thus removed a segment of the skull, and with as little or even

less violence or disturbance to the other bones, than must have been used in

detaching a similar segment from the thorax or pelvis of a land-animal. If
we compare this cranial segment with the typical vertebra fig. 14, we recog-
nise in the single median bone (1, fig. I) the centrum, by its relative position
and its articular surface for the atlas, which retains, moreover, the concave
form characteristic of the vertebrae in the piscine class : in the pair of bones
(╖2, 2), which articulate with the upper surface of the centrum, protect the
sides of the epencephalon, and are perforated by the ' nervi vagi,' we have the
neurapophyses : in the single symmetrical bone (3) which completes the
arch, and terminates in a crest for the attachment of the uppermost or dorsal
portions of the vertebral muscles continued from the trunk, we have the neural
spine : and in the pair of bones (4, 4), wedged between this spine and the
neurapophyses, which gi.ve attachment to the inferior arch of the segment

H(fig. 5, i), and terminate in a free crest or spine for the attachment of the

upper and lateral portions of the vertebral muscles, we have the parapo-
pihyses ; for whose elevated position we have been prepared by their gradual
ascent in the anterior vertebrae of the trunk. The rest of this natural segment

has undergone the same kind of modification as the thoracic vertebrae present
in higher animals (fig. 15), and which consists in the great expansion of the
haemal arch, the removal of the hcEtnapophyses (fig. 5, 52) from the centrum
(ib. i),and the interposition of elongated and Ae^ecieA pleurapophyses (50, &\):
finally, the great inverted arch, so formed, encompasses, supports and protects
the heart, or centre of the haemal axis. The elements of this arch are open
to two interpretations according to the type of figure 15 : either 50 may be
pi, 5\, h and 5%hs; or 50 and 51 may be a divided (teleologically compound)
pleurapophysis, and 52 an unusually developed haemapophysis : and this latter

conclusion is more agreeable with the character of the vertebral segments of

the trunk in fishes, in which the haemal spines are absent, the haemapophyses,

:when ossified, long and sometimes joined together at their lower ends, ase. g^
 in the first trunk- vertebra of Argyreiosus vomer, and the pleurapophyses some-
times, as e. g. in the sturgeon, composed of two or more pieces, set end to
лnd. The condition of the pleurapophysis of the pelvic arch in the meno-

pome (fig. 28, 62, pi), which sustains a radiated appendage (ib. A) of the

 haemal arch of the occipital vertebra, indicates the true character of the

 pleurapophysis : and the modifications of this arch in the higher classes will
 be found to establish the accuracy of the general homology of the bone 52,
.with the haemapophysial element, since the lower extremities of 52 are actu-
 ally drawn apart and articulated to a haemal spine, which completes the arch

Hbelow in reptiles and birds (fig. 22, s).

    Even should there be error in assuming the subdivision of the pleurapo-

 physes and the absence of the haemal spine, in the particular determination of

 the constituent elements of the arch in question, yet the alternative is still
 within the recognised limits of the vertebral modifications of the trunk ; and
 the want of unquestionable proof of the precise elements forms no valid ob-
jection to its general homology as a haemal vertebral arch, expanded and modi-

 fied after one or other of the types of those which, in the thorax of the air-
 breathing vertebrates, encompass and protect the more backw;ardly placed
276 REPORT-- 1846.

centres of the vascular system (heart and lungs) ; according to which types,
for example, it may be either closed below by the meeting of the sternal ribs
rhaemapophyses) or by the intervention of a single or divided sternal bone
(haemal spine). And, further, since in fishes, as the lowest class of vertebrata,
the vegetative character of repetition of forms, proportions and composition
in the successive segments of the skeleton prevails in a greater degree than
in any of the higher classes, so we may conclude that this haemal arch pre-
sents, by its articulation with the epencephalic neural arch, its normal position;
and that the whole occipital vertebra here manifests its veritable and typical

character.

   As the haemal arches in the trunk of fishes commonly support diverging
appendages, which project freely outwards and backwards, but are hidden and

buried in the muscular masses to which they give attachment, so the occipital
arch, also, commonly supports its diverging appendages. They are absent
in Gymnothorax and some other MurcBnida. The appendage is present in
the form of a single multiarticulate filament in the eel-like protopterus* and
lepidosirenf ; it is modified by that mode of vegetative repetition which
results in adding to the number of similar filaments directly articulated to
the supporting arch ; and is further complicated by the expansion or conflu-
ence of the proximal joints in different degrees as they recede from the sup-
porting arch, so as to constitute definable segments of the appendage J.

    Such is the condition of the part in most osseous fishes, and such is shown
in the diagram of the base of the appendage in figure 5 ; where the proximal
segment consists of two broad and flat bones (54 and 55), the next segment of
five narrower and shorter but thicker bones (ae), and the last segment of
more numerous bones of the primitive filamentary form and multiarticulate
structure, which bifurcate and radiate as they recede from the centre of at-
tachment.

  We may connect the tendency to extreme and variable development in the

peripheral parts of a vertebral segment, with the freedom which is the neces-
sary consequence of their position : they are attached by one end only, they

have not, therefore, that physical restraint to growth which may arise out of
the fettering by both extremities, which characterizes the more central ver-

tebral elements entering into the composition of the neural and haemal arches.
Even in these we find the disposition to luxuriant growth or vegetative sub-
division greatest in the peripheral elements, viz. the neural and haemal spines :

much more, therefore, might it be expected in the less constant, diverging,
and commonly freely projecting appendages of the vertebral arches. Although

here the polarizing forces which tend to shoot out particle upon particle after
the pattern of dendritic corals, plants or crystals, are so controlled by the
antagonizing principle of adaptation, that the radiating growth is always
checked at that stage and guided to that form which is suited to the wants
and required by the mode of life of the species.

   Since, however, we are able to retain firmly and with certitude our recog-
nition of the special homology of the diverging appendage of the occipital
haemal arch, through all its modifications, from the single ray of the lepidosi-
ren to the hundred-fold repetition of the same elements with superadded
dichotomous bifurcations sustaining the enormous pectoral fins of the
broad and flat plagiostomous fishes thence called 'rays'joar excellence, so
we can retrace, with equal certitude, the serial homology of this appendage,
when it is so plainly manifested by its simple form as well as connections in

the lepidosiren, the amphiuma or the apteryx, with the scarcely more simple

or less-developed appendage of the thoracic abdominal haemal arches (ribs)
of birds and fishes (figs. 15 and 17j л╗ a) ; and thus we are led to determine

its general homology, under its manifold forms of fin, fore-limb, wing, or arm,

as the diverging appendage of the haemal arch of the occipital vertebra.

The natural and typical vertebral segment above-defined cannot bedetached,

in every fish, by the mere disjunction of sutures : in the lepidosiren, e. g. the

ossified part of the centrum has coalesced with that of the next segment in

advance and would require to be divided by the saw : the same coalescence

occurs in the human skull, and has led to the definition of the cranial bone,

called ' OS spheno-occipitale*.' In osseous fishes, either by connation of 5

with 9, fig. 5, or by excessive development of bone in the notochordal capsule

extending forwards from the centrums, and producing 9, there results the long

bone (5, 9) continuing the series of vertebral centrums forwards, and corre-

sponding in position with two segments or arches above. On the hypothesis

that it represents the central elements of both those arches, it must be divided

artificially, in order to separate that segment of the cranium which next suc-

ceeds the occipital one. And, further, either by a similar coalescence of the

proximal elements of two haemal arches, or by the undue extension of such

element of one of the arches, interposing itself between the next arch and

the rest of the vertebra to which that arch belongs, it happens, that unless the

proximal element or elements in question be artificially divided, as at asa, asa,

Hfig. 5, two haemal arches (H 11 and in) would be brought away, with the

neural arch detached by the separation of sutures and the division of the

bone 5, 9. If neither that bone, nor asa v\ere divided, but were, with the

bones in superior connection with them, separated from the bones anteriorly

articulated to them by suture, then we should have the group of bones, in-

N Hcluded by the curved lines marked T^J 11, iii, Hii,      Twoiii in fig, 5.

vertebral segments are plainly indicated in this group by the distinct haemal

H Harches and their appendages, 11 and in ; but three pairs of bones, le, 6

and 10, fig. 5, appear to be in neurapophysial relation with the single and

symmetrical median bone 5, 9. If, however, what has been urged in the

chapter on ' Special Homology' (pp. 188-196) respecting the petrosal cha-
racter of 16 be a true interpretation of that bone, then we must eliminate it

from our present inquiry, inasmuch as being a partial ossification of a sense-

capsule (and nature herself removes them, as such, in most fishes), it apper-

tains to a category of bones (splanchno-skeleton), forming no part of the pro-

per neuro- or endo -skeleton, in which alone we seek for evidence of asegmental

disposition of parts corresponding with the segments of the nervous system.

The bony petrosals (le) being removed, let us, then, with the view of ex-

amining the composition of the segment of the skull with which the occipi-

tal vertebra was articulated, saw across the bones 5, 9 and 23a, and separate

the bones e, r, s from their sutural connections with those in front of them.

In thus obtaining the segment in question, the opponents to the vertebral

theory of the skull are entitled to assert that violence is done to nature by

the sections of the single bones above-cited ; the validity of which as an

objection to that theory will be afterwards inquired into.

   It is not, however, absolutely necessary to divide the basal bone 5, 9 : in
many osseous fishes a symmetrical bone (fig. 5, 9') supports the parial bones

10, and stands in the relation of a centrum to them ; the neural arch or circle
of that segment would not, therefore, be broken by the removal with the

posterior segment of the whole of the bone 5, 9. If the corresponding

development from the under part of the centrum of the second cervical ver-
tebra of the siluroid fish (p. 260) were removed, with that segment, from the
atlas, the atlantal neural arch would still be completed by the rudimental body,
beneath which the ossification from the succeeding vertebrae had extended

itself.

Whether, however, we divide or not the bone 5, 9, those which rest upon

its posterior or basisphenoidal part present, after the removal of the petro-

sals, when viewed from behind, and slightly disarticulated from each other,
the arrangement exhibited in fig. 2. The bones 6, 6 support and defend

the lobe of the third  ventricle or  the  mesencephalic  segment of the brain
                                                                                                                                                        ;

they give exit to the trigeminal nerves (<r), and thus, as well as by their con-

nections with the other bones of the arch, repeat the neurapopki/sial cha.racteTS

of the bones 2, 2 in the occipital segment. The bones s, r, by their more ex-

ternal position, by affording an articular surface to the h^mal arch (ixa,

H 11), and their development of a strong transversely and backwardly pro-

duced process for muscular attachments, obviously repeat the parapophysial

characters of the bones 4, 4 in the occipital vertebra.

   The arch is not completed above in the cod-fish ; the bones 7, 7 being se-

parated at the mesial line by the interposition of the produced spine of the

occipital vertebra h, which joins with 11. In some other fishes, however,

e. g. carp and pike, the bones 7, 7 do come in contact and join each other by

a ' sagittal ' suture, thus completing the neural arch. It will afterwards be

seen, by tracing the homologues of these bones in other animals and their

homotypes in other segments, what value may be assigned to the objection to

their general homology as the crown or haemal spine of the mesencephalic

neural arch, founded upon the median division and occasional divarication of

the two halves of no. 7 in osseous fishes. I may so far anticipate the discus-

sion as to remark that, even in the present group of vertebrates, the spine of

the occipital vertebra (3) is divided by a median suture in the lepidosteus ; so

that the condition of the epencephalic arch in that fish is precisely that of

the mesencephalic arch in the carp, and essentially the same as that in fig. 2,

and in most other osseous fishes.

 HTheremainder of the second or parietal segment of the skull, 11, repeats the

expanded modification of the haemal arch of the occipital vertebra, and even

approaches nearer to the character of the thoracic vertebrae of the higher

animals, by the development of single symmetrical bones at the crown of the

inverted arch. But the principle of vegetative repetition is still more mani-

fested in this arch than in the occipital one. If we regard the posterior half

of the epitympanic, 2sa, as the proximal piece of the parieto-haemal arch,

which has coalesced with the corresponding piece of the fronto-haemal arch,

then the pleurapophysis oi the ySiT'ieto-hdimaX arch will consist, in bony fishes,

of two pieces, 28a and 38, like the pleurapophysis of the occipito- haemal arch,

50 andsi. Thebones, 39 and 40,represent the hcemapophysis of tlie parieto-haemal
arch. The two pairs of small bones (41) with the single median anterior (42)
and posterior (43) appendages, represent a still more subdivided spine or key-

bone of this inverted arch.

Beneath this mask of multiplication of bony centres, the broad characters ╖

of the inverted arch suspended to the parapophyses of the parietal vertebra,

as the haemal complement of that natural segment of the skull, stand boldly

--out: it encompasses, sustains and protects the branchial organs the ana-
--logues of lungs the next great development of the vascular system anterior

to the heart ; and the subdivision of the piers of this expanded arch relates to .

the necessity for a combination of strength, with flexibility and elasticity, in

tlft execution of the movements producing the respiratory currents.

The correspondence with the scapular, or occipito-haemal arch, is further

carried out by the presence oi appendages (44) which freely diverge from it, but

the development of these appendages has not been observed to extend beyond

that second phase, marked by vegetative multiplication of the simple ray,

directly attached to the arch itself. The lepidosiren offers the simplest con-

dition of such ' diverging appendage ' in the single slender bony piece con-

nected with the element 40*. Cuvier and other ichthyologists cite a series

of stages of this kind of development of the hyoidean appendage from a si-

milar  simple  beginning  up  to  a  30-fold  repetition  of  the  single  ray  (Elops)
                                                                                                                ;

and the ' branchiostegal ' rays have been found in much greater numbers in

certain fossil fishes. Like the ' pectoral ' rays, they support a duplicature of

membrane, which plays freely backwards and forwards, reacting upon the

ambient medium, and forming, in short, a cephalic fin, but with its powers

so restricted and adjusted, as to propel the water through the branchial cham-

bers of the fish, instead of driving the fish through the water ; in which latter

action, indeed, the occipital appendages (pectoral fins)in most osseous fishes

can and do perform but a very small share.

  N HIf we next proceed to compare the frontal segment, iii and iii, dis-

membered as above described from the parietal vertebra, and, by the separa-

tion of the sutures, from the bones terminating the skull anteriorly, we shall

find a neural arch (fig. 3) closely repeating the characters of that of the oc-

cipital vertebra. The centrum is sometimes represented simply by the forward

extension of ossification of the basisphenoid (ii), which I regard as the ho-

motype of the ossification of the capsule of the notochord beneath the cen-

trums of the anterior trunk- vertebrae in the silurus ; sometimes, also, of a di-

stinct superincumbent symmetrical ossicle (9', fig. 5), answering to the rudi-

mental (central part of the) body of the atlas supported by the inferior bony

plate, inthesilurus. This more complex condition of the centrum of the frontal

vertebra is well-seen in the sword-fish. The bones 10, 10, which directly rest

upon 9', when it exists, which defend the sides of the prosencephalon, and

which are either grooved by the optic nerves, or have those nerves perforating

the fibro-cartilaginous membrane close to the margin of the bone (10) from
which it is continued, are obviously the neurapophi/ses. They are, however,

small ; inasmuch as the segment of the brain to which they relate is of inferior

size in bony fishes : and they are still smaller in comparison with the spine

(u) which is enormously expanded, in relation to its accessory functions as

the chief contributor to and protector of the orbits. The bones 12, wedged

between the neurapophyses and spine, affording an articular surface to the

proximal piece of the haemal arch, and developing a transverse process for

muscular attachments, are the parapophyses. The bones (ir) have as little

essential connection with the typical neural arch above demonstrated, as the

bones le, le" had with the corresponding arch of the parietal vertebra : and
their more peculiar form in relation to the ball which they protect, and their

variable histological condition in the vertebrate series, have not only prevented

        their ever being mistaken for parts of cranial vertebrae, but have led to the

Iopposite extreme of excluding them altogether from the bones of the skull,
       with which they are as much entitled to rank as the petrosal (le) or the
turbinal (19) ; but always in the category of sense-capsules or ' splanchno-

skeletal ' pieces.

In regard to the inferior arch of the frontal segment, the subdivision of its

constituent elements, in subserviency to its special functions, is carried to as

great an extent as in that of the parietal segment. I regard the four over-

lapping and closely-connected pieces from the upper joint (asa) to the lower

joint (isd) inclusive, as the pleurapophysis : it is not so obvious whether

the bones 29-32 form a subdivided hcemapophysis, or whether the terminal

bone (32), forming by symphysis with its fellow the crown of the inverted arch,

may not be the moiety of a mesially divided haemal spine. But the general
character of the inverted arch (H iii), as the haemal complement of the fron-

tal vertebra is unmistakeable, and its serial homology with the succeeding

(H Harches
            11 and i) is fully illustrated in fishes by its supporting diverging

appendages (34-37). These, in the series of fishes, manifest, in as many

permanent arrests, the ehief phases of development that the corresponding

appendages of the occipito-haemal arch have been described to pass through.

The diverging appendage of the fronto-hsemal arch is a single and simple

bony style in the lepidosiren ; it consists of three or four simple rays in the

monk-fish and some other plagiostomes ; it has one ray expanded into a broad

proximal piece in the conger, which sustains a distal segment of the appendage,

one member of which, the ' subopercular,' still retains the long and slender,

ray-like form, which is, also, clearly traceable in* the broader but long and

curved ' opercular '; in the cod, as in most osseous fishes, the parts of the

second segment of the appendage (35, 36, 37, fig. 5) are metamorphosed, like
the proximal one (34), into broad and flat bones. The fin-like fold of inte-
gument, sustained and moved by means of this diverging appendage and its

muscles, reacts upon the surrounding water ; but, like the hyoid-fins, with

which the tympanic or opercular fins are closely connected, they are chiefly

subservient to the creation of the respiratory currents and their direction

through the gill-chambers. The weight of these appendages, and the con-

stant movements in connection with respiration, as well as those which the

haemapophysial portions of the arch, modified in subserviency to nutrition

have to perform, as jaws, explain the necessity of the subdivision of the sup-

porting pedicle into overlapping pieces allowing of a certain elastic yielding

with recoil, and thus diminishing the liability to fracture without affecting,

except by increasing, the strength of the arch. The trochlear joint between

the two elements of this arch (at i%d and 29) with its cartilage and synovial

sac, repeats the complex structure of the ai-ticulation between the vertebral

and sternal portions of the ribs in birds. To the fore-part of the lower piece

(2srf) of the pleurapophysis is usually articulated a bone (24) connecting it

with another bone (20) in advance : the ground for regarding 24 as appertain-

Hing to the arch (20, 21 and 22, iv) will be explained in the description of

that arch.

   There remains, then, in the fish's skull, to be considered, the group of

Hbones (N iv, iv, fig. 5) forming its anterior extremity; and we have to in-

quire, whether there can be traced in this easily separable group such a con-

cordance in its formation with the arrangement of the constituents of the

foregoing segments as will justify its being regarded as a natural segment of

the skull, and as still illustrating the type on which all the other segments of

the endoskeleton have been constructed. Fig. 4 gives the same view of the

bones of this group in vertebral relation with the rhinencephala as the views

in figs. 1, 2 and 3 do of the bones having a similar relation to the three larger
segments of the brain : we perceive the single and symmetrical bone (13)
forming the basis of the arch, and sustaining the bones i4, 14, which more

immediately support the olfactory ganglions and transmit their nerves, either

by grooves or foramina, to the olfactory capsules : the key of the arch is

formed by the single and symmetrical bone 15, which is articulated to and

chiefly sustained by the bones 14, i4 : but 15 is expanded and deflected

anteriorly so as to rest directly upon 13 and completely obliterate the neural

canal ; the haemal canal being in like manner closed by the approximation of
                                                               --

the haemal spine (22) to the nasal centrum (is), and by the upward develop-

ment of the processes of 22 which join the neural spine (15). Much modifi-

cation was to be expected in the segment which terminates the skeleton
anteriorly ; and yet the typical characters of the neural arch are more com-
pletely preserved here than at the opposite end of the vertebral column. If
the bones 4, 8, 12, which I recognise as ' parapophyses ' in the cranial
segments i, 11, in, must be viewed as superadded intercalations for the
special and characteristic expansion of the neural arches of those segments
normal elements, indeed, of the typical vertebra, but withmodified connections

--for cranial functions then the disappearance of their homotypes in the nasal

segment restores its neural arch (fig. 4-) to the more common condition, and we

recognise in 13 the centrum, in 14, 14, the neurapophyses, and in i5 the neural

spine of the nasal vertebra.
    But the segment to be complete should exhibit a second arch, inverted ; and

we find such arch closed or completed by the symphysis of the bones 2?,
fig, 5, and suspended to the sides of the centrum 13 and to the neurapophyses
1-1, 14, by the bones 20, as the piers or crura of the arch ; these bones being
connected to the key-bones 22, by the intermediate bones 21. Now, the
modifications which these elements of the inverted or haemal arch of the
nasal vertebra have undergone, are, also, much less than might have been
anticipated from the extent to which the segments are modified at the oppo-
site extreme of the endoskeleton. All the normal elements of the haemal
arch, for example, are retained : 20 is the pleurapophysis, 21 the hamapo-
physis, and 22 the hcemal spine, in most fishes divided at the middle line, but
sometimes confluent with its fellow e. g. Diodon. The essential (pleur-
apophysial) part of 20 extends in many fishes (e. g. percoids) like a short
straight rib from its articulation with 13 and 14 to the condyle at its opposite
end to which the haemapophysis 20 is articulated ; but it usually, also, de-
velopes a process from its hinder margin downwards and backwards, which

Hgives attachment to the diverging appendage of the arch iv. The de-

velopment of the other bones of the arch, 21 and 22, outwards, downwards
and backwards, is still more marked in relation to the protractile and retrac-
tile movements of the arch in most osseous fishes ; and some anatomists,

influenced by the form and proportions rather than the connections of those

bones, have described them as independent parallel arches : but, as such,

they must be regarded as being suspended by their apices or key-stones to
the axis of the skull, and as having their haunches hanging freely downwards

--and outwards a position the reverse of that of the foregoing inferior arches

of the skull and of every typical haemal arch. The reduction of that di-
vergent development, characteristic of the bones 21 and 22 in fishes, is ef-
fected in a great degree within the limits of the piscine class : already we
find one of the spurious arches abrogated in the salmonoid fishes by the short-
ening of 22, and its more direct continuation from 21, which now forms the
larger part of the upper border of the mouth and supports teeth : the con-
fluent maxillaries and premaxillaries send down only a single divergent

process from their point of suspension to the palatine condyle in the plecto-

gnathic fishes; and the consolidation of all the elements of the palato-maxillary
arch into its normal unity is eflTected in the lepidosiren*. The palatines (20)

always form the true bases or suspensory piers of the inverted haemal arch

at their points of attachment to the prefrontals (14) ; the premaxillaries, 22,
constitute the true apex or crown at their symphysis or point of confluence,

canal. The diverging appendage, sometimes single and anchylosed to the
arch (lepidosiren) ; sometimes single and detached like a long, narrow bone
(some uiurBRnoids) ; more commonlj' consists of two bones (23, 24), which
extend outwards, downwards, and backwards from the pleurapophysis (20)
but the more constant and better ossified bone of the two, no. 24, articulates
posteriorly witli the succeeding pleurapophysis (28) and combines its move-
ments with those of its own arch, just as the diverging appendages of one
thoracic haemal arch in the bird associate the movements of that arch with
those of the next in succession (as in fig. 15, pi, a, pi). The haemapophyses

here, as at the opposite end of the body, begin so far to dissociate themselves
from the pleurapophyses as to articulate also directly with the centrum (13)

as well as with the pleurapophyses. I regard this as a very interesting ap-
proximation to that condition of the typical vertebra which is illustrated by

the diagram (fig. 14), and which is seen in nature in the caudal vertebrae of
the crocodiles, enaliosaurs and menopome (fig. 28, H).

   From the foregoing analysis it appears, then, that in osseous fishes the

endoskeletal bones of the head are arranged, like those of the trunk, in seg-
ments ; that these are four in number, and that they closely conform to the

character of the typical vertebra.

   Thus we have four centrums and neural arches : viz.

     N I. Epencephalic arch (figs. 1 and 5, i> 2, 3, 4) ;
     N II. Mesencephalic arch (figs. 2 and 5, 5, 6, 7,8) ;
     N III. Prosencephalic arch (figs. 3 and 5, 9, 10, n, 12)
     N IV. Rhinencephalic arch (figs. 4 and 5, 13, 14, is).

   As a collective name for the sum of these immoveably articulated arches
would be as convenient as the anatomist finds the names 'sacrum' and 'cara-

pace,' applied to similarly consolidated portions of vertebral segments in the

pelvic and abdominal regions of certain air-breathing vertebrates, that of
' cranium ' may well be retained for the neural arches of the skull : but it
should be understood to signify, in all animals, the bones 1 to is inclusive;
whereas it has, hitherto, been applied variably in difierent species ; some-
times including sense-capsules and facial bones, intercalated to expand the
walls of the cavity for a large brain ; and more frequently excluding true
cranial bones, those of the rhinencephalic arch, for example, which encompass
as essential a part of the encephalic chamber, as the sacral vertebrae do of the
neural canal at the opposite end of the vertebral axis ; although in both in-

stances the extremities of the neural axis may have been withdrawn, in the

course of its concentrative change and movement, from their original seat.
   The haemal arches indicated by the arrows in fig. 5, the heads marking

the point of junction or crown, are,

     H I. Scapular arch (50-52)
     H II. Hyoidean arch (38-43) ;
     H III. Mandibular arch (28-3?) ;
     H IV. Maxillary arch (20-22).

    The diverging appendages of the haemal arches are,
       1. The Pectoral (54-57) ;
       2. The Branchiostegal (44) ;
       3. The Opercular (34-37) ;
       4'. The Pterygoid (23-24).

   The bones or parts of the splanchno-skeleton which are intercalated with

or attached to the arches of the true vertebral segments, are,

       The Petrosal (le) or ear-capsule, with the otolites, le";
       The Sclerotal (17) or eye-capsule ;

   Reptiles. In proceeding with the inquii-y into the natural arrangement of

the skull-bones, I have selected from the Reptilia the crocodile, as a typical

example of that class, and one most likely to facilitate the inquiry on account

of the characteristic persistence of the primitive cranial sutures.

   Pursuing the same mode of investigation as in the case of the fish, let us

disarticulate the hindmost segment of

the skull and so detach the four bones.             Fig. 18.

detached and depressed neural spine

of the atlas of the crocodile. The                  Disarticulated epencephalic arch, viewed from

of no. 1 makes that centrum resemble

the posteriorly convex bodies of the

trunk-vertebrae in as striking a manner as the repetition of the articular
concavity in the basioccipital of the cod (fig. 1, 1) marks its serial homo-
logy with the succeeding vertebral centrums of the same animal. In the
descending process from the under part of the occipital centrum of the
crocodile (fig. 18, 1), we see a second character of the cervical centrums in
that reptile repeated, viz. their inferior exogenous spine. The neurapo-

physes (2, 2), like those of the atlas, meet above the neural canal : they give
exit to the vagal and hypoglossal nerves, and protect the sides of the me-

dulla oblongata and cerebellum. The neural spine (3) protects the upper
surface of the cerebellum : it is also traversed by tympanic cells, and assists,
with the bones 2, 2, in the formation of the chamber for the internal ear.
The special homology of the outstanding processes (4, 4) in the crocodile

and serpent (fig. 10), with the similarly situated but distinct 'paroccipital'
bones in the cod, is confirmed by their resuming their independency in the

hinder segment of the skull of the chelonian reptiles ; and the occipital neural

arch of the crocodile is reduced by their confluence with the neurapophyses

to the condition of those of the trunk-vertebrae, as composed, viz. of four

instead of six elements.

The epencephalic arch offers the same simple condition not only in the

ophidians but in most saurians : the chameleons however retain, like the

chelonians, the ichthyic independence of the parapophyses (4, 4). In batra-
chians the epencephalic arch is reduced to the two important elements, the

neurapophyses                                                       which meet and join  each  other  bf>low as well as  above the

condyles, for articulation with the corresponding processes of the neural arch

of the atlas. Tiie basioccipital, if it exists in batrachians, is rudimental and

confluent with the basisphenoid, and the supraoccipital is in like manner

recognisable only as the posterior border of the backwardly produced parietal.
The parapophyses are short exogenous processes of the neurapophyses of this

much sim])lified epencephalic arch in all batrachian reptiles.

The chief modification that distinguishes the above-described segment of

the crocodile's skull from its homologue in the fish, is the absence of an

Weattached inverted or haemal arch.                                                      recognise, indeed, the special homo-

logues of the piscine constituents of that arch in 50, 51 and 52, fig. 22. The
upper suprascapular piece (50) is however free, disconnected from any seg-

ment, and retains, in connection with the loss of its proximal or cranial

articulations, its cartilaginous state : the scapula (51) is ossified, as is likewise
the coracoid (52), the lower end of which is separated from its fellow by the

interposition of a median, symmetrical, partially ossified piece called 'epister-

num ' (hs). The power of recognising the special homologies of 50, 51, and

H52 in the crocodile, with the similarly numbered constituents of the arch i

in fishes (fig. 5), though masked not only by modifications of form and pro-

portion but even of very substance, as in the case of 50, depends upon the

circumstance of these bones constituting the same essential element of the

archetypal skeleton : for although in the present instance there is superadded

to the adaptive modifications above cited the rarer one of altered connections,

Cuvier does not hesitate to give the same names (suprascapulaire) to so

and (scapulaire) to 51, in both fish and crocodile : but he did not perceive or
admit that the narrower relations of special homology were a result of, and

necessarily included in, the wider law of general homology. According to

the view of this law here taken, we discern in so and 51, fig. 22, a teleologically
compound pleurapophysis, in 52 a hcemapophysis, and in hs the hamal

spine, completing the hnemal arch.

The general relations of the scapulo-coracoid arch to a haemal or costal

one have been long recognised, but the vertebral segment to which it apper-

tains seems not hitherto to have been suspected, and has certainly not been

satisfactorily determined. Oken, who had observed the free cervical ribs in

a specimen of the Lacerta apvda, Pallas (Pseudopus), deemed them repre-

sentatives of the scapula, and this bone to be, in other animals, the coalesced

homologues of the cervical pleurapophyses*. In no animal are the conditions

for testing this question so favourable and obvious as in the crocodile : not

only do cervical ribs coexist with the scapulo-coracoid arch, but they are of

unusual length and are developed from the atlas as well as from each suc-

ceeding cervical vertebra : we can also trace them beyond the thorax to the

sacrum, and throughout a great part of the caudal region, as the sutures of

the apparently long transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae demon-

strate in the young animal ; the lumbar pleurapophyses being manifested

at the same period as cartilaginous appendages to the ends of the long dia-

pophyses.

ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                        285

The scapulo-coracoid arch, both elements of which retain the form of

strong- and thick vertebral and sternal ribs in the crocodile, is applied in the
skeleton of that animal over the anterior thoracic hsemal arches. Viewed

as a more robust haemal arch, it is obviously out of place in reference to the
rest of its vertebral segment. If we seek to determine that segment by the

mode in which we restore to their centrums the less displaced neural arches
in the sacrum of the bird (fig. 27, n \-n 4), we proceed to examine the verte-
brae before and behind the displaced arch with the view to discover the one

which needs it in order to be made typically complete. Finding no centrum and

neural arch without its pleurapophyses from the scapula to the pelvis, we give

up our search in that direction ; and in the opposite direction we find no verte-

--bra without its ribs until we reach the occiput : there we have centrum and

neural arch, with coalesced parapophyses the elements answering to those
N 5-- Hincluded in the arch
i, fig.                        but without the arch i ; which arch

can only be supplied, without destroying the typical completeness of antece-

dent cranial segments, by a restoration of the bones 50-52, to the place which
they naturally occupy in the skeleton of the fish. And since anatomists

are generally agreed to regard the bones 50-52 in the crocodile (fig. 22)
as specially homologous with those so numbered in the fish (fig. 5), we
must conclude that they are likewise homologous in a higher sense ; that in

fig. 5 the scapulo-coracoid arch is in its natural or typical place, whereas in

the crocodile it has been displaced for a special purpose. Thus, agreeably

with a general principle, we perceive that as the lower vertebrate animal

illustrates the closer adhesion to the archetype by the natural articulation of

the scapulo-coracoid arch to the occiput, so the higher vertebrate manifests

the superior influence of the antagonising power of adaptive modification by

the removal of that arch from its proper segment.

   The scapula retains the more common cylindrical long and slender rib-

like form of the pleurapophysis in the chelonian reptiles, where, from the

greater length of the neck, it has retrograded further than in the crocodile

from its proper centrum, and is placed not upon, but within, an anterior

thoracic hsemal arch, the pleurapophysis of which has, on the other hand,

been expanded like a scapula.

If the arguments founded upon the relations of the scapulo-coracoid arch

to the segments of the skeleton in osseous fishes and crocodilians be admitted

to sustain the conclusion here drawn from them, that arch must be held to

form the haemal complement of the occipital vertebra in all animals. Bojanus,

in illustrating his vertebral theory of the skull by the osteology of the Emys

EuropcBa, thus defines the

"Vertebra occipitalis, sive capitis prima.

" Basis occipitis, seu corpus hujus vertebrae,

" Pars lateralis occipitis, sive arcus,
" Crista occipitalis, processus spinosi loco,

" Cornu majus hyoidis, costcB vertebrce occipitalis comparand um*."

He adds a dotted outline of the hyoid arch to complete the vertebra oc-

cipitalis, in tab. xii. fig. 32, B. 1 of his beautiful Monograph.

Supposing the special homology of the middle cornua of the hyoid of the

chelonian, so represented and compared to ribs by Bojanus, with the stylo-,

epi- and cerato-hyals of the fish (fig. 5, 38, 39,40) to have been correct, which

the metamorphoses of the hyoid and branchial arches in the batrachians dis-

prove, the singular and highly interesting change of position as well as shape

of the true ceratohyals, during the same metamorphosis, prepares us to expect

a retrogradation of the hyoid arch in respect to its proper centrum, in the

skulls of the air-breathing vertebrates. In the young tadpole the thick car-
tilaginous hyoidean arch* is suspended, as in fishes, from the tympanic pedicle:
the slender hyoidean arch of the mature frog is suspended irom the petrosal
capsule f. The mandibular arch has, also, receded ; and the scapular arch
which, at its first appearance, was in close connection with the occiput, further
retrogrades in the progress of the metamorphosis to the place where we find

it in the skeleton of the adult frog.

   The argument, therefore, may be summed up as follows. The position of

the neurapophyses in the dorsal vertebrae of chelonians and in the sacral ver-
tebrae of dinosaurians and birds, shows that a change of relative position in
respect of other elements of the same vertebra may be one of the teleological
modifications to which even the most constant and important elements are
subject. Instead of viewing such shifted arches as independent individual parts,
we trace their relation to the stationary elements of the vertebral segments
the centrums. Thus, commencing, for example, with the anterior of the

Asacral vertebrae of the ostrich, in fig. 27, we observe that, besides sup-

porting its own neural arch, it bears a small portion of that of the next ver-
tebra : the third neural arch (n i) has encroached further upon the centrum
of the vertebra in advance ; and thus, in respect to the neural arch (it 2), if
it were viewed with the centrums, ci and c 1, upon which it equally rests,
apart from the rest of the sacrum, it would appear to appertain equally to
either, and be referable to the one in preference to the other quite gra-
tuitously. Nevertheless ni'is proved, by the intermediate changes in ante-
cedent neural arches, to belong actually, and in no merely imaginary or trans-
cendental sense, to c 2 altogether, and not to the segment of which c 1 is the
centrum ; and in tracing the modifications of those sacral vertebrae which
follow c 2, we find n n to have regained nearly the whole of its centrum, c 1,
and the normal relations of the elements are quite restored in the succeeding

vertebra.

   Now let us suppose the habits of the species to have required a more

extensive displacement of the arch (n 2) and its appendages : if its formal
characters as a neural arch were still retained beneath the adaptive develop-
ment superadded to the adaptive dislocation, and if the segments before and
behind the centrum c 2 were found complete, and that centrum alone wanting
its neural arch; would the mere degree of modification in respect of relative
position nullify the conclusion that the shifted arch appertained to such in-
complete segment, and forbid that restoration to the typical condition, which

no anatomist, it is presumed, will dispute in the case of л 2, C2, fig. 27 ? No

anthropotomist hesitates in pronouncing the exact vertebra to which the
sixth ribs belong in the human skeleton. But, separate that costal arch
with the two bodies and neural arches of the vertebras with which it articu-
lates, and to which of them it belonged would be as questionable as in the
instance of the displaced neural arch in the bird's sacrum. The head of each
 rib is applied half to the upper centrum, half to the lower one : the upper
border of the neck of the rib articulates with the upper neural arch, the tu-
 bercle with the diapophysis of the lower neural arch. If a naturalist, not
conversant with the definitions of human anatomy, were shown this detached
part of the human skeleton and were pressed to determine the proper centrum
and neural arch of tlie hypothetically displaced costal element, the attempt
might seem to him gratuitous : and to the question, to which of such
centrums the rib exclusively (as to the pre-existing pattern) belonged ? he

might reply, to neither. And such, doubtless, would be the inatter-of-fact

answer most congenial to the character of mind which would limit its views

to the specialities of the ribs as parts independent of anj"^ ideal archetype, or

be unable or unwilling to push the consideration of their connections beyond

Athe purposes apparently subserved thereby.  second anatomist might see

in the more constant articulation of the costal tubercle with the transverse

process, a character which would incline the balance in favour of the vertebra

Ato which the transverse process belonged.  third anatomist might extend

his comparisons to other ribs and centrums, and finding the lower centrum

obtaining by degrees a greater proportion of the head of the rib, until the

first and last ribs respectively wholly articulated to the centrum answering to

the lower one in the case of the hypothetically detached sixth pair, he would

conclude that such pair of ribs belonged essentially to the lower and not

to the upper supporting centrum, and he would count accordingly such

lower centrum with its neural arch, as the sixth of those vertebrae which are

characterized as supporting ribs. The anthropotomist, in fact, in so counting

and defining the dorsal vertebrae and ribs, admits unconsciously perhaps, an

important principle in general homology, which pursued to its legitimate

consequences and further applied, demonstrates that the scapula is the modi-

fied rib of that centrum and neural arch which he calls the ' occipital bone,'

and that the change of place which chiefly masks that relation (for a very

elementary acquaintance with comparative anatomy shows how little mere

form and proportion affect the homological characters of bones) differs only

in extent and not in kind from the modification which makes a minor amount

of comparative observation requisite in order to determine the relation of the

shifted sixth lib to its proper centrum.

With reference, therefore, to the occipital vertebra of the crocodile, if the

comparatively well-developed and permanently distinct ribs of all the cervical

vertebrge prove the scapular arch to belong to none of those segments, and,

if it be wanting to complete the occipital segment, which it actually does

complete in fishes, then the same conclusion must apply to the same arch in

other animals, and we must regard the occipital vertebra of the tortoise as

completed below by its scapulo-coracoid arch, and, not as Bojanus supposed,

by its hyoidean arch*.

With these views of the general homology of the scapulo-coracoid arch,

the embryologist will observe with less surprise its constant appearance in

the first instance close to the occiput, and its equally constant primitive ver-

tical position ; however far back it may be subsequently removed, or to

whatever extent it may be rotated, in the same progress to maturity, out of

its original parallel direction with the more normal pleurapophyses.

Returning to the study of the crocodile's skull in reference to the verte-

brate archetype, if we proceed to dislocate the next segment in advance of

the occipital, we bring away in connection with the long base-bone, 5 and 0,

arches in fishes. With regard to the scapular arch, he alludes to its articulation with the

skull in the lowest of the vertebrate classes as an ' amalgame inattendue ' (Anatomie Philo-

ciation of the law of vegetative uniformity or repetition, and of the ratio of its prevalence

segment. As accessory func-

tions they contribute, like the corresponding bones in fishes, to the forma-
tion of the ear-chamber. They have, however, a little retrograded in posi-
tion (see fig. 9), resting below, in part, upon the occipital centrum, and sup-

porting more of the spine of that centrum (3) than of their own (t) ; which
is, however, formed of a single bone, and in so far manifests more of the
normal character of the element completing the neural arch, as its crown or
key-bone, than does the homologous divided and often divaricated bone in

fishes. This and other analogous facts show that although the lowest ver-
tebrate class adheres most, as a whole, to the archetype, yet that it can be

recognised clearly and unequivocally only by patient study of its modifica-

tions in all classes : for even the lowest have special exigencies arising out

of their sphere of existence calling for modifications of the type which are

Wenot present in other and higher classes.  shall find, indeed, that the con-

nation of the basi- and pre-sphenoids ceases in mammals, and that they only

coalesce in that class, being primitively distinct ; so that the second cranial

centrum (5) may be removed with its neural arch, in the foetal quadruped
(fig. 24') or human subject (25), without doing violence to nature by the use
of the saw. The bones s, s, fig. 19, wedged between e and 7, here, also, ma-

nifest more of their parapophi/sial character than in fishes, inasmuch as they

are excluded from the inner walls of the cranium, whilst they retain and

manifest broadly their characters as outstanding processes for muscular at-

tachment. But, besides afibrding ligamentous attachment to the hyoid arch

(39, 40), they articulate largely with the proximal element (is) of the man-
dibular arch, whose backward displacement, in comparison with its more

normal position in the fish's skull (fig. 5), is as clearly illustrated in the meta-

morphosis of the anourous batrachia, as is that of the hyoidean or scapular

arches.
    Referring, then, to the side view of the cranial vertebrae of the crocodile

(fig. 22), we see the haemal arch of the second or parietal vertebra in the
hyoid (39,40, 41) retaining 80 much of its embryonic dimensions as is required

by its restricted functions, and having no call for progressive growth in sub-
serviency to a branchial respiration. It consists of a ligamentous stylohyal,
'\ts pleurapophysis, retaining the same primitive histological condition which
obstructs the ordinary recognition of the same elements of the lumbar haemal
arches. The hsemopophyses and haemal spine are, however, here as there,
more advanced in respect of their tissue. The hamapophysis is ossified like
the so-called ' abdominal ribs,' and usually, like them, consists of two portions,

having the special names of epihyal (39) and ceratohyal (40) : the hcsmal
spine (41) retains its cartilaginous state like its homotypes in the abdomen
there they get the special name of ' linea alba' or abdominal sternum, here

of ' basihyal.' With respect to formal modification, this element is chiefly
remarkable in the crocodile for its broad expanse : it sustains the ascending

valvular ridge at the base of the tongue, which, applying itself against the

descending ' palatum raoUe,' constitutes an effectual barrier against the entry
of water into the glottis from the mouth, whilst the crocodile is engaged in
overcoming the struggles of a submerged and drowning prey.

   There being no need of diverging appendages from the hyoidean arch in
the crocodile, branchiostegal rays are not developed. The scapular arch is

similarly simplified in Anguis and other serpentiform lizards ; but, to those
who recognise its true homology, its presence without a trace of its appen-
dages, the fore-limbs, will create no more surprise, than the presence of the
hyoidean arch without the branchiostegal fins or of the mandibu lar arch without

the opercular fins.

   On removing the neural arch of the parietal vertebra, with or without the

rietal centrum (5). The neural spine of the frontal vertebra (11) retains its
normal character as a single symmetrical bone, like the parietal spine, which
it partly overlaps. It is much developed longitudinally, but more in the
anterior, and less in the lateral direction than in most fishes.

    One cannot contemplate the relative position of the frontal to the parietal
and of the parietal to the supraoccipital, which is overlapped by the parietal
and itself overlaps the flattened spine of the atlas, without a conviction of the
serial homology of these single, median, imbricated bones, all completing
arches above the neural axis, and each permanently distinct from the piers
or haunches of the arch of which it forms the key-stone. In like manner
the serial homology of those piers or neurapophyses, viz. the laminae of

the atlas, the exoccipitals, the alisphenoids and the orbitosphenoids, is equally
unmistakeable. Nor can we close our eyes to the same serial relationship
of the postfrontals (fig. 20, 12, 12) as parapophyses of their vertebra, with
the mastoids (a) and the coalesced paroccipitals (4). The frontal parapo-
physis, 12, is wedged between the back part of the spine, 11, and the neur-
apophysis, 10 : its outward process extends backwards and joins the next
parapophysis (s) ; but, notwithstanding the retrogradation of the mandi-
bular arch, it still receives a small part of its own plenrapophysial element
(28). This element now manifests its typical unity : vegetative subdivision,

much reduced in the batrachian reptiles, no more prevails in tiie develop-
ment of the frontal pleurapophysis in any higher vertebrate. The serpents
exhibit this element under the common form of a rib ; longer, indeed, than

are any of the pleurapophyses in the batrachian order ; but it has so far
retreated in serpents as to be exclusively attached to the parietal parapo-
physis, which is remarkably elongated and produced backwards, and sus-
pends the long, slender, straight and simple frontal pleurapophysis (tympanic
pedicle) vertically from its posterior extremity. In lacertians no. 28 is ver-
tically suspended from no. s, and, commonly also, from no. 27, which is con-
 tinued from the backwardly produced parapophysis of the frontal vertebra
 (12) to that of the parietal vertebra (s) in most of this division of the Cu-
vierian order Sauria. In chelonians and crocodilians the diverging appen-
 dage of the maxillary arch (27) descends and applies itself to a large propor-
tion of no. 28, down to its lower articular end, and contributes to fix and
 strengthen that bone, as well as the modified costal arch from which it di-

 verges.

    The condition of the shortening, expansion and fixation of the frontal
pleurapophysis in crocodiles and chelonians is exemplified in the uses to
which the modified haemapophyses, completing that' costal arch, are put.
 Tortoises crop the grass by the application of the trenchant horny plates of
the under to those of the upper jaw : turtles equally need a fixed suspensory
joint of the under jaw in the act of biting and dividing the tough sea-weeds.

 Crocodiles have the frontal hsernapophyses (mandibular rami) unusually
long ; supporting numerous large laniary teeth, and requiring a fixed and
firm point of suspension in the violent actions to which they are put in re-
taining, and overcoming the struggles of their prey.

    The teleological complication of the lower or distal elements of the arch
in question (29-32, fig. 22) is carried further than in fishes : there was more
 need, in fact, for a combination of the greatest elasticity and strength with
 the least weight of bone* in the frontal haemapophysis of the crocodile than

 in the frontal pleurapophysis of the fish (2s a-28 d, fig. 5).
     There, lastly, remain then in the skull of the crocodile the bones inter-

and 73, and we have to inquire whether through all the modifications which
their extreme position subjects them to, we can still trace any evidence of their

arrangement according to the vertebrate type.

  A long and slender symmetrical grooved bone, like the ossified inferior

half of the capsule of a notochord, is continued forwards from the centrum

of the foregoing vertebra, and stands in the relation of a centrum (13) to the
vertical plates of the bones 14, which expand as they rise into the broad and

thick triangular plates with an ex-

posed horizontal superior surface.     Fig. 21.

The arch of which these form the

piers, and to the anterior rhinen-

cephalic prolongations traversing

which arch they stand in the re-

lation of neurapophyses, is com-

pleted by the two bones (13) : which

I, therefore, regard as a divided

neural spine. In fishes we have

seen that the corresponding ele-

ment of the parietal vertebra was

similarly divided, whilst the neural

spine of the nasal vertebra was

single : in the crocodile the re-

verse conditions prevail. In a spe-

cies of alligator I have observed

the bone 13 continued further for-

ward, expanded, and divided at the

middle line, the two divisionsform-

ing a small disc on the bony palate.

and most lacertians ; it is single in

chelonians, but retains its carti-

laginous state in some species {Emys expansa, e. g.). The neurapophyses

(14, 14) transmit the olfactory nerves in all reptiles ; but the ganglions are
usually withdrawn backwards into the prosencephalic neural arch, leaving

ramus in the recent and extinct saurians by pointing out the similarity of the structure to
that adopted in binding together several parallel plates of elastic wood, or steel, to make a
cross-bow; and also in setting together thin plates of steel in the springs of carriages. Dr.
Buckland adds, " Those who have witnessed the shock given to the head of a crocodile by
the act of snapping together its thin long jaws, must have seen how liable to fracture the
lower jaw would be, were it composed of one bone only on each side." lb. p. 177. The
same reasoning applies to the composite condition of the long tympanic pedicle in fishes.
In each case the splicing and bracing together of thin flat bones of unequal length and of
varying thickness affords compensation for the weakness and risk of fracture that would Other-
wise have attended the elongation of the snout. In the abdomen of the crocodile and plesi-
osaur the analogous composition of the haemapophyses (abdominal ribs) allows of a slight
change of length in the expansion and contraction of the walls of that cavity : and since
amphibious reptiles, when on land, rest the whole weight of the abdomen directly upon the

ground, the necessity of the modification for diminishing liability to fracture further appears.

But what we are here chiefly concerned in is the evidence that the general homology of

elementary parts of a natural segment is not affected by the modification of teleological

composition of such parts. What happens to the haemapopbysial or inferior elements of
the inverted arch in the abdominal segments of the crocodile also affects the same elements

of a cranial haemal arch ; and the subdivision of the pleurapophyses of the trunk in the

sturgeon is repeated in the same elements of the cranial vertebrae in osseous fishes.
292 REPORT-- 1846.

only the nerve-trunks to be protected by the nasal neurapophyses. These

are, therefore, more approximated, and the anterior termination of the neural

canal is much contracted ; and, in the tailless batrachia, the nasal neur-

apophyses coalesce together.

  We recognise in that element (20) of the fourth or foremost inverted arch

of the crocodile's skull, which is in connection with the body (vomer, 13) and

descending plates of the neurapophyses (prefrontals, 14) of the nasal vertebra,

the proximal or pleurapophysial element of such arch ; and the same repe-
tition of the characteristic connections of the bone, 20, which enabled Cuvier

and Geoffroy to recognise its special homology with the palatine bone in the

fish, establishes its claim to be equally regarded in the crocodile as thepleur-

apophysis of its vertebral segment; although it now affords but a partial at-

tachment to the bone 21, which forms the next element of the inverted arch.

This bone, the hamapophysis, has undergone a striking change in its propor-

tions by development both in length and breadth: it is connected not only with

no. 20 behind and with no. 22 before, but with the elongated spine, no. 15, of its

own vertebra, and with the lacrymals, 73, above ; with its fellow of the opposite

side below, and with a well-developed proximal element, no. 26, of a strong

diverging appendage behind. The hcBmal spine, no. 22, is divided, and the

Harch is completed by the symphysial junction of the two halves at iv. The

nasal aperture or entry to the air-passages forms the span or area of the

much-modified inverted arch constituting the upper jaw of the crocodile.

The two proximal elements of the arch, nos. 20 and 21, continue to send

outwards and backwards exogenous diverging processes ; but they consti-

tute a smaller proportion of the bones than in fishes, and both processes di-

rectly support distinct bones representing the diverging appendage of the

arch, and serving to fix and attach it to the succeeding arch. The pleurapo-

physial appendage (pterygoid, 24) soon coalesces, however, with its fellow
and with the centrum of its own vertebra (vomer, 13), and then expands to

unite by a broad sutural surface with the coalesced centrums of the frontal

Aand parietal vertebrae (9 and 5).  second osseous piece (ectopterygoid,

24') diverges from the pleurapophysis external to the preceding and attaches

it to the haemapophysis, to the haemapophysial appendage, and to the par-
apophysis of the frontal vertebra. The strong diverging ray from the haem-

apophysis is teleologically subdivided into nos. 26 (malar) and 27 (squamosal),

and firmly attaches the maxillary arch to the pleurapophysis (23) of the man-

dibular one.

In the chelonian reptiles the modifications of the nasal segment of the

skull adhere pretty closely to the type of those in the crocodile ; the centrum

is more independent and better developed, but the divisions of the neural

spine have coalesced with their neurapophyses : the diverging appendages,

26 and 27, are usually developed into broad and flat bones. In many lizards

we find the nasal centrum divided but the neural spine single : the ha;mal

spine is, also, single, as a general rule, and sends upwards and backwards a

process to join the neural spine, divide the area of the haemal canal, and

terminate the vertebral series anteriorly. The haemapophysial diverging ap-

pendage commonly resumes its long and slender ray-like proportions, and joins

the parapophyses of both frontal and parietal vertebrae as well as the prox-

imal end of the pleurapophysis of the mandibular arch. In serpents both

divisions of this appendage are absent (indicating the inferior character of

the bones 26 and 27 in general homology), but the two parts of the pleurapo-
physial appendage, 21 and 24', are retained and serve as levers in the move-

ments of the maxillary arch. The spine of that haemal arch is single, and

commonly united only by lax and elastic ligaments with the haemapophyses.
          ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                        293

which may be divaricated like the halves of the mandibular arch, so as to

widen the mouth laterallj' ; and this free suspension and incomplete closure

of the principal costal arches of the cranium in serpents repeats in an inter-

esting manner the characteristic free and open condition of all the costal arches

of their trunk. In the genus TytJilops the diverging appendage of the

palato-maxillary arch is reduced to the primitive condition of a long and

slender ray. In anourous batrachiaiis a long and slender backwardly pro-

duced exogenous process of the hsemapophysis (maxillary) joins a shorter

advancing exogenous process of the distal division of the next pleurapo-

physis (tympanic) : but in the tailed species the maxillary arch is fixed only

by a broad (pterygoid) appendage; and both maxillary and premaxillary retain

only their essential connections as forming the inferior arch of their segment.

In the proteus and siren the pleurapophysis (maxillary) is almost obsolete.

The bones nos. 24, 24', 26 and ir, being shown to be the least constant

members of the group forming the nasal segment, and to form by their posi-

Htion and direction, the diverging appendages of the haemal arch iv, there

remains in the skull of the crocodile only the bone 73, which by its position

in front of the orbit and its relation to the lacrymal duct, is to be referred

like the great anterior suborbital mucous bone in fishes to the dermal skele-

ton. In like manner the palpebral or supra-orbital scale-bones are to be ex-

cluded from the category of the pieces of the endoskeleton. The small and

inconstant ossifications in the capsule of the organ of smell, together with the

scarcely ossified sclerotals (n), the small petrosal, le, and the columelliform

stapes, le', are intercalated portions of sense-capsules and appendages re-

ferable to the system of the splanchnoskeleton.

Thus the endoskeletal system of bones of the head of the crocodile are natu-

rally arranged in four segments, each composed of a centrum with a neural

and a heemal arch. The haemal arches have been subjected, as in the trunk,

to most modification ; that of the occipital vertebra having been displaced;
that of the parietal vertebra detached from its segment and arrested in its

development ; whilst that of the frontal vertebra is articulated in a very small
proportion to the parapophysis of its own segment, but chiefly to that of the

parietal  segment, with  paroccipital  connections  also                     it is immensely de-
                                                                          ;

veloped, the haemapophysial portion being the chief seat of extension. The

haemal arch of the nasal segment is also very large, but shows as much

excess of development in breadth as that of the frontal vertebra in length.

The diverging appendage is more complex than in fishes : one piece indeed,

no. 25, fig. 5, is absent, but three others, 24', 26 and 27, have been superadded.

The diverging appendages of the frontal and parietal vertebrae cease to be

developed in every class above that of fishes ; but that of the occipital haemal

arch, though it no longer shows the luxuriant profusion of rays that distin-

guishes it in fishes, begins to assume a more fixed and definite character with

more special powers" and independent movements of its constituent parts.
The first segment (53), doubtfully and obscurely recognizable in any fish, is
henceforth a constant and important bone, and is always single : the next

segment consists as exclusively of two bones, connate, indeed, in batra-

chians : the distal segment presents two jointed rays (digits) in the Amphi-
uma didactylum \ three rays in Amph. tridactylum and the proteus and four
rays in the Siren lacertina ; it branched into as many as nine rays in the ex-

tinct ichthyosaurs ; but they never exceed five in the existing saurians, which

tions of the cephalic division of the vertebrate endoskeleton. Although, as a

general rule, the separate cranial bones can be discerned only at a very early

period, yet in those birds in which the power of flight is abrogated the indi-

cations of the primitive centres of ossification endure longer, and in the

species here selected for the illustration of the cranial segments (fig. 23) the

constituent bones of the skull, though figured of their natural size, have, with

the exception of the basioccipital, i, and basisphenoid, 3, and the two bones,

6 and 8, which coalesce with the petrosal, le, been separated by maceration
merely. I may remark, however, that in all birds, certain bones, which

coalesce with others in the cranium of most mammals, always retain their

primitive individuality ; the tympanic (as) and the pterygoid (24) for ex-

ample.

The hindmost segment of the cranium (N i, fig. 23) so closely repeats the

characters of the epencephalic neural arch of the crocodile (fig. 18), as to
render a separate and full view of it unnecessary for the illustration of its

vertebral character. The basioccipital (1) still developes the major part of
the single articular condyle, and sends down a process, more marked in the

struthious genera, and especially the dinornis, than in most other birds : in

all respects this primitively distinct bone retains the character of the centrum

of its vertebra.

The exoccipitals, 12, contributing somewhat more to the occipital condyle

than in the crocodile, develope, as in that reptile, the paroccipital (24) as an
outstanding exogenous ridge or process : but it is lower in position than in

the crocodile : the proper neurapophysial characters of no. 1 are fully main-

tained. The supraoccipital (3) now begins to manifest more strongly the
flattening and development in breadth, by which the spinous elements lose

the formal character from which their name originated, and are converted

Wefrom long into flat bones.  saw the first step in this most common of the

changes to which one and the same endoskeletal element is subject, in the

detached neural spine of the atlas of the crocodile: that of the occipital

vertebra of the same animal presented another stage in the metamorphosis:
we have a third degree in the bird, and the extreme of expansion is attained
in the human subject (fig. 25, 3), where the spine is sometimes developed,
like that of the parietal vertebra, from two centres. But the arrested steps

in this strange change of form and proportion demonstrate the essential

nature of the part, as the neural arch, whilst the constancy of the characters

of connexion is shown by this crown of the arch of the occipital vertebra

having the exoccipitals as its piers or haunches from the fish to the human

subject. It always protects the cerebellum ; is absent in the frog where this
organ is a mere rudiment ; and is present in the crocodile in the ratio of

the superior size of the cerebellum. The further development of the cere-

bellum is the condition of the superior breadth of the spine or crown of

the epencephalic arch in the bird.

The arguments that determined the nature and displacement of the haemal

arch of the occipital vertebra in the crocodile apply with equal force to that

in the bird. The extent of the displacement, it is true, has been greater

not seven, but seven-and-twenty vertebrae may intervene between the place

of the scapulo-coracoid arch and the remainder of its proper segment con-

stituting the occipital region of the simple cranial box in the bird. But this

diflference of extent ought no more to mask the real relationship of such

costal arch to its centrum, than the degree of development of the spine of

the occipital vertebra affects the general homology of that element.

In the ostrich, and other struthious birds, the haemal arch of the occipital

vertebra has retained much of its embryonic proportions. The pleurapo-

/>%лл/ part (51) has, also, retained its slender rib-like form* ; it has coalesced
with the hmmapophysis (52), and the inverted arch is completed, as in the
crocodile, by a haemal spine, as much modified in form by flattening and ex-
pansion as is the neural spine represented by the supraoecipital (3). The
diverging appendage of the occipito-hsemal arch also retains much of its
primitive simple character : a long and slender bone (53) supports two rays
(.'╖4, 55), and there is an attempt at three at 57, of which one is short, atrophied
and anchylosed to the rest. In the two small bones (se, se) interposed be-
tween this and the preceding segment, Ave recognise the special homologues
of the carpal series in the crocodile and fish : in 54 we have the ulna, in 55
the radius, in 53 the humerus, in 57 the metacarpus ; in c? 3 and di the rudi-
ments of the digits so numbered in the crocodile (fig. 22) and the mammal
(fig. 24). The evidences of the unity of plan in the construction of the
scapular limb, whether it be an arm with the prehensile hand, a hoofed fore-
leg, a wing, or a fin, are admitted by all ; the same scapula, humerus, anti-
brachial, carpal, metacarpal and phalangial bones are readily recognised by the

 tyro in comparative osteology in the ape, the horse, the whale, the bird, the

tortoise and the crocodile. The beautiful simplicity of the fundamental basis
 of all these adaptations of structure is descanted upon in all our popular

 teleological treatises. But the higher law governing the existence of these
 special homologies has attracted little attention in this country. Yet the
 inquiry into that more general principle of conformity to type according to
 which it has pleased the Creator of organic forms to restrict the manifesta-
tions of the variety of proportion and shape and substance and even relative

 position of the limbs requisite for the various tasks assigned to the vertebrate
species, is one that by no means transcends the scope of the comparative

 anatomist. And the conclusion to which my comparisons have conducted
me is, that one and the same element, viz. the diverging appendage of the

 occipital vertebra, forms the seat or substratum of all the adaptive modifica-

tions of the part called 'anterior ' or ' superior extremity.'

The second segment of the skull has for its central element a bone (fig.

23, 5), which in the bird, as in other ovipara, is connate with that (9) which

stands in the same relation to the third cranial segment ; the proof of the

N Nnatural distinction of these segments is given by the neural,
                                                                11, 111,

H Hand haemal, 11, in, arches. Probably the circumstance of the bodies

of those vertebrae being formed by ossifications of the fibrous capsule of the

notochord, representing the external or cortical parts only of such centrums,

may be the condition, or a favourable physical cause of such connation.

The neural arch of the parietal vertebra retains the same characters which

it first manifested in fishes. Besides the neurapophyses (e) impressed by the

mesencephalic ganglia and transmitting the trigeminal nerves, besides the
vastly expanded and again, as in fishes, divided neural spine (7), \he. parapo-
physis (s) is independently developed. It is of large proportional size ; and,
owing to the raised dome of the neural arch, is relatively lower in position
than in the crocodile; it sends downwards and outwards an unusually

long ' mastoid ' process, and forms a large proportion of the outer wall of
the chamber of the internal ear with the bony capsule of which it speedily

coalesces.

  The haemal arch of the parietal vertebra (H 11) is more reduced than in
the crocodile, and owes much of its apparently typical character to the re-

visceral system, which are feebly and transitorily manifested in the embryo
 bird. These spurious cornua project freelj' or are freely suspended, and are
 the subjects of singular and excessive development, as has been exemplified
 in the chapter on Special Homology.

    The bones (lo) of the third neural arch protect a smaller proportion of the

 prosencephalon than in the crocodile, but maintain their neurapophr/sialreXa,-
tion to it and to the optic nerves: theMeMra/sp27je5(n)cover a larger proportion
of the hemispheres, and, with their homotypes (7), exhibit a marked increase
of development in conformity with that of the cerebral centres protected by

their respective arches. The parapophysis of the frontal vertebra (12) is
relatively smaller in the bird than in the cold-blooded vertebrates, and is
rarely ossified from an independent centre ; but I have seen this in the emeu,
and it appears to have been constantly an autogenous element in the dinornis.
The haemal arch of the frontal vertebra has been transferred backwards to
the parietal one; its pletirapophi/sis (as), which is simple, as in the crocodile,
articulating exclusively with the parietal parapophysis (s), though this in
some birds unites with that of the frontal vertebra. In the young ostrich
and many other birds traces of the composite character of the hamupophysis
are long extant ; and bear obviously a homological relation to the teleologi-
cally compound character of the element in the crocodile : for the pieces,
nos. 29, 29', 30' and 31 ultimately, and in most birds early, coalesce
with each other and with the hcBtnal spine (32), the halves of which are con-

fluent at the symphysis.

   The centrum (is) of the nasal vertebra is always single, and, when it does
not remain distinct, coalesces with the neurapophyses, 14, and pleurapophyses,
20, of its own segment, and sometimes, also, with the rostral production of the
frontal centrum (a) : it is elongated and pointed at its free termination, and
deeply grooved above where it receives the above-named rostrum ; indicating
by both its form and position that it owes its existence, as bone, to the ossi-
fication of the outer capsule of the anterior end of the notochord. In the
ostrich the long presphenoidal rostrum intervenes between the vomer (13)
and prefrontals (14). These latter bones manifest, however, as has been
shown in the paragraph on their special homology (p. 214), all the essential
neurapophysial relations to the rhinencephalon and olfactory nerves : but

they early coalesce together, or are connate, as in the tailless batrachians.

The neural spine (15) is divided along the middle line ; but in most birds the
suture becomes obliterated and the spine coalesces with its neurapophyses,
with the frontal spine and with those parts of the haemal arch of the nasal
vertebra with which it comes in contact.

   The pleurapophyses (fig. 23, 20) of this inverted arch retain their typical
connections with the nasal centrum and neurapophyses at one end, and with
the haemapophysis (21) at the other end, and they also support the constant
element of the diverging appendage of the arch, no. 24. The hcEmapo-
physis {i\) resumes in birds more of its normal proportions and elongated
slender form : but the hcemal spine (22) is largely developed though undi-
vided, and sends upwards and backwards from the part corresponding to the
symphysis of the spine, when this element is divided, a long pointed process
(22'), which joins and usually coalesces with the neural spine (is) and divides
the anterior outlet of the haemal canal into two apertures called the nostrils.
The modification of the inferior arch of the nasal vertebra in the lizard tribe
is here repeated. The pleurapophysial appendage, 24, connects the palato-
maxillary arch with 28, and in the ostrich and a few other birds, also with s :
the second or haemapophysial ray of the diverging appendage is deve-
loped in all birds, as in the squamate saurians ; combining the movements

 of the haemal arch of the nasal vertebra with that of the frontal vertebra,
 and consisting of the two styliform ossicles (-0) and ar) which extend from the
 haemapophysis, 21, 21", to the pleurapophysis, 28 : the essential relationship of

the compound ray, 20 and it, with the nasal vertebra, is indicated by their
becoming confluent with its haemapophysis (at 22"), whilst they always main-

tain an arthrodial articulation with the pleurapophysis (2s) of the succeeding

 vertebra.

    The bones of the splanchno-skeleton intercalated with the segments of the
endoskeleton in the bird's skull are the petrosal (le), between the neural
arches of the occipital and parietal vertebra, early coalescing with the ele-
ments of those vertebrae with which it comes in contact : the sclerotals (17),
interposed between the frontal and nasal neural arches : and the thyro-hyals

(47), retained in connection with the debris of the haemal arch of the parietal

Hvertebra, 11. The olfactory capsule remains cartilaginous. The dermal

bone (73) is well-developed and constant : a second supraorbital dermal bone
is occasionally present. All the endoskeletal bones manifest, under every
adaptive modification, the segmental arrangement, and it is difficult to con-
template the repetition of the arrangement of the cranial bones around the
primary segments of the encephalon in the series of arches closed respectively

H H H Hnumber of arches closed below, at iv, iii, 11 and i, without a con-

viction that the type illustrated in fig. 15 is that upon which these seg-
ments of the skull have been constructed. This conclusion might seem
forced, in respect to the occipital vertebra, were its displaced haemal arch
and appendages to be viewed without reference to their relative position and
connections in the lower vertebrate classes ; but it will be confirmed and
shown to be agreeable to nature and to the recognised kinds and grades of
modification to which the elements of one and the same vertebra are subject,
by observing in the young bird the distinct pleurapophysial elements of those
cervical vertebra, beyond which the corresponding elements of the occiput
have retrograded, in obedience to the functions which the haemal arch of
that vertebra and its appendages are destined to perform in the feathered

--class.
   Mammals. If the foregoing views of the general homology of the bones
of the skull be agreeable to their essential nature, we should expect that the
new and additional modifications, in the mammalian class, which tend to
obscure those relations would be seated in the appendages and peripheral
elements of the endoskeletal segments, or in the capsules and appendages of

the special organs of sense.

   1 have selected with a view to testing such anticipation the skull of a young
pachyderm*, and, after successively disarticulating the segments in the order
in which they have been previously described, I have given a side view of
them arranged in correspondence with the figures 2^, 22, and 5. (Fig. 24.)

   The neural arch of the occipital vertebra, Ni, agrees with that of the bird and
crocodile in the coalescence oi t\\e parapophysis, 4, with the neurapophysis,
2 ; but the process, 4, now descends from the lower part of the arch, and,
as in many other mammals, is of great length. An articular condyle is also
developed from each neurapophysis which articulates with the concave an-
terior zygapophysis of the atlas, and is the homotype of the posterior zyga-
pophysis in the trunk-vertebrae. The centrum (1) is reduced, like that of
the atlas, to a compressed plate, and its hinder articular surface is not more

developed than is the front one of the centrum of the atlas, with which, in-
deed, it is loosely connected by ligament. The expanse of the occipital
spine, 3, has been governed, agreeably with a foregoing remark, by the su-

perior development of the cerebellum.
   The haemal arch of the occipital vertebra is represented, like those of the

cervical vertebra, by the plenrapophysial elements only (si); but these, in
most mammals, are developed into broad triangular plates with outstanding
processes: that called ' spine' and 'acromion' is exogenous ; but that called
'coracoid' is always developed from an independent osseous centre (a rudi-
mental representative of the hcemapophysis, 52), which coalesces with the
pleurapophysis in mammalia, and only attains its normal proportions, com-
pleting the arch with the haemal spine (episternum) in the monotremes.

   In many mammals the arch is completed by bones, which are, apparently,
the haemapophyses of the atlas, e.g. in man (fig. 25, 52'), which have followed
the occipital haemal arch in its backward displacement, but not quite to the
same extent.

   The diverging appendage, though retaining the general features of its
primitive radiated form, has been the seat of great development and much
modification and adjustment of its different subdivisions (53-57) in relation
to the locomotive office it is now called upon to perform.

    With the exception of this excess of development of the appendage, the
defective development and displacement of the haemal arch, and the coales-
cence of the parapophyses in the neural arch, there are few points of resem-

N Hblance which are not sufficiently salient between the segment i, i in the

mammal, and that so marked in the fish (fig. 5). And, if the interpretation
of the more normal condition of this segment in the lower vertebrate, ac-

cording to the archetypal vertebra, fig. 15, be accepted, then the explana-
tion of the nature of the modifications of the special homologues of the con-
stituents of the occipital segment by which that archetype is masked in the

mammal, may be confidently left to the judgement of the unbiassed student

of homological anatomy.
    In commencing his comparisons of the second segment of the skull with the

typical vertebra, he will be unexpectedly gratified by finding, in the immature

Hmammal, the centrum, 5, naturally distinct, and the haemal arch, 11, retaining

its natural connections with the rest of the segment, and by means of a more
 complete development of the pleurapophyses (as) than in any of the inferior

air-breathing vertebrates. He may now separate, without artificial division of

 any compound bone, the entire parietal segment, but he brings away with it
 the petrified capsule of the acoustic organ, and the anchylosed distal piece (27)
 of the maxillary appendage, which more or less encumbers and conceals the
 typical character of the neural arch of the parietal vertebra in every mammal
 least so, liowever, in the monotremes and ruminants. The neurapophyses (a)
 of the parietal vertebra, like the mesencephalic segment of the brain, are but
 little more developed in mammals than in the cold-blooded classes : they are
 notched in the hog and perforated in the sheep by the larger divisions of
 the trigeminal, and they send down an exogenous process, which articulates
 and sometimes coalesces with the appendage (m) of the palato-maxillary
 arch. The neural spine (r), always developed from two centres, often vastly
 expanded, and sometimes complicated with a third intercalary or inter-
 parietal osseous piece, is occasionallj^ uplifted and removed from its neur-
 apophyses by the interposed squamous expansion of the bone -n ; but this,
 which reminds one of the occasional separation of the neural arch from the
 centrum of the atlas in fishes, is a rare modification in the mammalian class.

 A still rarer one is the separation of the halves of the parieto-neural spine
ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                           299

from each other by the extension and mutual junction at the median line

Aof the occipital and frontal spines.  specimen of this, in a species of

Cebus, which repeats the common modification of the parts in fislies, is pre-

served in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. The parapophysis

(3) always commences as an autogenous element by a distinct centre of ossi-
fication, as shown in the human foetus, iig. 11,8; it speedily coalesces with

the petrosal, but otherwise retains its individuality in some of the lower mam-

mals, as e.g. in the echidna (fig. 12, s) : or it coalesces with the curtailed

frontal pleurapophysis 28, or with the maxillary appendage 27, or with both

these and the pleurapophysis of its own vertebra (as), when the complex

'temporal bone' of anthropotomy is the result. In most mammals iha pleur-

apophysis (ss) retains its primitive independency and rib-like form, with

usually the 'head' and 'tubercle'; but by reason of its arrested growth it

has been called ' styloid' bone or process. Sometimes it is separated from

the short hcemapophysis, 40, by a long ligamentous tract, sometimes it is imme-

diately articulated with it,- or by an intervening piece. The haemal spine, 41,
is usually small, but thick and always single. The rudiments of hypobranchial

elements (40) are retained as diverging appendages of the parieto-hasmal arch
in all mammals, and have received the special names of ' posterior cornua,'

or ' thyrohyals,' from their subservient relationship to the larynx.

    In the frontal segment the centrum, 9, and neurapophyses, 10, very early

coalesce. Two separate osseous centres mark out the body (fig. 26, C, 9 ),

and each neurapophysis has two distinct centres (ib. 10, 10), the optic foramina

(op) being first surrounded by the course of the ossification from these

points. The superior development of the neurapophysial plates (10), as com-
pared with those of the parietal vertebra (e), in most mammals, harmonizes

with the greater development of the prosencephalon ; but the chief bulk of

this segment of the brain is protected by the expanded spines of the frontal (11)

and parietal(7) vertebrse, and by the intercalated squamosals (27). And the ap-

pendicular piece (27) not onlyusurpssomeof the functions of the proper cranial

neurapophyses, but, likewise, the noriTial office of the frontal pleurapophysis

(23), in the support, viz. of the distal elements of the haemal arch (29, 32),

which now articulate directly with 27, in place of 28 as in all oviparous verte-

brates. The tme pleurapophysis of the frontal vertebra (2s) is almost re-

stricted in the mammalian class to functions in subserviency to the organ

of hearing, is sometimes swollen into a large bulla ossea, like the parapophyses

and pleurapophyses of the cervical vertebrae of Colitis ; it is sometimes pro-
duced into along auditory tube, and sometimes reduced to the ring supporting

the tympanic membrane. Yet, under all these changes, since its special ho-

mology is demonstrable with 28 in the bird (fig, 23) and crocodile (fig. 22) as
well as with the teleologically compound bone, 2s a, b, c, d, in the fish (fig. г),
so likewise must its general homology, which is so plainly manifested in

the fish, be equally recognised. The frontal hcemapophysis (fig. 24, 29, 30),
and the corresponding half of the hcemal spine {ib. 32) are connate on each

Hside in all mammals, and become confluent at iii, in most. The heemal

arch of the frontal segment of the skull, as in other air-breathing vertebrates,

has no diverging appendage, unless the tympanic otosteals be so regarded,

an idea which is not borne out by their development.

  HThe nasal segment (N iv, iv) is chiefly complicated by the confluence of

parts of the enormously developed olfactory capsules (is) in the mammalian

class, and its typical character is masked by the compression and mutual coa-
lescence of the neurapophyses, n. The centrum is usually much elongated,
as at 13, and soon coalesces with both neurapophyses (14) and nasal capsules
in the hog. The neural spine (15) is usually divided, but is sometimes single,

e. g. in Simia. In the rhinoceros it supports a dermal spine or horn. The

pleiirapophysis (20) or proximal element of the haemal arch of the nasal ver-
tebra has its real character and import almost concealed by the excessive

development of the second element of the arch (21), which resumes in mam-

mals all those extensive collateral connections which it presented in the cro-
codile ; and to which are sometimes added attachments to the expanded spine
of the frontal vertebra, as well as to that of its own segment. The pleurapo-
phj'sis however, besides its normal attachment to its centrum, 13, sends up a
process to the orbit, in order to effect a junction with its neurapophysis which
sometimes appears there, as the ' os planum' of antliropotomy. The hcEmal
spine (22) is developed in two moieties, which never coalesce together, al-
though, in the higher apes, and at a very early period in man, each half
coalesces with the haemapophysis, and repeats the simple character of the
 corresponding elements (rami) of the succeeding (mandibular) arch.

    The appendicular element (24) which diverges from the pleurapophysis
 (20), contributes to fix and strengthen the palato-maxillary arch by attaching
it to the descending process of the parietal centrum (5) ; with which, in most
mammals, it ultimately coalesces. The other elements of the diverging mem-
ber of the arch correspond in number and in the point of their divergence
with those in birds, chelonians and crocodiles. They are two in number, suc-
 ceeding each other, and both become the seat of that expansive development
 which is followed by the multiplication of their points of connection ; thus
 the proximal piece ('malar' 20) articulates in the hog not only with the
 haemapophysis (21) from which it diverges, but likewise with the muco-dermal
bone, 73. The distal piece of the appendage (squamosal, 2?) expands as it
 diverges, and fixes the naso-haemal arch not only to the frontal pleurapo-
 physis (23), but also to the frontal, parietal and occipital neurapophyses and
 spines : it also affords, in the hog, as in other mammals, an articular surface

 to the frontal haemapophysis (29).

    The development of an osseous, centre in the cartilage of the snout of
 the hog, and the homologous .' preiiasal' ossicle in certain fishes, the carp,
e. g., might be regarded as rudiments of terminal abortive segments more
 anterior than the nasal vertebra. The multiplied points of ossification in the
 vomer have been, also, deemed indications of that bone being, like the vome-
 rine coccygeal bone in birds, a coalescence of several vertebral bodies. Of
 course, a priori, the segments in the cranial region of the endoskeleton
 might as reasonably be expected to vary in number in different species, as
 the segments in the thoracic or sacral regions. I have not, however, been
 able to determine clear and satisfactorj' representatives of more than four
 vertebree in the skull of any animal ; and the special ossifications in the nasal
 cartilages appear to me to belong to the same category of osseous parts, as
 the palpebral bones in certain crocodiles and the otosteals.

  --Man. Arriving, finally, in the ascensive survey and comparison of the

 archetypal relations of the bones of the vertebrate skull,at Man, the highest and
 most modified of all organic forms, in which the dominion of the controlling
 and specially adapting force over the lower tendency to type and vegetative

 repetition is manifested in the strongest characters, we, nevertheless, find the

 vertebrate pattern so obviously retained, and the mammalian modification of it,
 as illustrated in the preceding paragraph and diagram, so closely adhered to,
 as to call for a brief notice only of those developments of the common
 elements which impress upon the human skull its characteristic form and

 proportions.

    The neural arch of the occipital vertebra differs from that of the hog by
 a much greater development of the neural spine (fig. 25, 3) and a much less

        development of the parapophysis. This, as in other mammals, is not only an
        exogenous process of the neurapophysis, 2, but is commonly reduced to a
        mere " scabrous ridge extended from the middle of the condyle towards the

    --root of the mastoid process" (Monro, I.e. p. 72) the " eminentia aspera

        musculum rectum lateralem excipiens " of Soeramerring : the knowledge of
        its general homology, however, makes quite intelligible and gives its true
        Interest to the occasional development of this ridge into a ' paramastoid
        process, which now, however, projects, like the true ' mastoid,' downwards
        from the basal aspect of the cranium (ante, p. 204).

           The occipital pleiirapophysis, pi, 51, shows the same displacement as in
        other mammals, but is still more expanded in the direction of the trunk's
       axis, and its exogenous (acromial) process is still more developed. The hcem-
        apophysis (52), originally distinct, has its development checked and speedily

         coalesces with the pleurapophysis.

     --If the bone 52' be the special homologue of the bone, 58, in the fish, and

        considering the backward displacement of 51 and 52, its anterior position to

    --them in man is no valid argument against the determination, then we may

r adopt the same general homology, and regard the clavicle, in its relations to
        the vertebrate archetype, as the displaced ha^mapophysial element of the
        atlas, to which segment its true relative position is shown in the same low
        organized class in which the typical position of the scapular arch is likewise

         retained.

          The adaptive developments of the radiated appendage of the occipital
      haemal arch reach their maximum in man, and the distal segment of the ap-
       pendage constitutes in him an organ which the greatest of ancient philoso-
       phers has defined as the "fit instrument of the rational soul ;" and which

  --╖ the first of modern physiologists has described " as belonging exclusively to
      man as the part to which the whole frame must conform"*. And these ex-
       pressions give no exaggerated idea of the exquisite mechanism and adjust-

       ment of its parts.
           It is no mere transcendental dream, but true knowledge and legitimate

        fruit of inductive research, that clear insight into the essential nature of the
       organ, which is acquired by tracing it step by step from the unbranched

        pectoral ray of the protopterus to the equally small and slender but bifid
        pectoral ray of the amphiume, thence to the similar but trifid ray of the
        proteus, and through the progressively superadded structures and perfec-
       tions in higher reptiles and in mammals. If the special homology of each
        part of the diverging appendage and its supporting arch are recognisable

      from Man to the fish, shall we close the mind's eye to the evidences of that

       higher law of archetypal conformity on which the very power of tracing the
       lower and more special correspondences depend ?

   The centrum, 5 c, of the parietal vertebra gives, in the human fcetus, the
same evidence of its essential individualitj', by the same absence of the mask
of connation which somewhat concealed it in the oviparous classes, as
we have alread}' noticed in the lower mammal (fig. 24). The neurapo-
physes (c) rise higher to reach their properлpme(7)in the lofty cranial dome
of man, of which that divided and enormously expanded element forms the

greatest part of the roof: but the base of the neurapophysis continues to be
perforated by the homologous divisions of the nerve (tr) that notches it in

the cod-fish (fig. 5, e tr). The parapophysis (s) retains its autogenous or

independent character in relation to its proper neural arch, the ' additamental'
suture by which it manifests its normal relations to the neural spine (7) being
persistent ; but it speedily coalesces with the acoustic capsule, le (from
which it is artificially separated in fig. 25), and with the modified plenrapo-

physis, 28, as has been already explained in the chapter on ' Special Homo-

logy' (Mastoid, pp. 197-210).
    The ^TO^er pleurapophysis (ss) of the parietal vertebra ordinarily becomes

confluent with contiguous and coalesced portions of the parapophysis, g, and

 acoustic capsule, le ; and the ossified portion of the h(emapophysis, 40 h, is
 separated from it by a long ligamentous tract, and becomes confluent with
the hcemal spiiie, Aihs. The entire inverted arch exhibits the usual arrested
 growth characteristic of the air-breathing vertebrates, and its appendages
 are represented by the still retained ' hypobranchial' elements, 46, of the

splanchnic arches, which are so voluminously developed in the fish.

    The centrum and neurapophyses (9, 10) of the frontal vertebra manifest the
 same speedy coalescence as in other mammals. The spine, n, though developed
from two lateral moieties, regains its normal unity, as a general rule, in man
 by the obliteration of the median suture : its transverse and vertical expanse
 here attain their maximum. The /jar(7/>o/j%52s (12) is developed, as in the
 occipital segment, as an exogenous process, called ' external angular or or-

 bital' in anthropotomy, but from the neural spine instead of the neurapo-
 physis. This element is perforated by its characteristic nerve (op). The pleur-

 apophysis, 28, is now separated from its parapophysis, 12, by both parts, 27 and

 20, of the diverging appendage of the maxillary arch ; but yet it is interesting
 to note that it is still connected through the medium of these with the same

 element to which, agreeably with the greater retention of the vertebrate

 archetype, it directly articulates in the fish (fig. 5, 12, 2s a-d). The inter-
 calated piece (27) further interposes itself, as in other mammals, between
 the pleurapophysis, 28, and haemapophysis, 23, of the frontal segment, directly
 articulating with the latter and leaving the proximal element of the arch (28)
 reduced in man to its subordinate function of sustaining the ear-drum. The
 hcet)iapopkysis,29,and hcemal spine, 32, are connate, and soon coalesce with their

in the Anguis, Pseudopus, and some other limbless and snake-like lizards. The usual pre-

dominating development of the scapular appendage has bred so prevalent an idea of the sub-

ordinate character of the supporting arch, that the existence of the arch minus the ajjpend-

age, is adverted to not without a note of surprise in the above-cited and other excellent works.

General homology, however, teaches that a vertebral arch is a more constant and hnportant

part than its appendages ; and, that, being anterior in the order of development, it may be

expected, in cases where development is arrested, whether normally in accordance with the

natMe of the species or abnormally as an individual defect, to be present when the diverging

appendages are absent. Sir Chai-les Bell, well recognising the primaiy function of the modi-

Wefied occipital rib in relation to breathing, observes, in reference to the above-cited case, "

would do well to remember this double office of the scapula and its muscles, that, whilst it is

the very foundation of the bones of the upper extremity, and never wanting in any animal

that has the most remote resemblance to an arm, it is the centre and point d'appui of the

muscles of respiration, and  acts  in  that capacity where there  are no  extremities at                    !

                                                                                          all

          opposites at the symphysis inenti ; and the whole distal portion of the inverted
          arch of the frontal segment is then formed by a continuous bar of bone, modi-
          fied in its form and articulation, and by its dental appendages, in subserviency
        to mastication and other subordinate functions in relation to the human mouth.

         We recognise the centrum of the nasal vertebra in the human skull by the

         position and connections of the bone, 13, notwithstanding it has undergone
         as extreme a divergence from the ordinary cylindrical shape of such elements,
         as its homotype at the opposite extreme of the vertebral column in birds,
         which Cuvier compares to a 'soc-de-charrue' : it is, in fact, more compressed
         and vertically developed than in the hog (fig. 24, 13) ; but it is shorter, and
         commonly retains its original individuality. It directly supports the similarly
         modified compressed, and also, coalesced neurapophyses, u, which termi-
         nating in like manner the series of their vertebral homotypes anteriorly, have
         undergone the extremest modification. But the arguments which show the

        coalesced prefrontals of the frog, the bird and the mammal to be the special

         homologues of the bones so called in the fish, establish, as a corollary, their
        general homology with those bones, which retain in so much greater a degree,
         and unmistakeably, their neurapophysial characters in that lowest class of
        cold-blooded vertebrates. The nature of tlie additional complication by

        which those vertebral or archetypal characters are further masked in mam-

         mals, has been already explained in relation to the nasal neurapophyses of
        the hog. The olfactory nerves are transmitted in man, as in that and most

I other inferior mammals, by numerous foramina, 14, ol. The ^lasal spine, 15, is
         divided, but much-restricted in its growth, and presents a singular contrast

          in that respect to its homotypes, 1 1, 7, 3, in the succeeding cranial vertebrae.

        The development of the neural arch of the nasal vertebra is so modified in
         man, so contracted as well as retracted, that the orbits, instead of being
         pushed apart and directed laterally, have approximated by a kind of reci-
         procal rotation towards the median plane, and have thus gained a directly

           anterior aspect.

             General homology perhaps best explains the import of the continuation
         of the small and seemingly insignificant bones (20, pi) from the roof of the
        mouth " up the back part of the nostrils to the orbit," where they are
         connected "to the ossa plana and cellulcB ethmoidece by the ethmoid suture."
        That the connection is the best possible for the functions of the bone we
        may feel assured, without the sentiment being damped by discerning in it,
         at the same time, the attempt to retain the type, and repeat those constant con-
         nections of thepleurapophysis in question, not only with its centrum (vomer),
         but also with the modified neurapophyses of its proper segment (prefron-
        tals with coalesced olfactory capsules constituting the compound ' ethmoid
        bone ' of anthropotomy). The connections of the pleurapophysis, 20, with its
         hsemapophysis, 21, in front, and its diverging appendage, 24, behind, are also
        retained in man ; and in short, all those characters that, depending on the
         essential nature of the palatine bone as the pleurapophysis of its vertebral
        segment, have served to indicate its special homology from man to the fish,
         without doubt or difficulty, to all anatomists (see Table I.).

            The hcemapophysis (20) has the usual mammalian expansion, but is unu-
         sually short in man, and coalesces unusually early with the corresponding
         moiety of the hcemal spine. (22). Besides the normal and constant connec-
         tions with 20 and 22, the haemapophysis, 21, articulates with its fellow, with
         the centrum (13), neurapophysis (i4, os planum), and spine (15), of its
        own vertebra, with the spine of the frontal vertebra (11), with the detached
         portion of the olfactory cap^^ule (10), and with the muco-dermal bone (73).

          It also affords a large surface of attachment to the proximal piece of
--304 REPORT 1846.

its diverging appendage (ae), which, in addition to the more constant con-
nections with 21 and 27, articulates in man with the neurapopliysis (10)
and parapophysis (12) of the frontal vertebra. The distal extremity of the
second bone (27) of the diverging appendage attains its maximum of expan-
sion in man, and besides its connection with 26, and the glenoid articulation
for the haemapophysis, 29, it joins the parietal neurapophysis, e, and spine, 7,
and sometimes also (in the melanian race) the spine (11) of the frontal ver-
tebra : and it speedily coalesces with the reduced pleurapophysis, 2s, of the
frontal vertebra, and with the parapophysis (s) of the parietal vertebra, to-
gether with a portion of the capsule of the acoustic organ.

   In reviewing the general characters of the human skull in reference to the
vertebrate archetype, we find the occipital segment simplified by the atrophy
and connation of its parapophyses and haemapophyses ; and modified chiefly
by the excessive growth of its neural spine and pleurapophyses, and by the
backward displacement of the latter element, as in all other air-breathing
vertebrates. The parietal segment, retaining, like the occipital one, the more
normal proportions of its centrum and neurapophyses, is still more remark-
able for the vast expanse of its permanently bifid spine. As in most cold-

blooded vertebrates, the parapophysis preserves its independence in respect of

the neural arch of its own segment. The haemal arch retains its almost fcetal
proportions, but is less displaced than in some of the inferior air-breathing
vertebrates. The primitive individuality of the centrum o: the parietal vertebra
is a feature by which the human subject, together with all other mammals,

manifests a closer adhesion to type than is observable in this part of the skull
in any of the oviparous vertebrates, and it shows the necessity of extending
comparisons over the entire series, and not deducing the vertebrate arche-

type exclusively from those inferior forms : for although it may be upon the

whole best retained in them, yet the modifications superinduced in subser-
viency to their exigences, and by which they diverge to that extent from the

common plan, and, as a series of species, from the common vertebrate stem,
may affect a part which the conditions of existence of higher forms do not
require to be so masked. The early ossification and large proportional size
of the hyoidean arch in the human embryo is very significant of its true

nature and importance, in relation to the archetypal vertebrate structure,
i. e. as being the haemal complement of a primary segment of the skull.

    Exogenous processes descend, like the pair from beneath the lower cer-
vical vertebrae of some birds, from the body of the parietal vertebra; but
the true transverse processes are the mastoids, which always articulate with

a corner of the parietals.

   The centrum and neui-apophyses of the frontal segment retain their ordi-
nary proportions, and the spine is again the element which, by its extreme
expansion and its modification in subserviency to the formation of the orbits,
chiefly masks the typical features of the neural arch. The parapophysis is
connate and reduced in size, and its vertebral relations with the pleurapo-
physis of its segment interrupted by the interposition of the diverging appen-
dage from the antecedent haemal arch : the unusually expanded distal end
of the same appendage also intervenes between the frontal pleur- and haem-
apophyses ; the pleurapophysis (23) being more atrophied in man than in
most inferior mammals. The haemapophysis and spine are on the other
hand much developed and modified as above described, for the business of
mastication, though relatively shorter than in other mammals.

   The compression and extension, both vertically and longitudinally, of the
centrum (is), the compression and coalescence of the neurapophyses (i4),both
with each other and the nasal capsules (rs), and tlie corresponding proportions
ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  305

of the divided spine (is), mainly characterize the neural arch (N iv) of the
terminal or nasal segment of the human skull. The early coalescence of each

haemapophysis(2i)with the corresponding half of the divided haemal spine (22),
and the unusual expansion of the bones, especially the second (27), which
diverge from the haemapophysis, form the chief characteristics of the haemal

arch (H iv) of the nasal segment. The haemapophysial portions of both the
nasal and frontal vertebrae are much less elongated than in most other

animals.

   It may serve to test the accuracy of the general homologies here assigned
to the bones of the human skull, if we notice the degree to which they have

been subject to modification in connection with such determinations.
    According to the general character of the vertebral elements in the rest of

the frame, we should be prepared to expect that the haemal arches would be
subject to a greater variety in respect of development and relative position
to their segments than the neural arches ; and that in the latter the parts
determined as centrums and neurapophyses would retain more of the or-
dinary proportions of such parts in other segments or in other animals, than
the peripherally situated spines. If new bones are added, we should expect
to find them in the relative position of appendages to the normal vertebral
arches : or should these be homologous with similar superadditions in the
skulls of lower animals, they will probably be the seat of more extensive

changes of form, proportion and connections, than the elements of the verte-

bral arches themselves.

   Now if the reader will glance at fig. 25 and compare the bones forming

the segments of the skull with those in figs. 24, 23, 22 and 5, he cannot but be
struck with the remarkable degree of uniformity in the dimensions of the
bones 2, e and 10 : no. 14 being the terminal neurapophysis, has been the seat
of more variety ; but the general steadiness of this series of bones in regard
to their dimensions and connections accords with the characters assigned to
them, as neurapophyses, which are always the most constant and important

of the ossified vertebral elements.

   The bones 1, 5, 9 and 13 equally conform in the kind and degree of their

modifications with their determination as the bodies of the vertebrae.

   The increasing capacity of the neural canal of the head, demanded for the
lodgment of the progressively expanded encephalonas the vertebral scale rises,
is chiefly acquired by the expansion of the bones, 3, 7, u, which, being deter-
mined as 'neural spines' in the fish, might be expected to be subject to greater
deviations from their typical form and proportions than the more central
and essential parts of the neural arches. The terminal neural spine, 15, is
subject to still greater varieties in the range of species, as might also be ex-
pected from its position. In one mammal, e. g. the porcupine, it is more
expanded than any of its succeeding homotypes in the cranium ; in man its
proportions are so much reduced as greatly to mask the homotypal relation.
In one mammal, e. g. the orang, the nasal spine is not only diminutive but
single : in another mammal, e. g. the manatee, it is also diminutive but di-
vided, and the halves completely separated by the intervention of part of the

succeeding spine.

   The abnormal conditions of the human skull give further illustration of the
truth of these general homologies of the cranial bones, and reciprocally re-

ceive light from such determinations. In the case of idiots from defective
growth or development of the brain, where the cavity of the cranium is re-
duced to half or less than half its normal capacity, as e. g. in the skull described

and figured in my ' Memoir on the Osteology of the Chimpanzee*,' it might

have been expected from the anthropotomical ideas of the cranial bones,
according to which no one bone is deemed either more or less important
than another in its essential nature, and where the squamosal is as little re-
garded in the light of a superadded or intercalary piece as the alisphenoid,
that all would be reduced in the same proportion in forming the parietes of
the contracted brain-chamber. But this is by no means the case. In the
instance above-cited the basioccipital and basisphenoid have been developed
to their usual size, and the distance from the posterior boundary of the bony

palate to the anterior border of the foramen magnum is as great as in any
normal skull. The exoccipitals (condyloid portions of the occiput), the

alisphenoids and the orbitosphenoids retain in like manner their full dimen-
sions. The distance between the frontal and temporal bones is as great as
in the average of fully developed Caucasian skulls, and is greater than in
most of those from the Melanian race, in which the direct junction of the
frontal with the temporal, as in the chimpanzee, is by no means rare. The
contraction of the capacity of the brain-chamber is due chiefly to arrested
development of the frontals, parietals, supraoccipital and squamosals. By
the reduction of the supraoccipital and the retention of the centrums of the
cranial vertebrae of their normal proportions, the foramen magnum becomes
situated nearer the back part of the basis cranii than in the normal skull.

   In a still smaller cranium of a female idiot, who reached the age of twenty-

one years, which is preserved with the male idiot's skull above-mentioned in

the anatomical museum of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the contrast between

the normal proportions of the basioccipital, basisphenoid, exoccipitals, ali-
sphenoids and orbitosphenoids, on the one hand, and the reduced dimensions
of the supraoccipital, parietals, frontals and squamosals on the other, is still
more striking and significant of the true nature of those bones. The normal
growth of the centrums, indeed, might be explained by the concomitant nearly
normal size of the medulla oblongata, base of third ventricle and optic chi-
asma, in the brain of the same idiot : but it is not so obvious from the con-
dition of the brain itself why the alisphenoid should not have shrunk in the

same proportion as the parietals, frontals and squamosals. To the homologist,

however, the recognised difference of subjectivity to modification presented
by the neurapophyses, spines and diverging appendages of the typical seg-
ments, renders very intelligible the partial seats of arrested growth in the

bones of these idiots' crania.
   In reference to disease, also, one sees not why the alisphenoid should have

a minor attraction for the morbid products deposited, or be less subject to
the destructive actions excited, during syphilitic or mercurial disease, than
the parietals, or the orbitosphenoids than the frontals, or the exoccipitals
than the supraoccipital : yet it needs but to examine any series of such
morbid skulls in our museums of pathology to be convinced that the variable
and peripheral elements of the neural arches, viz. their expanded spines, are
almost exclusively so affected : the frontal and parietal being the most

common seats of the disease ; the supraoccipital a less frequent one, concomi-

tantlv with its minor deviation from the typical standard of the element. I have
yet seen no example in which either a cranio-vertebral centrum or ueura-
pophysis was so affected ; but the nasal bones are notoriously attacked.

  --It would be easy to multiply such instances of the new light new eyes,

--so to speak, with which human anatomy, normal and abnormal, is viewed,

after the essential nature or general homology of the parts have been appre-

ciated.

    If the bones 4, s, 12, fig. 5, have been correctly determined as the parapo-
physes of the cranial vertebrae, they might be expected to be subject in the

course of adaptive modification to the loss of their individuality, and from

autogenous elements to be reduced to the condition of exogenous processes.

Now this is exactly what we trace in the series of vertebrate skulls ; and we

are further prepared to expect that the simplification of the segment forming

the anterior extremity of the vertebral series will be in part effected by the

total disappearance of its least important elements, the parapophyses. These

are, in fact, absent in the nasal vertebra in all animals ; they become con-

fluent with the occipital vertebra in most reptiles and all warm-blooded ani-

mals ; and in the latter, we find, with the exception of a few birds, that the

parapophyses of the frontal vertebrae have likewise lost their individuality.

   The first endoskeletal bones which plainly disappear from the skull in

tracing its modifications upwards from fishes are those which, in the present

vertebral theory, have been referred to the category of diverging appendages

viz. the entopterygoid (fig. 5,23), the operculars (ib. 34-37), and the branchi-
ostegals (ib. 44). The first bones that we discover to be plainly superadded

to those that remain after the above subtraction, in the skull of the reptiles,

for example, are, also, referable, in the present vertebral theory, to the same

variable and inconstant class of elements : they are the ectopterygoids (fig.

22, 24'), the malars (figs. 22 to 25, 20) and the squamosals (ib. 27) ; and are,
in general homology, diverging appendages of the palato-maxillary arch.

They are subject to more inconstancy as to their existence than the more

regular and normal elements of the skull : some reptiles, for example, have

the malar and squamosal, whilst others want them ; most reptiles have the

ectopterygoid, but this, which is not present in fishes, is again taken away in

the warm-blooded vertebrates. With reference to inconstancy of form and

connections no bone of the cranium exceeds the squamosal, and it is precisely

this distal element of the diverging appendage, which, through its inordinate

development, most masks the archetypal character of the human cranium

the bones of the skull is essential to that of their general homology,and aknow-

ledge of their general homology is indispensable to their natural classification.

Cuvier divides the bones of the head in all animals into bones of the cra-

nium and bones of the face.

   The boues of the cranium are those of the cavity containing the brain :
all the rest are bones of the face and contribute to form the cavities for the

organs of sight, smell and taste*. But these primary divisions do not in-

clude the same bones in all animals : the nasal (fig. 5, 15) and vomer (ib. 13)
are cranial bones in fishes, but not in mammals : the squamosal (fig. 25, 27) is
a cranial bone in mammals and not in birds or reptiles, &c. And this dis-

crepancy in the Cuvierian classification of cranial bones is due, not only to a

non- appreciation of their essential nature, but partly to mistakes of special

homologies : thus the nasal is called ethmoid in the fish, and the squamosal

is called jugal in the bird.

    In all anthropotomical classifications the bones of the cranium are reckoned
eight in number : four single, viz.

The frontal (fig. 25, 11);
The ethmoidal (ib. u and is) ;
The sphenoidal (5, g, 9, 10 and 24) ;
The occipital (1, 2 and a) : and

four in pairs, viz.

The two parietal (7), and
The two temporal (s, lo, 27, 23 and 3s).

The bones of the face are reckoned as fourteen in number, viz.

The two malar (26)
The two maxillary (21, 22) ;
The two palatal (20) ;
The two nasal (15) ;
The two turbinal (19) ;
The vomer (13), and
The mandible (29-.ir.),

   The detached portion of the hyoid arch (40, 41) and its appendages (47),
togetiier with the whole of the scapular arch and its appendages, are excluded

from the category of the bones of the head.

   The natural classification of the bones of the human skull appears to me

to be, first into those of

      The Endo-skeleton,

The Splanchno-skeleton, and

The EXO-SKELETON.

The primary division of the bones of the endo-skeleton is into the four seg-

ments, called

    N HOccipital vertebra, i, i

    N HParietal vertebra, 11, 11
    N HFrontal vertebra, iii, iii
    N HNasal vertebra, iv, iv.

These are subdivided into the neural arches, called

       Epencephalic arch (1, 2, 3) ;
       Mesencephalic arch (5, 9, 7, s);

      Prosencephalic arch (9, lo, n and 12) ;

        Rhinencephalic arch (13, 14, 15) :
and into the hasmal arches and their appendages, called

Maxillary arch (20, 21 and 22) and appendages (24, 2a, 27) ;

Mandibular arch (28, 29-32)   (no appendage)
                                                                                                      ;

Hyoidean arch (ss, 40, 41) and appendages (45) ;

Scapular arch (51 and 52) and appendages (53-58).

The bones of the splanchno-skeleton, are

       The petrosal (le) and otosteals (le')* ;
      The turbinals (is and 19) and teeth. (The sclerotals retain their primitive
histological condition as fibrous membrane.)

The bones of the exo-skeleton, are
   The lacrj'mals (73).

   * These ossicles are described by most anthropotoinists as parts of the ' temporal bone.'
" Os temporum infantis magnopere ab osse temporum adulti differt ; labyrinthi et ossiculorum

auditus fabrica absoluta est," says Soemmerring in the classical work before cited (t. i.
p. 132). The signification of the differences between the foetal and adult human temporal
bone, which the great anthropotomist truly regarded as so remarkable, is made plain by
anatomy ; which shows the bone to be an assemblage of several essentially distinct ones, and
at the same time exposes the character of that singularly heterogeneous assemblage and
coalescence of osseous elements to meet the exigences of the peculiarly developed frame of
man. What the ' ossicula auditus ' are, is a problem which still awaits careful additional

research in the embryonic development of the haemal arches of the cranium, for its satis-
factory solution. The question is not, of course, whether they are dismemberments of the
'temporal bone,' since tliis has no real claim in any animal to an individual character; but
whether the ossicles of the ear-drum in mammals are to be regarded, like the pedicle of the
eye-ball in the plagiostomous fishes, as appendages to a sense-organ, and thereby as develop-
ments of the splanchno-skeleton; or whether they are, like the tympanic ring, modifications
of the tympano-mandibular arch. The reasons are adduced in the Chapter on ' Special

Homology' (p. 235) which have led me to view them as peculiar mammalian productions

in relation to the exalted functions of a special organ of sense.
       ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                           309

NThe course of coalescence reduces the epencephalic arch (fig. 25, i) to

one bone, the scapular arch to one bone (the arch is apparently completed
by the connexion of an element (52') not appertaining to the skull). The

centrums 5, (9) and neurapophyses (c, lo) of the parietal and frontal vertebrae
coalesce together and with the diverging appendages (24) of the maxillary arch
to form one bone, the ' sphenoid ' of anthropotomy, and this ultimately coa-

lesces with the epencephalic arch and constitutes the ' os spheno-occipitale ' of
Soemmerring. The expanded halves of the parietal spine (7) remaining
usually distinct are reckoned as two bones. The expanded halves of the frontal
spine (u) usually coalescing together form a single bone. The halves of the
nasal spine (13) rarely coalescing are counted as two bones. The mastoid (s)
coalescing with the petrosal (le) and thiswith the tympanic(2s), squamosal (2r)

and stylohyal (ss), the whole is reckoned a single bone, which thus combines

a parapophysis and pleurapophysis of one vertebra with a pleurapophysis of

another and a diverging appendage of a third vertebra, and all these parts of

the endo-skeleton become confluent with a sense-capsule belonging to the
splanchno-skeleton : such is the heterogeneous compound character of the
' temporal bone ' of anthropotomy. The neurapophyses of the nasal vertebra

(14) coalesce with each other and with a considerable part of another ossified
sense-capsule (is), to form the single bone called ' ethmoid.' The maxillary

bone includes the superior maxillary (21) and premaxillary (22) of the lower

animals. The hyoid bone includes the basihyal (41), with the ceratohyals (40)
and the thyrohyals (45). The scapula includes both the pleurapophysis (51}
and the hsemapophysis (52) of the occipito-haemal arch. The signification of
the separate points of ossification of the human foetal skull is made plain by

the foregoing applications of the ascertained general homologies of the bones

of that part of the skeleton.

  --Objections to the Cranial vertebrce considered. The latest and most formal

objection to the fundamental idea on which the general homologies of the

bones of the head have been worked out in the present Report, is also

the most formidable in respect of the great and deserved eminence of the
objector. In a manuscript left by Baron Cuvier, entitled, " Le crane est-il
une vertebre ou un compose de trois ou quatre vertebres ?" appended to

the posthumous edition of the 'Lemons d'Anatomie Comparee*,' he admits

that "the analogy of the basilar and two condyloid parts of the occiput with

the body and two halves of the annular part of the atlas is very appreciable.

The basioccipital and the body of the atlas serve equally to support the

myelon ; the exoccipitals and the two halves of the ring of the atlas to cover it.
The condyles are represented by the articular processes by which the atlas is
joined to the dentata. The condyloid foramen, which gives passage to the

nerve of the ninth pair, has some relation with the hole in the atlas which

gives passage to the first cervical nerve and to the first bend of the vertebral
artery. Some have also found a certain relation between the mastoid process,

which in most animals appertains to the occipital bone, and the transverse

process of the atlas and the other vertebrae ; upon which it must be remarked
that these relations are less in man, in some respects, than in the quadrupeds,

since the atlas has commonly only a notch for the passage of the artery, and

pare," Cuvier saj's, " the supraoccipital to the spinous processes which in
certain animals originate by special points of ossification and remain for some
time distinct from the rest of the vertebra : nevertheless, there is already here
a great difference of strncture and function *." With regard to the points in
which Cuvier is willing to admit an ' analogy' between the occiput and the

--atlas, he subjoins, agreeably with his idea of the law which governed such

correspondences, " These resemblances might naturally be expected in the
part of the head placed at the extremity of the vertebral column, and the
functions of which are, in fact, analogous to those of vertebrae, since it gives

passage, like them, to the great neural axisf."
    With regard to the feature of resemblance (quelque rapport) which some

had seen between the mastoid process and a transverse process, Cuvier founds
his objection to its application to the vertebral character of the occipital
bone on a false homology. Concluding that the mastoid in man (fig. 25, s)
was homologous with the paroccipital in the hog (fig. 22, 4)J and some
other quadrupeds, he deems the determination of the paroccipital as the
transverse process of the occipital vertebra to be invalidated by the fact
that the ' mastoid ' belongs, in man, not to the occipital but to the petrosal.
There were cases, however, not unknown to the able Editors of the posthu-
mous edition of the ' Lemons d'Anatomie Comparee,' where the true trans-
verse processes of the occipital vertebra, though exogenous, like those of the
succeeding trunk-vertebrae in man, had become developed to an equal extent
with such transverse processes ; the abnormality of the human occipital thus
repeating its normal condition in the quadruped. They however do not cite
these instances, or notice the confusion by their author of the true mastoid
with the paroccipital in reference to this his first objection to the vertebral
homology of the occipital segment. But it might further have been re-
marked, in respect of the segment of the skull to which the mastoid really
stands in parapophysial relation, that although the mastoid belongs in man to
the petrosal in the sense of being anchylosed with it, it articulates with the
parietal ; and the persistence or obliteration of a primitive suture is too vari-
able a phaenomenon to determine to which of two bones a third connected with
both essentially belongs. The constant existence of the paroccipital either
as an autogenous element or an exogenous transverse process in all the

oviparous vertebrate classes, its common existence in mammals, and occa-

sional, though rare, development in man, establish that additional, though
bv no means essential vertebral character in the occipital segment, which

ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  311

Cuvier seeks to obscure by the normal absence of its proper transverse pro-
cesses in man, and the assumed transference of them to another part of the

skull.

    Cuvier in the next place objects to the comparison of the supraoccipital
with the neural spine of a trunk-vertebra, " because of its vast difference of

structure and function." He does not specify the nature of the difference :

he admits that the neural spines have distinct centres of ossification in certain
animals ; and all will allow that, in most of the trunk-vertebrae of such, the
neural canal is closed by the coadapted ends of the neurapophyses to which
the spine articulates or becomes anchylosed : that therefore such spine does not
directly cover the neural axis, but, retaining the shape signified by its name,

performs exclusively the function in relation to muscular attachments. At
first view the conti-ast seems conclusive against all homology between such
mere intermuscular spine and the broad thin convex plate applied over the
cerebellum and posterior cerebral lobes in man. And it must be confessed

that the determination of their general homological relations could not have
been satisfactorily demonstrated by the mere relations of the parts to the

laminae supporting them, in so limited a range of comparison. But, if we
descend to the fish, we shall find the supraoccipital equally excluded from
the neural canal by the meeting of the exoccipitals beneath its base ; we

shall, also, see it still retaining the spinous figure, indicating its function in
relation to muscular attachments to predominate over that in subserviency

to the protection of the epencephalon. If we next ascend to the crocodile,
we shall find the neural spine of the atlas to be one of those examples alluded
to by Cuvier, where the ossification proceeds from an independent centre
and it not only thus manifests its essential character as an autogenous ver-
tebral element, but maintains its permanent separation from the neurapo-
physes : and it further indicates the modifications of form to which the cor-
responding elements will be subject in the more expanded neural arches of
the antecedent cranial segments by having already exchanged its compressed
spinous for a depressed lamellar form. Here indeed Cuvier might not only
have objected to recognise it as a vertebral spine by reason of its change of
form and function, but also by its continuing a distinct bone, which is
not the case with ihe expanded 'spine ' of the mammalian occipital vertebra.
But returning to the crocodile, we observe in the segment anterior to the atlas

that both the form and connections of the supraoccipital (fig. 22, 3) are

so closely similar to those of the neural spine of the atlas that the recog-

nition of their serial homology is unavoidable ; and we have a repetition
of the same characters of the vertebral element in question in the small and

undivided parietal (ib.r). Now Cuvier makes no difficulty in admitting the

' occipital superieur ' in the crocodile to be the homologous bone with its
more expanded namesake in the bird; or this with the still more expanded
* partie grande et mince de I'occipital ' in mammals and man : he is also
disposed to admit the special homology of the supraoccipital under all

its variations of form and function in the above-cited air-breathing animals
with the bone 3 in fishes, which he sometimes calls ' occipital superieur,'
sometimes 'interparietal.' If then the special homology be admitted on the
ground of the constancy of the connections of the part, with what show of
reason can its general homology be rejected which forms the very basis or
condition of the characters determinative of such admitted special homology ?
But Cuvier is not consistent with himself in his grounds of objection to the

essential nature of the human supraoccipital as the neural spine of its seg-
ment ; for he does not hesitate to call the atlas of the crocodile a vertebra,
                      --:

312 REPORT-- 1846.

although its ' annular part' is closed above by a transverse plate* instead of

by a vertical spine, of which, indeed, there remains hardly more vestige than

is presented by the tubercle or rudiment of the spinous process in the supra-
occipital of man. It must also be remembered, that the human supraoccipital

does retain to a certain extent the same function in relation to the attach-
ment of the proper vertebral muscles (splefiii capitis, complexi, and the modi-

fied interspinales called '^ recti capitis postici maj. et min.) as the succeeding

vertebral spines ; and combines this with the same place of completing, as

the key-stone, the neural arch ; although by reason of the more voluminously

developed segment of the neural axis protected by that arch the peripheral ele-

ment is chiefly modified for the acquisition of the required increase of space.

Cuvier next proceeds to comment on Oken's endeavour to represent the

basisphenoid and the two alisphenoids with the two parietals as forming a ver-

tebra : and he admits that there is some analogy, though this is much more
feeble than the differences. "The basisphenoid, having another function,

takes on a different form from the basioccipital, especially above, by virtue

of the posterior clinoid processes : and in the embryo it is composed not of

a single nucleus, but of twof ." With respect to the objection from the

modification of form alluded to, it may be remarked that the same element

in other vertebral segments of the body undergoes much greater change

of shape; the centrums of the lower cervical vertebrae in many birds send down

two processes as well-marked as the ascending ones called ' clinoid ' in that

of the parietal vertebra, not to speak of the ' soc de charrue' of the coccy-

geal vertebrae of the bird, for example, without any difficulty having been felt

or expressed by Cuvier in their recognition as modified vertebral bodies, the

more essential characters of their general homology being as plainly retained

as in the case of the basisphenoid ; in its relation, e. g. to the neur-

apophyses and the support, of the mesencephalon. With regard to the

objection from the two centres of development, if this be valid against the

general homology of the basisphenoid (e, fig. 25) as a vertebral centrum, it

equally tells against the body of the atlas (c), which, as Cuvier well knew,

was ossified sometimes from two, and sometimes from three centres |. And
I may further observe that, although Cuvier affirms the two ossific centres of

the basisphenoid to retain for a long time between them simple cartilages,

my observations bear out the accuracy of the remark of Kerkringius, (whose

figures Cuvier cites,) touching the " dua ossicula distincta" (tab. xxxiv. fig.

Kiii. c, c), viz. " quae celerrime in formam figurae appositse  coalescunt "

and the figure of the coalesced rudiments of the basisphtnoid given by Kerkrin-

gius closely resembles the bilobed rudiment of the vertebral centrums in the

sacrum of the chick.

    Cuvier next objects to the neurapophysial character of the alisphenoids,

that the ' foramen ovale ' is rarely a notch, more often a complete hole.

" Now," he urges, " vertebrae properly so called give passage to the nerves only
by the intervals that exist between them and the other vertebrae, and not by
particular foramina*." Therefore the young anatomist must conclude that
the dorsal vertebrae of the ox, the abdominal vertebrae of the lophius, and
every other segment of the trunk whose neural arches are directly perforated
by the spinal nerves, are to be rejected from the vertebral category I

   It has been shown in the generalities on the corporal vertebrae (p. 265), that
the neurapophyses in relation to the passage of their governing nerves may
be either untouched, notched or perforated by them, without prejudice to
their neurapophysial character. Viewed in the entire series of vertebrata
the cranial neurapophyses are more frequently perforated than notched, those
of the trunk more frequently untouched or notched by the nerves in passing

through their interspaces.

   The penetration and sagacity of Cuvier nowhere shine forth more brightly
than in his bold and true determination of the bone 6, fig. 5, in the cod-fish f
as the homologue of the temporal wing of the sphenoid in the human skull.
To any less-gifted comparative anatomist the relation would have been masked
by the coalescence of the homologous part in man, by its connections with the
squamosal and frontal, and its comparatively small proportions under the
guise of a subordinate process ; none of which characters exist in the ali-
sphenoid of fishes : it still retains, however, in that class, as in man, its most
essential connections in relation to the bones of its own segment and to the
brain and nerves ; and Cuvier availing himself of these in the determination
of its special homology, was little likely to be swayed by so unimportant a
variety as the transmissioii of the characteristic nerve by a foramen instead
of by a notch. No sooner, however, has the time arrived and the call been
sounded for an advance to a higher generalization, which includes and ex-
plains the minor proposition, than Cuvier interposes the least important
ditference of the alisphenoid to check the progress. It will be obvious to

the anatomist that the foregoing explanation of the value of the nerve-
notch or hole in the homological character of a neurapophysis has been

called forth by the weight of the name of the objector rather than by the

force of the objection.

    Cuvier directs his next argument against the vertebral character of the
(neural arch of the) parietal segment generally. " Its composition," he avers,
" is different from that of other vertebrae, since the ring (he had just before

denied its annular form) would be composed of five pieces or even of six, inclu-

 ding the interparietal." Yet Cuvier does not hesitate, in his Article V., 'Zes Ver-

 tebres ' (Osteologie des Crocodiles) :j;, to reckon as the first vertebra, the atlas

 notwithstanding its composition of six pieces.

    If,indeed, Cuvier had subscribed to Geoffroy's assertion, that " Nature repro-

--duces the same number of elements, in the same relations, in each vertebra,

 only she varies indefinitely their form," his objection to the vertebral charac-

 ter of any given segment that might deviate from the assumed normal number
 of pieces would have been intelligible. But even, then, he would not have
 been guided consistently by his own principle ; for the objection founded
 upon the supposed abnormal number of pieces in a cranial segment weighs

not at all against the recognition of a corresponding segment of the trunk,
though similarly composed.

   In fact, throughout this attack upon the vertebral theory of the skull, it
will be seen that it is based upon the a priori assumption that all the endo-
skeletal segments of the trunk, however modified, are vertebrae, and all those
situated in the head, are not vertebrae. The essential character of a vertebra
is thus deduced from its position, not its composition. It needs only to com-
pare any of Cuvier's objections to the vertebral character of the cranial seg-
ments, with the modifications of the corporal segments admitted by him to
be vertebrae, previously enumerated in this Report (pp. 264-270), to see that
the characters of the cranial vertebrae objected to by Cuvier differ in degree not
in kind, and become valid arguments against the admittance of natural seg-
ments into the vertebral category, only when they happen to be situated at or
near the commencement of the series.

    It has been abundantly proved, I trust, that the idea of a natural segment
(vertebra) of the endoskeleton, does not necessarily involve the presence of
a particular number of pieces, or even a determinate and unchangeable ar-

rangement of them. The great object of my present labour has been to

deduce, by careful and sufficient observation of Nature, the relative value
and constancy of the different vertebral elements, and to trace the kind and
extent of their variations within the limits of a plain and obvious maintenance

of a typical character.
    In reference to the neural arch, the variation in the number and disposition

of its parts, illustrated in the figures 1, 2, 3,4, 18, 19, 20, 21, do not seem to
me, nor will they I apprehend to any unbiassed anatomist, to obliterate the
common typical character of that part of a vertebra. Those elements which
are furthest from the centrum are the chief seat of the changes. If the reader
will compare figure 2 with figure 19, he will see for example that the crown of
the arch is formed by a single bone(7) in the crocodile, but by two bones (7, 7)
in fish ; nay, in most fishes the halves are even pushed apart by the interposi-
tion of a third bone. Yet the sagacity of Cuvier led him to determine the di-
varicated moieties of the divided parietal in such fishes to be the same (homo-
logous) bone with the single parietal of the crocodile. With what consistency,
then, can the general homology of the segments be rejected, which suffer no
other change in their composition than that resulting from the single or bifid
character of the same bone in each ? Is the single frontal of the human
adult regarded as a distinct bone from the bifid frontal of the foetus ? If,
therefore, the neural arch of the parietal vertebra (mesencephalic arch) of
 the crocodile be free from the objection, raised by Cuvier to the vertebral
character of the homologous arch in man, on the score of the number of its
 elements ; neither can that objection be allowed to have any force when it
rests upon the mere division in the human mesencephalic arch of the recog-
 nised homologue of the single spinous element in the crocodile.

    In the sheep, the arch which encompasses the epencephalon is formed by
 only three elements, the neural spine resting upon the conjoined upper ends
 of the neurapophyses. In the dog these elements are divaricated and the

epencephalic arch is closed above by the neural spine. Now Cuvier does

 not allow this difference of arrangement of the latter element (3) to affect his

 recognition of the ' suroccipital ' in both mammals ; and, therefore, one is at
 a loss to discover the consistency of the ideas which would repudiate the
 general homology of the bones or of the entire arches which they surmount,
 because, as Cuvier would say, " the composition of the arch is different, being
 of three pieces in the sheep and of four pieces in the dog." Yet this is pre-
 cisely the kind of objection which he has directed against the mesencephalic
 arch, viz. because it may be composed of five or even six pieces, in certain
                             ::

ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  315

--animals. In the fish, in fact, by reason of the parietal parapophyses (s, s)

being subject to the same variation in their relative position to the other
elements, which has been illustrated in respect of the neural spine in the

--epencephalic arch of the dog and sheep, the mesencephalic arch is com-

posed of seven pieces, or, including the interposed supraoccipital, of not less

than eight bones. Yet even here we clearly and easily trace the kind and
degree of modification to which the fundamental plan of the neural arch
has been subject. The archetype is nowise obliterated : the general homo-

logies of the modified elements are not less recognisable than their special

homologies. The centrum and neurapophyses are the steadiest elements
the spine is not only subject to great diversity of size and shape, but to some

variety of position, and, moreover, to be either single or bifid : the parapo-

physes have less range of variety in point of dimensions, but may be more
or less interposed between spine and neurapophyses, or may become con-
fluent with either element. Thus the epencephalic arch of the crocodile
(fig. 18) differs essentially, in a Cuvierian sense, from that of the tortoise or the
fish (fig. 1), because it is composed of four pieces in the first and of six
pieces in the latter ; the difference of composition merely depending, how-
ever, on the more exterior position and connation of the parapophyses, 4, 4, in

the crocodile.

   The independency of the parietal and frontal bones is next urged by

Cuvier as militating against the idea that they complete a vertebral arch
formed respectively by the alisphenoids and orbitosphenoids as the piers or
haunches : and the more so, inasmuch as they are separated from those bones

in some animals by the intercalation of the squamosals*. By parity of reason
we must reject the general homology of the neural arch and spine of the
atlas in the Ephippus and some other fishes, because that part of the verte-
bra is not only distinct, but uplifted and removed from the piers or base of

the arch by the intercalation of the articular processes of the neural arches
of the occiput and axis. According to Cuvier such separated atlantal arch
must be regarded as a new bone, and the centrum ought therefore equally
to be viewed as ' une piece particuliere qui a une destination particuliere '
but the general homology of vertebral elements may be determined not only
by their relations to their own segment, but by those which they maintain
with their less modified homotypes in contiguous segments.

   The centrum of the atlas in the Ephippus directly sustains other neur-
apophyses than its own, and so far has a new or particular function ; but,

since it continues to unite the centrum of the axis with that of the occiput,
we still regard it as their homotype, and as standing in the relation of the

centrum to its uplifted and shifted neurapophyses. So, likewise, although
these elements now aid in strengthening the joint between the zygapophyses
of the neural arches of the occiput and axis, and thus perform a new and
very peculiar function, their relation to these and other neural arches in the
series of vertebrae renders it impossible to overlook the serial homology of
the separated ' laminae ' of the atlas and that of its spine with the other and
larger vertebral laminae and spines.

31G REPORT-- 1846.

    The new functions which the uplifted and independent spines of the pari-
etal and frontal vertebrae perform in man and many mammals are, with
respect to tha parietal bones, to shield the upper surface of the middle and

posterior parts of the cerebral hemispheres, wliilst the frontal is confined to
covering the anterior lobes of the same hemispheres.

   Hereupon it may be asked whether such relations and offices are the rule

or only the exception ; and, if the latter, whether it occurs in the lowest or
the highest of the vertebrate series ; whether in that class where the arche-
typal arrangement of parts is most, or in that in which it is least departed
from ? All these considerations are felt to be indispensable by the homo-
logist in quest of the true signification of the parts of the animal frame,

before drawing his conclusions from the first modification that may present
itself. They are neglected by Cuvier in the objection to the vertebral cha-
racter of Oken's ' kiefer-wirbel,' founded upon the relations which the parietal
bones present to the encephalon in the mammalian class. Yet the more
normal relations of those bones, both to the encephalon and to the alisphe-
noids, seem to have been present to the mind of Cuvier, and to have been
duly appreciated by him when he defined, in 1817, the second cranial cinc-
ture as constituted by the parietals and sphenoid*.

   With regard then to the first of Cuvier's arguments for viewing the human
and mammalian parietals as ' des pieces particulieres qui ont une destination
particuliere,' viz. that they are separated from the alisphenoids by the tem-
poral bones. If we commence our consideration of it by the question, whether
this separation be the rule or the exception, the reply which Nature sanc-

tions will be that they are not so separated in any of the three great classes of
oviparous vertebrata, nor in the majority of mammalia, nor even, as a general

rule, in man himself. With regard to the second objection founded on the

interposition of the enormously and backwardly developed prosencephalon
between the mesencephalic spines (fig. 25, 7) and the mesencephalic segment

--of the brain, to which the parietal vertebra essentially relates, its value will

depend on the choice made by the homologist between the function of the
parietals as immediate shields to the optic lobes (mesencephalon) in the cold-
blooded classes, and their function as mediate ones through the interposed
mass of the prosencephalon in the warm-blooded classes, as that whicii best
manifests adhesion to the ideal archetype. What to me has ever appeared one
of the most beautiful and marvellous instances of the harmony and simplicity
of means by which the One great Cause of all organization has effected every
requisite arrangement under every variety of development, is the fact, that
the protection of the enormous cerebrum peculiar to the higher mammals
has not been provided for by new bones : by bones, e. g. developed from
centres so numerous or so situated as to render any determination of their
homologies as vague and unsatisfactory as would result from the attempt to
determine those of the dermal ossifications upon the head of the sturgeon, in

Wereference to the endoskeletal epicranial bones in fishes and reptiles.

might well have expected, had conformity to type not been a recognizable
principle in the scheme of organized beings, to have had so many 'particular
bony pieces' and so situated in the expanded human cranium as would have
baffled all our endeavours to reduce them to the type of the epicranial bones
of the reptile or fish. Yet the researches of the great comparative anatomists
of the present century, and more especially those of Cuvier himself, have
proved that there is no such difficulty : and a glance at the Table of Special
Homologies, No. 1, will show that the bones (3, 7, 11) most modified in rela-
tion to the expanded cerebrum and cerebellum of man and mammals are

precisely those of which the determination has been easiest, and respecting
the names and nature of which there has been the least discrepancy of opi-
nion. It is with pain and a reluctance, which only the cause of truth has

overcome, that I am compelled to notice the inconsistencies into which the
great Cuvier fell, when his judgement became warped by prejudices against

a theory, extravagantly and, perhaps, irritatingly, contended for by a con-
temporary and rival anatomist. After having established by the clearest
evidence and soundest reasoning in his great and immortal works that the
bones (7) in the fish (figs. 2 and 5) and reptiles (figs. 9, 10, 13, 19, 22) were
homologous with those in birds (7, figs. 8 and 23), mammals (7, figs. 12 and

--24), and even in man (7, figs. 11 and 25); and, after contending that they

ought to bear the same name under which, indeed, we find him describing
them in the ' Lemons d'Anatomie Comparee ' from man down to the fish
Cuvier comes at last to declare that, in those animals in which they are
separated from the alisphenoids and mesencephalon, they are "particular

                                                                                                       !"

pieces which have a particular destination
   The relation of the mastoids (s, s), as parapophyses, to the parietal or

sphenoidal vertebra not having been detected in Cuvier's time, he supposes
that the pterygoids, in the system which makes a vertebra of the sphenoid,
can be compared to nothing else than the transverse processes of such. As,

according to my views, they are recognizable in General Homology as quite

distinct elements of another cranial vertebra, the arguments which Cuvier
advances in disproof of what he thought they must be called, do not concern

the subject of the present Report. The inferior exogenous processes, in-
deed, of the basisphenoid in mammals are not unlike those developed from
the under surface of the centrum of the atlas in Sudis gigas, or from some
of the cervical centrums in birds. The argument founded by Cuvier on the
autogenous development of the true pterygoid (tigs. 24? and 25, 24) would
weigh little against its parapophysial nature, if other characters concurred
to prove it a ' parapophysis;' but its connections and position show it to be

a ' diverging appendage.'
   With respect to the anterior sphenoid, Cuvier affirms that its composition

is totally different from that of the posterior sphenoid and occipital, and from

that of any vertebra. By the term ' sphenoide anterieure ' is meant the

coalesced presphenoid and orbitosphenoids (figs. 24 and 25, 9 and 10) ; and the
two bones referred to in the comparison signify, the one, the basi- and ali-
sphenoids (Jh. 5 and e), and the other the basi- and ex-occipitals {ib. 1 and 2).
With respect to 9 and 10, Cuvier remarks that it is never, in mammals, formed
of three pieces, but only of two ; and that these are properly the bony rings
for the optic nerves, which in course of time approximate and coalesce with
each other : but so long as the median suture divides them, no distinct or

third bony nucleus is developed in the intervening cartilage*.
   Since, however, we see that the homologues (recognised as such by Cuvier)

of the orbitosphenoids are something more than rings surrounding the optic

--nerves in the bird (figs. 8 and 23, 10) and crocodile (figs. 9 and 22, s) that

they are merely notched by the optic nerves, and are chiefly developed in

--neurapophysial relation to the sides of the prosencephalon, we are led to

carry our inquiries into an earlier period of their development than that ad-

duced by Cuvier, as contravening their vertebral characters. Cuvier cites
the figure 2, in pi. xxxv. of the ' Osteogenia Fcetuum' of Kerkringius, as evi-
dence of his statement of the developmental characters of the ' spheuoide

anterieur." That figure, however, exhibits the condition of the bone, when,
although the median suture remains, each orbital ala has become anchylosed

with the posterior sphenoid, and is likewise directly perforated by the optic

nerve. The gelatinous cells of the anterior extremity of the notochord very

early retrograde to the basioccipital region of the basis cranii, and the noto-

chordal capsule alone is continued to the anterior extremity of the basis.

This is converted into cartilage,

and the osseous particles which        Fig. 26.

ultimately constitute the anterior

sphenoid are deposited as follows

first a centre or nucleus appears,

in each orbital ala, external to the

hole by which the optic nerve

passes through the primitive carti-

lage (fig. 26, A, lo) ; soon after a
second nucleus (ib. B, lo) is esta-

blished at the inner or mesial side

of each optic foramen : these cen-
tres form the foundation of the

neurapophyses or orbitosphenoids,

and ultimately coalesce around the

optic nerve, as Kerkringius has

depicted. But a third pair of ossi-

fic centres {ib. C, 9) is established
behind the optic foramina between

these and the basisphenoid (5).        Phases of derelopment of the Human Sphenoid bone
This third pair unite together into

a single transverse bar {ib. D, 9),

before coalescing with the orbitosphenoids in front, or with the basisphenoid

behind, and that bar transitorily represents the centrum of the frontal vertebra.

To the objection that such supposed centrum is developed from two points
instead of one, the same reply may be made that was made before to a similar

objection raised by Cuvier against the general homology of the basisphenoid;

which objection, as was then shown, would be equally valid against the uni-

versally admitted homology of the body or centrum of the atlas.
   The frontal neurapophyses manifest in their development, each from two

centres (fig. 26, B, C, 10), a transitory mark of vegetative repetition analogous
to that which permanently characterizes the neurapophyses of the trunk-verte-

brae in the sturgeon.

Thus the evidence of development, when complete, tells for, rather than

against the serial homology of the ' sphenoide anterieur ' of Cuvier with the

centrum and the neurapophyses of other vertebrae ; and the more obvious
and important characters of relative position to the other bones of their own

segment, and to their homotypes in the contiguous segments, as well as to

--prosencephalic segment and characteristic nerves, which characters have

served to determine the special homologies of the coalesced bones in ques-

--tion (9, 10) from man down to the fish, concur with the developmental

characters in establishing their general homology as centrum and neur-

apophyses.
ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  319

     Cuvier affirms, however, in support of his argument, that, although the
 orbitosphenoids are never separated from the frontals, as the alisphenoids are
 from the parietals, in the mammalia, they are almost always separated from
 the frontals in the other classes, so that the vertebral ring is again inter-
 rupted *. But, were even the frontals commonly uplifted above the orbito-

sphenoids in birds, reptiles and fishes, which does not accord with my ex-

perience, the objection, on that score, to regarding them as ' neural spines,'
would as little apply, as it does to the universally recognised general homology
of the separated and uplifted neural arch of the first vertebra of the trunk
of the Ephippus and some other fishes.

     Cuvier finally regards the connection of the frontals with the prefrontals,
which he calls ' ethmoid ' in mammals, ' I'enchassement de rethmoide,' as a
function quite remote from any of a vertebral character, " relative a toute
autre chose." This objection only shows the necessity of a right apprecia-
tion of special homologies, in order to form a true judgement respecting
general homology ; and, with respect to the ' ethmoide,' I must refer to the
section on the prefrontals in the chapter on ' Special Homology (p. 214). If
the arguments there adduced be held to prove the crista galli and cribriform

plate in the human skull to be the homologues of portions of the coalesced
prefrontals and olfactory capsules, we may next remark that these portions
are not merely wedged between the orbital plates of the frontal, but articu-
late behind by a persistent suture with the orbitosphenoids. As neurapo-

physes, the coalesced prefrontals of the terminal vertebra of the skull thus
articulate with their next succeeding homotypes ; and, by virtue of the ex-
cessive development of the spine of the frontal vertebra, as well as from their

being contracted and drawn backward in the human skull, they articulate
with such spine (the frontal) as well as with that of their own proper seg-
ment (the nasals). But, in the crocodile (fig. 9), we have seen a similar
relation manifested not only by the more normal neurapophyses (h) of the
nasal vertebra, but likewise by those (lo) of the frontal, those (e) of the
parietal, and those (2) of the occipital vertebra.

   All the objections raised by Cuvier to the general homology of the cranial
bones as modified vertebral elements, equally apply to elements of vertebrae
in the trunk, which Cuvier himself has admitted to be vertebrae, notwith-
standing such modifications. The repetition of the perforated character of
the human alisphenoid and orbitosphenoid in the neurapophyses of the trunk-
vertebrae of many inferior animals, requires only a passing notice. The
flattening, expansion and sutural union of the human supraoccipital, parietal
and frontal bones, are matched by the neural spines in the carapace of the
tortoise. If the basioccipital, basisphenoid and presphenoid are broad and flat,

instead of cylindrical, so likewise are the bodies of the sacral vertebrae in the

broad-bodied megatherioids and in many birds. If the basioccipital and
basisphenoid are lengthened out and firmly united together by deeply in-
dented sutural surfaces in most fishes, so likewise are the bodies of the four

anterior vertebrae of the trunk in the pipe-fish (^Fistularid). If the basi-
sphenoid and presphenoid be developed each from two ossific centres, as in

man, so likewise may the body of the human atlas be ossified; and even should
the moieties of that centrum not coalesce at the median plane, they would

   * " Ce que j'ai dit des parietaux s'applique aux frontaux, consideres comme complements du

nevertheless still retain their essential characters as divisions of a single ver-

tebral element: just as does the vomer in the salamanders, salamandroid

fishes and serpents, which begins to be developed from two lateral points,
like the body of the human atlas occasionally, without the development end-

ing, as it always does in such atlas, by confluence of the resulting halves. It
would be more reasonable to repudiate the general homology of the body of
a whale's dorsal vertebra with the centrum of the typical vertebra, because
it consists of three pieces set end to end, than to deny the general homology

of the vomer because it may consist of two pieces set side by side, or that
of the anterior trunk-vertebrae of the silurus because they consist of two
pieces set one upon the other. These are examples of a principle of varia-

 tion which Cuvier never permitted to blind his perception of the special ho-
mology of certain bones, the mandibular ramus, for example ; though vege-
tative or teleological subdivision is carried out to a much greater extreme
 there than in any vertebral centrum ; unless, indeed, the number of points

from which the whale's vomer be ossified may equal those in the crocodile's

 lower jaw. But if the differences in this developmental character, viz. of ossi-
 fication from a single ossific point as in the vomer of the cod, or from two
 points as in that of the lepidosteus, or from three or more points as in the
 human vomer, interpose no obstacle to the determination of the special homo-
 logy of the bone 13 from man to fish, it can as little avail as an argument
 against its general homology, which is determined not by the development of
 the vomer but by its relations to the other constituents of the segment of the

 skeleton to which it naturally belongs.
    The great difficulty which the anthropotomist may naturally experience in

 forming an idea of the vomer as the body of a vertebra, will arise from its
 extremely modified form in the human subject : but he must bear in mind
 that it is an extreme part, the last of its series counted forwards ; and if he
 should desire some higher and better established authority than the present
 Report before yielding assent to the vertebral character of the bone, under
 its characteristic ' ploughshare ' mask in man, I know no name more influen-
 tial than that of Cuvier himself, in regard to the equally and similarly modi-
 fied centrum at the opposite end of the vertebral series in the bird. For
 although the mask of coalescence is superadded to that of strangeness of
 shape in the bone which Cuvier there compares to a ploughshare [vomer, or
 'soc de charrue'], the great anatomist and cautious generaiizer does not hesi-
 tate to affirm that it is " composed of many vertebrae " (see ante, p. 263).

     It may, perhaps, be said that the coccygeal vomer must be vertebral in its
 nature because it is situated in the tail ; but the ' petitio principii ' in this
 argument will be transparent, if we transpose the locality, and say that ' the
 cranial vomer must be vertebral in its nature because it is placed in the
 head.' For what are ' head,' ' tail,' ' thorax,' or ' pelvis,' but so many di-
 versely modified portions of a great segmental whole ? These localities do not
 determine the nature of the segments composing them ; such knowledge can
 only be acquired by a study of the composition of the segments ; and it is the
 modifications of the segments that determine the nature of the localities or
 divisions of the endoskeleton, to which such special names as ' head,' ' tho-

 rax,' &c. are applied.

    Yet Cuvier himself, perhaps, little suspected how much his ideas of the
 essential nature of a segment of the endoskeleton were governed by the part
 of the body in which it happened to be placed. Whenever the young ana-

 tomist finds a difficulty from the peculiar form or development, division
  or coalescence, of a cranial bone, in recognising or admitting its vertebral

character, let him compare the results of his own observations with those
summed up in pp. 264-266, and see whether the same kind of modification
may not be repeated in the homologous element of a vertebra of the trunk
in one or other of the species of vertebrate animals.

   The latest direct objection to the cranio-vertebral system is from the pen
of the celebrated ichthyotomist of Neuchatel. M. Agassiz represents the
current ideas respecting this system at the period when he published his

--objections to it, in the following graphic passage of his invaluable and

splendid work: " It was M. Oken who had printed the first programme on
the signification of the bones of the skull. The new doctrine which he set forth
was received with extreme enthusiasm in Germany by the school of physio-
philosophers [Natur-philosopher]. The author at that time required three
cranial vertebras, and the basioccipital, the sphenoid and the ethmoid were
viewed as the central parts of these cranial vertebrae. Upon these pretended

bodies of vertebrae were raised the arches enveloping the central parts of the
nervous system (our 'protective plates') ; whilst to the opposite side were at-
tached the inferior pieces which should form the vegetative arch destined to
embrace the intestinal canal and the great vessel (the ' facial arches ' of which

we shall presently speak). It would be tedious to enumerate here the changes
which each author has rung upon this theme in modifying it agreeably with
his notions. These contented themselves with the number admitted by Oken;
those raised the number of cranial vertebrae to four, six, seven, or even more
some saw nothing but ribs in the branchial arches and jaws ; others took the

latter for limbs of the head, analogous to arms and legs. If they could not

agree about the number of the vertebrae, still less were they at one in regard
to the part assigned to each bone. The most bizarre nomenclatures have
been proposed by different authors who thus sought to generalize their
ideas. Some have gone so far as to pretend that the vertebrae of the head
were as complete as the vertebrae of the trunk, and by means of dismember-
ments, with divers separations and combinations they have reduced all the
forms of skull to vertebrae, assuming that the number of pieces was in-
variable for every form of skull, and that all vertebrate animals, whatever
their definitive organization, bore, in their respective crania, the same number
 of points of ossification *."

    And thus it is that a great truth in nature has been endeavoured, and

   * " C'est M. Oken qui fit imprimer le premier programme sur la signification des os du
crane. La nouvelle doctrine qu'il exposait fut accueillie en Allemagne avec un enthousiasme

extreme par I'ecole des philosophes de la nature. L'auteur postiilait alors trois vertebres

du crane, et I'occipital basilaire, le spbenoide et I'ethmoide etaient envisages comme les

parties centrales de ces vertebres craniennes. Sur ces pretendus corps de vertebres s'elevaient

des arcs enveloppant les parties centrales du systeme nerveux (nos plaques protectrices)
tandis que du cote oppose etaient attachees des pieces inferieures qui devaient former I'arc
vegetatif destine a embrasser le canal intestinal et les gros vaisseaux (les arcs de la face dont
nous traiterons plus tard). II serait trop long d'enumerer ici les changements que chaque
auteur apporta a ce travail en le modifiant a sa maniere. Les uns se contenterent du nombre
admis par Oken, les autres eleverent le nombre des vertebres craniennes jusqu'a quatre, six,

sept et meme plus ; les uns voulurent voir des cotes dans les arcs branchiaux et les raachoires ;
les autres prirent ces dernieres pour des membres de la tete, analogues aux bras et aux
jambes. Si Ton n'etait pas d' accord sur le nombre des vertebres on I'etait encore moins sur

le role qu'on assiguait a chaque os. Les nomenclatures les plus bizarres ont ete proposees

par les differens auteurs, qui cherchaient ainsi a generaliser leurs idees. On alia jusqu'a
pretendre que les vertebres de la tete etaient aussi completes que les vertebres du tronc, et
au moyen de demembremens, de separations et de corabinaisons diverses, on ramena toutes
les formes du crane a des vertebres, en admettant que le nombre des pieces etait invariable-

ment fixe poiu- toutes les tetes ; et que tous les vertebres, quelle que soit d'ailleurs leur

--organisation definitive, portaient dans leur tete le meme nombre de points d'ossifications."

too successfully in regard to the rising generation of anatomists, to be
obscured. Ideas and statements are misquoted, unintentionally, doubtless,
and through neglect of reference to the original work (as in the citation of
the bones representing the bodies of the cranial vertebrae in the Okenian
theory): or they are misunderstood (as where the arches, neurapophyses or

' bogentheiie,' composed as Oken truly said by the alisphenoids and orbito-
sphenoids are held to be synonymous with the ' plaques protectrices ' of M.
Vogt) : the most extreme and least defensible views are selected out of each
tentative step in the inquiry, and are clubbed together to represent the
general result, which is of course dismissed with as sweeping a condemnation.
The specific objections raised by Cuvier are deemed well-founded and un-
assailable ; and to these M. Agassiz adds the following. Premising that,

" the formation of vertebrae presupposes as a first condition the existence
of a notochord*;" and, arguing upon this basis, and on the assumption
that the cephalic extension of the ' chorda dorsalis' as it is permanently
manifested in the Branchiostoma is not so great in the embryos of other and
higher fishes, but is arrested at the region of the alisphenoid from the com-

--mencement of its development, M. Agassiz concludes: "Now, the application

of this principle to the composition of the skull demonstrates at once that there
exists but one cranial vertebra, the occipital vertebra, and that the rest of
the skull is foreign to the vertebral system f."

   At the period of development described and figured by M. Vogt in the em-
bryo of the Coregonus, which period M. Agassiz conceives to represent the very

earliest condition of the anterior extremity of the notochord, the pointed ex-
tremity of the gelatinous central cells of this part terminates at the posterior
boundary of the hypophysial space: but the peripheral capsule of the notochord
extends over that space and forwards to the obtuse anterior extremity of the
embryonal * basis cranii ' : and it is in the expanded aponeurosis, directly con-
tinued from the chorda along the basis cranii, that the thin stratum of carti-
lage cells are developed, arching along the sides of the hypophysial space,
from which the ossification of the basisphenoid, presphenoid and vomer

proceeds J.

   The superaddition or the later continuation of the cylindrical gelatinous
'chorda' in the aponeurotic basis of the cartilaginous and osseous growths of
the vertebral centres in the trunk, seems to relate chiefly to their more or

less cylindrical form in that region : the notochord regulates, as a mould, the
course of ossification, disappearing by absorption as the bony lamellae of the
vertebral bodies encroach upon it in their centripetal progress: the notochord
plays an important part also in the establishment of the elastic jelly-filled
capsular joints in the back-bone of fishes ; and therefore it might well be
dispensed with, or be early and rapidly removed, in the development of the
flattened, expanded and anchylosed or immoveably articulated bodies of the
cranial vertebrae. And, besides, the notochord is immediately concerned in
the development of only one of the elements of the typical segment of the
endoskeleton. It is obviously, therefore, an unwarrantable and erroneous
application of a developmental character, to conclude, from a modifica-
tion of this one character in respect of a single element, the 'centrum,' that
every other character establishing the general homology of such element, as

well as every character determining that of the surrounding vertebral elements,

are to be nullified and set aside ! M. Agassiz, moreover, seems not to have
suspected that the notochord may have other and more immediate and import-
ant functions than even those relating to the vertebral column. The peculiar
elective attraction of its component cells for the gelatinous principle may be es-

sential to the due operation of those neighbouring cells which form the basis of
the neural axis, and which as exclusively assimilate the albuminous principle :
and this reciprocal antagonism in the selection of particular proximate prin-

ciples from the common primitive blastema may explain the contemporaneous
origin of notochord and myelon in the embryonic trace, when all development
is as yet the work of cell-assimilation and metamorphosis, without any supply
from a vascular system, this being a later formation in the building up of the
organic machinery. By confining, however, his views of the notochord to one
of its functions in relation to a single vertebral element, and by extending his
conclusions from this to the entire vertebra, M. Agassiz, though recognising
more absolutely than Cuvier, the vertebral character of the neural ai'ch of

the occipital segment, concludes that Nature discards that type in the con-
formation of the cinctures that precede it and which successively girt the

mesencephalon, prosencephalon and rhinencephalon.
    Assuming a gratuitous explanation of the hypothetical absence of the bodies

of the cranial vertebrae (Poissons Fossiles, t. i. p. 128), M. Agassiz asks,

 " Ainsi, que seraient dans cette hypothese, le sph^noide principal, les grandes
ailes du sphgnoide, et I'ethmoide, qui forment pourtant le plancher de la

-- --cavite cerebrale ? Des apophyses ? Mais, les apophyses ne protegent les
--centres nerveux que du cote et d'en haut ? Des corps des vertebres ?

Mais ils se sont formes sans le concours de la corde dorsale ; ils ne peuvent

done pas etre des corps des vertebres." (lb. p. 129.) To this it may be

 replied, first that the bodies of the cranial vertebrae are not absent ; they
 are represented, as above explained, by their cortical portions in the vomer
 (fig. 5, 13), presphenoid (ib. a) and basisphenoid (ib. s), and by both cortical
 and central portions in the basioccipital (ib. i) : nay, the central part of the
 body of the frontal vertebra is represented in some fishes by the entosphenoid
 (ib. 9'), which remains distinct from the cortical part below, as does the central
 part of the body of the atlas in the siluroid fish. If it were true, indeed,

 that the entosphenoid was pierced by the canals transmitting the olfac-
 tory nerves*, Bojanus' idea of its general homology as the centrum of the
 * vertebra optica ' must be abandoned. But the parts called ' olfactory

nerves ' by M. Agassiz, pass from the prosencephalic to the rhinencephalic

 compartments of the cranium not merely above the bone called ' cranial
 ethmoid ' by the same author, but, also, through the upper part of the inter-
 space between the bones (orbitosphenoids) which the entosphenoid (9')
 sustains: and the true olfactory nerves perforate the neurapophyses (14)

 which Bojanus called ' ethmoid ' and which Cuvier and M. Agassiz have
 termed 'frontaux anterieurs' (see ante, pp. 214-226). The alisphenoids, being
 notched or perforated by their proper intervertebral nerves, are ' apophyses'

 (neurapophyses), and accordingly do protect the sides of their proper nervous
 centre, the mesencephalon. The central jelly-cells of the notochord appear to
 be withdrawn into the occipital region before ossification of the basisphenoid
 commences, and that modified vertebral body is therefore developed at the
 expense of the fibrous sheath of the notochord, and is represented by its
 ' cortical ' part only. But its general homology is determined by its con-

    * M. Agassiz has described this bone under the name of ' ethmoide cranien ' as " un os

iiections with the basioccipital (admitted by Agassiz to be a vertebral body)
behind, and with the alisphenoids above.

    In many fishes the basisphenoid unites with the basioccipital by a deeply
indented sutural surface, like that which unites together the elongated bodies
of the anterior trunk-vertebrae in the Fistularia. In mammals the basioc-
cipital and basisphenoid join each other by flat surfaces, also like the bodies
of the trunk-vertebrEE, until the period when, in most of the class, the
joint is obliterated by anchylosis. These and similar repetitions of class-
characters of vertebral elements in the regions of the head and trunk are not
so wholly devoid of signification, as they must seem to be to the opponents

of the cranio-vertebral theory.

    In his new and elaborate classification of the bones of the skull of fishes,
M. Agassiz divides them primarily, like Cuvier, into bones of the cranium,
or ' box which envelopes the brain and the organs of sense ' : and into bones
oi the face, 'which is composed of the moveable pieces subservient to nutrition
and respiration' (l. c. p. 110).

    This division is open to the objection that the bony or cartilaginous cap-
sules which immediately envelope the organs of sense are always originally,
and most of them permanently, separate from the box or capsule that enve-
lopes the brain. The independent character of the ear-capsules, for example,
is manifest on their first appearance in the ammocete ; and, although they
subsequently lose their distinctive features by the accumulation of cartilage-
cells around them in which the foundations of the neurapophyses and parapo-
physes, contributing to the otocrane, are laid, one centre of ossification is
commonly established, even in fishes, in special relation to the immediate
protection of the vascular and nervous parts of the labyrinth.

   As to the proper bony envelope of the eye, M. Agassiz does not enumerate
it amongst the cranial bones of fishes : but admits into that series only the
accessory protecting pieces which form the orbit ; or rather only those that
at the same time form the brain-case : for, the suborbitals, the entopterygoids
and palatines are placed amongst the ' facial ' bones : whilst the supraorbi-

tals are transferred to another category of osseous pieces, the natural system
here prevailing over the artificial one.

ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.  325

M. Vogt. With regard to the series of nine arches into which the facial
bones are distributed, it may be remarked that the independence of the maxil-

lary from the palatine, which is more apparent than real in the osseous fishes,
ceases to be manifested in any degree in the plagiostomes and lepidosiren :
that the first and second arches are suspended by their crowns with their
haunches projecting freely outwards, whilst the third and fourth arches are
suspended, in the reverse position, viz. inverted, with the crowns or key-stones
downwards : the four next arches are rather complete cinctures, their sum-
mits meeting and being loosely suspended to the basis cranii, or, in pla-
giostomes and cyclostomes, to the under part of the vertebral column of the
trunk. Although professing to base his classification upon developmental
characters, M. Agassiz owns with regard to the posterior branches of the
maxillary arch, e. g. the suborbitals, " that they appear to be rather formed

by the dermal system." And this is unquestionably true : whilst the pala-

tines, which are the true piers of the arch, are developed from the blastema
of the same visceral arch as the maxillaries and premaxillaries.

   The error in regard to the special homology of the suborbital bones, deter-
mined by M. Agassiz as the raalars, and which is so clearly exposed by the
structure of the skull of the Psittaddce (ante, p. 209), has misled him in re-
spect to the natural and typical constitution of the maxillary arch.

   The mistake in reference to the special homology of the epitympanic (23a),
determined by M. Agassiz as the ' mastoid,' has, in like manner, influenced
him in dissociating it from the other dismemberments of the tympanic pedicle,

and referring it to a different arch.
   With regard to the hyoid and branchial arches, it will be observed that

M. Agassiz makes no distinction between the systems of the neuro- and
splanchno-skeleton. An arch constant and ossified in all vertebrates where
the rest of the endoskeleton is ossified, and which, even admitting M. Agassiz*
special homology of the preopercular as the styloid process of the temporal,

would still be suspended in the inverted position, like a true haemal arch, is
placed in the same category as the branchial girdles, which are often cartila-
ginous when the hyoid is osseous, in bony fishes ; and which disappear, in the
metamorphosis of the tadpole, with the evanescent respiratory viscera for
the support of which they are exclusively developed.

   The constitution of a distinct 9th facial arch for the posterior pair of bran-
chial girdles, which retain their gills in lepidosiren, though modified in sub-

servience to mastication in most osseous fishes, appears to be giving undue

importance to an artificial or adaptive character. Finally, the natural con-

nections of the scapulo-coracoid arch in osseous fishes are totally disregarded,
and it is left out of the enumeration of the bones of the head.

   The unbiassed anatomist may find an element for judging of the natural
character of the cranio-vertebral system propounded in the present Report,
by contrasting the classification of the bones of the fish's skull to which it
leads, with that proposed by M. Agassiz, and with nature*.

   Having thus responded to the objections advanced by Cuvier and M.

Agassiz to the interpretations of the segmental constitution of the bones of
the head which were open to the criticism of those great authorities in
anatomy, I proceed briefly to explain the segmental constitution of the bones

   * I ain bound here to say that in the discussion of the subject of this Report with M.
Agassiz, which, amongst other advantages of the meetings of the British Association, I en-
joyed at Southampton, he admitted, with his characteristic frankness, that some points of
his classification of the bones of the head in fishes would require reconsideration. One of
the eminent physiologists who was present at the debate which followed the reading of the

Report, has recorded the impression it produced upon him in a review of my ' Hunterian

Lectures on Vertebrata ' iu ' The British and Foreign Medical Review,' No. xlvi. p. 490.

of the trunk of the human subject according to the archetype with which the

segments in the head have been illustrated.

The first seven segments of the trunk consist each of centrum (fig. 25, c),

neurapophyses(M), neural spine (s), and rudimental pleurapophyses(j╗/), which

coalesce, in each segment, into one bone, called ' cervical vertebra ' in anthro-

potomy. If the hasmapophyses (si') have the same relation to their centrum

which those of the seventh dorsal vertebra, in the Ciconia Argala, more ob-

--viously bear to theirs, thatis,beingattached below and disunited at their upper

ends from their pleurapophyses, which are short, stunted and anchylosed to the

--centrum, and if, as the apparent homologues of 52' in fishes would indicate,

the atlas be actually the centrum to which such detached and shifted hsema-

pophy ses belong, then the first will-be the sole segment of the cervical region of

the trunk in which those elements are ossified.

In the seven vertebrae which succeed the cervicals the pleurapophyses {pi)

are progressively elongated; they are shifted from their proper centrum to tlie

interspace between it and the next segment above, or in advance, and retain

their moveable joints. The haeraapophyses (h) are cartilaginous and articulate

with the ends of the pleurapophyses and with the haemal spines (/i*), which are

flattened, slightly expanded, and ultimately blended into one bone called ' ster-

num.' The haemal spine of the first typical segment remains longest distinct

it receives, also, the extremities of the displaced haemapophyses (52') and has

been called ' manubrium sterni.' The hasmal spine of the seventh segment

commonly continues longer distinct, and is later in becoming ossified, whence

it is called ' ensiform cartilage ' : it probably includes the rudiments of some

succeeding haemal spines. In the four succeeding segments the pleurapophyses

become progressively shorter, and the haemapophyses, still cartilaginous, are

severally attached  by  their  lower  attenuated  ends  to the pair  in  advance
                                                                                                          ;

leaving the hasmal arch incomplete below. In the next vertebra (19th from

the skull) the still shorter pleurapophyses resume the exclusive articulation

with their proper centrum ; and the correspondingly short and pointed haem-

apophyses terminate freely.

Those pleurapophyses and haemapophyses which directly articulate with

haemal spines (sternum) are called collectively 'true ribs ' (costae verae), the

proximal element being 'the bony part of the rib' (pars ossea costas), the distal

one the ' cartilage of the rib.' The rest of the haemal arches which are in-

complete through the absence of the haemal spine, are called ' false ribs

(costae spuriae) ; and the last, which terminates freely in the origin of the

diaphragm, is a ' floating rib.' The centrum, neurapophyses and neural spine

of each segment with freely articulated pleurapophyses coalesce into one bone,

called ' dorsal vertebra ' in anthropotomy : these vertebrae are twelve in

number. Each of the five succeeding segments is represented by the same

elements (centrum and neural arch) coalesced that constitute the so-called

dorsal vertebrae : they are called ' lumbar vertebrae ' (fig. 25,L.): they have no

ossified pleurapophyses ; and the haemapophyses of these segments are repre-

sented only by the aponeurotic ' inscriptiones tendineae musculi recti' (A").

Certain elements of the five succeeding segments (ib.S.) coalescing together

in the progress of growth form the bone called 'sacrum': and are described in-

dividually as sacral vertebrae. The first four of these each combine the same

elements, coalesced, as in the neck; viz. centrum, neurapophyses, neural spine,

and short but thick pleurapophyses* : in the fifth sacral vertebra there are no

developed. One or more typical segments are obviously completed by the
meeting of the broad sides of the inverted arch (52, as, 64) at the ' ischio-
pubic symphysis ' forming the ' pelvis ' of anthropotomy. Before, however,

328 REPORT--1846.

   The special homologies of these elements of the pelvis being thus deter-
mined, it follows, that their general homology, as it may be revealed by the
simple condition of the pelvic arch in the species in which the pelvis, as
complete and fixed to a sacrum, makes its first appearance in the animal
kingdom, will be equally applicable to the parts under ail their metamor-

phoses in the higher air-breathing vertebrates.

   The correspondence of the segment of the endoskeleton in the raenopome
D', PI', H, A, with the typical vertebra, as illustrated by fig. 13, is such,
that any other explanation of its essential nature than as a representative or
repetition of such fully developed segment or vertebra seems contrary to
nature. The chief modification has its seat in the most peripheral part or
appendage A, as compared with its simple homologue in the thoracic segment
of the bird (fig. 15). If 6-2 and 64 are to be regarded as strangers to the
vertebral system, new parts introduced for special purposes, and not as
normal elements modified for special purposes, I am at a loss to know on
what principles, or by what series of comparisons we can ever hope to attain

to the higher generalizations of anatomy, or discover the pattern according

to which the vertebrate forms have been constructed. It may be said that the
arch which they constitute performs a new function, inasmuch as it sustains
a locomotive limb which reacts upon the ground. But this new function
arises in the menopome, rather out of the modifications of the appendage
than of the arch itself. In so far as the mere support of the appendage is
concerned, the inverted or haemal arch PI', H, performs no new function, but
one which is common to such arches in the thorax of birds, and to the less com-
pletely ossified homologous arches in the abdomen of fishes, where moreover

the simple diverging appendages do give attachment to the muscles of locomo-
tion. Comparing, then, the haemal arch in question with that of the typical
vertebra (fig. 15), we find that, like the scapulo-coracoid arch in fishes

H(fig. 5, i), its parts are open to two interpretations. The upper piece of

PI' may be the whole pleurapophysis, the lower, 62, the haemapophysis, and the
part, 64, the half of an expanded and bifid haemal spine : or PI' with 62, may
be two portions of a teleologically compound pleurapophysis, and 64 the haem-
apophysis, which would join with its fellow without, or with a mere rudiment
of, a haemal spine intervening. From the analogy of the scapulo-coracoid
arch in fishes, which is proved by its modifications in higher animals to
want the haemal spine, it is most probable that such is the condition and

true interpretation of the correspondingly simple pelvic arch under considera-
tion. But the general relation of this arch to the haemal one of the typical
segment is not aff'ected by the alternative.

    I regard, therefore, PI', 62, as two portions of a fully developed pleurapophy-

sis ; and the pleurapophyses, PV, PI of the contiguous vertebrae as answering

only to the upper portion of the pelvic one. In ascending from the raeno-
pome to the crocodile, we find the homologue of 62 broader than it is long,
and articulated to the thickened proximal portions of the pleurapophyses of

two segments ; and we observe, likewise, the pelvic arch completed below
by two pairs of haemapophyses : for the anterior pair the name of ' ossa

 pubis ' is retained ; to the posterior pair that of ' ischia' is given. In general
homology these bones complete, as haemapophyses, the two vertebral seg-
 ments modified to form the sacrum of the crocodile ; and the intermediate

connecting piece (ilium) may be interpreted, as either the confluent distal

 portions of the pleurapophyses of both vertebrae, or as an expansion of one
such portion, answering to 62 in the raenopome, and intruding itself between
 the stunted pleurapophysis and distant haemapophysis of the second sacral

 vertebrae in the crocodile.
                   ON THE VERTEBRATE SKELETON.                                329

   In the bird the expansion of tlie element 62 proceeds to a further extent,
and besides the proximal piece of the pleurapophysis of its own segment 62,

is brought into connection with the homologous stunted or proximal ends

of pleurapophyses of several contiguous segments, in the manner indicated

by the dotted line in fig. 28. Now, if the ilium, so expanded, were inter-

preted as the coalesced complementary portions of all the short pleurapo-

physes with which it articulates, its condition would be very similar to that

which Oken has attributed to the scapula. But its ossification radiates, as
in the simple rib-like ilium of the menopome, from a common centre : there

are no corresponding multiplications of hsemapophyses below; these are

restricted in the pelvis of all animals to the number which they present in
the crocodile. And since the scapula has been proved to be, under its most
expanded form, the homologue of a single pleurapophysis, so also I am dis-

posed to regard its homotype, the ilium, as maintaining under every variety

of form and proportion, the same fundamental singleness of character, as it

presents on its first appearance in the perennibranchiate batrachian.

The first sacral vertebra, then, in man is complete ; but its pleurapo-

physis is divided, and the lower portion expanded to form the so-called

' ilium' (62). The haemapophysis (04) coalesces with that of the succeeding
vertebra (es), and with its own pleurapophysis (ea).

The  second  sacral vertebra  has  its  haemapophysis          (m, called  ' ischium
                                                                                                   ')

ossified, but separated from its proper pleurapophysis by the expanded (iliac)

portion of that of the preceding vertebra, with which it coalesces, as well as

with the preceding haemapophysis (pubis). The short and thick pleurapo-

physes of the third sacral vertebra also articulate in the adult with the ex-

panded distal portions of those of the first sacral vertebra: but these (iliac

bones) are restricted in infancy and early childhood to their connections

with the first and second sacral vertebras, which connections are permanent

in most reptiles.

The fourth sacral vertebra consists of centrum, neurapophyses, and rudi-

mental pleurapophyses ; the fifth sacral vertebra of centrum and rudimental

neurapophyses, which rarely meet above the neural canal.

In each sacral vertebra the elements of the neural arch and rudimental

ribs first coalesce together; and afterwards the vertebrae unite with each

other and form the anthropotomical bone called * sacrum.'

The first coccygeal vertebra in man consists of a centrum and of stunted

neurapophyses* wide apart above, but developing zygapophyses, which join

those of the last sacral vertebra, and diapophyses which extend outwards

further than those of the same vertebra. The neurapophyses are represented

by exogenous tubercles of bone in the second coccygeal vertebra ; and the
third and fourth vertebrae are reduced to the centrums only.

The cartilaginous deposits in the primitive blastema of this extremity of

the trunk indicate a greater number of caudal vertebrae, and the rudimental

tail is proportionally longer in the embryo than in the adult. It is shortened,
however, by absorption prior to the commencement of ossification, and but

four segments are indicated by depositions of the earthy salts in the situa-

tions proper to the above-specified elements of a typical vertebra : these
finally coalesce into a single bone " of a crooked pyramidal figure," which

got its name of ' os coccygis ' from its supposed resemblance to a cuckoo's

beak f-
   The early recognition of these and other specialities arising out of the va-

rious adaptive modifications of the typical segments of the human skeleton

found its expression, necessarily, in special terms, the convenience of which

will ensure their permanence ; but the course of anatomical science having
unfolded the primary form which is the basis of those modifications, there
arises the same necessity for giving utterance to ideas of the generic cha-

racter of the parts by general terms.
   Inasmuch, however, as the different segments of the human skeleton de-

viate in various degrees from the common archetype, and as the different

elements of such segments differ in their modifiabiiity, anthropotomy has at
no period wanted also its ' general terms' expressive of the recognised ex-
tent of such conformity : such terms also, indicating, obscurely indeed, so

much perception of the pre-existing model as could be obtained from the

-- --study of one form, at a period when that form the human frame was

viewed as something not only above, but distinct from, if not antithetical
to the structures of the brute creation, and when it was little suspected

that all the parts and organs of man had been sketched out, in anticipation,
so to speak, in the forms of the inferior animals. Thus the word ' vertebra
shows, by the number of the segments or parts of segments to which it is

applied in anthropotomy, the recognition of the obvious extent to which the
archetype is retained in such primary constituents of the human endoskeleton.
 And, inasnmch as in some regions (the cervical, e.ff.) the 'vertebra' includes
all the elements of the typical segment, there developed, it has been retained,
but, with a more definite meaning, as the technical term of the primary

constituent segment of the endoskeleton in all vertebrate animals.
    The ' true vertebrae ' of anthropotomy are those segments which retain the

power of moving upon each other ; and the term is applied in a peculiar and
empirical sense very different from tiie meaning which the anatomist at-
taches to a true or typical vertebra. The ' false vertebrae ' of anthropotomy
are those segments or parts of segments forming the lower or hinder extreme
of the endoskeleton, and which do not admit of reciprocal motion at their

joints. And Monro, admitting that the condition of even the human os

 coccygis sometimes militates against the definition, meets the objection by
 arguing for the speciality of that bone, and with as good or better reason
than those who have subsequently contended against admitting the cranial
 segments into the category of vertebrae. "From the description of this bone "
 (os coccygis), " we see how little it resembles vertebrcB ; since it seldom has
 processes, never has any cavity for the spinal marrow, nor holes for the pas-

 sage of nerves*."
     Embryology has since demonstrated that the parts of the os coccygis are

 originally in vertebral relation with the neural axis; and that this is subse-
 quently withdrawn by a concentrative movement, which in like manner
 withdraws it from the terminal segment at the opposite extreme of the endo-
 skeleton. The homology of the divisions of the sacrum with the true ver-
 tebrae is admitted by Monro, because of the perforations for the nerves : and

 this character is still retained in the nasal vertebra in the form of the cribri-

 form foramina, although its neurapophyses, like those of the sacrum, have

 lost their primitive relation to the neural axis.

     Homological anatomy, therefore, teaches, th'at the term ' vertebra ' should

 not only be applied to the segments of the human skeleton in the technical
 and definite sense illustrated by figs. 14 and 15, but be extended to those
 modified and reciprocally immoveable segments which terminate the endo-
 skeleton superiorly, and are called collectively ' skull.'

    The term 'head,' then, indicates a region of specially modified vertebrae, like
 the terms ' neck,' ' chest,' ' loins,' &c. ; and amongst the species of the primary

 segments characterized by specific modifications, the ' cranial ' vertebrae must

                                                         * Monro, /. c. p. 143.

be added to the ' cervical,' ' thoracic or dorsal,' ' lumbar,' ' sacral,' and ' coccy-

geal or caudal.'

Such, with reference to the ' general ' terra * vertebra,' seems to be the

advance of which authropotomical science is susceptible, in order to keep

progress and be in harmony with anatomy.
   As to the elements of the typical vertebra, anthropotomy has also its gene-

ral phrases (see Table II. column vi. ' Soemmerring.'), some of which are

equivalent to the clearly defined technical terms of such elements in anatomy

properly so called.

   The serial homology of the centrum {corpus vertebrce) has been recognised

in all the so-called ' true vertebrae,' and in some of the ' false vertebrae : ' thus
Monro says, " The fore-part of the os sacrum, analogous to the bodies of the

true vertebrae, is smooth and flat*." But their smooth and flat homotypes in

the skull have only the special names of 'basilar' and 'cuneiform' processes ; of

' processus azygos ' and ' vomer.' The ' neurapophyses ' are recognised as re-

petitions of the same part under the definitions of ' a bony bridge produced

backwards from each side of the body of the vertebra,' of ' arcus posterior
vertebrcB,' of ' vertebral laminae ' or ' pedicles.' Monro describes these rudi-

mental elements in the last sacral vertebra as ' knobs,' and in the first coccy-

geal vertebra as its 'shoulders.' In the skull they receive the special defini-
tions of " the pieces of the occipital bone situated on each side of the great
foramen ; from which nearly the whole condyles are producedf " {partes late-

rales seu condyloidecB, Soem.) ; ' great ' or ' temporal wings of the sphenoidal
bone t ; ' ' orbitar wings ' or ' processes of the sphenoidal bone ; ' ' nasal ' or
* vertical plate' and ' cristi galli' of the ethmoid {'pars media ossis cethmoidei,'

Soem.).

The neural spines are called generally ' spinal processes' in every segment

of the trunk: in the head they are known only by the special names of 'oc-

cipital plate, ' ' parietal bones,' ' frontal bone,' ' nasal bones.'

   The pleurapophyses, when free, long, and slender, are called 'ribs,' 'verte-

bral ribs,' or 'bony parts of the ribs'; when short and anchylosed, they are
called, in the neck, " the second transverse processes that come out from the

sides of the body of each vertebra з ;" {radix prior processus trajisversi ver-
tebrce, Soem. ;) in the sacrum ' transverse processes ' and ' ilium'; in the skull,

╖ scapula', ' styloid process of the temporal bone,' ' external auditory or tym-

panic process of the same bone'; 'palatine bone.'

In like manner the serial homology of the hasmapophyses is recognised in

the thoracic region by the general term ' cartilages of the ribs' or ' cartilages

of the sterimm' there applied to the same elements of twelve successive seg-

ments. When ossified in other vertebrae they have received the special names

of ' ischium,' ' pubis,' ' coracoid process of the scapula,' 'clavicle,' ' appendix

or lesser cornua of the hyoid bone,' (' crura superiora,' ' os linguale superius,'

Soem.), ' lower jaw' or mandibula, ' upper jaw' or maxilla.
   The exigences of descriptive anthropotomy and its highly important ap-

plications to Medicine and Surgery necessitate such special nomenclature, and

the reform which that nomenclature chiefly requires is the substitution of

names in the place of phrases for the parts of the human body.

But the retention and use of specific names for specially modified elements

in the diflferent segments by no means precludes the entertainment of general

ideas and the necessity of expressing them by generic names for the homo-

logous elements in the entire series of vertebrae.

   If anthropotomy is to make corresponding progress with anatomy, and
to derive the same light from the generalizations of zootomical science which

medical botany has done from general botanical science, its nomenclature

must expand to receive those generic terms which express the essential

nature of the parts, heretofore named and known only according to the

Aresults of particular and insulated observation.  term which truly ex-

presses the general homology of a part enunciates the most important and

constant characters of such part throughout the whole animal series, and

implies therefore a knowledge of such characters in that part of the human

body, when used and understood by the human anatomist. Before the cunei-

form process of the occipital bone could be defined as the ' occipital cen-

trum,' the modifications and relations of the homologous part in all classes of

vertebrate animals had to be accurately determined. The generic homo-

logical term expresses the sum or result of such comparisons, and the use of

such terms by the anthropotomist implies his knowledge of the plan or pattern

of the human frame which lies at the bottom of all the modifications that

raise it to an eminence so far above those of all other vertebrate animals.

   In no species, however, is each individual segment of the endoskeleton

so plainly impressed with its own individual characters, as in Man ; the prac-

tised anthropotomist, for example, will at once select and name any given

vertebra from either the cervical, the dorsal, or the lumbar series. During

that brilliant period of human anatomy which was illuminated by a Fabricius,

an Eustachius, a Fallopius, and a Laurentius, the terms expressive of the

recognition of such specific characters were more numerous and often more

precise than in our modern compilations. Pleurapophyses were indivi-

dualized in the thorax as well as in the head : the ' antistrophoi,' ' stereai

and ' sternitides,' for example, were distinguished from the other ' pleurai

gnesiai'*.

   General anatomical science reveals the unity which pervades the diversity,

and demonstrates that the whole skeleton of man is the harmonized result

of essentially similar segments, although each segment differs from the other,

and all vary from their archetype.

                            Part III. Serial Homology.

   Since, then, we are led by the observations, comparisons and reasonings re-

corded in the preceding parts of this Report, to recognise, as the fundamental
type of the vertebrate endoskeleton, a series of segments repeating each
other in their essential characters, it follows that, not only the power of de-
termining the homologous bones throughout the vertebrate series, but also
throughout the vertebral segments of the same individual, is included in
such generalization.

   The recognition of the same elements throughout the series of segments
of the same skeleton I call ' the determination of serial homologies.' This
kind of study appears to have been commenced by the gifted Vicq d'Azyr,
in his ' Memoire ' entitled " Parallele des os qui composent les extremites,"
printed in the Memoires de I'Academie des Sciences for the year 1774', and
Condorcet, in his Report on this ingenious Essay, speaks of it as " un essai
d'une autre espece d'Anatomie comparee, qui jusqu'ici a ete peu cultivee."

    Vicq d'Azyr compares, or points out the serial homology of, the scapula
with the ilium, the humerus with the femur, the two bones of the fore-arm
with the two bones of the leg, the small bones of the carpus with those of
the tarsus, the metacarpus with the metatarsus, and the fingers with the toes.

He is not so happy in his particular as in his general determinations : his

choice in the leg, for example, of the homotypes of the radius and uhia in
the fore-arm, is erroneous ; but the whole memoir is an admirable example
of the appreciation of correspondences which later researches in the same
direction have proved to flow from a higher and more general law of uni-
formity of type. It is, indeed, a striking instance of the secret but all-pre-
vailing harmony of the vertebrate structure that serial homologies should be
determinable to such an extent in the parts of the diverging appendages,
which are the seat of the greatest amount and variety of deviations from the
fundamental type.

   It will, of course, be obvious that the humerus is not 'the same bone' as
the femur of the same individual in the same sense in which the humerus
of one individual or species is said to be 'the same bone' as the humerus of
another individual or species. In the instance of serial homology above-cited,
the femur, though repeating in its segment the humerus in the more advanced
segment, is not its namesake, not properly, therefore, its ' homologue '. I
propose, therefore, to call the bones so related serially in the same skeleton
' homotypes,' and to restrict the term ' homologue' to the corresponding bones
in different species, which bones bear, or ought to bear, the same names.

   In the skull those bones are homotypes, or repetitions of the same essential
part in the series of vertebral segments, which succeed each other length-
wise, as in the last four columns of the subjoined Table :

Vertebr-e.
--334 REPORT 1846.

inents, whether retaining their spinal shape as in the caudal haemapophyses,
or flattened as ordinary ' sternal bones,' or expanded and subdivided, like the
neural spines in the cranium, in order to coraplete below the thorax of the

bird or to form the plastron of the turtle.
    There reigns a beautiful parallelism in the kind and degree of modification

of the parts of the neural with the corresponding parts of the haemal arch of
the same vertebral segment : and as the serial homologies which have just
been enunciated succeed each other longitudinally (horizontally in beasts,

vertically in man) in the axis of the vertebral column, so these manifest them-

selves in a direction perpendicular to that axis.

   The manubrium sterni of the bat developes a spine downwards, as the
supraoccipital of the fish sends a spine upwards : the expanded manubrium
sterni of the whale repeats the condition of the supraoccipital in birds and
mammals. The form of the ordinary sternal bones in mammals is repeated
by the parietal and supraoccipital bones of the crocodile. The divided sternum
of the young ostrich, before the two lateral ossifications have coalesced
at the median suture, repeats the condition of the divided parietal in most
mammals. The development of the crista from the obliterated suture of
the lateral halves of the expanded hsemal spine in the thorax of birds is
paralleled by the development of the crista from the obliterated suture of
the expanded neural spine in the cranium of carnivores. The interposition
of the entosternal piece in the chelonian carapace parallels below the inter-
position of the interparietal bone in the rodent cranium above.

    Thus modifications and developments of the same kind and degree manifest
 themselves in the upper (neural) as in the lower (haemal) peripheral elements
 of the vertebrae ; and though not always in the same vertebra, nor in the
same animal, yet they are sufficiently exemplified in the myelencephalous series
 generally, to establish the conclusion that the haemal spines under all their
 modifications are vertical homotypes, not of the centrums, as Oken, Meckel

and De Blainville have supposed, but of the neural spines of the same verte-

 brae. In the composition of the neural arch of the occipital, parietal and
 frontal vertebrte, we find the neurapophyses repeating the pleurapophyses of
 the haemal arch, and the parapophyses repeating the haemapophyses in their
 relative positions to the centrum and the spine or key-bone of such arches.

     Symmetry or serial homology of parts of the same vertebral segment is
 usually still more strictly preserved in the transverse direction, and is so
 obvious, as to have immediately led to the detection of the homologous parts,
 which are accordingly distinguished as ' right' and ' left.'

    To return to the consideration of those serial homologies with which Vicq
 d'Azyr commenced the study of these relations, I may remark that the bones
 of the fore- and hind-limbs of some of the marsupial quadrupeds best illus-
 trate the true relations which ray revered Preceptor in Anatomy, Dr. Barclay*

  was, I believe, the first to enunciate in respect of the bones of the fore-arm

  and leg.
     The skeleton of the Phalangista or Phascolomys plainly demonstrates that

  the tibia is the homotype of the radius, and that the fibula is the homotype
  of the ulna. In both wombat and ornilhorhynchus the fibula assumes those

   Dr. Barclay, without refeiTing to Vicq d'Azyr's Memoir, simply enunciates the correct

 --view of the serial homology of the bones of the fore-arm and leg, as follows : " On com-

   paring the atlantal (pectoral) and sacral (pelvic) e.^tremities, the fibula is found to be the bone
   corresponding to the ulna ; and accordingly, upon extending our researclies to Comparative
  Anatomy, we perceive it exhibiting the like variety and unsteadiness of character, sometimes
  large, sometimes small, and sometimes merely a process of the tibia," &c. He does not push
   his comparison to the bones of the distal segment of the limbs.

proportions and developes that process from its proximal end, the want of

which in man and most mammals deceived Vicq d'Azyr, as it has misled,
more recently, M. Cruvelhier. The complex explanation of the serial homo-

logies of the bones of the upper and lower extremities proposed by the last
named pains-taliing anthropotomist*, involves more unnatural transpositions
and combinations of the parts than those of the D'Azyrian hypothesis, which
its ingenious author could not but admit seemed paradoxical ; viz. that the
anterior member of one side of the body repeated or corresponded with the
posterior member of the opposite side. Cuvier, however, seems to sanction
this idea by repeating the statement of Vicq d'Azyr, " C'est la droite d'une

paire, qu'il faut comparer a la gauche de I'autret."
   M. Flourens has exposed in detail the fallacies of this view in an excellent

memoir in the ' Annales des Sciences* for 1838 (t. x. p. 35) ; in which he
arrives at the same conclusions as Dr. Barclay, and from similar considera-
tions from Comparative Anatomy, as to the serial homologies of the bones bf
the fore-arm and leg ; and he confirms those of the carpal and tarsal bones,
which had been so truly and acutely discerned by Vicq d'Azyr.

   In mammalian quadrupeds generally the fore-limb takes the greater share
in the support, the hind-limb in the propulsion of the body. The manus is
accordingly commonly shorter and broader than the joes ; this may be seen in
the terminal segment of even the monodactyle hand and foot of the horse.
Consequently the transverse direction prevails in the arrangement of the

carpal bones and the longitudinal in that of the tarsal bones.
   The ditFerence is least in the carpus and tarsus of the long and slender fore-

and hind-hands of the quadrumana. If the carpus of the chimpanzee, for
example, be compared with that of man, the first difference which presents
itself is the comparatively small proportion of the scaphoid which articulates

with the radius, as compared with that in man, in whom the distal articu-

lation of the radius is equally divided between the scaphoides and lunare
which are on the same parallel transverse series. In the chimpanzee and
orang, on the contrary, the scaphoid is elongated, and extends, almost as much

from the os lunare as from the radius, along the radial side of the carpus, to
reach the trapezium and trapezoides ; it is, as it were, interposed between the
lunare of the proximal row and the trapezium and trapezoid of the distal row
of the carpal bones. The similarity of its connections, therefore, in the carpus
with those of the scaphoid in the tarsus (fig. 25, sc.)J is so close that the
serial homology of the two bones is unmistakeable. The astragalus {ih. a),
then, in the foot, repeats the os lunare (/) in the hand, but usurps the whole
of the articular surface of the tibia, and presents a larger proportional size,
especially in man, whose erect position required such exaggerated develop-
ment of the astragalus, or homotype of the lunare. The prominent part of
the calcaneum obviously repeats the prominent pisiforme (/>), and the body
of the calcaneum (cV) articulates with the fibula as the cuneiforme (cm)
articulates with the ulna. The strain upon the homotype of the pisiforme to
produce the required effect in raising the back-part of the foot with its super-

incumbent weight upon the resisting ends of the toes, required its firm
coalescence with the homotype of the cuneiforme ; in other words, the cunei-

forme and pisi forme of the carpus represent together the os calcis of the
tarsus. With regard to the other bones there is no difficulty ; the cuboid
(i) supports the two ulnar digits, iv, v, of the foot, as the unciform bone (m)
does those of the hand : the ecto-cuneiform supports the digitus medius, iii,

of the foot as the os magnum (ni) does that of the hand : the meso-cunei-

form supporting the toe ii is the homotype of the trapezoid supporting the
finger ii, and the ento-cuneiform (ci) is the homotype of the trapezium {t).

    It is no unusual exception that of two essentially distinct bones in one

-- --segment being represented by a coalesced homotype a single bone in an-

other segment, as in the explanation above given of the serial homology of
the calcaneum. The scaphoides and astragalus in the tarsus of the lion are
represented by the single scapho-lunar bone in the carpus. The scaphoid
and a cuneiform bone in the tarsus of the sloth and megatherium are repre-
sented by the single scapho-trapezium in the carpus.

    I have long entertained the opinion that an appreciation, vague and indi-

stinct, perhaps, of certain serial homologies, may have been associated with,

if it did not suggest the epithets " scapula of the head," " femur of the head,"
&c. applied to certain cranial bones by Oken and Spix.

    To Cuvier this language seemed little better than unintelligible and mystical

jargon, and he always alludes to it with ill-disguised contempt*. It has beea
commonly cited by those who have followed the great palaeontologist in de-
preciating the crauio-vertebral theory, as a sufficient instance, needing no

comment, of the extravagances essentially inherent in such attempts to recog-
nise and explain the fundamental pattern to which the modifications of the

cranial bones are subordinated. And it must be confessed that the expres-

sions by which the philosophical anatomists of the school of Schelling have

endeavoured to illustrate in the animal structures the transcendental idea of
'the repetition of the whole in every part,' have operated most disadvan-
tageously and discouragingly to the progress of calm and dispassionate
inductive inquiry into that higher law or condition upon which the power

of determining the special homologies of the bones of the skeleton depends.

Nevertheless the utterances of gifted spirits to whom the common intellectual

storehouse is indebted for such original and suggestive generalizations as those
contained in the " Program iiber die Bedeutung der Schiidelknochen " are
entitled to some, and we will hope to respectful consideration, even when
they happen to be least intelligible or most counter to the conventional ex-
pressions of the current anatomical knowledge of the day ; nor will the at-

tempt to detect their latent meaning be wholly unproductive.
    With regard, for example, to the term ' scapula capitis ' applied by Oken

to the tympanic bone in birds (fig. 23, 25), it is quite possible that some ap-
preciation of its serial homology with ribs and other modifications of the pleur-
apophysial element, besides that exhibited by the blade-bone, may have lain at
the bottom of the expression. And, we may ask, whether the error here be not
rather in the mode of expressing the relationship than in the relationship itself?

Had Oken, for example, said that the tympanic bone of the bird was a modified

' pleurapophysis,' or expressed by any other equivalent general term his idea of
its standing in such general relation to its proper cranio-vertebral segment, his
language would not only have been accurate, but might have been intel-

ligible to Cuvier. When Oken called the ' tympanic ' a ' cranial scapula ' he

unduly extended the meaning of the term ' scapula,' and converted it from a
specific to a generic one. The tympanic is the homotype of the scapula,
both being modified pleurapophyses, but each has an equal claim to its proper
or specific name indicative of their respective modifications.

   I am aware that Oken meant more than mere serial homology when he

called the tympanic the ' blade-bone of the head ': it is part of the phraseology
of the hypothesis of the head being a repetition of the whole body, &c. But
at the time when that anatomist wrote it was not known or suspected that
the head already possessed the scapula, and that the modified pleurapophysis
so called, actually appertained to a segment of the skull (fig. 5, so, si). In

the terms 'femur capitis,' 'tibia,' 'Jlbula,' 'pes capitis,' applied by Oken to the
parts of the teleologically compound mandibular ramus, and in those of ' ulna
and ' manus capitis,' applied to the distal segments (21, 22) of the maxillary
arch, we have not only instances of the attempt to express general relations of
repetition or homology by special terms, but these modes of expressing the
serial homologies of nos. 29, 30, 32, and of 21 and 22, betrays the misappre-
ciation of the general homologies of the locomotive extremities, and their

relations to the vertebral arches supporting them.

   To gain an insight into whatever proportion of truth may be involved in

the ideas signified by the phrases above cited, it is necessary to determine
the essential nature of the parts called ' femur,' ' tibia,' ' humerus,' ' ulna,'
' manus,' ' pes,' &c., or the general homology, in short, of locomotive members,
and the attempt to master this problem has been not the least difficult part
of the present inquiry. Cuvier has oflPered no opinion, nor does he appear
to have ever troubled himself with the attempt to decipher the significa-
tion of the locomotive members of the vertebrate animals ; i. e. of what
parts of the primordial or pre-existing vertebrate model they are the

modifications.

    Oken's idea of the essential nature of the arms and legs is, that they are no
other than 'liberated ribs ': " Freye Bewegungsorgane konnen nichts anderes
als frey gewordene Rippen seyn *."

   Carus, in his ingenious endeavours to gain a view of the primary homologies

of the locomotive members, sees in their several joints repetitions of vertebral

-- --bodies (tertiar-wirbel) vertebrae of the third degreef 'aresultof an ultimate

analysis of a skeleton pushed to the extent of the term ' vertebra' being made
to signify little more than what an ordinary anatomist would call a ' bone.'
But these transcendental analyses sublimate all diff"erences, and definite
knowledge of a part evaporates in such unwarrantable extension of the mean-

ing of terms.

    It has been, however, I trust, satisfactorily demonstrated that a vertebra

is a natural group of bones, that it may be recognised as a primary division
or segment of the endoskeleton, and that the parts of that group are definable
and recognizable under all their teleological modifications, their essential

relations and characters appearing through every adaptive mask.

   According to the definition of which a vertebra has seemed to me to be sus-
ceptible, we recognise the centrum, the neural arch, the haemal arch, and the
appendages diverging or radiating from the haemal arch. The centrum,

though the basis, is not less a part of a vertebra than are the neurapophyses,
haemapophyses, pleurapophyses, &c. ; and each of these parts is a different
part from the other : to call all these parts * vertebrae ' is in effect to deny

* Lehrbuch der Natur Philosophic, p. 330, 8vo, 1843.

their differential and subordinate characters, and to voluntarily abdicate the        J
power of appreciating and expressing them. The terms ' secondary ' or                 1

' tertiary vertebrae ' cannot, therefore, be correctly applied to the parts or        ^
appendages of that natural segment of the endoskeleton to the whole of                I
which segment the term 'vertebra' ought to be restricted.                             "

   So li lie wise the term ' rib ' may be given to each moiety of the haemal arch
of a vertebra ; although I would confine it to the pleurapophyses when they
present that long and slender form characteristic of the thoracic abdominal

region, viz. that part of such modified haemal or costal arch to which the term
' vertebral rib ' is applied in comparative anatomy and the term ' pars ossea
costce ' in anthropotomy : but, admitting the wider application of the term
'rib' to the whole haemal arch unJer every modification, yet the bony di-
verging and backward projecting appendage of such rib or arch is something
different from the part supporting it.

   Arms and legs, therefore, are developments of costal appendages, but are
not ribs themselves liberated : although liberated ribs may perform analo-
gous functions, as in the serpents and the Draco volans.

   If then the arms or pectoral members be modified developments of the
diverging appendage of the scapulo-coracoid arch, and if this be the haemal
arch of the occipital vertebra, it follows that the pectoral members are
parts of the head, and that the scapula, coracoid, humerus, radius and ulna,
carpals, metacarpals and phalanges, are essentially bones of the skull.

   The transcendentalism, thei'efore, which requires for its illustration that
the maxillary arches be the arms and hands of the head, meets its most direct
refutation in the fact of the diverging appendages, properly called arms and
hands, belonging actually to one of the modified segments of which the head

itself consists.

   The head is, therefore, in no sense a summary or repetition of all the rest
of the body: the skull is a province of the whole skeleton, consisting of a
series of parts or segments essentially similar to those of which the rest of

the skeleton is constituted.

    Most of the phrases by which Spix attempted to systematize and carry out
the repetition-hypotheses of Schelling and Oken, as applied to the osteology
of the vertebrate skull, may be similarly explained, and when well-winnowed
some grains of truth may be recovered.

    In denominating the palatine bone the ' hyoid bone of the face,' Spix en-
deavours to express a relation of general homology by a term which should
be confined to the enunciation of a special homology : but he adds " cornui
ossis hyoidei anterior! analogum," which shows an almost correct appreci-
ation of the serial homology of the palatine bone. It answers, however, in
the maxillary arch to the stylo-hyal or proximal element of the hyoidean
arch, not to the cerato-hyal or haemapophysial element ; and it needs only to
recognise the palatine as the ' pleurapophysis ' of its vertebral segment, to
appreciate all its true serial homologies. It might as well have been called the

'tympanic pedicle of the face,' the 'styloid process,' the 'scapula,' the 'vertebral

--rib,' or the ' ilium of the face', according to Oken's and Spix's faulty method

ol' expressing serial homological relations, since it holds in its vertebral segment
the same place which each of the above-named bones respectively does in its

segment.
    So also, with regard to the term ' os faciei iliacum ' applied by Spix to the

mastoid (s), the error lies not only in the application of a special term to ex-
press a general homological relation, but in the supposed serial homology so

expressed. Hnd Spix detected, in a cranial vertebra, the precise element

answering to tliat called ' iliac bone ' in a post-abdominal vertebra, yet it

would have been more proper to have signified such serial homology by giving
the general term applicable to such parts, as abstract vertebral elements.

   The Fact is, hovi'ever, that the mastoid (s) is the parapophysis of its verte-
bra, whilst the ilium is a portion of the pleurapophysis of its vertebra ; and
the mastoid is serially homologous with the transverse process (parapophysis)

of a sacral vertebra (fig. 27, p), not with the pleurapophysis or ' ilium ' ; it

is not, therefore, a repetition of the ilium in the skull. The true expression
of the ideas which suggested the terms ' ilium of the head,' ' scapula of the

head,' &c., will be found in the true enunciation of the serial homologies of

the vertebrate skeleton.

    It finally remains for inquiry, admitting the explanation of the endoskeletal

archetype given in this Report to be the true one, whether such is the

ultimate attainable generalization, or whether we may not also gain an in-

sight into the nature of the force by which all the modifications of the

vertebrate skeleton, even those subservient to the majesty of man himself,
are still subordinated to a common type.

  We perceive in the fact of the endoskeleton consisting of a succession

--of segments similarly composed, in the very power, in short, of enunciating

special, general and serial homologies,^--an illustration of thatlaw of vegetative

or irrelative repetition which is so much more conspicuously manifested by

the segments of the exoskeleton of the invertebrata, as, for example, in the
rings of the centipede and worm, and in the more multiplied parts of the

skeletons of the echinoderms.

   The repetition of similar segments in a vertebral column, and of similar

elements in a vertebral segment, is analogous to the repetition of similar cry-
stals as the result of polarizing force in the growth of an inorganic body.

   Not only does the principle of vegetative repetition prevail more and more
as we descend in the scale of animal life, but the forms of the repeated parts
of the skeleton approach more and more to geometrical figures ; as we see,
for example, in the external skeletons of the echini and star-fishes : nay, the
calcifying salt actually assumes in such low-organized skeletons the very
crystalline figures which characterize it when deposited, and subject to the
general polarizing force, out of the organized body. Here, therefore, we
have direct proof of the concurrence of such general and all-pervading polar-

izing force with the adaptive or special organizing force in the development
of an animal body.

   The marvellous phsenomena of this development have, hitherto, been ex-
plained by two hypotheses or forms of expression, as the result, viz. of ' vital
properties' either peculiar to living matter or common to all, but latent in
dead, matter ; or, as due to th(' operation of one or more 'vital principles,*
vital forces, dynamies or faculties, answering to the JBeat of Plato, deemed
by that philosopher to be superadded to matter and mind, and which he de-
fined as a sort of models, or moulds in which matter is cast, and which
regularly produce the same number and diversity of species*.

   Now besides the ]Ha, organizing principle, vital property, or force, which

produces the diversity of form belonging to living bodies of the same materials,
which diversity cannot be explained by any known properties of matter, there
appears also to be in counter-operation during the building up of such bodies
the polarizing force pervading all space, and to the operation of which force,
or mode of force, the similarity of forms, the repetition of parts, the signs
of the unity of organization may be mainly ascribed.

   The platonic IHa or specific organizing principle or force would seem to

                                  * See Barclay, Life and Organization, 8vo, 1822.

be in antagonism with tlie general polarizing force, and to subdue and mould
it in subserviency to the exigences of the resulting specific form.

   The extent to which the operation of the polarizing or vegetative-repeti-
tion-force is so subdued in the organization of a specific animal form becomes
the index of the grade of such species, and is directly as its ascent in the scale
of being. The lineaments of the common archetype are obscured in the same
degree : but even in man, where the specific organizing force has exerted its
highest power in controlling the tendency to type and in modifying each
part in adaptive subserviency to, or combination of power with, another part,
the extent to which the vegetative repetition of segments and the archetypal
features are traceable indicates the degree in which the general polarizing
force may have operated in the arrangement of the parts of the developing
frame : and it is not witliout interest or devoid of significance that such
evidence should be mainly manifested in the system of organs in whose tissue
the inorganic earthy salts most predominate.

On Anemometry. By John Phillips, F.R.S., F.G.S.

Anemometry, or the registration of wind, is a process of recording certain
effects of the (horizontal) pressure or movement of the atmosphere. Ac-

cordino- to the kind of effect which is subjected to observation, and to the
process of measuring, weighing or counting which is adopted, the anemo-

metrical instruments vary, and it is required to determine the forms of these

instruments which are best adapted for accurate meteorological inquiries.
Correct anemometers may be applied with advantage as auxiliaries in a variety
of important problems not meteorological, but they are of primary import-
ance in meteorology, and derive their value in other branches of knowledge

from their proved adaptation to this.

  A complete anemometrical register should give on a scale of time the

direction of the wind, and its pressure or velocity in a continuous series, or

Weat very frequent intervals, for days, weeks, months or years.  may for

particular inquiries be desirous of learning the total space traversed by the

aerial movement, or be satisfied with knowing the maxima and minima of

pressure, in a given period of time, or in other ways simplify the problem,

which in its general form cannot be solved without adding a clock or other

register of time to the apparatus for measuring wind.

                Mecha7iical Effects of the Movement of the Atmosphere.

   The (horizontal) movement of the air over any given point on the earth's
surface, one of the most important desiderata in meteorology, can only be
observed directly in the phaenomena of the clouds. The velocity of these
light bodies may be measured trigonometrically, by their change of position,
or when the sun shines, by observing the progress of their shadows on the
ground. But these are rather experiments than observations, and when we
attempt by instrumental means to register the velocity of the wind, some
considerable difficulties at once appear. The air moves because it is pressed:
machines to be influenced by wind must be made to receive and yield to its
pressure. If this pressure be received on a machine so contrived that it has

a resisting power, which rises with the increase of pressure till equilibrium
is gained, the displacement of the spring, the elongation of the lever, the
augmentation of the weight, &c. may be taken as proportioned to the
                --

Pressure. Many such instruments have been nivented, tlie most famous
being M. Osier's anemometer, first erected at Birmingham.

    But if the pressure (P) be received on an instrumental contrivance, which
(its inertia being overcome) is set into a continuous motion (as the various
sorts of windmills), the rate of this motion goes on increasing till the resist-

ance which the motion generates balances the wind- pressure on the sails.
This resistance consists of two parts, one caused by the displacement of the
air in the path of revolution of the sails, and consequently proportioned to

the square of the velocity of revolution (or to v'-); the other caused by the
ordinary friction of machinery, which being a uniformly retarding force (6),

destroys the power P exerted on the machine a quantity proportioned
to the space moved over*, and consequently to v'. P then is prop, to

+a v'- bv', the coefficients a and b requiring to be separately determined for

each instrument.
   If we conceive friction to be very small, so that the second term almost

vanishes, the velocity of revolution becomes nearly proportioned to V, the
velocity of the wind ; but if friction be very large, the velocity of revolution

of the machine becomes nearly proportioned to P or V^. The former is the

case on a windmill in heavy wind- pressures ; the latter of the same machine
when the wind-pressure is light f.

   Hence all machines of this kind have a rate of revolution proportional to
the movement of the air, retarded by quantities which are proportioned to
something else. The smaller we can make this retardation, the nearer to

--perfection is the instrument. Such an instrument is Whewell's anemometer.
    WheiveU's Anemometer. Assuming in respect of this instrument that its
general action is like that of a windmill, we see with low velocities of wind,
the term b v' is not only greater in proportion to a v'"^ than with high veloci-
ties, but may acquire a higher numerical value than it.

proportions of wind's velocity and revolutions of sail :

are quite within the range of errors of observation.
    Mr. Harris has furnished us with experiments* in which the revolutions

of the vane of Whewell's anemometer were compared directly with the
wind-pressure on Lind's well-known instrument, and to these the same form

   Anemometers on the principle of Dr. Wliewell's, almost perfectly fulfil the
intention of the inventor at high velocities, and also give results capable of
satisfactory interpretation at all velocities down to a certain low rate of
wind movement, but below that the instrument ceases to be sensibly affected.

--Its sensibility to light winds might be perhaps augmented by a change of

construction especially by substituting wheel-work for the screw, and the

sails should probably be set to the angle of maximum effect*. This instru-
ment appears applicable to a variety of problems in which the air-movement
enters as an element. Among the results which have been already obtained

for meteorology by the diligent use of it, Mr. Harris's demonstration of the
path of the air over Plymouth is very conspicuous. Were such records con-
temporaneously kept at only three selected stations in the British Islands, for
a few years, or even one year, and accurately discussed and compared, how
great and how valuable would be the accessions to our knowledge of the

 winds

  --Osier's Anemometer. The pressure of the wind on Osier's anemometer is

resisted by the equable force of a spring, and by the friction of the machinery
for registration. The pressure of the wind is well-known to be subject to fre-
 quent and great pulsations, all of which (except the very quickest and feeblest)

the instrument registers. By enlarging the scale, every the minutest variation

 of the wind's force has been traced during the flow of the minutes and seconds,
so that in one minute twelve conspicuous (besides many smaller) undulations
 of the wind's direction, and twice as many notable risings and fallings of its pres-
 sure have been graphically recorded by the pencils of the anemometerf.
 Thus the machinery is kept in continual and sometimes quick motion, and the
 friction which it generates is considerable. The pressure of the wind then is
 balanced by two forces, one of which is proportional to itself, the other to the
 frequency and extent of the fluctuations of strength and direction of the wind.
 Each of these fluctuations is a function of the pressure ; they are not necessa-
 rily similar functions ; but from Osier's experiments in November and De-
 cember 1846, they seem to be proportionate to one another.

     It is of importance to the theory of this instrument to obtain a correct ex-
 pression for these functions, since if they determine movements whose extent
 is simply proportioned to the pressure, the instrument, properly set to an
 adapted scale, would register exactly for all winds the continually varying

 pressure of the atmosphere down to some certain small pressure, below which
 there will be no record. But if the movements in the machinery caused by
 these pulsations and fluctuations are in extent not simply proportional to the

  wind's pressure, but to something else, as for instance to the wind's velocity,
 the forces balancing the wind's pressure would then be of two kinds, or

 P^aP'-t-6^P'; a similar form of expression to that for Dr. Whewell's

  anemometer ; and this instrument, like Dr. Whewell's, would require a com-
  puted correction, and in small wind-pressures this might become important.

      Mr. Osier's latest inventions have so greatly increased the sensibility of
  his apparatus to light winds, that it may be seen working freely, when
  the wind- pressure is no more between half a pound per foot and 0. This on

tube, of the deviation of a falling body from a vertical Hne, or the recession of a fine spring.
The simple velocity of wind may be measured by the transference of clouds, the shadoTvs
of clouds, or the movement of light bodies near the surface of the earth.

   * Since these remarks were written, the Association has received from the Rev. Dr.
Robinson a notice of the construction of an anemometer with a different mechanism, which
appears to satisfy the much-desired object of a direct registration of the wind's velocity.

   t Report of the Philosophical Society of Birmingham. -
--.344 REPORT 1846.

Lind's anemometer corresponds to the space from 0*0 to 0*10 inch, and to a
velocity of from to 15 feet per second, that is to say, to 10 miles per
hour*.

    Except the instrument be very carefully constructed, this degree of accu-
racy is unattainable, and pressures less than ^Ib. per foot, and velocities of

several miles per hour, may not be recorded at all. One of the most inter-

--esting of the powers connected with the use of this instrument has been

already noticed, the power of studying the momentary phases of air-move-
ment at the observatory. This is peculiar to the principle of Mr. Osier's
invention ; another result of great importance has been derived from the study
of its tracings. The force of the wind for every hour of the day and night
has been determined not only for the whole air-movement, but for each direc-
tion of wind, and in each season of the year. Mr. Osier's conclusions on
this subject, supported by Harris, Brewster and Sabine, go directly to deter-
mine a law of the wind's daily pressure and to connect it with the progress
of diurnal heat. In fact the curves of daily wind-force and of daily mean
temperature are almost identical, as may be seen in Col. Sabine's Observations
ou the Meteorology of Toronto.

   The same registration gives data for investigating what may be called

curves of storm pressure, the law according to which wind-pressure rises to

a maximum and sinks to a minimum, a subject of great interest and import-
ance. From some data which may be found in Mr. Osier's Report, in the

volume of the Association for 1840, I have obtained the following Table of
pressures during a strong wind of 96 hours' duration.

prepared with such a scale, the ordinates of velocity may be measured off
with nearly as much accuracy as those of pressure, and the mean velocity

men, p. 345, both for velocity and pressure, with very little additional expense.

    The pressure lines may be continuous, the velocity lines dotted. Such a

velocity of the wind. In many cases winds of several miles an hour have been

    Lind's Anemometer. In I.ind's anemometer, the pressure of wind is ba-
lanced by tlie weight of a column of water, -\- the force due to the friction of
its movement. Owing to the facility of liquid movements, this instrument, if
made with a siphon of large diameter, is very quick in its indications, and
prettily exhibits what Mr. Osier's pencils record, the continual fluctuations
of the wind. Pressures which move the water to a difference of level of less
than one-twentieth of an inch, can scarcely be noted accurately, but may be
estimated to one-fortieth or one-fiftieth. This gives as the limit of wind-ve-
locity reallj' measurable five or seven miles an hour.

   Lind's anemometer may be rendered self-registering, but not without
some sacrifice of its quickness and accuracy *.

   It is possible to arrange apparatus which shall allow of the flowing of a
liquid under the pressure of the atmosphere with the velocity due to that

pressure ; it is also possible so to regulate the direction of this flowing that the

direction shall be known of the wind to which the efflux is due ; and in other
ways the apparatus may be varied; but it does not appear that by these pro-
cesses any real advantage can be gained over the instruments of Whewell
and Osier, when these are properly attended to. I proceed therefore to an-
other view of the subject.

                 Molecular Effects of the Movement of the Atmosphere.

the molecular condition of the air, and on its rate of movement ; if it can

be made the basis of wind-registration, there will be no mechanism required
for recording the measures of air-movement or pressure, and the scale of re-
sults will increase in accuracy as the wind-force grows less, and may be in this
direction more and more trusted as we approach to zero; a circumstance which
would confer upon this mode of anemometry a peculiar value, and render it
almost a necessary complement to the mechanical processes now in use, for
these take but little notice of very light Avinds, which yet it is of much im-

portance to record.

   One of these joint effects of the molecular constitution of the air, com-
bined with its rate of movement, is seen in the rapidity with which objects

exposed to wind acquire the temperature of the atmosphere.

   If a thermometer whose temperature differs from that of the atmosphere

mby degrees be exposed in the open air, it instantly begins to undergo

change of temperature, and loses or gains heat continually until it has be-
come sensibly of the same temperature as the surrounding medium. This
effect, a mixed result of radiation and conduction of heat, is in the open air

mvery nearly in simple proportion to ; but in closed vessels, where conduc-

tion is impeded and radiation influential, the changing temperature of the

surrounding bodies complicates the experiment, and the wet thermometer
does not in this case lose or gain heat in the same simple proportion to m.

   Exposure of the thermometer to a current of wind accelerates the process
by which its temperature is made sensibly equal to that of the surrounding
medium, and thus by careful experiments the momentary velocity of the
current may be estimated, as Sir John Leslie has proposed *.

   If we maintain a continual moisture on the bulb of the thermometer, a
new element of change of temperature is introduced, the force of vaporiza-

tion, the effect of which is finally to reduce the thermometer to the tempera-
ture of evaporation, where it remains.

   If we commence the experiment with the temperature of the wet bulb

mraised by the quantity above that of the surrounding atmosphere (t), it will

sink under the operation of two forces, the cooling power of air, proportioned
to m, and the force of vaporization. (The movement of the air is not now
considered.) By the sum of these forces it approximates to t, at which point

m being =0, the cooling power of the air ceases. By the force of vaporiza-

tion it is depressed below this point to t!, but between t and t! the air exerts
a heating power proportioned to m. The rate of cooling in air of a wet-bulb
thermometer is thus found to be complicated with two quite distinct functions,

at every point but one, viz. at the temperature t of the atmosphere ; at this
point it depends solely on the force of vaporization, modified by the move-

ment of the air. If then we perform a series of experiments on the rate of
cooling of a wet-bulb thermometer exposed in the open air, from #4-|░ to
t--\░, under the influence of winds of very unequal velocity, and under the
influences of very unequal degrees of dampness in the air, we shall be able
to distinguish the effects of these influences, and assign to each its proper
functional expression. But if one of these can be determined theoretically,

fewer experiments will be required. It appears that the cooling influence of
evaporation at different temperatures and in different hygrometrical states of
the atmosphere can be thus determined.

   The rate of evaporation of water in the atmosphere depends upon the force
of aqueous vapour at that temperature, diminished by the force of the aqueous
vapour actually present in the atmosphere. Thus if/' represent the force of
vapour at the temperature of evaporation, and/" the force of vapour at the

For determining the influence of the rate of air-movement on the rate of

cooling of the wet bulb, several processes have been employed, both in the

open air and in the house.

1. In the first place, choosing a day when the air was considered nearly

calm, (i.e. moving so gently that only leaves with very flexible petioles were

swayed by it,) the wet bulb was first suspended at rest in this gentle current

(A); secondly, it was carried across it( B) at the rate of 2-75 miles an hour;

thirdly, it was sicung across it at the rate of 6'18 miles an hour (C). The

efi'ects are recorded in the table below.

in the several conditions, appear below :

and are obviously not in simple proportion to the velocity of the air-move-
ment in the several cases. If we suppose the so-called 'calm' air to move
two miles an hour (which the movement of smoke at the time seemed to in-

dicate), the velocities, obtained by calculating the diagonals of the air-move-

ments combined with the thermometer-movements, would be as under :--

may perhaps not be wholly eliminated at even 20 or 24; inches distance.
Perhaps no better mode of experiment on this peculiar transportation of the
atmosphere by railway trains could be devised than the trial of its cooling

power. In the first of the above experiments the air-displacement appeared
to be about 13 miles an hour at 3 inches from the carriage ; about 24 miles
at 18 inches, and 30 miles at 24 inches.

   The result noAV arrived at must, however, be regarded as only a first ap-
proximation, and requires to be tested and corrected by more rigorous pro-
cesses. For this purpose the cooling of the wet bulb has been observed
when carried round by a lathe movement, and when subject to the vibrations
of a pendulum. The results are yet incomplete, but may be offered for the
consideration of the Association on a future occasion.

Report on the Crystalline Slags. By John Percy, M.D.

We have pleasure in now presenting to the Association the results of our

investigation of the cr3'stalline slags. It is obvious that such an investiga-

tion must be limited by the opportunity of obtaining specimens, which re-

quire to be diligently sought for at the various metallurgical works ; and

that, consequently, it is impossible for us at present to offer anything like a

Wecomplete report upon this interesting subject.  have however been for-

tunate in procuring already an extensive series of beautifully crystallized

Weslags, several of which we have not yet had time to examine.             are espe-

cially indebted to Mr. John Dawes, of West Bromwich, and to Messrs.

Blackwell and Twamley, of Dudley, for many valuable contributions. In

the present Report we have confined our attention to the slags produced in

Wethe smelting and manufacture of iron.  shall adopt the following ar-

rangement:
   1 The crystallographic and mineralogical description by Professor Miller.
   2. The analysis*.

    3. Special remarks.

   The first series is composed of six specimens. Nos. 1 and 2 were ob-
tained from hot-blast furnaces in the vicinity of Dudley ; Nos. 3 and 4 from
Messrs. Blackwell's hot-blast furnaces at Russell's-hall, near Dudley ; No. 4
from one of Mr. Philip Williams's cold-blast furnaces, at the Wednesbury
Oak Works, near Tipton ; No. 6 was brought by Mr. Samuel Blackwell from
a hot-blast furnace named La Providence, at Marchienne, Charleroi, Bel-
gium. No. 3 was produced when the furnace was considered to be work-
ing unsatisfactorily, from some interruption to the free course of the blast.

   The crystals of the slag No. 3 are square prisms, terminated by planes
perpendicular to the axis of the prism. Many of the prisms have their
angles truncated by planes, making equal angles with the adjacent faces of

the prism.

 --Analysis. The slags composing the first series were found to contain

silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, protoxides of manganese and iron, potass in

small quantity, and sulphur as sulphuret. Phosphoric acid was also found
in some of them. They are readily decomposed by digestion with dilute

--hydrochloric acid. The following method of analysis was adopted.
   Method of Analysis 1. The fine powder obtained by trituration in an
agate mortar was digested with dilute hydrochloric acid. The whole was
evaporated to dryness. The dry mass was treaXed with hydrochloric acid,

and left for a few hours. Nitric acid was added sometimes before and some-
times after evaporation to peroxidize the iron. The silica separated by fil-

tration was washed with boiling water until nitrate of silver ceased to pro-

duce the slightest turbidity, dried, incinerated at a bright red heat, cooled

under a glass shade containing sulphuric acid, and then weighed.

   2. To the acid solution was added a slight excess of ammonia. Filtration
was conducted as rapidly as possible, the funnel being covered with a glass

plate.

   3. The precipitate (2) was boiled with potass. The solution was treated
with an excess of hydrochloric acid, and the alumina then precipitated by
carbonate of ammonia.

   4. The insoluble residue (3) was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the
iron was precipitated by succinate of soda or ammonia with the usual pre-

cautions.

   5. The lime was precipitated by oxalate of ammonia from solution (2),
after treatment by ammonia. The precipitate, which consisted of oxalate of

lime mixed with oxalate of manganese, was incinerated at a bright red heat,

and then digested with dilute acetic acid, which dissolved the lime and left

Athe brown oxide of manganese.    slight excess of sulphuric acid was added

to the solution of acetate of lime ; the whole was evaporated to dryness, and

heated to redness; from the sulphate of lime thus obtained the lime was

calculated.

   6. The solution (4), after separation of the iron, was added to solution (5)
after separation of the lime. The manganese was precipitated by hydrosul-
phate of ammonia in a close vessel, and in every instance at least twelve
hours were allowed for precipitation. The sulphuret of manganese was dis-

solved in hydrochloric acid, and precipitated as carbonate by carbonate of

potass. The carbonate of manganese was incinerated at a bright red heat
for a considerable time. The oxide of manganese thus produced was esti-

mated as MnO + Mn= 0^.

   7. The solution (6), after precipitation of the manganese, was digested
with excess of hydrochloric acid until the sulphur separated by decomposi-

tion of the excess of hydrosulphate of ammonia had completely separated.
The magnesia was precipitated by phosphate of soda and excess of ammonia.

Generally twenty-four or forty hours were allowed for complete precipita-
tion. The precipitate was washed with ammonia-water until no sensible

residue was left by evaporation on a plate of glass. When dry, generally
as much of the magnesian salt as possible was detached from the filter, and
                     ON THE CRYSTALLINE SLAGS.  353

slowly heated to reduess ; the filter, with what adhered to it, was then intro-
duced into the crucible and incinerated as usual.

   8. To determine the potass, the slag was digested as usual in hydrochloric
acid, the iron was peroxidized by nitric acid, and the solution was then
treated with excess of carbonate of ammonia. The filtrate was evaporated
to dryness, and the ammoniacal salts were expelled by heat. The residue
was treated with boiling water, and the solution filtered from the brownish
residue. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness after the addition of excess
of sulphuric acid. The residue was dissolved in water, acetate of baryta
was added in excess, the sulphate of baryta was separated with the usual
precautions by filtration ; the filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and after-
wards heated to redness. The solution contained the potass as carbonate;
hydrochloric acid was added, and from the amount of chloride obtained by
evaporation and heating to low redness, the potass was estimated. Berze-
lius's method of separating potass from magnesia by oxide of mercury was

also occasionally resorted to.

   9. The sulphur was determined either by oxidizing with strong nitrous
acid, or by fusing with nitrate of potass and a mixture of carbonate of potass
and soda. Chloride of barium was added to the acid solution. From the
sulphate of baryta produced the sulphur was estimated.

   10. The method resorted to for the detection of phosphoric acid will be

described in each case.

   The actual quantities of the substances found by analysis will always be
given, in order that the calculations may be corrected in the event of any
errors in the received atomic weights being corrected by future observers.
The calculations have been made from the tables in the French translation
of Rose's work by Peligot (Paris, 1843).

                     1. Analysis. By J. P.

1. Weight of slag employed 27*57 grains, after having been gently heated

over a spirit-lamp.

2. Silica 10-49.

3. Alumina 3-89.

4. Sulphate of lime 24'35.

5. Phosphate of magnesia (2MgO, P░- O^) 5-74.

6. Oxide of manganese (MnO + MnO^O^) 0-12.

7. Sesquioxide of iron 0*39.

8. Potass. Weight of slag employed 50*47 grains. Chloride of potas-

Asium 1-48.  minute quantity of precipitate was produced by the addition

of antimoniate of potass to the solution. The quantity of chlorine was de-

termined by nitrate of silver. The chloride of silver obtained weighed 2*814

grains, which correspond to 0*694 of chlorine. 1*48 of chloride of potassium
by the tables, contains 0*702 of chlorine. Difference 0*702-- 0*694=0*008.

The chloride may therefore be estimated as nearly pure chloride of potassium.

   9. Sulphur. Hydrosulphuric acid was liberated by the action of hydro-
chloric acid. Weight of slag 22*68. The nitrous acid process was" em-
ployed. The sulphate of baryta weighed 0*59. It was ascertained that the
slag did not contain sulphuric acid. The sulphur is admitted to exist as

sulphuret of calcium.

   10. Phosphoric acid was not detected. Weight of the slag employed
51*38 grains. It was digested with hydrochloric acid, and the silica sepa-
rated as usual. The precipitate obtained by the addition of ammonia in
slight excess was dissolved by hydrochloric acid ; tartaric acid was added.

   10. Phosphoric acid. The alumina and oxide of iron obtained in the pre-
ceding analysis were fused for a considerable time with bisulphate of potass.
The mass was digested with hydrochloric acid ; some flocculent matter re-
mained undissolved. To the solution tartaric acid was added, and after-
wards chloride of magnesium and excess of ammonia. Two days afterwards
minute crystalline particles were observed adhering to the glass. On exa-
mination with a simple microscope, the well-known stai'-shaped crystals of
phosphate of magnesia and ammonia were immediately recognised. The solu-
tion was allowed to stand several days afterwards. The minute quantity of
crystals was collected on a filter, and washed with cold ammonia-water, until
no sensible residue was left by evaporation on a plate of glass. After in-
cineration the phosphate of magnesia weighed 0*06. The phosphoric acid is

admitted to exist in combination with the alumina.

   From an examination of the preceding analyses, it is evident that the fol-

lowing formula is the correct expression of the composition of this series :

              AP03, Si03 + 2(3(Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe)0, SiO^)-

The formula differs from that of Vesuvian, in containing two equivalents of
the silicate of lime series instead of one. Ivanov however has described a
mineral from Slatoust, identical in composition with the preceding slags
(Rammelsberg, Part 2. p. 258, and first supplement, p. 151); but Professor
H. Rose informs us that the analysis of Ivanov has been clearly proved

erroneous. Berthier has given the results of several analyses of slags
from blast furnaces of nearly the same composition, but has incorrectly de-

+duced the formula " (Ca, Mg, M, f)S AS," which is that of Vesuvian.

He has also omitted in his analysis of a slag from Dudley, protoxide of man-

ganese, potass and sulphur, which were found in all the preceding analyses

of slags from the same locality.

                                  7. Analysis. By J. P.

   This slag was obtained from one of Mr. Dawes's hot-blast furnaces at
Oldbury. It was found mixed with coke and other matters ; it contains
globules of iron, and sulphur may be readily observed deposited here and
there upon the crystalline plates.

   The crystals are thin square plates, the lateral faces of which are perpen-
dicular to each other, and to the terminal faces. They appear to belong to
the pyramidal system. They are white, and when very thin transparent.

   Hardness =5-7.

       indicative of soda was observed.
h. By the addition of the solution of antimoniate of potass to a few

         drops of the solution on a watch-glass, a minute quantity of preci-

         pitate appeared.

   9. Sulphur. Hydrosulphuric acid was copiously evolved by the action
of hydrochloric acid. Sulphur existed in three states, free, combined as sul-

phuret, and also as sulphuric acid. The free sulphur was not estimated.

The nitrous acid process was adopted. M"?^ grains, weighed after expul-

sion of the sulphur by heat, furnished of sulphate of baryta 1*71. By a

second determination of sulphur 13"0I grains, heated as before, and treated

with nitrous acid, gave of sulphate of baryta 1'58. By the first total sul-

phur                                        r60 per cent.

Sulphur as sulphuric acid. 9'72 grains heated as before to expel free sul-

phur, were digested with hydrochloric acid. Evaporation to dryness was

omitted, and the solution was immediately filtered; baryta water was added

to the filtrate. The sulphate of baryta weighed 0'104. This, by tables,

corresponds to 0'37 per cent, of sulphuric acid, and to 0*15 of sulphur.
The whole amount of sulphur is 1*63. Therefore 1*63-- 0"15=1'4'8 is the

sulphur combined as sulphuret.

In slag 7 we may probably be justified in regarding the sulphate of lime and
sulphuret of calcium as impurities, and in no way connected with the for-
mula just as the water, which appears to exist in natural Gehlenite in

                        ;

variable proportion, may be similarly regarded. Metallic iron and frag-
ments of coke being mixed up in the slag, the crystalline plates were care-

fully selected as free from impurity as possible.
   The oxygen of the silica is to the oxygen in either the alumina or lime

bases in the proportion of 4 to 3. This leads to the formula

                       3(3CaO, Si03) + 3A12 03, Si 03,

or as represented by Berzelius's method of notation,

                     SCa'Si-l-Als'si,

which also appears to represent the constitution of Gehlenite more nearly

+than 2Ca3 Si Al^Si, which is usually assigned to it (Rammelsberg, Hand-

worterbuch, Theil i. p. 250 ; second supplement, p. 53).
   By contracting the following calculations from the respective foimuloe

this statement will appear clear.

--360 REPORT 1846.

We are unable to conjecture why the latter formula should have been pre-

ferred to the former, unless because the combination Al', Si was supposed
improbable ; examples however of such a combination are afforded by KoUy-

+rite Al^si ISH, Heterokline Mn^'Si, and Sismondine 4'Fe3 Si+SAJsSi

+ 15H.

We may also call attention to the fact, that the slag in question has the

same hardness as natural Gehlenite.

Admitting this slag to be really Gehlenite, the circumstance of its pro-

duction at a high temperature in an iron furnace, may possibly be made

available by the geologist in explaining the formation of the rocks in which

Wethe natural mineral occurs in Fassathal in the Tyrol.  subjoin in a note

the following interesting description of the locality of Gehlenite by Von

Buch, translated by Mr. Warington Smyth, of the Museum of Economic

Geology *.

                                                                          8.

   This specimen was also presented to us by Mr. Dawes. It was obtained
during the process of remelting cast iron with lime in a small cupola.

   No. 8 is a mass of pearl-gray slag containing imbedded long yellow crystals
which appear to be square prisms with the angles truncated, cleavable per-
pendicular to the axis of the prism. In part of the specimen the crystals
are very fine and radiated.

                                 8. Analysis. By D. F.

   Nitrous acid was employed, instead of hydrochloric, to decompose this
slag. Magnesia and potass were not present. After the precipitation of the

   * The syenite of Mount Monzon descends steeply from the snow limit, and is very like
the zircon syenite of Norway. The hornblende is green, and accompanied by grains of
iron pyrites. Tourmaline also appears there in crystals, radiating from a centre. In cracks
and hollows of this syenite are found Vesuvian, Gehlenite, brown garnet, Ceylanite and

Fassaite, a sort of augite.

   In ascending the branch valley from Vigo to Monzon (see plan) fine cliflfs of dolomite are
seen on both sides, and on the left the augitic porphyry, or melaphyre, is seen to underUe
it ; higher up the whole valley is strewed with blocks of syenite fallen from the Alp above.

   From beneath the height may be seen a thick bed of Vesuvian, from which fragments
often fall, though no one has as yet been able to ascend to it ; its crj'stals are four-sided
prisms vrith the terminal faces much-modified, and are always imbedded in calc spar, gene-

rally of a blue colour.
    Cordier considered that the Gehlenite is only Vesuvian with its crystallization impeded by

the presence of calc spar. There are also brown crystals enveloped in calc spar, with

neither end free, and these are undistinguishable from Vesuvian. When they form groups

together, they lose lustre and colour, and the calc spar disappears. The only place where
it is found is quite on the west side of the syenite, close to the dolomite ; for it is only near
the edges that calc spar, which always accompanies these foreign minerals, is found in the

syenite.

    Above the Vesuvian and Gehlenite are fine druses of Ceylanite in crowded and generally
good dark octohedrons ; which were probably at first also imbedded in calc spar, since a
little of it, with corroded surface, sometimes lies among the crystals. In a similar manner
the sort of augite termed Fassaite Ues in calc spar ; when fresh the crystals are fine grass-
green : this augite is often found on the sides of Vesuvian crystals.

    At Monzon the cracks are often covered with fine rhombohedrons of chabasite, and some-
times are slight traces of mesotype, the only zooUtes found here ; though among the other

 zooUtes in the Fassa valley chabasite is not found.
    The relations of this syenite to the red sandstone and to the porphyry are diflicult to

 determine, from the great steepness of the mountain on the south side also.

boldtilite, as deduced from the analysis of Von Kobell (Rammelsberg, 2nd

part, p. 308), nearly represents the constitution of this slag. The formula

in question is

                              3R2Si + RSi.

We introduce Von Kobell's analysis (Rammelsberg, 1st part, p. 314) :--

to be identical with Mellilite*; and this formula is precisely that which we
have given for the first series of blast-furnace slags. For the sake of com-
parison we subjoin Damour's analyses.

   Berzelius remarks that " in designating by r the bases with 1 atom of

+oxygen, and by R the bases with 3 atoms of oxygen, the iormula 2r S R S

will be obtained, which expresses a somewhat rare kind of composition."

   The two following specimens were communicated by M. Krautz, the
well-known mineralogist of Berlin. They were labelled, Olsberger Fur-

naces, on the Rhine.
    No. 9 contains a drusy cavity with projecting crystals, which are not suf-

ficiently bright for measurement with the reflective goniometer. They
appear to belong to the oblique prismatic system. They have a single end-

=face which is not at right angles to the axis of the prism. Hardness 5.

   To one side of each of these specimens are attached minute scales of

graphite.

                                 9. Analysis a. By J. P.

The three following slags not being decomposable by hydrochloric acid,

the method of fusion with a mixture of equal parts of carbonate of potass

and soda* was resorted to.

   1. Weight of slag 20"16 after heating over a spirit-lamp and cooling over
SO^. Being extremely hard, it was broken between writing-paper on an iron

plate, further reduced in a steel mortar, and finally triturated in an agate

mortar, and levigated until the whole piece detached was reduced to im-

palpable powder. It was fused with 80 grains of the carbonate of potass-

soda mixture. The fused mass had a blue-green colour.

2. Silica 10-74.

3. Alumina 1-02.

4. Sulphate of lime 14-88.

5. Phosphate of magnesia 5-21.

6. Oxide of manganese 0*31.

7. Sesquioxide of iron 0-23.
8. Potass. Weight of slag 50-51 grains. Fused with 200 grains of car-

bonate of baryta and proceeded in the usual way. This alkali was distinctly

recognised by the following tests :

      c. Bichloride of platinum produced the characteristic yellow granular

      precipitate.

      b. Carbazotic acid, after the lapse of a short time, produced the charac-

      teristic crystals of carbazotate of potass.

      c. No indication of the presence of soda was furnished by antimoniate

                 of potass.

A source of error occurring, the weight of the chloride of potassium was notl

determined; however, it is certain that the quantity must have been veryj

small, less than in any of the preceding analyses.

   9. Sulphur existed combined as sulphuret in minute quantity. By the ac-l

tion of hydrochloric acid a slight evolution of gas was occasioned, but it hadi

the odour of hydrogen (from particles of iron detached from the steel mor-

tar ?), obtained by the action of an acid on iron ; the odour of hydrosulphuricj

acid  could not  be distinctly recognised                                                                                   yet  on  suspending for  some time al

mina exists probably as an accidental constituent, and does not enter into
the formula (Vide ' Handbuch der Chemie,' von L. Gmelin, Zweiter Band,

   As the crystallization was very confused, and as the analytical results do
not point satisfactorily to a formula, we do not attempt to deduce any rational

expression of the composition of this slag.

                                                                           12.

   This specimen of " Refinery Cinder" was produced in the Bromford Iron
Works, near Birmingham, and was communicated by one of the proprietors,
our friend Mr. John Dawes. The process of refining, which is not now ex-
tensively practised in Staffordshire, consists in exposing the surface of melted
cast iron to the action of a blast. The products ai'e refined or white iron,
and " refinery cinder" or slag.

                                  12. Analysis. By D. F.

 --Method of Analysis. 25-178 grains were fused with 80 of the carbonate

of potass-soda mixture and 30 of nitrate of potass. The fused mass was de-
composed by hydrochloric acid, and the solution evaporated to dryness. The
dry mass was digested with hydrochloric acid and filtered. The silica on the
filter not being white, it was again fused with 40 grains of the carbonate of
r ON THE CRYSTALLINE SLAGS.                                   365

potass-soda mixture and .10 of nitrate of potass. The fused mass was digested

as before with hydrochloric acid ; but even then the silica did not appear

perfectly white, and, accordingly, it was again fused and treated as before,

when it was obtained beautifully white. The alumina was determined in the

usual way. The iron and manganese were separated by the succinate plan.
On redissolving both the oxides of iron and manganese, a small quantity of

silica was left, which was collected and added to that previously obtained.

The solution from which the alumina was separated, was precipitated by a

little chloride of barium, and the sulphur determined from the sulphate of

baryta : the excess of chloride of barium was removed from the filtrate by

the addition of 20 grains of strong sulphuric acid diluted with 6000 grains

of water ; a liquid which does not precipitate lime. The lime was deter-

mined, as usual, after separation of some oxide of manganese by acetic acid.

The remaining manganese (the greater part having been precipitated with

the alumina and iron by ammonia) was thrown down by hydrosulphate of

ammonia. The magnesia was then determined by ammonia and phosphate

of soda.

From the identity in crystalline form of this slag with the one succeeding,

we are inclined to regard it as a mixture of silicate of protoxide of iron with

a considerable amount of impurity, represented especially by the alumina.

This view would also appear to receive confirmation from an inspection of

Wethe slag itself.  need scarcely refer to the numerous instances of well-

formed crystals containing much foreign matter, so that there seems to be

nothing improbable in this view respecting the composition of the crystals of

this slag, which are certainly not perfectly formed.

                                                                      13.

   The following beautifully crystallized specimen was presented by Mr.
Dawes. It was found in the flue of a puddling furnace, where it had pro-
bably been exposed to a high temperature for a considerable time.

occasionally an iridescent tarnish. The crystals belong to the prismatic
system. The normals to the faces make the following angles with each

 would contain 1*28 of alumina.

     6. Sulphate of lime 0-23.

     7. Phosphate of magnesia 0"1 9.
    8. Sulphur. This determination was made by Mr. Forbes by fusion with
 nitrate of potass and the carbonate of potass-soda mixture. 20*14 grains
gave of sulphate.of baryta 0"87. The odour of hydrosulphuric acid could
not be 'detected by the action of hydrochloric acid upon the powder of the
slag ; but on suspending for some time a slip of moistened acetate of lead
paper in a test tube containing some of the powder of the slag and hydro-
chloric acid, it became slightly brown. Now, as the slag contains sesqui-
oxide of iron, the hydrosulphuric acid liberated by the action of hydrochloric

acid upon any sulphuret which may be present, would evidently be imme-
diately decomposed, with the separation of free sulphur, by the sesqui-
chloride of iron which would be formed at the same time ; and, accordingly,
free sulphur was always distinctly recognised by its odour in drying the silica
obtained from slags of this group. It may perhaps appear somewhat remark-
able that sulphuret of iron and sesquioxide should exist together in the same
slag ; the fact however is certain. It may be that the sulphuret is irregu-
larly diffused, and is, as it were, entangled in the mass. No trace of sul-
phuric acid could be detected by the addition of baryta water to the solution
of the slag in hydrochloric acid, even after standing 24 hours.

    9. Sesquioxide of iron. About 10 grains were digested in dilute hydro-
chloric acid in a well-stopped flask over the water-bath. The necessary
precaution of previously filling the flask with carbonic acid was carefully
observed. The clear supernatant liquor was decanted rapidly into a stoppered
phial containing excess of the solution of chloride of gold and sodium. The
phial was well-closed and left for several days. The metallic gold weighed
3'93, which by the tables corresponds to 4*16 FeO. The filtrate was deprived
of the excess of gold by digestion with oxalic acid. The iron was precipi-
tated by hydrosulphate of ammonia ; redissolved in hydrochloric acid per-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

oxidized by chloride of potass, and precipitated by ammonia ; the precipitate
was boiled with potass, redissolved in hydrochloric acid, and precipitated by
succinate of soda with the usual precaution. The sesquioxide of iron weighed
5*76, but from this must be deducted 4*16 FeO, estimated as Fe^ 03=4*63

5*76 : 1-13 : : 72*42 : 14*20. But 0*60 of S, as sulphuret, was present, which,

   These crystals closely resemble olivine in their form. The faces of the
crystals are denoted by the same letters as the faces of olivine in Naumann.
t, k, n of Naumann correspond to j9, c, 6,, of Phillips respectively.

   Crystals similar to these in form, composition and mode of occurrence, were
described by Mitscherlich in the Annales de Chimie, t. xxiv. Measurements
of crystals of the same form, and a comparison of their angles with those of
olivine, were given by one of the authors (VV. H. M.) of the report in the
third volume of the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society.

   Estimating the whole of the iron as protoxide, the composition would be

nearly that of Fe^ Si, the formula assigned by Thomson to the mineral from
Ireland, named " Anhydrous silicate of iron." Now, this slag had evi-

dently been in a position favourable to the absorption of oxygen, namely,

the flue of a puddling furnace ; and we shall probably be justified in sup-
posing that, after crystallization as silicate of protoxide of iron, oxygen may
have been absorbed, and that the crystal may consequently be regarded

to a certain extent pseud omorphous. In the case of the following slag,
which is similar to the one in question, it was found by experiment that the
powder of the slag readily absorbed oxygen by calcination in the air. If
this view be admitted, the slag will in constitution as well as form resemble
olivine, the magnesia of the latter being replaced by protoxide of iron.

                              14.

   This slag was found by Mr. Twamley at the Bloomfield iron-works, Tip-
ton, in a heap of calcined puddling furnace slag, technically called " tap
cinder." The proprietors of these works have secured by patent the appli-

cation of calcined tap cinder for the beds of puddling furnaces. It is stated
that, by the process of calcination, which is conducted in large kilns similar

to brick-kilns during a fortnight or three weeks, the slag is rendered much
less fusible, and is therefore well-adapted to the purpose to which it is ap-
plied. The analysis will probably explain this fact. The heat of the kilns
appears, from an examination which one of us has made (J. P.), to be suffi-

cient to soften and agglutinate the pieces of slag together, but not to effect

perfect fusion.

    This slag is a mass of large iron-gray crystals, the faces of which though

even are much too dull to be measured with the reflective goniometer. The

general resemblance of their forms, however, to those of No. 12 is so close

as to leave no doubt of their crystalline identity.

                            H. Analysis. By J. P.

This slag was fouod to contain the same constituents as the one preceding,

and the analysis was conducted in a similar manner.

1. Weight of slag 21 "00 grains.

2. Silica 5*01 grains.

3. Total amount of iron obtained as Fe-O^ 14*4'4.

KOThe oxide of iron in this case after boiling with   twice, was redissolved

in HCl and precipitated by hydrosulphate of ammonia.

4. Oxide of manganese 1'39. The manganese was precipitated as MnO^

by chlorine and ammonia.

   5. Alumina with phosphoric acid 1-87. The Al^O^ was precipitated from
a solution containing much more P^ O^ than required for saturation, for the

greater part of the P- O^ had been dissolved out of the iron precipitate by

KO. This fact was confirmed in another case by dissolving the oxide of

KOiron after treatment by    in HCl and digesting with excess of hydro-

sulphate of ammonia, and testing the filtrate for P- O^. Admitting the
phosphate of alumina, as precipitated by ammonia, to be ^Al^ O^, 3Pо O*
(Rammelsberg, Rapport Annuel, Berzelins, 7^^TM^ annee, p. 127), the calcu-
lated proportion of alumina is 0'91.

6. Sulphate of lime 0*1 36.

7. Phosphate of magnesia 0*1 39.

8. Sulphur. The observations upon this element in the preceding analysis

exactly apply to the present. 26'14' grains of slag were fused with 50 of
nitrate of potass and 100 of the carbonate of potass-soda mixture. Sulphate

of baryta 0*44.

9. Sesquioxide of iron.

   1. By chloride of gold and sodium process. Weighed roughly 10 grains.

           Proceeded precisely as in the former analysis. Metallic gold 3*32.

        Total quantity of iron as Fe^ O^, 5'85.

2. By Fuchs's method with pure copper. The necessary precautions

concerning the exclusion of air during solution, &c. by carbonic

acid, were carefully attended to. The copper was left in the solu-

tion during several days, until the latter had become colourless.

But the slag contains 0-23 per cent, of sulphur, which corresponds

to 1-12 per cent, of Fe^ O^. From the preceding data the following

results are obtained :

  We regard this slag as similar in constitution to the preceding, the alumina,

some of the sesquioxide of iron, and the phosphoric acid being present as
impurity. The presence of so large a quantity of sesquioxide of iron in this
slag is probably to be explained by its long exposure in the kiln, during
which it was in a condition favourable to the absorption of oxygen. The
powder of the slag, when heated to redness in a platinum crucible, changes
colour, acquiring a brown tint, and increases in weight. The quantity of
phosphoric acid is also remarkable, and is well-deserving of the attention of
those engaged in the smelting of iron. Berthier has given the analysis of a
refinery slag from Dudley (Traite des Essais, t. 2. p. 289), containing 7*2
per cent, of phosphoric acid. It is found that when puddling furnace slag
(tap cinder) is worked with the ordinary ores of iron, such as argillaceous
ore and haematite, the iron is liable to be " cold short," or possess that
property which is known to be dependent upon the presence of phosphuret

of iron. Now it is evident that in smelting tap cinder, which will probably

always be found to contain a sensible amount of phosphoric acid, the manu-
facturer will be introducing into the furnace the very element, in a concen-
trated form, which it is one object of the puddling furnace to remove, namely,

phosphorus. An immense quantity of iron slag, far richer than many iron
ores, is annually thrown away, and it may be that the presence of phos-

phorus in sensible quantity is one of the causes which prevents the resmelting

of this slag with advantage. This fact has not yet sufficiently attracted the

attention of those engaged in the manufacture of iron. The discovery of a
method of extracting economically good iron from these rich slags would be
of great advantage to the country, and could not fail amply to reward its

author.

                                     15.

The history of this slag is doubtful ; though it is probable that it was

produced in a puddling furnace.  It  has  not  yet been  analysed                                  yet  we in-
                                                                                                ;

troduce the results of its crystallographic examination in order to illustrate a

new process of admeasurement of crj^stals of this kind, by W. H. M.

One side of this piece of slag is bounded by a plane smooth surface, on

which are traced the outlines of a number of crystals packed close together,

separated by a lighter-coloured slag. Some of the outlines of crystals are

rectangles, others rhombs, having their obtuse angles cut off by parallel lines.

            ON THE CRYSTALLINE SLAGS.

An attempt was made to measure approximately the

acute angle of the rhomb in the following manner :

By means of a stout branch with an universal joint like

that of Wollaston's goniometer, the slag was attached

to a common six-inch circular protractor graduated to

half degrees, with its plane surface upwards, and parallel
to the plane of the protractor. The protractor was
placed upon a table, having traced upon it a fine straight

Aline longer than the diameter of the protractor. com-

pound microscope, having a spider line in the focus of
the eye-piece, was firmly fixed with its axis perpendi-

cular to the table, and at such a distance from it as to

command distinct vision of the plane surface of the
slag. By moving the protractor with the slag attached to it till the images
of the sides of the rhomb formed in the microscope successively coincided

with the spider line, and reading off the degrees and minutes at which the

protractor met the line traced on the table, the angle is obtained through

which the protractor has been turned between the two observations ; or, the

Aangle of the rhomb. The values of the angle C B thus observed were,

77░-0, 79░ 45', 81░ 30', 80░, 78░ 15', 79░ 15', 77░ 45', 78░ 20', 82░ 6', 80░ 50',

77░ 30', 80░, 80░ 15'. Such a method of observation is obviously insuffi-

cient for the identification of a crystalline species yet renders it probable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

that these crystals are the same as No. 13, a section of which, by a plane

perpendicular to kk', would produce a rhomb of 81░ 36'.

noticed that crests 7 and 1 1 were small waves ; abstracting them, we have this
succession of large waves thus, Nos. 1 , 3, 5, 9. When crest No. 1 traversed
England on the 1st, its anterior trough extended beyond St. Petersburgh;

when crest No. 3 traversed England on the 10th, its anterior trough also ex-

tended beyond St. Petersburgh ; when crest No. 5 passed the Orkneys on the
15th, its anterior trough passed St. Petersburgh ; and when crest No. 9 passes
Christiania (this day), its anterior trough passes St. Petersburgh. These facts

clearly show the gradual contraction of the waves or oppositely directed beds

of parallel currents.

                              General Conclusion.

It will be readily apparent from the collation of Mr. Brown's with the St.

Petersburgh observations, that the results arrived at in the preceding discus-

sion have been fully confirmed, and there appears to be but little doubt that

the waves as determined in the first instance by a discussion of observations

from the stations announced in my first report (Report, 1844', page 267), and

further identified and illustrated by the observations collected by Mr. Brown,

as well as those which have been brought to light by means of Mr. Brown's

observations, and confirmed and illustrated by the St. Petersburgh observa-

tions, had a real existence ; an individuality has been attributed to certain
arrangements of aerial currents and distribution of pressure in connexion

with such currents, the aggregate phaenomena forming an atmospheric wave.

Of the waves thus brought to light, two occupy very prominent positions ;

they stand out as it were from the others ; the individuality of each is very
sti'iking, and the velocities with which they traversed the area isolate them

from their pi-edecessors and exhibit them not as gregarious, but solitary waves.

These waves are B░ and crest No. 4, the first occurring just previous to the
setting-in of the great wave, and the last forming its crown. The wave, crest

No. 4, appears from its elevated position on the symmetrical or normal wave,
admirably adapted to crown our investigations with success, especially in so
far as its amplitude, velocity and path are concerned, we are now, I appre-
hend, in possession of materials to determine with a considerable approxima-

tion to accuracy, these elements. Its longitudinal direction appears to have

been very extensive. This element would receive considerable elucidation

by means of observations from the south of France, Spain, Portugal and the

north of Africa. It is highly probable that this wave in the direction of its

length stretched from the extreme south to the very north of Europe.

       MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

On the Principle of Continuity in reference to certain Results of Analysis.
                        By Professor Young, Belfast.

The principal object of this paper is to examine into the influence of the law of
continuity, as it affects the extreme or limiting values of varying functions, and to
exhibit some remarkable verifications of the mathematical axiom that " what is true

up to the hmit is true at the limit."

   Much error and confusion exists in the writings of analysts, more especially in those
of Cauchy and Poisson, in consequence of the imperfect views generally entertained

in reference to the principle of continuity, whenever extreme or ultimate values of a
variable come under consideration. In certain infinite series where the condition

of continuity avowedly prevails, it is the common practice to neglect this principle in
the limiting cases, and to treat such cases as if they were entirely isolated and un-

connected with the general forms to which they really belong ; whilst in other classes

of series, those namely that have been called periodic, as also in definite integrals
involving periodic quantities, it is a practice equally common to introduce the condi-

tion of continuity where in fact it has no legitimate existence. Many false conclusions

have thus obtained currency in analytical writings, and it is the aim of the paper, of
which this is a very brief abstract, to inquire into the sources of these errors, and to

supply the requisite corrections.

   As respects series, for instance, it is shown that the limiting cases of

+--\-- -\-^  = =ad inf., corresponding to a; 1 and x -1.

are very different from what Cauchy and other writers affirm them to be. Cauchy

says, that when these limits are reached, the series will be divergent in the first case,
and convergent in the second : but it is proved in the paper adverted to, that " if x

ascend from an inferior numerical value (that is from a fractional value either positive
^ --or negative), up to a; 1 or .e =:
                                       1, the limiting cases will both be convergent,

like all the preceding cases; but if the same limits be reached through descending

values of the variable, the extreme cases will then, on the contrary, be divergent."

In like manner the limit of the series

       +1 +a; 2a:*4-2. 3a;3+ 2. 3. 4x*+ &c. ad inf.

when X arrives at zero, and which is said by Cauchy to be equal to 1, is proved to be

in reality equal to a quantity infinitely great.

The errors of Cauchy arise from his neglecting the influence of continuity in these

limiting cases : the errors of Poisson, in his researches into the theory of periodic
series and definite integrals in the ' Journal de I'Ecole Polytechnique,' and in his
'Theorie de la Chaleur,' are of a directly opposite character: they arise from his

arbitrarily introducing continuity where no such principle exists. Poisson admits

that periodic series and periodic integrals are in themselves indeterminate ; but
he considers himself at liberty to overrule this indeterminateness, by introducing

into the series the ascending powers of a quantity infinitely little different from unity,

--and by introducing into the integral the arbitrary multiplier e at. By means of this

unwarrantable artifice the periodicity is in both cases destroyed : the series is ren-

1846.                                                                        B

tiered convergent instead of periodic, and the integral is rendered determinate instead

of indeterminate.

   To avoid the recurrence of these errors, it is proposed to divide infinite series and
definite integrals into two classes, those which are dependent upon some condition of
continuity, and those which are altogether independent, or neutral. Hutton restricted

-- + --the term neutral sevles to the form 1 1 1 l+> &c., because of its being neither

convergent nor divergent. It is here proposed to extend the signification of this

term, so as to have no especial reference to convergency or divergency : a strictly

neutral series may be either convergent, divergent, or periodic.
   Some controversy has arisen of late respecting Poisson's theory of definite integrals,

and certain forms have been condemned as erroneous which are really correct. Thus

the integrals

                          J --^a^andyo/oo sin ax/oo cos ax
                              a                       ^ _^ ^. dx

have been recently affirmed to be indeterminate, which they are not. The second of

these however has been investigated by Legendre, Gregory and others, by methods

Aaltogether objectionable, as is fully shown in the present paper.  correct process

for obtaining the proper determinate result, has been given by Sir W. R. Hamilton

in his paper on Fluctuating Functions, in the nineteenth volume of the Transactions

of the Royal Irish Academy. The ordinary investigations of the first of the pre-

ceding forms are correct, although objected to in a paper in the recently published

part of the Cambridge Transactions, yet the conclusions obtained by Euler, Fourier,

Poisson, and indeed by analysts generally, in reference to this integral, are affected

--with error : the values of the integral are always stated to be -> 0.  -- , according

as the constant a is positive, zero, or negative.
   It is easily shown however, by a reference to the law of continuity, that the

middle one of these values, viz. 0, has no existence; for if* become zero by vanish-

--ing poiiiiw/y, the value of the integral is still ; and if it become zero by vanishing

negatively, the value is  .

    Among the collateral topics discussed in the present paper, notice is taken of the

 method proposed by Deflers, and so often quoted by Poisson, for verifying the well-
 known integral theorem of Fourier ; this method has been properly objected to by Mr.
 De Morgan, as involving an inadmissible principle : by a little modification, sug-
 gested by the theory unfolded in this paper, the defect is removed, and Deflers' short
 and ingenious proof of Fourier's remarkable theorem rendered conclusive.

    The paper terminates with some observations on what is called discontimdtij, a term
 which it is thought is often injudiciously and imnecessarily employed in analysis.
 It is suggested that expressions called discontinuous may generally be contemplated

 with advantage, as consisting of distinct continuities embraced in a single form. An

/-m--instance of this is shown in the consideration of definite integrals of the form
                 , which are treated bv Poisson, in the eighteenth cahier of the Journal of
                x^
 the Polytechnic School, but whose conclusions are, by this mode of viewing the
 integral, shown to be erroneous. The entire paper will probably be published in the

 Cambridge Transactions.

     Letter, on the Deviation of Falling Bodies from the Perpendicular, to
                 Sir John Herschel, Bart., from Prof. Oersted.

   Tlie first experiments of merit upon this subject were made last century, I think in
1793, by Professor Guglielmini. He found in a great church an opportunity to
make bodies fall from a height of 231 feet. As the earth rotates from west to east,
each point in or upon her describes an arc proportional to its distance from the
axis, and therefoi-e the falling body has from the beginning of the fall a greater ten-
dency towards east than the point of the surface which is perpendicularly below it;
thus it must strike a point lying somewhat easterly from the perpendicular. Still, the
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  3

difference is so small, that great heights are necessary for giving only a deviation of

some tenth-parts of an inch. The experiments of Guglielmini gave indeed such a
deviation; but at the same time they gave a deviation to the south, which was not in
accordance with the mathematical calculations. De la Place objected to these expe-
riments, that the author had not immediately verified his perpendicular, but only some
months afterwards. In the beginning of this century. Dr. Benzenberg undertook new
experiments at Hamburg from a height of about 240 feet. The book in which he de-
scribes his experiments, contains in an appendix researches and illustrations upon the
subject from Gauss and Olbers, to which several abstracts of older researches are added.
The paper of Gauss is ill-printed, and therefore difficult to read ; but the result is,
that the experiments of Benzenberg should give a deviation of 3'95 French lines.
The mean of his experiments gave 3-99 ; but they gave a still greater deviation to
the south. Though the experiments here quoted seem to be satisfactory in point of
the eastern deviation, I cannot consider them to be so in truth; for it is but right to
state that these experiments have considerable discrepancies among themselves, and
that their mean therefore cannot be of great value. In some other experiments made
afterwards in a deep pit, Dr. Benzenberg obtained only the easterly deviation ; but
they seem not to deserve more confidence. Greater faith is to be placed in the ex-
periments tried by Professor Reich in a pit of 340 feet at Freiberg. Here the easterly
deviation was also found in good agreement with the calculated result ; but a con-
siderable southern deviation was observed. I am not sure that I remember the num-
bers obtained ; but I must state that they were means of experiments which differed
much among themselves, though not in the same degree as those of Dr. Benzenberg.
Professor Reich has published his researches, an abstract of which is to be found inPog-
gendorff's ' Annalen der Physik.' After all this there can be no doubt that our know-

ledge upon this subject is imperfect, and that new experiments are to be desired ; but
these are so expensive, that it is not probable that they would be performed with all

means necessary to their perfection without the concurrence of the British Associa-
tion. I will here state the reasons which seem to recommend such an undertaking.
1. The art of measurement has made great progress in these later times, and is here
exercised in great perfection. 2. All kinds of workmanship can be obtained here in

the highest perfection. I think it would not be impossible to have an air-tight cylinder

of some hundred feet high made for the purpose. This would indeed be expensive,
but it would present the advantage that the experiments could be made in the vacuum
and in different gases. 3. With these experiments others could be connected upon

the celerity of the fall and the resistance opposed to it by the air and by gases. Pro-

fessor Wheatstone's method for measuring the time would here be of great use.

4. If the southern deviation should be confirmed, experiments could be undertaken in

order to discover in how far this could be effected by magnetism in motion. For this

purpose balls of different metals might be tried. Very moveable magnetical needles,

well-sheltered, but placed sufficiently near to the path of the falling bodies, would

indicate magnetical effects induced in them.

       On certain Cases of Elliptic Polarization of Light by Reflexion.
                   By the Rev. Professor Powell, V.P.B.A.

   From the principle investigated by Fresnel, that polarized light changes its plane in
reflexion, by a certain law dependent on the incidence, for transparent media, and the
extension of a similar law to the reflexion from the second surface by Sir D. Brewster

(Phil. Trans. 1830), other formulae were obtained by the last-named philosopher to
express the varied phaenomena observed by himself (Phil. Trans. 1841), in the re-
flexion of polarized light from thin films, in extension of those previously investigated
by Mr. Airy and M. Arago. The whole subject was reduced to the principles of the
undulatory theory by Dr. Lloyd (Brit. Assoc. 1841, Sect. Proc. p. 26), who pointed
out the further theoretical result, that owing to the difference of phase or retardation,
thus produced in the two portions into which the reflected light is divided, polarized
light reflected by a thin plate will in general become elliptically polarized *.

   * This deduction, though stated in the report given in the Athenaeum, is omitted in the
volume of the Association,

                                                                     b2
--4 REPORT 1846.

   It is certain however that in a great number of cases of thin plates examined by
the author of tliis communication no ellipticity can be detected. Glass superficially
decomposed and giving brilliant tints produces no ellipticity, except in those instances
where it has a decided metallic lustre. Vapour condensed on soaped glass (in the
manner described by Sir D. Brewster), oils of turpentine, cassia, &c. between glass
plates (the upper being slightly prismatic to separate the reflexions), are equally de-
void of any indication of ellipticity.

   The theory therefore clearly needs some further modification to express the condi-
tions under which the effect may be sensible.

   There are doubtless many cases of thin plates in which elliptic polarization is pro-
duced (as in the films formed by Nobili's process and by heat, as investigated by the
author of this communication, or again, as in mica which has become laminated, &c.),
but in these cases the modus operandi is well understood ; the former arising from the
enormous refractive power, in the latter from the crystalline structure.

    In the instance of China ink observed by the author, the ellipticity appears equally,
whether it be in the form of a film or in a solid mass ; but it is only seen in the
purest specimens.

    In the numerous other cases examined by Mr. Dale it does not appear that any-
thing like films can be supposed; the only condition seems to be the high refractive
power.

   It may still be a question, then, whether the theory proposed independently by M.
Cauchy and by Mr. Tovey be not more easily applicable ; since it requires nothing

but the very simple and admissible hypothesis, that the molecules of cether, for a minute
depth within the surface, are unsymmetrically distributed*.

     In various substances containing but a very small proportion of metal, ellipticity
has been detected, in addition to those enumerated by the author on a former occa-

sion. Among these are prussian blue, and a specimen of the meteorite from the Cape
of Good Hope, 1839, which contains only about 33 percent, of protoxide of iron, very

small portions of oxides of nickel and chrome, and a minute trace of metallic ironf.

    On the Bandsformed by partial Interception of the Prismatic Spectrum.
                   By the Rev. Professor Powell, V.P.B.A.

     In the discussion! relative to these bands one or two points suggested themselves
 which appear to need further remark.

    The principal objection was, that according to the theoretical formula, a contrac-
 tion of the aperture of the eye or telescope should produce an enlargement of the in-
 tervals between the bands, which is not confirmed by experiment.

    The author finds that with a contraction down to the twentieth of an inch, though
 there is no sensible enlargement of the intervals, yet the bands become greatly more
 vivid and distinct, while they extend only over a smaller portion of the spectrum at a
 timeз.

    With the same plate, the enlargement of the intervals appears to depend solely on
 the increase in the angular extent of the spectrum subtended at the eye, whether pro-
 duced by a greater distance from the origin, a greater prismatic angle, higher di-
 spersion, or greater power in the telescope.

    The formula involves the ratio of the semi-aperture to the distance of an assumed
 point on the retina from the geometrical image of the point of light ; and this " dif-
 fusion" being no arbitrary supposition, but a direct portion of the theory, it seems un-
 reasonable to pronounce it " untenable" and " quite inadmissible," when the question
 at issue is, whether the theory as a whole will apply to the phaenomena.

     Apart from all theory, when under certain conditions bands are formed equally
 whether the plates be applied at one end of the spectrum or at the other, " polarity"
 seems an improper term by which to describe the efl!ect.

    On attempts to explain the apparent prq/ection of a Star on the Moon.
                   By the Rev. Professor Powell, V.P.B.A.

   Some remarks having been brought forward at the last meeting* relative to the sin-
gular phaenoraenon above named, in which "diffraction" was referred to as at least
in a general sense likely to afford an explanation, the author of this communication
conceived that some observations he has made might have a bearing on the question.

   "Diffraction" has often been appealed to in cases apparently of the same class,
but in the more strict and limited sense of the term it cannot apply, since both the
conditions and the resulting phaenomena appear essentially different.

   The phaenomena properly ascribed to " diffraction " exhibit/rin^e*, and suppose the
edge of the intercepting body to be within the area of the rays.

   But there are some effects of a concomitant kind which have been less attended to.
One of the most remarkable of these is that described by Newton (Opt. bk. iii. pt. 1.
obs. 5, 6, 7), in which the light admitted through a hole a quarter of an inch in dia-
meter, falling on the edge of an opake body, besides the phEenomena since called
"diffraction," gave rise to long streaks or "trains" of light darting into the shadow
perpendicular to the edge and shown on a screen ; or, when the eye was substituted,
producing a luminous line running along the edge, between it and the iirst fringe.

   The author has repeated this experiment in a different manner, and though in the
original experiment the edge is within the area of the rays, yet a part of the same phse-
nomenon (viz. the line of light along the edge) is seen, even when the edge is beyond
the rays, by the naked eye, or with a telescope.

   When the origin of light is reduced to a mere point (as by using the sun's rays re-

flected from a very small globule of mercury) and the rays are wholly intercepted by
a small circular opake disc at the distance of about 2 inches, so that both the luminous
point and the disc may be seen at once in focus by a small telescope about 12 feet dis-
tant, the bright line is reduced to a luminous patch on the edge of the disc at the part
nearest the luminous point which appeared to extend to a small distance inwards, and
then the rays converging crossed and diverged again faintly. This might possibly be
regarded as affording some experimental imitation of the case of the star : the origin
is not an absolute point ; but if it were, the patch of light on the disc might appear
like a projection of its image.

    Another explanation has been proposed of the phaenomenon of projection, on the
principle that owing to aberration, the star being seen out of its true place, a screen
placed in its true direction, as the moon, would exhibit the star projected on its disc
(Royal Astron. Soc. Reports, vol. vi. p. 246) ; and taking into account the proper mo-
tions of the stars, this would explain the appearance of the phaenomenon in one instance
and not in another, on the supposition that those proper motions are in opposite direc-
tions in the two instances. But this will not apply in the very instance to which re-
ference has been made, of the two stars 119 and 1 20 Tauri, which have proper motions
both in the same direction; also, the principle of this explanation is rendered ques-
tionable altogether from what has been lately suggested by Prof. Challis on the theory

of aberration.

    The whole subject is perhaps not yet ripe for explanation, since the first astro-
nomers are so much at variance as to the facts, the appearance having been frequently
seen by one observer and not by another; while it is believed by some to occur or
not, according as the attention is directed to the moon or to the star; which, if true,
would seem to point to some ocular cause. Hence a further accumulation of in-
stances is much wanted, any statements of which the author of this paper would be
thankful to receive addressed to him at Oxford.

                  On Elliptic Polarization. By Mr. Dale.

   The paper which I have to read to the Section relates to some new observed facts
in the subject of elliptic polarization, which appear to point out the physical element
on which depends the different action of metals on light, as compared with transparent
substances in general. They have already been communicated to the Ashmolean
Society at Oxford, but I have been induced to bring them forward at present, with a

view of more readily gaining for them the notice of those interested in optics. This
peculiar action, it will be remembered, is of this kind : first, that the metals (and
metallic sulphiu-ets, &c.) have no angle of complete polarization for common light
and secondly, that a plane polarized ray becomes elliptically polarized after reflexion
from their surfaces, whereas it remains plane polarized after reflexion from glass and
such like bodies. Endeavours have naturally been made to account for these phaeno-
mena on the principles of the undulatory theory ; and always, apparently, on the suppo-
sition that the laws of reflexion from transparent (uncrystallized) bodies were already
rigorously given by Fresnel's formula, but that a new and distinct theory was required
for metallic reflexion : thus assuming that the two classes of phsenomena were ab-
ruptly separated, without any intermediate links of connexion. It has, indeed, long
been known that several transparent or translucent substances have no angle of com-
plete polarization. Thus Biot (Traite de Physique, iv. 288) has excepted sulphur
and the diamond; and Sir John Herschel (Optics, Art. 845 ; see also 831) excludes
from the general rule, besides the metals, those substances which have the adamantine
lustre; which term is applied, in Mohs's system of crystallography, to several of the
minerals to be presently spoken of, as resembling the metals in another respect. I
do not know that any writer, except Mr. Green (in Camb. Phil. Trans, vol. vi.), has
stated this exemption to be general for all substances having a high refractive index
but it is important to recall this experimental fact to our attention, on account of its
coincidence and harmony with the new result which I have now to state. It consists

--in this : that these same highly refractive substances resemble the metals also in a

second respect that they confer elliptic polarization on a plane polarized ray reflected
from them. The following list of substances, in which this property was observed,
will be found to contain most of those at the top of Sir D. Brewster's list of refractive

indices :

       --Indigo which is remarkable for possessing the metallic lustre without con-

                       taining any metal.

       --Artificial realgar.

             Diamond of which three specimens were tried.

       --Sulphuret of zinc in transparent crystals.

               Glass of antimony translucent.

       --Sulphur melted on a polished slip of zinc foil.
       --Tungstate of lime transparent.

               Carbonate of lead in crystals, clear and limpid as glass.
              Hyacinth, or zincon--translucent.

                Arsenious acid.

            {Garnet.

                  Idocrase.

                 Helvine.

                Labrador hornblend.
Of which the last five possess the property in a very slight degree only. The test
used in every case was the dislocation of the rings of a plate of calc spar ; of which a
very good specimen was used, capable of exhibiting eight or nine red rings : and all
the experiments were made by candle-light, which is indispensable. It will secure
greater confidence in these results to say, that all the specimens which 1 submitted to
Prof Powell's examination, in a difierent instrument, were found by him to produce

the above effect ; and from his published observations several more cases may be

--quoted in confirmation of the general result : such are chromate of lead, litharge,

plumbago, and Indian ink. The natural conclusion from these facts appears to be,
that in a perfect mathematical theory of reflexion, both cases should be embraced in
one set of formulae, of which some terms or coefficients should be insensibly small,
except when the refractive index was very large ; that, strictly speaking, no substances
complete!!/ polarize common light at any angle, but that the residue of unaltered light
is too feeble to affect the eye, when the refractive index is below a certain limit
and that plane polarized light always becomes elliptically polarized, but that the vir-
tual difference of paths of the two "compact vibrations parallel and perpendicular to
plane reflexions is insensibly small, except the refractive index surpass a certain value
 greater than the refractive indices of felspar and sapphire, which I found to produce
no dislocation of the rings. It is remarkable, that such formulae have some time

since been deduced from a very profound mathematical investigation by Mr. Green,

--in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, vol. vii. whose results, however, do

not seem to have met with much attention. Now, however, that they have met with

the above undesigned general confirmation, it seems very desirable that they shoidd
be compared with the numerical results of experiments of Sir D. Brewster and Prof.
Powell. Mr. Green adopts, as part of the basis of his calculation, the original view

--of Fresnel, that the vibrations of a polarized ray are perpendicular to the plane of

polarization ; but as this point is a matter of dispute amongst mathematicians, I have

thought of an experimental method by which thi? point might, as I think, be decided,

independently of all theory. It consists in the observation of the shifting of the fringes

produced by two pencils of light polarized in the same plane on interposing in their

paths a piece of compressed glass. This last apparatus is to be constructed in the
--Afollowing manner :
                       strip of clear plate, 4 or 5 inches long by half an inch broad,

is to be provided ; and its narrowest faces (or narrowest long sides of the parallelo-

piped) are to be carefully polished, and rendered perfectly plane and parallel to each

--other, at least, in the middle part of their length, through which the light is to pass.

And the glass must be so well annealed and so free from strice as to allow of the for-

mation of fringes by interfering pencils which have traversed it. It is to be provided

╖with a wooden frame and screw, capable of compressing it in the middle. [A similar

apparatus has already been employed by Brewster, Ling, and Pouillet, to show that

Weglass under pressure possesses double refraction.]  may now proceed to the ex-

periment itself. Let us suppose, then, that the arrangements have been made in a

darkened room for producing the interference of two pencils of light, which are to be
polarized in the same plane, by passing, for example, through the same tourmaline
plate. This arrangement might, in fact, be that of Fresnel, in which a slender beam

is reflected from two glass plates very slightly inclined, provided that the light were

incident at the polarizing angle of glass. And, for the sake of clearness, let us suppose

the two foci, or virtual foci, to be vertically one above the other, the plane of polari-

zation to be vertical, and the glass to be interposed with its length horizontal. Then,
in its natural state, it will produce no displacement of the fringes, if made carefully

after the above description. But let us consider what will be its effect if interposed in

its bent state. The elasticities on its convex and concave sides are different in this

respect, that the particles are dilated or compressed ^ara/Ze^ io the length of the glass;

whereas little or no alteration of elasticity is produced in a plane perpendicular to the

length of the glass. Hence if the vibrations of the two polarized pencils are really

executed perpendicularly to the plane of polarization, or parallel to the length of the

glass (according to the arrangement above agreed upon), they will be propagated

with different velocities, and the fringes will be displaced parallel to the length of the

glass, in a direction which might be inferred from some statements of Sir D. Brewster,

but which is quite unimportant to the present purpose. If, however, on the other

hand, the vibrations be executed in the plane of polarization, or perpendicular to the

length of the glass, the two rays will traverse the glass with almost, or quite the same

velocities, and the fringes will either not be displaced at all, or to a far less amount

than in the preceding case.

Notice of a Neio Property of Light exhibited in the Action of Chrysammate

  of Potash upon Common and Polarized Light. By Sir David Brewster,

   K.H., F.R.S.

   The Chrysammate of Potash, which crystallizes in very small, flat rhombic plates,
has the metallic lustre of gold, whence it derives its name of golden sand. When the

sun's light is transmitted through the rhombic plates it has a reddish yellow colour,

and is wholly polarized in one plane. When the crystals are pressed with the blade

of a knife on a piece of glass, they can be spread out like an amalgam. The light,
transmitted through the thinnest films thus producer!, consists of two oppositely polar-

--ized pencils, the one of a bright carmine red and the other of a pale yellow colour.

With thicker films, the two pencils approach to two equally bright carmine red pencils.
It is to the reflected light, however, and its new properties, that I wish to direct the

attention of the Section. Common light, reflected at a perpendicular incidence from

the surfaces of the crystals, or of the films, has the colour of virgin gold. It grows

less and less yellow as the incidence increases, till it becomes of a pale bluish white
--8 REPORT 1846.

--colour at very great incidences. The compound pencil, thus reflected and coloured,

consists of two oppositely polarized pencils, one polarized in the plane of reflexion,

and of a pale bluish white colour at all incidences ; and the other polarized perpendi-

cular to the plane of reflexion, and of a golden yellow colour at small incidences, passing

successively into a deeper yellow, greenish yellow, green, greenish blue, blue, and

light pink, as the angle of incidence increases. This very remarkable property, which

I have discovered also in some other crystals, is not caused by any film of oxide formed

upon the natural surface of the crystal, nor is it the result of an)' change produced

upon the surface bj' external causes. It is exhibited, under the usual modifications,

if the surface of the chrysammate is in optical contact with fluids, and, by pressure, with

--glass : and when the crystal is in the act of being dissolved, or when a fresh surface is

exposed by mechanical means, the superficial action of the crystal upon light is in both

cases the same. When the chrysammate is re-crystallized from an aqueous solution, it

appears in tufts of prisms of a bright red colour, the golden reflexion being overpowered

by the transmitted light ; but when these tufts are spread into a film by pressure, the

golden yellow colour reappears. When the crystals of chrysammate are heated with

a spirit lamp, or above a gas burner, they explode with a flame and smoke like gun-

powder                                      and, by  continuing the  heat,  the residue  melts and  a  crop  of colourless  amor-
                                         ;

phous crystals is left. I have found the same explosive property in the Aloetinate of

rotash.

Description of a Portable Equatorial Stand for Telescopes withovt Polar

                      Axis. By Richard Greene, M.D.

    All previous attempts to produce equatorial motion have (the author believes) been
based upon the notion that the telescope should revolve upon a material axis, which
of course must be adjusted parallel to the axis of the earth. The principle also is
bad, inasmuch as the telescope is supported near the centre, and the moving power is

applied to that point, instead of the extremity of the tube.
    In following any of the heavenly bodies either to the east or west of the meridian

with the common stands mounted with altitude and azimuth movements, the observer
is obliged to keep them both continually in action to prevent the object getting out of
the field of the telescope. As the effect of these two powers acting at right angles to
each other is to cause the tube to move in the diagonal between them, it occurred to
the author that it would be more simple and equally efiicacious to employ only one
moving power in the direction of that diagonal, and thus obtain (he same motion by
one screw, which before was obtained by the two screws worked together. He also
remarked that when the object is passing the meridian, for a certain time it will re-
main in the field of view by moving the azimuth screw alone.

   The essential principle of the invention is simply to be able to place the horizontal
or azimuth screw in all situations of the heavenly bodies in a position similar to that
in which it is placed when an object is passing the meridian, viz. parallel to a tangent
of the circle the body is describing and touching the circle at the point where the body
then is. The common azimuth screw fully answers the purpose when the body is on
the meridian, as the tangent is then horizontal. When the body observed is to the
east of the meridian, as it is then rising higher every instant, and at the same time
moving westward, all that is required is to point the adjustible screw, which the author
calls the equatorial screw, upwards from the observer to such an angle as appears to
be parallel to the path the body is describing, which, from its altitude and distance
from the meridian, can be pretty nearly guessed by an astronomer. If he has ele-
vated the screw to the proper angle, the body will remain very nearly in the centre
of the field of view during the time he is following it through the length of the screw.

If, however, it appears to sink in field, it shows that the screw is not sufiiciently ele-
vated, and that it rises faster than the axis of the telescope, and he must raise the
remote end of the screw a little more : if tlie star rises in the field, of course it shows

that the screw is too much elevated. By two or three trials the angle may be found

in less than a minute. If the body viewed be to the west of the meridian, the remote
end of the equatorial screw is of course to be depressed, pointing downwards from the

observer.

   The principle of this equatorial movement is easily applied to many of the stands
now in general use, as well as to the Herschel stand, on which the author first tried it.

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  9

   Having no stands of his own, except the Herschel stand, (and this certainly defec-
tive in stabiHty, in consequence of the great mirror being unsupported except by the
tube, upon which it acts through a long and powerful lever of agitation,) Dr. Greene
turned his attention to the construction of some simple stand based upon the principle
of stability which the triangle affords, and presented a model of his first attempt to

attain that object.

   In this arrangement the heel of the telescope hangs by two pivots upon two Ys
fixed to the upper surface of a flat circular disc, which revolves upon another similar
disc, by means of a pin in the centre ; the lower disc stands upon three very low feet to
ensure its stability. The upper or eye-end of the telescope is attached by a pin to an
equatorial slide. The pin is united to a slide which moves parallel to the tube of the
telescope at its under side, and being moved by a rack and pinion, gives the slow
elevation movement. The equatorial slide is supported by a pair of shears, capable
of being lengthened or shortened at pleasure, to effect the quick motion in altitude.
The legs of the shears rest upon the two extremities of a sliding piece moving by rack
and pinion in the groove of a piece of mahogany or other hard wood in the shape of
the letter T, supported by three very low feet to ensure its steadiness. The sliding
piece is moved by a long handle attached to the pinion, and gives the slow azimuth
motion to the entire stand. To unite the different parts into one system, the piece
which supports the shears, and the lower circular disc which supports the heel of the
telescope, are attached by two bars with hooks at each extremity, the bars being
themselves bound together by two diagonal braces.

    It will be seen at a glance, that the telescope and its stand form one great triangle,
while each of its parts is a minor triangle ; that the great mirror is solidly supported,
having no tendency to disturb any part of the fabric by its disposition to be moved by
any slight external force.

     On an easy Method of contracting the Aperture of a Large Telescope.

                 By Henry Lawson, F.R.S., F.R.A.S., ^c.

   It is well known to the practical astronomer, that in using a telescope of large
diameter it is needful to contract the aperture of the object-glass when measuring
binary stars, &c., and also when the haziness of the atmosphere demands such con-
traction. The mode adopted is the adaptation of a brass tube, 6 to 12 inches long, to
the eye-end of the telescope tube, in such a manner that it may slide out and in with
facility. Into one end of this tube the eye-pieces of the telescope must screw (or
what is better, slide). Within this tube is to be placed a moveable diaphragm, made
to slide up and down the tube by means of a slit and stud. The diaphragm is to be
pierced with an aperture of such size as just to let the whole cone of rays proceeding
from the object-glass pass through it towards the eye-glasses, when the diaphragm is

drawn down or stands near to the eye-piece. When the aperture of the object-glass is

required to be contracted, the diaphragm must be slid towards the object-glass, and it
will have the effect of circumscribing the cone of rays to any required diameter. The
benefits resulting from the above-described plan are the following : that the astro-
nomer can with the greatest facility and without moving from the eye-end of his tele-
scope, adjust or contract the aperture of the object-glass to any required diameter
he can vary the magnifying power without shifting or deranging the aperture ; and,
lastly, he can produce these benefits without fear of altering the adjustments, or
turning the telescope from the object in view.

                     On the Arrangement of a Solar Eye-piece.

                 By Henry Lawson, F.R.S., F.R.A.S., ^c.

   This arrangement does away with the inconvenient and dangerous breaking of the
dark glass when viewing the sun through telescopes of large size, and enables the
astronomer to view the sun with the whole aperture of his telescope, however large it
may be ; thus giving an immense advantage when scrutinizing the wonderful and
most interesting appearances of the solar disc. The method consists in placing the
dark-glass or glasses within the telescope, by means of a brass tube supported between
the object-glass and the eye-glass of the telescope, the tube being from 3 to 18 inches

(according to the length of the telescope), measured from the eye-piece, to which
10 EBPOBT--1846,

it is to be attached. By this means the cone of rays proceeding from the object-glass

towards the eye-glass is intercepted by the dark glass at a considerable distance from
its focus, or most heating point, and thus the heating power of the rays, being spread
over a large surface of the dark glasses, passes througli without injuriously heating
them, and enters the eye in a cool and agreeable temperature. Another benefit de-

rived by this arrangement is, that the cell holding the dark glass may be made to con-
tain several glasses ; and those may be of different colours ; whereby an opportunity
is afforded of repeating the valuable experiments of Sir John Herschel on transmitted

light through different coloured media; and also attempering or adjusting the inten-
sity of the light entering the eye to the sensibility of the retina. Another benefit is
obtained, that of using various magnifying powers with the same dark glass arrange-
ment with the greatest facility.

On the Meteorological Observations at Kew, loith an Account of the Photo-
      graphic Self-registering Apparatus. By F. Ronalds, F.R.S.

   Mr. Ronalds, on presenting his third annual volume of observations and experi-

ments made at the Kew Observatory, described his experiments on the photographic

self-registration of the electrometer, the barometer, the thermometer and the declina-

tion magnetometer; explained his existing apparatus for these purposes, and exhibited

the resulting photographs, but first briefly adverted to his previous proposals in 1840

and 1841, and experiments in 1844, relative to the subject. The principal charac-

teristic of his improved system is a peculiar adaptation of the lucernal microscope.

An instrument of this kind was employed in July 1845 to register the variations of

Volta's atmospheric electrometer. The pair of straws were properly insulated and

suspended within the body of the microscope and towards its object-end. A con-
Adensing lens was placed at the end itself, and a good lamp stood beyond it. strong

light was therefore projected upon those sides of the straws which were turned towards

the condensing lens, and the other sides were in deep shade. The light also impinged

upon a little screen fitted into the back of a case about two feet long, fixed to the eye-

end of the microscope at right angles with it, and vertically. Through this screen

was cut a narrow curved slit whose chord was horizontal and radius equal to the length

of the straws. Between the electrometer and the screen a combination of achromatic

lenses by Ross was adjusted to produce a good chemical focus of the electrometer, at

a distance as much beyond the external surface of the screen as the thickness of one

of the plates of glass to be presently mentioned. In the long vertical case was sus-

pended a frame about half the length of the case, provided with a rabbet, into which

two pieces of plate glass could be dropped, and these brought into close contact by

means of six little bolts and nuts. The frame could be removed at pleasure from the

line by which it was suspended, and the line, after passing through a small hole stopped

with grease at the top of the long case, was attached to a pulley about four inches in

diameter on the hour arbor of a clock. Lastly, counterpoises, rollers and springs

Awere used for ensuring accurate sliding of the frame, &c.  piece of Mr. Collen's

photographic paper was now placed between the two plates of glass in the moveable

frame ; the long case was closed so as to prevent the possibility of daylight entering it,

the clock was started, and the time of starting was noted. All that part of the paper

which was made to pass over the slit in the screen by the motion of the clock, became

now therefore successively exposed to a strong light, and was consequently brought

into a state which fitted it to receive a dark colour on being again washed with the

usual solution, excepting those small portions upon which dark images of the lower

parts of the straws were projected through the slit. These parts of course retained

the light colour and formed the long curved lines or bands, whose distances from each

other, at any given part of the photograph, i. e. at any given time, indicated the

electro-tension at that time. Sometimes daylight was used instead of the light from

a lamp, and in that case, during the process, some appearances of the sky were occa-

sionally noted, by which it was evident that in serene weather, when the sun's light

and heat varied, and the paper became consequently either more or less darkened,

the electric tension, as shown in the photograph, varied also, increasing with the in-

crease of light, &c. This fact has not perhaps been before observed, but as the dark-

ening effect on the paper could not be always depended upon, separate notes were

taken of the intensities of light and the same results obtained. At the suggestion of
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  IJ.

the Astronomer Royal, a distinguishing electrometer, formed on the dry pile system,
was afterwards employed, which exhibited in the photograph, not only the tension,
but the kind of electricity possessed by the electrometer at any given time. The dry
thermometer was next tried. It was of the horizontal kind, had a flat bore, and its
tube was introduced through the side of the microscope. The tube had a diaphragm

of very narrow aperture fixed upon it, and the slit in the screen, at the eye-end of the
microscope, was now of course straight and horizontal. The image was a little mag-
nified, and the breadth of the dark band or line in the photograph became the mea-
sure of temperature inversely at any given time*. -The barometer employed was of
the siphon kind. The microscope was turned in order to bring the long case and its
sliding frame into a horizontal position. The clock was placed at one end, and a
little weight, sufiRcient to keep the frame steady, was suspended by a line passing over
a pulley at the other. The lower leg of the barometer was introduced through the
now bottom of the microscope ; it was provided with a similar kind of diaphragm to

Athat on the thermometer, and of course the slit in the screen was now vertical.

light blackened pith-ball rested on the surface of the mercury, and its image was
slightly magnified, but will in future be much more so. The declination magnet was
one of two feet, lent to Mr. Ronalds by the Astronomer Royal. It was provided with
a damper, and its mode of suspension was essentially similar to that of the Greenwich

declinometer. In order to adapt it for self-registration, a light conical brass tube,
projecting six inches beyond its north end, was affixed to the lower side of the spur
which carried it, and to the north end of that tube a small wire, called the index, was

attached at right angles. This index descended through little slits in the bottoms of
the two cases which enclosed the magnetic, and took the place of the electrometer

in the lucernal microscope, which was placed below the cases, and was now required
to be much longer than before, in order that the image and motion might be suffi-
ciently magnified, yet a flat field retained. Everything was firmly fixed upon the two

Apillars which formerly carried the transit instrument of His Majesty George III.

great many photographs were obtained and sent for inspection to Greenwich. Con-
cerning some term-day impressions, Mr. Glaisher, the Magnetical and Meteorological
Superintendent of the Greenwich Observatory, says, in an official note, that " the

beautiful agreement of the results with these at Greenwich is highly satisfactory."

     On some Meteorological Phcenomena. By Professor Wartmann.

   Although many attempts have been made of late to extend our knowledge of the
electrical phaenomena of the atmosphere, it must be confessed that much remains to
be done. The frequency of the flashes of lightning, according to the latitude to the
seasons, is a subject of inquiry which has been recommended by M. Arago. It
would also be interesting to record the duration of thunder-storms, the number of
flashes of each of the three classes which have appeared, the height and general
appearance of the clouds, and the hygrometric state of the atmosphere.

    I shall take the liberty to point out some facts which I had occasion to witness on
the evening of the 1st of August last. After many hot days, clouds appeared on
the south-west part of the horizon of Lausanne, and when over the town they began
to become illuminated almost without intei-ruption. I counted more than forty flashes
in twenty-two minutes, two-fifths of which were of the first class, and all going
eastward.

  A flash, of such a white brilliancy that the eye could not bear it, but the appear-

ance of which was perfectly definite, did not disappear suddenly, but left a florescent
trace of a dark red colour, like to the illusions of the dissolving views and the trainees
or trails of certain shooting stars which I observed on the night of the 10th of
August 1838.

   Another flash of the first class appeared at the under part of the clouds, and after
a rather long course, it vanished at the very edge of it : no thunder was heard.

Two flashes were bicuspidated ; three others were tricuspidated at some distance from

their origin, two of which appeared together, one over the other, in the same hori-

zontal position. Are those flashes as scarce as it is generally believed ? Are they pro-
duced by a particular state of humidity which makes the state of the air better

conductors in many given directions simultaneously than in others ? This I am not

able to decide ; but I think that the quantity of rain which happens to fall during a
thunder-storm has a great influence upon the falling of the electric fluid. Indeed, in

a recent instance, a thunderbolt fell in a low part of a vintage near Lausanne,
burning all the stems on an area of more than eighty feet square, during a shower of
the most tremendous character, and without being attracted by more elevated con-

ductors which were at a short distance; and, on the contrary, two years ago, during

a storm which was accompanied by no rain, the thunder fell on a neighbouring situa-
tion, and burned by ricochets, stems here and there, upon a surface of more than

four acres,  ^^____

                   On a New Anemometer. By Dr. Banks.

   The instrument is worked by a vane supported on a hollow wooden shaft about
two inches diameter and three feet long, whose upper end is supported by slight
friction rollers, and the bottom rests on a steel point.

   Each of two levers holds a pencil, one for the direction of the wind, working
in a spiral of three turns, which by a very simple contrivance returns to its position
if the wind moves round the compass with frequency. The other lever is acted upon
by the force-board attached to the vane, and which, in its retirement from an in-
creasing wind, raises a series of weights together with a disc, upon which, by a roller,
the lever rests. The instrument is about 2\ feet long by 2 feet high, exclusive of the
vane, which is attached to a tin tube of length according to circumstances.

         Meteorological Observations. By Capt. W. W. Childers.

--Table A. Meteorological Observations, Saint Helier, Jersey, deduced from Hourly

   Observations taken by William Walbanke Childers, late Captain in the 42nd Royal
   Highlanders, assisted by Mr. John B. Le Roy, Optician ; from the Mean of four

   barometers and three thermometers. The extremes noted by a perpendicular Self-

   Registering Thermometer eighty-five feet above the mean level of the sea. Soil
   gravelly clay. Latitude 49░ 11' N., Longitude 2░ 06' W.

   From the above comparative table, it appears that Jersey, although within a comparative
short distance of London, enjoys a far more equable temiperature, neither undergoing so great
a degree of heat nor exposed to so extreme cold. This in a great measure arises from its
position, and the great rise and fall of the tide, upwards of forty feet between the levels at
high and low water, spring tides and the nature of its soil; a rich loomy clay with gravelly
subsoil. In June and July, for instance, the temperature in London reached 93░, in Jersey only
8 1░ ; whereas in December the thermometer in London fell to 1 1░, in Jersey no lower than 25░.
Jersey is a very moist climate, S.W. winds having prevailed" 107 days during the year, and

the quantity of rain fallen being nearly double that at Chiswick.

It is probable, also, that the temperature of the steam in the manometer was, from
exposure to the air, less than that of the steam in the boiler, so that the small ther-
mometer may be expected to give the temperature too high rather than too low.

An Account of an Atmospheric Recorder. By G. Dollond, F.R.S.

    It having appeared to be desirable at the last meeting of the British Association
that a correct self-registering apparatus should be constructed, by which the various
changes of the atmosphere should be recorded upon paper, in such manner that they
might be referred to at a future period, I have the pleasure to describe an apparatus
which records the indications of the following eight instruments, viz. the barometer,
the thermometer, the hygrometer, the electrometer, the pluviometer, the evaporator,
the force-boai-d, and the anemometer, in relation to time. I have found it answer the
purpose for which it was intended, in every way satisfactorily. 1st. The barometer
registers the change which takes place in the weight of the atmosphere at every half-

hour, and the line may be traced from one point to the next without any difficulty.
2nd. The thermometer registers the various changes from cold in the night or morn-
ing, to the greatest heat in the afternoon, continuously. 3rd. The hygrometer is
adjusted to show the changes from dryness to extreme saturation of moisture to every
hundredth of the scale, and is extremely steady in action. 4th. The electrometer is
acted upon by a conductor, and registers each flash of lightning which comes within
the range of the conductor. 5th. The pluviometer registers the drops of rain which

fall upon the surface of the receiver, and shows the continuation of the falling quan-
tity until an inch is received ; this is then discharged and the process recommences
for another inch, and so on continually. 6th. The evaporator is so constructed as to
retain a quantity of water with the surface exposed, and so guarded that rain cannot

enter into the vessel. The surface gradually evaporates, as shown by a diagonal line
upon the paper until an inch is evaporated, when a discharge takes place and another
line commences. 7th. The force or power of the wind acts upon a board one foot
square, whose movement is registered in pounds and ounces avoirdupois, from one
ounce to thirty pounds. 8th. The direction of the wind is shown in circles, which
immediately upon inspection show the direction of the course or change which has
taken place, for instance, if it has passed through the south or the north, from east to

west, and the point from which it started and that to which it returned. All these
eight varieties have their scales about half an inch from the marking-points, and can

be very easily read or referred to. There are markers on each edge of the paper for

time, the paper being carried forward by a clock.
   Mr. Dollond gave an account of the storm, as shown by this instrument, at Cam-

berwell on the 1st day of August 1846, during his absence :

The barometer changed from          30-03 inches to 29-82 inches.

The thermometer  from               69░ to 98░

during the day, or twenty-four hours.

   The hygrometer ranged from 39░ to 80░ of moisture.

At two o'clock the electrometer was affected by the lightning, and registered fifteen

discharges or flashes in one hour.

   At 3" 23' the rain commenced falling, and in two minutes the pluviometer dis-
charged an inch, which had previously stood at 11*90 for several days. At 4" 3'
another inch was registered, and at b^ 25' a third inch was marked upon the regis-

tering paper ; and so tremendous was the fall of rain and hail, that at b^ 35' a fourth
inch was marked upon the paper, making on the whole 3-12 inches in 2^ 17'.

The force of, the wind was equal to one pound four ounces, and the direction

changed from east to west, through the south at 3'' 20'.

On the Construction of a Self-registering Barometer, Thermometer, and
                     Psychrometer. By C. Brooke, M.B.

Mr. Brooke remarked that he had been induced by the want of efficient means of

automatic registration of the variation of meteorological instruments, and especially

of magnetometers, which was so generally expressed at the last meeting of the British

1846.                                                            C

Association at Cambridge, to bestow some attention to the subject, and was enabled

to report to the meeting that he had succeeded in devising a method of continuous
registration with as much accuracy as the purposes of science require.

Various mechanical means have been proposed for the registration of all meteoro-

logical instruments except the magnetometers ; but the amount of magnetic force is
so small, that the variations of its intensity and direction are incapable of actuating

any mechanism, and therefore can only be expected to be recorded by the aid of

photography ; and by these means the proposed object had been accomplished : as
however a detailed description of the apparatus by which magnetic variations have

been registered is already in the hands of the Royal Society, Mr. Brooke did not con-

sider himself authorized to enter into a description of it, further than is necessary to

explain those modifications of the apparatus which formed the subject of the present

communication. A piece of prepared photographic paper is placed between two con-

centric cylindrical glass surfaces, which are carried round their common axis, placed

horizontally, by the hour-hand of a time-piece movement. The paper consequently

passes vertically behind a horizontal slit in a case of suitable form in which the

cylinders are enclosed to protect the prepared paper from the influence of diffused

Alight.  cylindrical refractor, the axes of whose surfaces are parallel to the slit, is

placed in front of tlie slit, and at such a distance from it that the rays of light falling

on it may be refracted to a focus on the paper. In the case of the magnet, a sphe-

rical concave reflector is attached to a stem by which the magnet is suspended, and a

camphine lamp having a vertical narrow slit in the chimney is placed at such a dis-
tance from it that an image of the slit may be formed at the distance of the paper;

a portion of the image is condensed vertically by the cylindrical refractor, and im-
presses the photographic paper. Some registers obtained by this apparatus wei'e

exhibited to the Section, from which the position of the declination magnet might be

determined by a scale with a probable error not exceeding 10", and in some, not ex-

ceeding 5".

In obtaining the register of the barometer, a lamp is placed in front of the appa-

ratus, and a screen with a narrow vertical slit attached to the end of the long vertical

arm of a lever is interposed between the refractor and the horizontal slit before de-

scribed. This lever is balanced, and a short horizontal arm rests on a float supported

by the mercm-y in the shorter tube of a siphon barometer; the lengths of the arms of

the lever having been taken as 10 to 1, the variation of the height of the column will

be magnified 5 times, and the light passing through the point at which the two slits

cross, will trace out a line sufficiently distinct to indicate the height of the barometer

at any period to the -s^g-th of an inch.
   The registration of the thermometer and psychrometer was obtained by interposing

the stem of these instruments with a flat bore, wide enough to exclude the light, be-

tween the slit and the refractor ; as however this expedient is not new, it need not be
more particularly described ; the only novelty in Mr. Brooke's apparatus was in

placing the stems of the two instruments on opposite sides of the cylinder, so as to

obtain a register of both on the same paper, and in making the bulbs long narrow

cylinders instead of spheres, in order to increase the surface and consequently the sus-
ceptibility of changes of temperature. By having each degree about ith of an inch

long, the temperatures may be obtained at any time to J^yth or ^'oth of a degree.

Table of the Fall of Rain in the Lake Districts of Cumberland and West-
                 moreland, Sfc. in the Year 1845. Si/ J. F. Miller.

   The writer exhibited a series of registers in a tabular form, from which it resulted
that at Seathwaite there have been 31 days in which the fall was between I and 2
inches, five days between 3 and 4 inches, one day between 4 and 5 inches, and one
day between 6 and 7 inches.

   On the 27th of November, 1 845, there was measured at Seathwaite 6*G2 inches,

and on the 26th and 27th nearly 10 inches, being the greatest quantity of rain which
has ever been measured in tlie same period in Great Bi'itain. At Langdale Head in
Westmoreland, the fall on the 27th was 6'28 inches, and on the 26th and 27th nearly
9 inches.

The consequence was the heaviest flood which had occurred at these places for at

least sixty years past.

   Windermere Lake had not been so high for the last fifteen years ; on the night be-

tween the 26th and 27th it rose 2 feet in perpendicular height ; the quays along the
banks of the lake were immersed in water, and much wood was carried away by the
current and lost. Keswick Lake had not been so high since November 30th, 1838.

   Of the total quantity of rain, measured in the vale of Borrowdale in 1845, 106-58
inches fell in the months of .January, March, August, October, November and De-

cember ; and nearly 46 inches in the two latter months.
   Such was the violence of the storm on the night of the 28th of December in the

lake districts, that a number of fish were found next day on the margin of Bassen-

--thwaite Lake, which had been thrown up by the waves in the course of the night by the

force of the wind, a circumstance wholly without a parallel, except on the night of the

memorable 6th of January, 1839. The rain which fell in the preceding twenty-four

hours amounted to 4-22 inches ; at Whitehaven the quantity was -323, or nearly one-

third of an inch.

   Through the kindness of various gentlemen I am enabled to add returns of the ram

in 1845, from several places throughout Great Britain, by way of comparison with the

quantities measured in the lake districts.

The fall at Seathwaite is more than 3 times the quantity measured at Whitehaven,

one of the wettest towns in the kingdom.    It  exceeds  the  fall  at  Leeds  by  6  times                        at
                                                                                                                ;

Culloden by 5i times; atDoncaster and Highfield House, Nottinghamshire, by 5 times;

at Cirencester and Arbroath by 5^ times; and at Makerstoun near Kelso, the seat of

Sir Thomas Brisbane, Bart., by more than 7 times.
   Seathwaite exceeds Doncaster, in January, by 15 times ; in November by 21 times ;

and in December by 9^ times. It exceeds the quantity at York, in January, by 16

inches, or 20 times ; in March by 9 times ; and in November by 20 times. It ex-
ceeded Dublin, in March, by 14 times; in April by 13 times; in October by 5 times;

and in November by 7 times.
   The quantity measured at Seathwaite and Langdale Head, in the month of De-

cember (24-02), is more than falls at some places in Great Britain during a year.
   Mr. Miller said, " It is much to be regretted that the meteorology of our lake and

mountain districts should have been so long neglected. Prior to the establishment

of these gauges, there were none stationed in the lake district of Cumberland, and, so

far as I am aware, only two among the lakes 'of Westmoreland, viz. one at Esthwaite

                                                                          c2

Lodge, and the other at Grasmere ; and the largest quantities measured in any year

were 86 inches, and 90 inches respectively. And so startling did these results appear
to meteorologists, when first made known, that many were led either to doubt their

authenticity, or to suspect the accuracy of the instruments employed.
    " But subsequent investigation shows that these values are exhibited in some por-

tions of the lake district of Cumberland only in the very driest years. Thus, in the

period from July 1844 to June 1845 (which for drought has only found a parallel in

the memorable 1826), the fall at Gatesgarth and Wastdale Head amounted to 83'96

and 88'42 respectively, and at Grasmere in Westmoreland to 74 inches nearly. But we

suspect that meteorologists will hardly be prepared for the discovery, that we have

localities in our own country, which, even in average years, exceed the amount of rain

annually deposited in many tropical climates ; yet such is the almost incredible fact.
At Grenada, lat. 12░ 5', the average fall is 1 26 inches ; at St. Domingo, lat. 1 8░ 20', it is

120 inches; and at Calcutta, in lat. 22░ 35', it is 81 inches. In the past year the

quantity measured in the vale of Borrowdale exceeds the largest of these amounts by

25*87 inches. An inspection of a map of the country in connection with the table

will show, that the wettest portions of the lake district are those situated at the head

or eastern extremity of those valleys formed by our highest mountain ridges, amongst

which are the Great Gabel, Sea Fell, Glaramara, Red Pike and Honister ; the first

being apparently the grand central point of attraction and condensation for the warm

vapour arriving  in a south-westerly current  across the Atlantic                                                                                     and it is a remark-
                                                                                                                                                   ;

able coincidence that nearly all our lakes bear in the direction of Gabel, so that if ex-

tended onward in a direct line, they would all converge at the base of this noble

mountain.
   " Immense as is the deposit of rain at Gatesgarth, Grasmere, Wastdale, and in other

portions of the lake district, even these enormous quantities sink into comparative in-
significance when compared with the fall at Seathwaite, a small hamlet at the head of
the vale of Borrowdale, which exceeds the wettest of the other localities by 27-74 inches,

or by one-fourth nearly. Now it is chiefly the deposit in the vale of Borrowdale which

supplies the majestic river Derwent and the extensive and picturesque lakes of Der-
went and Bassenthwaite, so that we might a priori have expected to find the greatest

amount of rain in this section of the district.
   " The great difference in the fall between places closely contiguous to each other is

very remarkable : the proportion which obtains between Ennerdale lake, and a farm-

house about \\ mile distant, is as 2 to 1 nearly.
   " Loweswater, Buttermere and Gatesgarth are all in the same line of valley, sur-

rounded by the same ridges of mountains, and are each distant about 2 miles from the
other. Buttermere exceeds Loweswater by 18 inches or one-fourth; but Gatesgarth,
at the head of the valley, exceeds Buttermere by36'65 inches, or nearly one-half. Here
the difference between the head and foot of the valley, in a distance of 4 or 5 miles, is

54"5S8 inches.
   " But the great increase in the fall towards the head of the valleys is appreciable at

much more limited distances. At Wastdale Head I have two gauges of precisely the
same size and shape, and within a quarter of a mile of each other, yet the difference
of the receipts in a single month sometimes amounts to half an inch.

   " The annexed statement will show that the excess is always in favour of the higher

gauge marked No, 1.

" The current of vapour is apparently only partially decomposed in passing over a

flat or even an undulating country ; it aims at once for the loftiest heights, passing

over the less hilly districts with little diminution of its original weight or volume. But

on reaching the mountain peaks, the sudden change of temperature causes a rapid and

continuous condensation in the form of vast torrents of rain, whilst comparatively

little descends on the adjacent plains.

   " As an instance of the low temperature on our mountain tops, I may mention that

on making the ascent of Skiddaw, on the 5th of September last year, the thermometer

on the summit, at noon, stood at 41░ ; sky overcast, the sun gleaming out at intervals.

The temperature of a strong spring, about 2 miles from the summit, was also 41░.
The temperature of the air at the foot of the mountain, at 3^ 30TM p.m., was 58░.

remember seeing a patch on the 15th of June, 1843 ; and on the neighbouring moun-

tains the air was so intensely cold that we think it could not be more than 2''or30above

the point of congelation. That the rapid increment in the fall of rain in approaching

mountainous districts is owing to the causes above alluded to, and not to the greater

number of wet days, is evident on an inspection of the table, where it will be found
that we have as many wet days at Whitehaven near the level of the sea; indeed it
rarely rains in the lake districts, that the day is not also wet, more or less, at the coast.

   " And in comparing the number of wet days at various places, we not unfrequently

find them to obtain in the inverse ratio to the fall of rain ; thus, in 1845, they range
from 195 to211 in the lake district; but at Manchester, with a fall of 41 inches, they

amount to 235 ; at CuUoden, with a fall of 27 inches, to 237 ; but at Kendal, where

the quantity of rain is 53 inches, the wet days are only 178.
   " At Carlisle the wet days are the same as in the lake district, where the fall is four

times as much.

  " We are informed by a gentleman recently returned from India, who was many

years medical attendant to the Rajah of Sattarah, that he seldom measured more

than 40 inches of rain in the plain, but among the hills 30 miles distant, the annual
quantity reached 350 inches ; and as much as 9 inches has been known to fall in 24

hours.

   " The utility and beauty of this arrangement is obvious, since the mountain torrents

afford a continuous supply of water to the lakes and rivers, which otherwise could

scarcely have an existence. The rivers thus called into being aid the efforts of the

husbandman by carrying off the superfluous moisture from the plains, which, without

such a provision, would be in danger of stagnating into pestilence."

--22 REPORT 1846.

The number of gauges in the lake districts, in addition to the above, is twelve,

most of which are read off daily.
   It would appear from the average results since April last, that the amount of rain

increases from the valley upwards, to an altitude of about 2000 feet, and gradually

decreases above that elevation ; thus the gauge at Sparkling Tarn (1900 feet) almost
invariably receives more than any other of the gauges ; much however depends upon

the position of the mountain with respect to the prevailing wind ; thus the gauge on

Seatollar (nearly the same elevation as Sparkling, but bearing nearly due north) in-

variably receives less rain than the valley at the end of a  month                                nevertheless,  mea-
                                                                                               ;

surements made at short intervals, when a north or north-west wind had prevailed,

show that it sometimes receives considerably more.

Fall of Rain on the Coast of Travancore and Table Land of Uttree, from Ob-

Byservations of M. General Cullen, Resident in Travancore.                                        Lt.-Colonel

Sykes, F.'R.S.

   At former meetings of the British Association I have had the means of submitting
to the Physical Section facts illustrative of the meteorology of portions of Western
India, particularly at great elevations, such as at Mahabulesliwur, near Sattarah,
at the height of 4500 feet above the sea, and at a distance of about 30 or 40 miles
inland. It was shown that the fall of rain in one monsoon was of the prodigious
amount of 302"21 inches, or more than 25 feet depth of water. At a similar height
at Merkara in Coorg, about 5░ of latitude S. of Mahabulesliwur, and in about the
same longitude, and at 65 miles from Cananore on the coast, the mean fall of rain

for the years 1838, 1839 and 1840, was 143*35 inches. Communications from my
friend General Cullen, the British minister at the Travancore court, enable me to ex-

tend the meteorological observations, at least as far as relates to temperature and the
fall of rain, to Cape Comorin, supplying also data for a comparison of the fall of rain

on the coast and at short distances inland, at a considerable elevation. I may state
that we are indebted for the present communication from India to the stimulus oc-
casioned by the publication of the Mahabuleshwur and Merkara observations in the
volumes of the Association. General Cullen's letter to me is dated Cochin, the 27th of
July 1845, and he states that he had been in the habit for many years past of observing

the meteorology of his location, wherever that might be, but that the pressure of his
public duties had disabled him from reducing and arranging the observations, parti-

cularly the barometrical. He had, however, been enabled to transmit to the govern-
ment of Madras, statements of the fall of rain along the western or Malabar coast of

Hindoostan, from Cape Comorin in Travancore, lat. 8░ 4', to the town of Cochin and to
Panlghatcherry, in lat. 10░ 45', as well as at several inland stations in the provinces of
Cochin and Travancore ; and in the Company's district of Tinnevelly, on the east side
of the Ghats, for the years 1841, 1842 and 1843. These statements were accompanied

with explanations which I shall shortly notice. In the year 1841 the stations selected
in Travancore were 5 ; but the observations did not commence at Nagercoil, Trevan-

drum and Quilon, before the month of May ; and at Allepy and Cochin in the month
of June. The stations on the east side of the Ghats were 3 ; at Vaurioor the obser-
vations commenced in June, at Shenkotah in July, and at Palamcottah not before
October. As the observations are not for equal periods, I shall confine myself to ob-

serving that both the Malabar and Coromandel coasts appear to have been subjected to
both monsoons, the S.W. and N.E.rain having fallen at all the stations in the months
of October, November and December, as well as in the usual S.W. monsoon months of
June to September inclusive. In the year 1 842 the stations in Travancore and Cochin

were extended to 8, and the observations were for the whole year, with the exception of
Tritchoor and Chittoor, where they did not commence until May, and at Koravantava-
lum, where they did not commence until August. At the three former stations in Tin-
nevelly the observations were for the whole year. In this year, although both mon-

soons appear to have operated upon both coasts in the months of August, September,
October and November, yet in the month of December rain only fell on two days on the
Travancore coast, and only five times at Palamcottah on the opposite coast. The same
discrepancies exist with respect to the months of January, February and March, rain

having only fallen on thirty-eight days at all the eleven stations together, on both coasts,
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  23

during those tlu-ee months. In the year 1843 Cape Comorin is added to the eight stations
in Travancore, and the observations at all the stations are for the whole year. At Cape
Comorin, at an elevation of fifty feet above the sea, we have the singular fact of not a
single shower having fallen in the months of February, March, April, August and No-
vember, months belonging to both monsoons ; and the fall for the whole year at Cape
Comorin was only 19-2 inches. At Palamcottah, on the Coromandel side, there was
not a single fall of rain in the months of June, July, August and September, and only
1 and 3 and 1 and 4 falls respectively in the months of February and March, at all
the stations in Tinnevelly. The total fall at each station exhibits a rapid increase in
quantity, in increasing the latitude, as is shown by the annexed tabular statement.

land E. from Quilon, and in the gorge of the great gap in the Gh^ts at Palghat, which
opens to the Coromandel coast of Tinuevelly, and on the high road it might be said
of the aqueous vapour of both monsoons, had only 68 inches, while Allepy, on the
open coast, had 131 inches, and Cochin 124 inches. The fall is greatest on the sea
coast, diminishes at stations inland to the foot of the Ghats, but, as I shall have oc-
casion to show, increases enormously on ascending the Ghats to their plateaus or table-

lands.
    General Cullen says it is difficult to attempt explanation of the diffei-ences in the

amount of rain exhibited in his tables ; but he offers some remarks on the winds and
physical structure of the country as necessarily influencing the distribution of rain.
The peninsula of India, as is known, is in a triangular form, the apex of which is Cape
Comorin. Tlie western Ghats in maps appear to run continuously without break from
Cape Comorin to the 24 or 25░ of latitude N. ; but sucli is not the case. The land
 within the apex of the triangle to Palghat, a distance of 150 miles, rises precipitously
 into a table land 2000 or 3000 feet high, with peaks and masses attaining an elevation
 of 5000 or 6000 feet. It has at its sides a narrow low tract of land on both coasts. In
 the latitude of Palghat, this table land suddenly terminates in a chasm or gap forty
 miles long by thirty miles broad, without a single hill or ridge. There are other gaps,
hut of less marked character ; in one of these stands Shenkotah. It might be supposed
the continual passage of aqueous vapour through these gaps would continually drench
them ; but such is not the case, as the vapour passes thi-ough only partially condensed
for Chittoor, which is at the western gorge of the Palghat gap, has only 68 inches of
rain and Shenkotah only 48 inches ; both however have rain in every month of the
year, excepting February at Chittoor, and in the month of November, at both places,
there was only one fall of rain. The paucity of rain at Palamcottah, General Cullen
attributes to the intercepting of the vapour of the western monsoon by the table lands
of Travancore. But this does not explain the paucity of rain at Cape Comorin and
Vaurioor, which are open to both monsoons ; and why should they not be deluged at
least by the S.W. monsoon as well as Allepy or Cochin?

    General Cullen made the observations which I have adverted to without a view to
the illustration of any particular meteorological phases or phtenomena ; but observing
the publication in the annual volume of the Association of the extraordinary fall of
rain at high elevations, as at Mahabuleshwur and Merkara, he was induced to ascer-
tain whether a similar fact obtained on the high lands of Travancore. He therefore,
on the 23rd of June 1844, established a pluviometer at a spot called Uttree Mullay.
thirty miles E.N.E. of Trevandrum, at an elevation of 4600 feet above the sea
(about that of Mahabuleshwur), and continued his observations simultaneously with
others at Trevandrum and Quilon on the coast until the end of December. The fall
of rain on the table land was 164 inches, while the fall at Trevandrum and Quilon
respectively was only 36 and 36^ inches. The variation of the monthly mean tem-
perature at Uttree Mullay was only from 64░ to 67░ Fahr., and at Trevandrum from
77i░ to 78i░ Fahr,

have been much greater ; but as it is, it is sufficiently remarkable*. Above 100 inches
of the rain which fell at Uttree MuUay occurred in the months when the S.W. mon-
soon is considered to have ceased on the western or Malabar coast, and may there-

fore be said to belong to the N.E. monsoon of the Coromandel coast. There appear
to have been two occasions when the fall of rain was remarkable in twenty-four

hours. On the 1 0th of October there fell 9 inches, and on the 2Gth of November

there fell 7*35 inches; but there also fell from the 6tli to the 10th of October inclu-

sive, 29"4 inches, averaging nearly 6 inches daily, or more than falls in most of the
counties in England in a twelvemonth. I am glad to communicate the assurance of

General Cullen, that not only will he continue these interesting observations throughout

the year, but that he has also established two pluviometers in the central table land of

Travancore, which is about thirty miles across to the Coromandel side ; one at Perre-

gaar at 2300 feet, and another on the eastern or Coromandel edge at an elevation of

3600 feet. General Cullen considers the area of this table land to be about 2000

Hesquare miles, much of it at an elevation of 4000 feet.  states that it is lost to

civihzation, from the Travancore government drawing only cardamoms from it, and
rigorously prohibiting culture to protect their cardamom monopoly. The main fea-

tures of these observations correspond with those of Mahabuleshwur and Merkara, and

testify to one of those benevolent provisions of nature which the inquirer always

meets with, of the continuous impingement of aqueous vapour upon mountain masses,

occasioning very great condensation, and furnishing the perennial sources of springs and

rivers. The apparent discrepancy of the comparatively small fall of rain at Chittoor,

situated in the midst of the great gap of Palghat, confirms this view ; for though the va-

pour is constantly driving through the gap, it does not meet with any impediment to
force it up into a much lower temperature than its own, and it is therefore only partially
condensed. The paucity of rain however at Cape Comorin and Vaurioor, both open

more or less to both monsoonSj does not admit of a ready solution. If, as General Cullen
asserts, the S.W. moonsoon beats rather from the N.W. and westerly points than from

the S.W., it eannot be said that Ceylon intercepts the vapoxu* from Cape Comorin

and then, whj- is there a fall of 131 inches and 124 inches respectively at Allepy and

Cochin on the open coast, and only 19 inches at Cape Comorin ? With respect to the
N.E. monsoon, some of its vapour may be cut off from Cape Comorin by shoulders

or peaks from the table land of Travancore, and yet the whole mass of the table land

does not prevent Trevandrum and Quilon from receiving a portion of the N.E. mon-

Asoon, as is shown in the preceding table.  closer attention to local physical circum-

stances is evidently necessary before a rational account can be given of these discre-

pancies ;  but General Cullen is too zealous an  observer not to work out the question
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

and I look to being enabled, at a future meeting of the Association, of laying before

this Section a continuation of General Cullen's observations and a satisfactory solu-

tion of the existing difficulties.

     On a New Portable Azimuth Compass. By E. J. Dent, F.R.A.S.

   Mr. Dent exhibited this instrument. The magnetic needle was suspended in an
inoer case, and that again fitted in an outer case in such a manner as to admit of
having either its ends reversed so as to eliminate errors of centring ; or its faces re-

versed so as to eliminate the error of coUimation.

On the Relations of the Semi-Diurnal Movements of the Barometer to Land

   Mr. Hopkins exhibited diagrams, drawn up from Col. Sabine's paper ' On the Me-

teorology of Bombay,' of the diurnal temperature curve, total pressure curve, and ga-
seous pressure curve; with a diagram representing the swelling and sinking of the
land and sea-breezes ; and endeavoured to show that these were inconsistent with the
explanation given by Col. Sabine, but harmonized with alternations of pressure caused
by the alternate extrication of heat and absorption of it during the alternate evapora-
tions and depositions of water, in the state of clouds and dew.

   * Since this paper was read it has been ascertained that the fall of rain for the whole year
was 290 inches.

tro-magnetic rotation takes place all round each, which is in the sense of the hypo-

thetic currents of Ampere. Prof. Grove has just pointed out to me that such an action

had been stated by Dr. Christie, though, as far as I know, it had been referred to
by no treatise on electro-magnetism, and that he himself had witnessed the phseno-
menon many times. The other fact seems to be of a higher interest, since it declares,
as it were, to the eye, what may be called the lines of chemical affinities. I shall now
content myself by merely describing what I have been able to witness and to show to
many scientific men, reserving for a future occasion to complete this communication

and to dwell upon the theoretical part of the subject. Common sulphate of copper is to

be dissolved in water, and a cylinder of soft iron dipped into it ; as soon as the first
deposit of copper has taken place, it is easy to perceive all round the cyUnder light
films of a blue matter which are extending themselves as diverging rays from the very
centre of the cylinder which may be thought to represent the centre of the chemical ac-
tion. I suppose this substance to be a subsulphate of copper, and Prof. H. Rose is of
the same opinion ; but fi-om want of time and scarcity of matter, I have not yet been
able to submit it to analysis. During the progress of its manifestation, the nature of the
liquid is always varying, sulphate of iron taking the place of a corresponding quantity

of sulphate of copper. When this change has reached a certain extent, the phasnome-

non ceases to spread. It is then like to a large passion-flower, with slender stamina
terminated by a continuous circular and opake ridge of thick antherse. Its figure,
which is altogether independent of the nature and the form of the vessel, is very geome-
trical. After half an hour, more or less, this extraordinary design fades by the deposition

of the matter at the bottom of the trough. When two cylinders are used in the same

plate, two of the rays meet each other perpendicularly on the line of shortest distance of
the centres. Others join in direction more and more oblique, and being totally deprived
of the faculty of entering their relative dominions, they incurve themselves in hyperbolic
arches. Thus a perfectly straight line is formed which cuts into two halves the line
of shortest interval. It is scarcely necessai-y to add that the rays which are not to
meet others, extend as in the first case described. With three centres situated at the
summits of an equilateral triangle, the lines of separation intersect each other in a
point which is at equal distance from the summits, and thence run perpendicular to the
three sides of the triangle. The diverging rays, opposite in two directions, are much
inflected. The whole of the figure is perfectly regular. These rays are not affected
in their development by the magnetization of the cylinders ; at least, if one observa-
tion made on this point suffices for deciding the question. If there are but two cylin-
ders, and if they are lifted up in the liquid by means of an appropriate horse-shoe
magnet, it is possible to move them very slowly without any disturbance of the figure,
and particularly without the least incurvature of the line of separation, which follow
the cylinders backwards and forwards, as if lirmly tied together. But a shock loosens
all those particles geometrically adherent ; they fall down, and all the design vanishes.

  Summary of ResearcJies in Electro-Physiology. By Prof. Matteucci.

    In the first place he described the experiments which prove that the development of
electricity in living animals is a phsenomenon appertaining to all organic tissues, and
principally to muscular fibres, and that it is a necessary consequence of the chemical

processes of nutrition. He particularly wished to prove that the development of elec-

tricity in the muscles can never produce electric currents which circulate either in the
muscular mass or in the nerves. It is only by a particular arrangement of the expe-
riment that we succeed in obtaining a muscular current.

    Further, all experiments contradict the opinion of an electrical current existing in
the nerves. M. Matteucci proved that the current said to be proper to the frog is
on the contrary a general phsenomenon which exists in all the muscles that have ten-
dinous extremities unequally distributed, and that this current, supposed to be peculiar
to the frog, is only a particular instance of muscular current. In the second place,

the Professor laid before the Section his last researches on electrical fishes. He showed

that the laws of the electrical shock of these animals are a necessary consequence of
the development of electricity, which is produced in each cell of the electrical organ
under the influence of the nervous power. In the third place, he showed the relation
which exists between the electrical current and nervous power, and proved that mus-
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS,  29

cular contraction is always produced by a phsenomenon analogous to the electrical

spark, and that the electrical current does but modify the nervous excitability. On
these facts M. Matteucci establislies a simple theory of electro-physiological phseno-

mena. In the last part of his communication he treated of inducted contraction and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

after having demonstrated that these phaenomena cannot be explained in supposing
an electrical discharge of any kind indiscriminately, he concluded that inducted con-
traction is an elementary phenomenon of the nervous power, which acts in muscular
contraction, and is analogous to all the actions of induction of physical forces.

          On the Identity of certain Vital and Electro-magnetic Laws.
                           By Joseph Bullar, M.D.

   The object of this paper was to show that the direction and formation of blood-
vessels and the capillary circulation through them, which is independent of the pro-
pulsive power of the heart, are in accordance with laws of the vital force, identical in
their direction and relation to each other with those of the electro-magnetic force.

In such an investigation the forms of bodies were considered of the highest import-
ance. Growth is invisible, but the forms it produces are the evidence of the unseen
vital force, and by announcing its direction, determine its law. To seek therefore the
primary forms of which others are mere varieties, and to ask, " From what direction
of the living force does such a form derive its shape?" is a legitimate step towards the
discovery of the cause of that form, the "formal cause" of Bacon, or the law in mo-
dern language. The formation of blood and blood-vessels in the germinal membrane
which grows round the embryo during the incubation of a hen's egg, was taken as a
simple type of this process. The small whitish disc on the yolk-bag (the cicatricula),
is the spot where the vital changes begin. The embryo occupies the centre of this
spot, and becomes the centre of the vital force excited by the mother's warmth. From
this centre the force is communicated to the yolk-bag. The disc enlarges, still keep-
ing its circular form, and marked by concentric circles more or less perfect. The disc
is produced by the conversion of the yolk into cells, which adhere as a thin circular
la)rer. The circular form of this disc and the general concentric arrangement of the
cells, were considered to indicate that the lines of vital force which arranged and pre-
served that form were circular. The next step is the conversion of a portion of these
cells which form the disc into blood and blood-vessels. The trunks pass in the direc-
tion of radii of the original disc and central germ. The main trunks unite at the
central heart, which is at first only a bent portion of the common trunk. The capil-
laries inosculate at the circumference; thus the vessels form a complete circle. This
circular arrangement of the vessels as radii indicates a second circular force at right
angles to the plane of the former one. The vessels are formed thus. Those called
by Harvey " vasa lutea" are coarse, and the stages in their formation are more easily
watched. They are formed in the substance of the disc, and out of the same mate-

--rial, the cells of the yolk. These cells continuing to accumulate, some are arranged

as cylinders, then in succession as half-circles, circles, net-work, and trunks conver-
ging to the central embryo. At this stage each vessel is a coarse yellowish cylinder,
with a red streak down its axis. Externally it is composed of cells of various sizes,
which can easily be brushed off from the semi-transparent tube which they cover, and
which is composed of smaller cells, and contains the red blood flowing towards the
centre. The inference drawn was, that this tube, formed of cells aroimd the current,
is the evidence of a circumferential force around the current, arranging the cells as
a tube. It was next shown that such a direction and relation of the vital force in
arranging the disc and its vessels were in accordance with the direction and relation of
the electro-magnetic force. The law of this double force, which bears on the present
inquiry, is, that in order to act botli currents must circulate, that is, each must return
into itself. That the galvanic force must circulate, is evident from the construction
of a galvanic cell. The magnetic force accompanying the galvanic obeys the same
law. It also circulates, but in a plane at right angles to the galvanic. Dr. Wollaston
called it, in consequence of its circulation, vertiginous magnetism. These two cur-
rents are inseparable. They are directive forces, or carrying, according to the con-

dition of matter on which they act. What is true of the magnetic current circulating

round a single wire conveying the galvanic current, applies to two or more wires if
--30 REPORT 1846,

put together as a ribbon, or to a slip of metal, the only difference being the increase

of force in the latter instances, If the galvanic wire be'bent in a circle, or if several

wires are arranged so as to form a series of concentric i"ings, or if, which is the same

thing, a spiral coil of wire be made, the magnetic force still retains the same direc-

tion as in the straight wire; but as the whole of the wire acts upon the circle of mag-

netic force, its direction is through the centre of the ring or coil. If such a spiral

coil be placed on iron filings, they arrange themselves in lines, passing through the

centre parallel to its axis, and then folding up on either side as radii round the edge,

where they meet. These experiments were quoted from Dr. Faraday. Such a spiral

coil, through which galvanic force circulates, was considered to represent the disc

around the embryo ; and the iron filings to represent the direction of the capillary

vessels, arranged circularly in a plane, at right angles to the disc, by the magnetic

force accompanying the galvanic. From comparing the two, the conclusion was drawn,

that in both cases the force at work obeys the same laws ; that the formation of a

circular living disc, by a central force constantly acting, proves the existence of a

circular force around that centre, and is analogous to a flat spiral or disc, through

which the galvanic force is circulating; and that this vital force in the disc is neces-

sarily attended by a second circulating force in the direction of radii to it, such as is

indicated by the vessels. The actual movements of the cells in this living process

are invisible, as it is one of growth ; but the forms produced are explicable on the

hypothesis that the living force acts in accordance with the laws of a force the direc-

tion and relation of which have been ascertained. This analogy is rendered still more

probable by the connexion between heat and galvanism discovered by Seebeck. If

a current of heat instead of a current of galvanism be made to circulate through the

spiral coil of wire, it will, like galvanism, develope magnetic currents in the direction

Nowof radii to the centre.  as the mother's heat is the source which supplies force

to the embryo, in both instances, in the metal coil of wire and in the disc the force is

in the form of heat. In both there is a primary concentric arrangement of matter

for the transmission of this force ; and in both there is the evidence of a second cir-

cular force in a plane at right angles to the first.

If, instead of the arrangement of the galvanic wire as a flat spiral coil, the rings are

arranged side by side, as a spiral tube or helix, then the second or magnetic force

would be through its axis. It would be a tube, which, if placed in water, would carry

one pole of a magnetic needle, floated on cork, through it ; and iron filings would

arrange themselves in a circular line, going through the helix, round on the outside,

returning into itself (Faraday). The spiral galvanic force here is attended by the

current through the tube. The converse would be the case. The steps in the forma-

tion of vessels are, that blood is first formed, and when it circulates a tube is formed

around it. The current of blood indicates a force through the axis of the tube ; the

tube itself indicates a circumferential force around the current to arrange its materials

as a tube. The tubes are arranged circularly, meeting at the heart in the centre, and

at the capillaries in the circumference. The living tube, if it followed electro-mag-

netic laws, would have (like the helix of wire through which the galvanic force was

circulating) a circular force through its axis; and conversely, this current would tend

--to form a tube around itself supposing always appropriate materials. The vital

force has evidently appropriate materials in the form of cells. Those cells, which

exposed to oxygen become converted into red globules, are moved in a current; thus

showing that they are fit matter for the influence of vital force in one direction, and

that such a force is moving them ; whereas the smaller cells are arranged round the

cun-ent as a tube ; thus showing a second force at work around the first. There is a

current in one direction, and a tube around it ; neither tube nor current can be ex-

plained without the assumption of a moving power : both are readily explained by

two circular forces having the same relation to each other as the electro-magnetic.
   The cells out of which the disc and vessels are built have been regarded so far as

under the influence of a force external to them. But each cell has a vital force of its

own, similar in kind to the central force, but less in degree. The central force sub-

ordinates all lesser forces and makes the disc one. Embryologists have shown that

the earliest apjiearance of organization in the ovules of plants and ova of animals is a

cell, and that such cell has a nucleus, and each nucleus a nucleolus, or central spot,

which is the essential part of each cell, and which has the power of forming cells and

of arranging them round it. Dr. Barry has shown that each secondary cell becomes

in its turn the centre of a similar action, smaller ones being generated and arranged
round the larger ones. Prof. Goodsir iinds that the inner membrane of the tubes of
glands is formed of cells, and that nucleated cells are found among them, which he
calls centres of nutrition, as if these nucleated cells were the parents of successive broods
of young cells passing off from them, and arranged round them as centres. These
centres of nutrition are here called centres of force; and according to the law of this
force, there would be a common centre, bringing all these isolated and secondary
centres into one comprehensive whole. The blood corpuscles are also nucleated
cells, each having its own central living force, and thus their relation to the vital force
whilst circulating is analogous to that which a magnet holds to the electro-magnetic
force moving it. Both are bodies containing within themselves these forces.

   The vascular disc of the yolk-bag had been taken as a central fact, the right com-
prehension of which would explain other facts of the same kind, but more complex.

--Its application to some few facts in physiology was then shown, such as the formation

of new blood-vessels ; the tubular form of vessels and ducts among cells ; the circu-

lation through capillaries independently of the contraction of their coats, or of the
propulsive power of the heart ; and of that universal fact, that wherever there is a

--central heart, there are powers at work which neither its propulsive power nor capil-

lary action can explain, of forming new vessels in connexion with the old ones. Such
a universal fact becomes a law, when the cause is shown. This cause or law, now

proposed as the solution of these living processes, is, that the vital force circulating

--in two directions, one circle being in a plane at right angles to the other, thus iden-

--tical in direction and relation with the electro- magnetic force, will explain the phse-

nomena ; or, in other words, that wherever there is a central moving force there is
a power at work around, and to and from that centre, capable of arranging fit matter
as tubes, and of circulating fluid to a certain extent through them, and that the tubu-
lar formation is owing to a vital power identical in its direction with the galvanic
and the radiated arrangement of these vessels, and the circulation (to a certain ex-
tent) of fluid through them, are dependent on a power accompanying the former, and
identical in its direction with the magnetic force. The conclusion was not drawn that
the vital and electro-magnetic forces were the same, but that the direction and rela-
tion of both forces were identical.

On a new Multiplying Condenser. By Prof. A. F. Svanberg.

   The author was led by the process used by M. Pfaff of Kiel, in his researches on the
electricity of contact between metals and fluids, to construct a new instrument, which,

by a single contact of zinc and copper, can be charged by manipulation, requiring only

a minute of time, to an intensity sufficient to give a brilliant spark and strong shock.

It consists of two ordinary condensers, whose plates are of copper, the two lower con-

nected by a copper wire. They are pre-     _

vented from touching by plates of glass

cemented to them, and a little larger for

the sake of insulation. The lower plates

are supported by insulating stems, and

the upper have insulating handles. For

an instance of its use, suppose the first

On some Results of the Magnetic Observations made at General Sir T. M.
           Brisbane's Observatory, Makerstoun. By J. A. Broun.

 --1st. Magnetic Declination. The annual diminution of westerly declination at

Makerstoun is5'-8. When proportional parts of this have been added to the monthly

means, from January 1844 till August 1846, their whole range is only 2'-l ; that is
to say, the mean position of the magnetic needle for any month, freed from secular
change, has not been above 2'-l further west than the mean position for any other

month. Mr. Broun conceives that he has found the annual period of westerly decli-

nation to consist of a minimum at the vernal, and of a maximum at the autumnal
equinox; the mean range being under l'-2. From the observations for 1843, Mr,
Broun has concluded that there is a maximum of westerly declination when the sun
and moon are in opposition, and a minimum when they are in conjunction ; that there
is a maximum of westerly declination when the moon has its greatest north, and also
when it has its greatest south declination, minima occurring when it crosses the
equator. In the diurnal period, the double maximum and minimum have been found

to exist in each Imonth of the year. In the Transactions of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, Mr. Broun has gr\'en certain results relating to the horizontal and vertical

components of the earth's magnetic force; but these results were obtained in scale

divisions corrected for temperature by his method. In order to deduce the variations

of magnetic dip and of the total magnetic force from the variations of these compo-
nents, it was necessary to determine the values of the scale divisions in known units.
Mr. Broun had previously shown* the inapplicability of the method given by the
Committee of Physics of the Royal Society of London for the balance magnetometer.

He now described a method by which the value of the micrometer divisions may be

satisfactorily determined. This method will be found in the Introduction to the

Makerstoun Observations for 1843. He has applied the same method to the bifilar

magnetometer, and has found that the value of the scale divisions, obtained in the way

recommended by the Committee of Physics, is also inaccurate for this instrument.
With the aid of the values obtained by the new method, the following results have

--been deduced.

junction, and a maximum when they are in opposition. In the mean diurnal period

throughout the year, the principal minimum occurring at 6 a.m. in winter ; the two

minima being nearly equal at the equinoxes, and the diurnal curve being single in

The principal maximum occurs about two hours after the moon's passage of the infe-

rior meridian ; a secondary minimum about four hours before the passage of the su-

perior  meridian ;  a secondary maximum about  one hour after  the  superior passage
                                                                                                                                               ;

and the principal minimum about six hours and a half after that passage.

Curves were exhibited illustrating these results, and also the diurnal motion of a

magnetic needle freely suspended in the direction of the magnetic force. From the

latter some curious results have been deduced, which will be found elsewhere. It will

be enough to mention, at present, that in the mean for the year, the motion from 6 p.m.

till 6 A.M. is very trifling ; between midnight and 6 a.m. the needle is almost stationary,
nearly the whole motion occurring between 6 a.m., Noon, and (5 p.m. The end of the

needle describes an ellipse whose major axis is at right angles to the magnetic meridian;

but the direction of this axis varies throughout the year.

                     Magnetic Causation. By G. Towler.

    Magnetic phsenomena are due to two distinct classes of forces, which, in the absence

of more appropriate terms, maybe called the "intrinsic" and "contingent." It is to
the consideration of the intrinsic forces that this paper is directed. The "intrinsic"
forces of the magnet are due, first, to the mechanical structure of the bodies in which

magnetical phsenomena are displayed, the capacity of the interstices of which bears a
given ratio to the dimensions of the particle of fluid constituting atmospheric air, by
and through which such interstices become highly sensitive conductors of atmospheric
air ; and, secondly, to the fluxion through and circulation round a magnetic bar of the

particles of atmospheric media.

   The following are among the propositions which the author regards as established :
    Each extremity of a magnet perpetually exercises the same power over the other
that each does over indifferent masses of iron ; in other words, one-half of a magnet

is constantly magnetizing the other.
   The "intrinsic" attribute, or sine qua non of a magnet, is the extreme sensibility

of the fluid particles in its interstices to motion, from minute forces, arising from the
mechanical conformation of magnetical substances ; and the extremities, or opposite
forces of the body, being within that distance of each other, whereby the forces gene-
rated by such action are sufficient to reproduce it.

save a second heating. It should not be doubled over nor sheared and faggoted.

The rolling should be conducted at as low a temperature as convenient, as it thereby

--acquires a harder and closer texture and finer grain. 7th. In cutting into shape,

the substance (if large or of varied form) should not be strained, as by boring with

rimers, or straightening (oftener than is unavoidable) with the hammer, as it is

then apt to warp and to have unseen commencements of cracks on becoming subse-

quently hardened.

More carbonization than that previously described as best is of little injury to the

magnetic goodness of the steel, provided it be so prepared as to preserve a homo-

geneous and white appearance of fracture when hardened, which is not so easily ma-

naged as with that of lower carbonization ; but if it be again carbonized more than
usual (as razor steel, or above that) it rather improves ; and again, an increase dete-

riorates it as in cast iron, and a further increase again improves it. In short, in the

  --On the Physical Properties which the Steel should possess. The fineness of grain is

affected by many adventitious circumstances, which must be considered and allowed

for in judging of it ; and the most important fact is the difference between the appear-

ance in the hard and soft states ; for in the general properties, both optical, mechanical

and magnetical, their order, in any set of samples, is reversed in the hard state, inde-

pendently of the absolute change in each property.

The steels should be examined by breaking with a single bend at a iile notch

A(notching with a chisel, bending back, &c. changes the appearance).          microscope

of six or ten lineal power is better than any other power for examining it.

The general properties, without going into detailed description, should be as follows,

the terms being comparative with other samples of less value, and not at all with the

hard or soft states of the same steel.

   The author added some peculiar considerations on the chemical constitution and

molecular arrangement of certain sorts of steel ; and on the molecular peculiarities

of iron and other metals, in connexion with their magnetic capacity, illustrated by a

--tabular arrangement.
   On Hardening, S(c. In the ordinary process there is much risk and difficulty for
large work, owing to unequal heat, unnecessary time and heat applied, especially to

fine edges, decarbonization, scaling, &c.

   These are obviated by a process, which is new as applied on a large scale, namely,

heating in melted lead. It will be observed that the jorecise heat is imparted quite
uniformly in half a minute or so, and the finest edge is heated momentarily no higher
than the thickest part (rendering this process incomparable for all instruments where

it is the edge or smaller parts that are of importance). No scale is formed, the finest

polish or sharpest edge being preserved through the hardening ; the previous prepa-
ration of the steel and some other points are described ; and particularly the manner
of refrigeration in water (salt), and for securing hardness and great evenness, are

also detailed.

   The process has been applied to steel sheets of 10 inches by 20, obtained quite flat,
and as hard as a file throughout, even at the middle parts, which has hitherto been
found very difficult, we may say impossible. Magnets prepared by these means only
differ generally in magnetic power by -^th part, many being absolutely equal.

    Particulars are then given of the advantage of certain high powers for magnetizing
bars, and of an apparatus constructed weighing 2 cwt. and possessing nearly as great
agoregate power as the colossal magnet in possession of the Royal Society (weighing

we believe 2 tons).

  A method is suggested for verifying the constancy of magneto-meteorologic instru-

ments, by means of the terrestrial magnetism itself; independently of its own varia-
tions, or of the comparison of the mutual action of three or more bars.

               On the Mode of Developing the Magnetic Condition.
                       Bij the Rev. W. Scoresby, D.D., F.R.S.

    Dr. Seoi-esby stated that he had, at York, shown a new and superior mode of deve-
loping the magnetic condition in properly prepared and hardened steel bars, by inter-
posing a thin plate of soft iron between the operating magnet and the bar of steel to
be magnetized. He had, at that time, supposed it to be necessary to extend the thin
plate of soft iron the entire length of the bars of steel to be magnetized. But he had
since found this to be by no means the case ; since by laying any number of un mag-
netized bars of steel in a long line, and passing along them a horse-shoe magnet with
its poles connected with a thin polished plate of soft iron (he used common hoop iron),
the ends being slightly bent upwards to cause it to pass more freely over the steel
bars, and then turning them over and renewing the process on the other face, he found
he could communicaAe to the bai-s the full charge which they wei-e competent to re-
ceive. The author exhibited this experiment : and by simply passing a horse-shoe
magnet thus armed with an interposed piece of sheet iron, once over each face of
twelve previously unmagnetized bars of steel, he communicated to them so much
power as that they sustained their own weight, when held up as a chain.

On the Constitution and Forces of the Molecules of Matter. By Dr. Laming.

In this paper the author applied a theory of the molecular constitution of matter in

forty-two distinct propositions to the explanation of gravitation, temperature and spe-

which consists of three sorts of spherical atoms, distinguished as basic, calorific, and

electrical. The only force it recognizes is attraction. The basic atoms do not attract

one another, neither do the calorific ; but the electrical attract each other with a force

reciprocally as the square of their distances. Each electrical atom attracts calorific

atoms around it, and each basic atom attracts calorific in unlimited numbers ; whilst
it also attracts around it electrical atoms, in some large but definite number. This

number is in each case unchangeable, but the basic atoms differ one from another in

attracting around them a greater or less number of electrical atoms. The force be-

tween basic and electrical atoms is much greater than that between the electrical

atoms mutually ; hence one of these is termed the major, the other the minor

electrical force. The attraction of the basic for the calorific atoms is intermediate

between these. The attraction of the electrical for the calorific atoms is the greatest

of all the mutual forces. The immediate consequence of these forces is to cause

each electrical atom to be surrounded by calorific atoms, and each basic atom to be

then enveloped with these electrical atoms, in greater or less number according to

its chemical nature, but in each case definite. One of these basic atoms so sur-

rounded is the elementary molecule of matter, or the simple atom of the chemist.

Each basic atom thus surrounded by its sphere of electrical atoms constitutes an elec-

trosphere ; but a change of the calorific atomospheres of the electrical atoms of this,

may cause a change of their arrangements about the centpl basic atoms, so that some

of the electrical atoms may be thrown out on the surface of the electrosphere and

thus become complementary ; and it is upon the mutual actions and relations of these
complementary atoms that all electrical and other phsenomena involving change are

supposed to depend. One remarkable consequence of this theory is, that gravitation

depends on the electrical atoms alone ; and that hence a positively electrified body must

be heavier, and a negatively electrified body lighter, than the same body with its elec-

tricity in the ordinary undisturbed state. This the author proposed to prove experi-

mentally to the Section.

                    On Atmospheric Waves. By W. R. Birt.

   In introducing his report, the author noticed the steps he had taken during the last
autumn for observing the great symmetrical wave of November. Instructions de-
tailing the instruments to be observed, times of observation, &c., were drawn up and
forwarded by him to gentlemen interested in meteorological research, and also other-

                                                                      d2

wise circulated*. In accordance with these instructions, about thirty sets of inter-
esting and vahiable observations had been made ; the stations extending in one
direction from the west of Ireland to Heligoland, and in the other from the Scilly
 Isles to the Orkneys. These observations Mr. Birt had subjected to a very careful
comparison, especially those made at his own residence near London, with those
which he made in the autumn of 1842 at Leicester Square. The result of this com-
 parison was such as clearly to show that there was a most striking coincidence between
 the barometric movements of October and November 1845, and those of a portion of
 September, October and November 1842. So close did this coincidence appear to
 the author, that during the period from October 1 to November 21 in 1845, the baro-
 metric movements of October 23 to 26 were the only oscillations that appeared to
 have no corresponding movements in 1842. It appeared that the great wave com-
 menced in 1845, near midnight, between the 6th and 7th, that it culminated on the
 14th, and terminated on the 21st ; during the 10з days previous to the setting in of
 the wave, the movements in 1842 and 1845 were almost identical. Mr. Birt observed
 that in 1845 the great wave, in all its essential features, was very distinctly marked
 that it was completely separated from all the preceding barometric movements, and
 that the individuality that was thus given to it, induced the strong belief that we hajre
 obtained the type of the barometric oscillations during the middle portion of No-
 vember. This type he proposed to express in the following language :

     " That during fourteen days in November, more or less equally disposed about the
 middle of the month, the oscillations of the barometer exhibit a remarkably symme-

 trical character, that is to say, the fail succeeding the transit of the maximum or

 highest reading, is to a great extent similar to the preceding rise ; this rise and fall is
 not continuous or unbroken ; in three out of four of the occasions on which it has
 been observed, it has been found to consist ofJive distinct elevations. The complete
 rise and fall has been termed the great symmetrical barometric wave of November,
 and as such has been considered to result from the transit of a large wave, but there
 is great reason to believe that while it may be due to the transit of a normal wave
  of about fourteen days' amplitude, it also exhibits the transits oijive secondary super-
 posed waves. At the setting in of the great November wave the barometer is gene-
  rally loiv, sometimes below 29 inches. This depression is succeeded by two well-marked
 undulations, varying from one to two days in duration. The central undulation, which
  also forms the apex of the great wave, is of larger extent and longer duration, occu-
  pying from three to five days ; when this has passed, two smaller undulations, corre-
  sponding to those at the commencement of the wave, make their appearance, and at
  the close of the last the wave terminates."

     Mr. Birt exhibited curves of observations that had been made during November at
  Dublin, from 1829 to 1845 inclusive, which he had received from Capt. Larcom of
  the Royal Engineers. From these curves, it appeared that the great wave had been
  observed at Dublin in twelve out of seventeen years, and that with two exceptions in
  eleven years of distinct and well-marked transits of the great wave, the epochs of the
  maxima were confined to five days, near the middle of the month, namely from the

   12th to the 17tht.

     The author then proceeded to notice the comparison he had instituted between the
  curves he had obtained from various stations, and exhibited curves from twelve stations
  in Ireland, England and Heligoland. From a consideration of these curves (which
  were so arranged as to show the departm-e from symmetry in certain directions), he
  argued that while the posterior slope of a wave of considerable magnitude was passing
  oif towards the E.N. E., the front of another was approaching from the N.W., and that
  it was the interference of the two that produced the symmetrical arrangement of the
  curves. In that portion of the area covered by the advancing wave the barometer
   rose ; in that covered by the receding wave it fell ; while in that in which the two
   waves interfered, the atmosphere as regarded these waves was quiescent, and the
  smaller secondary waves passed on uninfluenced by them. He also showed that

       * These instructions, with a short notice of the wave, were published in the AthensEum

   of Sept. 6, 1845. No. 932, pp. 880, 881.
       f While exhibiting these curves, the author invited the attention of the Section to a very

   remarkable and apparently constant depression of the mercurial column which occurred about
   the 28th of November. It had been observed in fifteen out of the seventeen years' observa-
   tions, and appeared to be unconnected with the great wave.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.    37

these lines of symmetry or interference varied in different years ; iu the year 1842 the
line of greatest symmetry passed from Dublin through Brussels to Munich; in 1845
it appeared to be confined to the south of England.

    Mr. Birt next proceeded to notice the arrangements of the aerial currents or winds

with regard to the distribution of pressure. He stated that the observations on the

winds in November 1812, clearly established Prof. Dove's theory of parallel and
oppositely directed currents, and he showed by diagrams that if these currents are
shifting ones, as the Professor suggests, as they passed over any tract of country in
a direction transverse to those in which the wind was blowing in each, all the phaa-

nomena of an atmospheric wave would be produced. He remarked that if there was

only one set of these parallel currents passing over a line of country, then the exa-
mination of the phaenomena of an atmospheric wave would be comparatively easy.
The discussion of the observations had however shown that there were two sets of
parallel and oppositely directed currents at right angles to each other, one set from

the N.E. and S.W., with a lateral motion from the N.W., and the other from N.W.
and S.E., with a lateral motion from the S.W. ; and also that when these currents are
referred to the wave, the N.E. and N.W. currents, in their respective systems, re-

present anterior slopes with the direction of the aerial currents at right angles to the
axis of translation directed towards the left-hand; and the S.W. and S.E. currents

represent posterior slopes, the direction of the aerial currents still at right angles to

the axis of translation, but directed towards the right-hand*. The author considered
that these rectangularly posited currents explained several phaenomena, such as the
barometric wind-rose, the revolution of the vane in one imiform direction, &c., and
concluded his report with pointing out several important desiderata that it was desi-
rable should be made the subjects of future inquiries.

CHEMISTRY.

On the Changes which Mercury sometimes suffers in Glass Vessels hermetic

Bycally sealed.  Prof. Oersted.

It has been frequently noticed that mercury inclosed in glass tubes, even when

those tubes were hermetically sealed, undergoes a remarkable change. It first be-
comes covered by a thin film of a yellow colour, which adheres to the glass, and
becomes eventually nearly black. This has been attributed to oxidation, but the
oxidation which would arise from the exceedingly small quantity of atmospheric air
which could be contained within the bulbs exhibited by Professor Oersted was too
small to account for the formation of such a quantity of dark and yellow powder as

many of them exhibited. Professor Oersted referred the change on the mercury to
the action of that metal on the glass of which the bulb was formed. It appears that
sulphate of soda is frequently employed in the manufacture of glass, and it is thought

that a sulphuret of mercury is formed by the decomposition of the glass itself. This
is not however satisfactorily proved, and the subject has only been brought forward
that attention might be directed to a subject which appeared to involve some remark-

able conditions.

   Om a second new Metal, Pelopium, contained in the Bavarian Tantalite.

                                By Prof. H. Rose.

   In a former communication it had been shown that the so-called tantalic acid
which occurs in the Bodenmais in Bavaria, consisted of two acids, one of which
differed materially from all known acids. To this Professor Rose gave the name of
Niobium, regarding it as a new metallic oxide. After a most elaborate investigation.
Professor Rose has found that the other acid contains another oxide of a metal dif-

   * These directions are in close accordance with that of the rotation of the air in revolving
storms, and appear strongly to support Sir John Herscliel's suggestion, that such storms may
be produced by the crossing nf two large atmospheric waves moving in different directions.

fering from niobiuni, and to this metal he has given the name of Pelopium, from
Pelops the son of Tantalus and the brother of Niobe. The tantalite of Bavaria is

--therefore now shown to contain three metals tantalium, niobium and pelopium.

These differ from each other in specific gravity, and they exhibit diflFerent and pecu-

liar chemical properties.

On Cavendish's Experiment respecting the production of Nitric Acid.
                    By Prof. Daubenv, M.D., F.R.S.

Dr. Daubeny stated the result of some experiments he had instituted with the

view of ascertaining whether the production of nitric acid by electricity, as was first

eflFected by Cavendish, really arose from the direct union of oxygen with nitrogen, or

was produced indirectly through the presence of minute portions of ammonia. For

this purpose he deprived the air, through which the electrical sparks were to be

passed, of water, and of any traces of ammonia that might have been contained in it,

by allowing it to stand in contact with concentrated sulphuric acid for some time

previous to the commencement of the experiment. Even in this case, although the

air had been in contact with no liquid except the mercury over which it was con-

fined, the usual diminution of volume took place after the electrical sparks had been

passed through it, and solution of litmus, when introduced into the tube, became

sensiblj' reddened. Hence the author infers that nitrogen does combine directly

with oxygen, as it is now known to do with carbon, but he still questions whether

it can do so with gaseous hydrogen, since ammonia cannot be formed, as nitric acid

is, by means of electricity ; and, as in all the cases in which ammonia has been pro-

duced artificially, one of the elements appears to have existed in what is called a

nascent state. But if nitrogen can be made to combine directly with oxygen, how

comes it that through the operation of thunder-storms the composition of the whole

atmosphere has not before this time been changed by the production in it of con-

siderable quantities of nitric acid ? This the author explains by the small amount of

heat generated by the union of the two gases, owing to which only those particles

combine which lie contiguous to the line of the electrical spark ; whereas in other

cases, as in that of the union of oxygen with hydrogen, so much heat is elicited

by the union of those particles which are affected by the passage of the electrical

spark, that a condensation of other portions of the mixture results, whence will arise

a union of more of the particles, and an extrication of a larger amount of heat. In

this way the explosion propagates itself through all parts of the mixture with a ra-

pidity which causes it to be considered by us as instantaneous. In all cases however

in which gaseous elements that can remain together without acting upon each other

are made to unite, the modus operandi, whether it be by electricit}', by heat, or (as in

the case of porous bodies) by adhesive aflBnity, appears to be the same, that is, such

a condensation of the respective gases as shall bring their particles within the sphere

of their mutual affinity.  _^_____

On the extent to which Fluoride of Calcium is soluble in Water at 60░ F.
                        гy George Wilson, M.D.

    In April of this year, 1846, Dr. Wilson read a paper to the Royal Society of
Edinburgh announcing the solubility of fluoride of calcium in water, and stating
that in consequence of observing this fact, he had been led to seek for that salt in
milk, in blood, and in sea-water, where it had not been previously detected, but in

all of which he found it. He also mentioned that he was able to confirm the re-

sults of previous observers as to the presence of fluoride of calcium in natural waters,
in plants and in animal remains, as well as in the urine of man.

   Since that paper was read. Dr. Wilson ascertained the extent to which fluoride of
calcium is soluble in water at 60░ F. ; and as it is a point of some interest in connexion
with geological and mineralogical, as well as with chemical speculations, he brought
it before the Chemical Section of the Association. The experiments recorded below
were performed with a solution of native well-crystallized fluor spar, prepared by
boiling distilled water upon the powdered fluor, which had been previously purified
by digestion with warm aqua regia, so as to remove any trace of metallic oxides,
lime-salts or the like, which might be present. The solution at 212░ F. was filtered

╖whilst warm, and left at rest for some days in stoppered bottles at a temperature of

about 60░, till it deposited the excess of fluor soluble above that temperature. It was

Athen filtered a second time.  certain volume of the solution measured at 60░ was

evaporated to dryness on the vapour-bath, in a counterpoised platina basin, and the

weight of the residue ascertained.
   Twenty-four pints of the solution were thus made use of. In six experiments,

one imperial pint of the solution (16 fluid ounces, or 7000 grains) was taken at each

trial. In four trials three pints were evaporated at each experiment. In one Ccise

six pints were employed. The following are the results :

                                                                        Per pint.

=Expt. XI. evap. 6 pints of solution. Residue 1-62 0-27 Average 0-270 per pint.

   Twenty. four pints of distilled water thus dissolved 6-330 grains of fluor spar ; so
that the average amount dissolved in one pint will be 0-2637 grains. One grain
therefore of fluor will requrie 26-545 grains of water at 60░ F. to dissolve it, or water

at that temperature will take up 26.545^^^ ░^ ''^ weight of the salt.

   The solubility here indicated must be considered great for a salt hitherto reputed
quite insoluble. It is still more soluble in water at a high temperature, as the de-
posit left by warm solutions on cooling shows. These facts will now be coniiected
with the appearance of fluoride of calcium in plants and animals, as well as in mineral
veins and elsewhere, and may perhaps prove suflacient to explain these hitherto per-

plexing phsenomena.

Analysis of the American Mineral Nemalite. By Prof. Connell, F.R.S.E,

   This mineral bears a striking resemblance to asbestus, so that by the eye it can
hardly be distinguished from it. It was first chemically examined by Mr. Nuttal,

who ascertained that it differs entirely in constitution from asbestus, and concluded

from his experiments that it consists essentially of magnesia and water with a little
oxide of iron and lime. It was subsequently examined by Dr. Thomson, according

whomto it also contains 12^ per cent, of silica. The constituents found by the

latter were

   The result which I have obtained differs somewhat from both the preceding.
According to both the previous experimenters, the mineral is soluble in acids without
effervescence. But I have found that even perfectly fresh portions of the specimens
(which I have) of the mineral from Hoboken in America sensibly effervesce when
dissolved in acids, showing some carbonic acid to be contained in it. I have also
found only a very minute quantity of silica, the mineral leaving scarcely any residue

when dissolved.
   The amount of water was determined by ascertaining the quantity of water col-

lected by ignition in a tube of German glass twice bent, and containing at one end

fused chloride of calcium. The carbonic acid was estimated by the loss of weight on

treating a portion of the mineral with dilute acid in a little bottle connected with a
tube containing chloride of calcium.

   The solid constituents were determined bj' ordinary methods. The result was, in
100 parts,

to be a combination of hydrate of magnesia and hydrated carbonate of magnesia.

Observations on the Nature of Lampic Acid. By Prof. Connell, F.R.S.E.

   The author had shown some years since that a large quantity of formic acid and
a little acetic acid exist in lampic acid as prepared in the ordinary way. Marchand
and others, admitting the presence of these acids, maintain that in addition it con-
tains aldehydic acid. It appears however to Professor Connell that the mere reduc-
tion of oxide of silver without effervescence, the formation of resin with alkaline
solutions, the blackening of the lampic salts on evaporation and by the action of sul-
phuric acid, are insufficient to support this view ; and these facts are all explained
on the idea of aldehyde being associated with the acetic acid present in the liquid.
Further, the atomic weight of lampic acid, 50-35, is much too high to belong to an
acid, containing aldehydic acid, associated with much formic acid. But if we sup-
pose a foreign body, such as aldehyde, associated with the acetic portion of the
liquid, and entering for the time into the constitution of its salts, we can easily ex-
plain the high atomic weight and chemical I'eactions.

On the Connexion between the Isomorphous Relations ofthe Elements and their
         Physiological Action. By James Blake, M.B., F.R.C.S.

   In a paper read before the Academy of Sciences at Paris, the author remarked
"that when introduced directly into the blood, the salts of the same base appear to
exert the same effect on the animal oeconomy." Since that time further researches
have led to the discovery of a law, equally interesting under a chemical as under a
physiological point of view. The law alluded to is that, when introduced into the
blood, all isomorphous substances produce analogous effects and give rise to the same
reactions in the animal ceconomy. This law has been verified by an extended series
of experiments with the salts of magnesia, lime, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc,
cadmium, copper, bismuth, lead, baryta, strontia, soda, silver, potash, ammonia,

--palladium, platinum, osmium, iridium, antimony, the acids of phosphorus, arsenic,

bromine, chlorine, iodine, sulphur, and selenium. One of the facts observed is the
connexion which exists between the phj'siological action of these substances, and
their isomorphous relations to the elements of the blood. It is found that those
substances which exist in the blood, or which have isomorphous relations with its
elements, give rise to the least marked reactions : thus phosphoric and arsenic acids
can be introduced into the veins without producing any marked phsenomena, whilst,
on the other hand, those elements which are most distinct in an isomorphous point
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                     41

of view, from the constituents of the blood, are those which give rise to the most

marked phenomena. Two drachms of arsenic acid injected into the veins will pro-

duce no marked effect on any organ ; but a grain of chloride of palladium, or two
grains of nitrate of baryta, are sufficient instantly to arrest the movements of the

heart. Several other instances analogous to those quoted were pointed out.

  On the Action of Oxalic Acid upon the Dead Tissues of the Animal Body.

                             By H. Letiieby, M.B.

   It has been stated by Dr. Coindet, Dr. Christison and others, that oxalic acid does
not appear to have any corrosive action on the stomach like the mineral acids. Dr.
Letheby however remarks that these statements are opposed to the observations
which he has made. In every case which he had examined of poisoning by oxalic
acid, the stomach soon after "death was found to be completely corroded, so that it
would scarcely hold together. Numerous experiments were made with various
animal tissues, such as submitting skin, stomach, intestine, muscle and tendon to
the action of solutions of oxalic acid of different strengths. After standing about
twelve or fourteen hours at a temperature of 60░ Fahr., it was found that the cel-
lular and mucous tissues of each underwent either complete solution, or else were so
softened that they broke down under the pressure of the thumb and fingers ; the
albuminous and muscular tissues were also softened and looked as if they had been

                           By R. D. Thomson, M.D.

   This paper was a recapitulation of the results obtained by Dr. Thomson when
engaged on the Government Commission, and published in the Report presented to
Parliament, and also in Dr. Thomson's ' Researches on the Food of Animals.'

On the Difference in the Physiological Actions of the Yellow and Red Prus-

Bysiates as an evidence of their containing dissimilar Badicals.  H.

Letheby, M.B.

   In the course of his inquiries into the actions of the various compounds containing
cyanogen on the animal oeconomy, the author was particularly struck with the great
dissimilarity in the effects produced by the yellow and red prussiates of potash, and
was led to think it might furnish some evidence upon the side of Liebig's doctrine,
that the two salts contain radicals which are dissimilar. To prepare himself for this
inquiry, however, he thought it necessary to ascertain what would be the effects of
the simple and the double cyanides, and then to experiment with the yellow and red
prussiates of similar bases. Of the simple cj'anides, he chose those of potassium,
sodium, ammonium, mercury, lead, iron, zinc and silver ; and, to provide against any
fallacy which might arise from the action of the gastric juice, injected them into the
veins or peritoneal cavity. Contrary rather to his expectations, it was found that

they were all poisonous ; the soluble ones generally acting as quickly as prussic acid,
while the others required a little longer time for the development of the symptoms ;
but in all cases death followed their administration, from two to five grains being
sufficient to produce such a result. Of the double cyanides, he chose those of po-
tassium and zinc, potassium and silver, potassium and nickel, and a mixture of
cyanide of potassium with cyanide of iron. These also were found to be most poi-
sonous, proving fatal in doses almost as small as the preceding. Now, these in-

--quiries clearly estabhshed two facts, that neither the simple nor double cyanides

could be given even in five-grain doses with impunity. The author was therefore
much astonished to find that a class of salts regarded by some chemists as double
cyanides should have little or no action upon the animal ceconomy, and that they
might be administered in doses of half an ounce without their exhibiting any un-
pleasant symptoms whatever. This was found to be the case with the ferrocyanides,
experiments having been made with those of potassium, sodium, ammonium, barium,

lead, iron and silver.

   He next examined the effects of the red prussiates ; and here again, contrary to
what would have been surmised from the want of action in the preceding compounds,
it was found that they constituted a class almost as poisonous as the simple cyanides.
The experiments were made with the red prussiates of potash and lead, and with a

crystalline acid obtained by the action of muriatic acid and aether upon the former
of these compounds. Each of them was quickly fatal in doses of from ten to forty

grains.

On the use of stating, with the results of Analyses, the nature of the Methods
                       employed. By W. West, F.R.S.

   The author of this communication pointed out the necessity' which existed for
knowing, not merely the results to which chemists might arrive, but the processes
by which these results were obtained. It was shown that many of the discrepancies
found to exist in analytical results would thus be satisfactorily explained, and all
doubt as to the correctness of an analysis removed.

On the presence of Atmospheric Air, uncombined Chlorine, and Carbonic Acid

  found in the Water of some of the Wells in the suburbs of Southampton,

  and their Action on Lead. By Henry Osborn.

   The principal object of this paper was to caution persons residing in the neigh-
bourhood of Southampton against the use of leaden pipes for conveying water, and
to induce them to avoid the use of lead in any form for that purpose without having

the water previously examined, in order to ascertain whether it possessed the property
of acting upon the metal and holding it in solution. The author brought forward
several instances of the serious consequences which had resulted from the use of
water impregnated with lead, and pointed out the different solvent principles found
in the water, one of which was uncombined chlorine discovered in a spring in the

New Forest. This water possessed the propert^^ of bleaching Brazil paper and redden-

ing litmus paper after concentration. The amount of uncombined chlorine was esti-
mated as chloride of silver by deducting the amount of the latter contained in twenty
ounces of water from that of the chlorine contained in the solid contents, the former
weighing 1-2 more than the latter; thus indicating 0-296 of uncombined chlorine
which is capable of uniting with 0-864 of lead, forming 1-16 of chloride of lead in
the imperial pint. The lead held in solution by carbonic acid and the oxygen of
atmospheric air was converted into chromate of lead, and estimated as chloride of
lead, which indicated 0-25 or 0*2 of the oxide in twenty ounces of water. The solid
contents in an imperial pint were found to vary from one to three grains, and to be
composed of the chlorides of sodium, calcium and magnesia, sulphate of lime, silica
and vegetable matter. Notwithstanding the preservative property which the salts
contained in spring-water are said to possess by forming an insoluble crust in the
interior of the pipes, it was found that the leaden pipes had been in use for some
years and the action of the water on the lead still continued with as much energy as
when they were first laid down, thus showing the presence of the above solvents, and
that they met with no resistance from the presence of the saline matter.

         On the Rationale of certain Practices employed in Agriculture.
                      By Prof. Daubeny, 3LD., F.R.S.

   The Professor instanced among other practices the use of quicklime and of gypsum

as fertilizers to the land.

   The former of these substances he supposes to act in part by rendering those in-
organic substances which are present in the soil more soluble, or, in accordance with
the views laid down by the author in a memoir which he has published in the Phi-
losophical Transactions of last year, by converting the dormant constituents of the
soil into active ones, or into a state in which they become immediately available.

   He appealed to the authority of Professor Fuchs, confirmed by that of Mr. Pri-
de9.ux of Plymouth, as showing that the alkali may be extracted from granite readily
by water after the rock in a pounded form has been heated together with quicklime
                    ----

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                         43

and he stated that a soil exhausted by long-continued cropping was found by him-
self to yield to water twice as much alkali, after having been mixed with quicklime,

as it had done before.
   Hence the frequent application of lime tends to produce exhaustion in the land,

not only because it supplies in itself no fresh alkali, but Ukewise because, by ren-
dering that which the soil contains more soluble, it causes it to be washed away

more readily by atmospheric water.
    Ploughing, and other mechanical methods of pulverizing the soil, appear to act in

the same way ; and so also may we suppose to do the sprinkling of the soil with
sulphuric acid, as is practised in some parts of the continent.

   The author then alluded to the various modes of explaining the advantage attri-
buted to gypsum which certain leading agricultural chemists had proposed; one
ascribing its virtues to the direct influence of the salt ; another to the indirect good
resulting from it, owing to its property of fixing ammonia ; a third regarding its acid
constituent as of the principal utility ; and a fourth its base.

    Dr. Daubeny gave reasons for rejecting the third and fourth of these hypotheses,
but considered that the use of gypsum may be in part attributable to the first and in
 part to the second of the causes pointed out ; supposing that this substance is gene-
 rally useful to all plants ^from its property of fixing ammonia, and also especially
 serviceable to certain species, by supplying them with a salt which they requhe for
their development. He was principally anxious however to bring forward this sub-
ject, in the hope of inducing chemists to institute fresh experiments for the purpose

 of setting the question at rest.

On the Fairy-rings of Pastures. By Prof. J. T. Way.

  A description of these patches, with which most persons are familiar, was given ;

and it was stated that the grass of which such rings are formed is always the first
to vegetate in the spring, and keeps the lead of the ordinary grass of the pastures
till the period of cutting. If the grass of these fairy-rings be examined in the spring
and early summer, it will be found to conceal a number of agarics or "toad-stools"
of various sizes. They are found situated either entirely on the outside of the ring
or on the outer border of the grass which composes it. The theory of DeCandolle,
that these rings increase by the excretions of these fungi, being favourable for the
growth of grass but injurious to their own subsequent development on the same

Aspot, was remarked on, and shown to be insufficient to explain the phaenomena.

chemical examination of some fungi (the true St. George's Agaric of Clusius Agaricus
graveolens) which grew in the fairy-rings on the pasture around the College at Ciren-
cester was made. They contained 87'46 per cent, of water, and 12*54 per cent, of
dry matter. The ashes of these were found to contain

Silica                1-09
                      1*35
Lime                  2-20
Magnesia              trace
                      1*93
Peroxide of iron     3"80
Sulphuric acid      29*49
Carbonic acid       55-10
Phosphoric acid       3-32
Potash                0*41
Soda
Chloride of sodium

                    98-69

The abundance of phosphoric acid and potash, existing no doubt as the tribasic

phosphate of potash (3K0, P05), which is found in these ashes is most remarkable.
--AThe author's view of the formation of these rings is as follows :
                                                                      fungus is deve-

loped on a single spot of ground, sheds its seed and dies : on the spot where it grew

it leaves a valuable manuring of phosphoric acid and alkalies, some magnesia, and a

little sulphate of lime. Another fungus might undoubtedly grow on the same spot

again ; but upon the death of the first the ground becomes occupied by a vigorous

crop of grass, rising like a Phoenix on the ashes of its predecessors. It would thus
--44 REPORT 1846.

appear that the increase of these fairy-rings is due to the large quantity of phosphated
alkali, magnesia, &c. secreted by these fungi ; and whilst they are extending them-
selves in search of the additional food which they require, they leave, on decaying, a
most abundant crop of nutriment for the grass.

      On certain Principles ivhich obtain in the application of Manures.
                       By William Charles Sfooner.

   This was a paper by a practical agriculturist, who has paid attention to the re-
commendations of chemists as to the application of manures. It was pointed out
that many of the recommendations of chemists were nearly valueless to the practical
farmer on account of the expense involved in their employment. The direct appli-

cation of sulphuric acid and silicate of potash were adduced as examples, the expense
in both cases rendering their use impracticable, however valuable these ingredients

may otherwise prove. Many other examples were given enforcing on chemists the

necessity of connecting with their experimental inquiries the practicability of their
agricultural applications, both with reference to economical use and the ease with

which they may be employed.

On the application of the Principles of a Natural System of Organic Che-
   mistry to the Explanation of the Phanomenm occurring in the diseased
  Potato Tuber. By G. Kexmp, M.D.

   At the meeting of the Association last year at Cambridge, Dr. Kemp introduced

to the notice of the Society an outline of the results of two years' investigation into
the nature of the changes effected by vital and physical agents on organized bodies,
his principal aim being to suggest an arrangement founded upon natural affinities,
and capable of interpreting the results of organic analysis, consistently with the phse-
nomena which natural or artificial agents have effected.

   At an early period of the ravages committed last year by what is called the potato

disease. Dr. Kemp was induced, by the application of elementary analysis, to attempt

the removal of some of the difficulties in which the explanation of the subject was
involved. The results of those analyses are recorded in the abstracts of the Cam-
bridge Philosophical Societ3^ By the application of the principles of the natural
svstem of organic chemistry which he has suggested, the author arrived at the con-
clusion, "that the true nature of the affection is an abnormal tendency to premature
germination," and that the changes which the diseased tuber undergoes are identical
with those which had three years previously been discovered by Erdmann, Marchand
and Scharling to take place during the normal germination of seeds and tubers.

   Some remarks followed which all bore on the importance of autumn planting.
Numerous striking instances were adduced in which healthy potatoes had been grown
from diseased tubers planted in the autumn.

Some Inquiries into the Extent, Causes and Remedies of Fungi destructive in

                         Agriculture. By 3. Prideaux.

  --1st. Extent. DeCandolle's theory of injurious excretions having been opposed

by many arguments and experiments, particularly those recently published by Dr.
Daubenv ; that of Liebig, of specific exhaustion of the soil by plants of one species,
leaving it fit for another which required diflferent ingredients, had been generally
substituted. Some however had taken a middle course, and supposed plants to breed
animalcules ; which they left in the soil, and which would feed upon other plants of
the same species, but not upon those of different ones. The writer also, unsatisfied

with the theor\' of specific exhaustion of inorganic ingredients, from the occasional
unaccountable efficacy of ashes and soot, and the inconsistent effects of inorganic

--manures ; had investigated the organic residues on the soil, after wheat, barley, tur-

nips and potatoes ; compared them with the premature decay of wheat (where too
often cultivated) in patches, expanding from centres, like fairy-rings ; and with the
notoriety of fungus in the potato disease ; and had thence been led to inquire how
far such fungous parasites might be the general representatives of DeCandolle's sup-
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  45

posed injurious excretions. To what extent this may be true, the microscope will

best decide, by examining the roots and contiguous soil of plants after harvest, espe-

cially those which have ripened seeds.

 --2nd. Causes. Fungi and mucors were supposed to bear somewhat the same re-
--lation to vegetable, as mites and the like to animal, life a sort of debased or degraded

vitality, produced when the organizing vital power was not enough predominant over
the disorganizing tendency to decomposition, to effect due assimilation of the nutri-

tious matter presented ; but still sufficiently so to prevent decomposition or decay.
The constant struggle between the organizing vital force, and the decomposing power
of chemistry, was described ; and instances were adduced to show that the invigora-
tion of the vital force by solar light, and abundance of proper nourishment, enabled
it effectually to repress the decomposing action ; whilst, on the contrary, gloom,

warm damp, and stagnant electrical air, assisted the disorganizing force, and often

produced predatory fiingi, which might thus be considered a sort of retarded disor-
ganization. So ripening plants, as their vital powers decay, might generate such

parasites, which would explain how they weaken the soil so much more than green

crops, in proportion to the contents of their ashes. Such fungi, though not the
cause of disease or decay, are effectual promoters of both, and probably the chief

--means of infection, where that also exists.
    3rd. Remedies. If further investigation prove fungi thus generated to produce
such generally injurious effects, the remedies will be of practical importance. These
should be cheap and antiseptic, as well as destructive to fungi. Sulphate of copper
with salt, which had been successfully used for seed potatoes, was too costly for
spreading over the soil. Fresh lime, the general destroyer of noxious vermin, roots
and seeds, would probably answer till rendered inert by carbonic acid. Salt, which
appeared more promising, he had found, in some experiments, rather promote than
destroy fungi. Lime and salt digested together would eliminate caustic soda, a very
active destroyer ; and soda ash, with or without lime, would have a somewhat like
 effect ; and ammoniacal gas liquor is perhaps a still more destructive application.

But none of these alkalies can be regarded as antiseptic ; and the ammonia, when
 neutralized in the soil, might even promote disorganizing fermentation where already
 too strong ; and therefore, though they might do after seed crops, more antiseptic
 dressings must be used where there is putrescent tendency. Chloride of lime, in
 solution, he had found useless on diseased potatoes ; the powder had been said to
answer Ibetter, but either would soon be rendered inactive in the soil by the humous
 matters. Sulphuric acid, diluted, might succeed, where farmers had the means of
 applying it ; and alum, which is of easy application, is a cheap and powerful anti-

 septic.

    Dressings of this kind, intended to kill the fungi and check the disorganizing
 action, would be turned under in the first ploughing after harvest, independent of the
 usual manure for nourishing and exciting vital action.

               JVew Facts bearing on the Chemical Theory of Volcanoes.

                       By Prof. Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S.

   This communication detailed the views formerly promulgated by the author in

support of that at one time entertained by Sir Humphry Davy, that volcanic phae-
nomena are due to the oxidation of the metallic bases of the earths and alkalies by

the access of water and atmospheric air to the interior of the earth.
   After alluding to the hypothesis of central heat, and pointing out in what respects

it fails to account for the phsenoraena presented by volcanoes. Dr. Daubeny particu-
larised two new facts which lend countenance to the chemical theory. The first of
these is the chemical composition of volcanic products, which, according to recent
researches, is such as to lead to the inference that they are derived from granitic
materials, by the super-addition of those alkaline and earthy ingredients, which would
arise from the supposed oxidation of the inflammable bases assumed to exist in the

interior of the earth.

   The other new fact was the emission of flames from the orifices of Vesuvius and
other volcanoes, attributable apparently to the combustion of hydrogen in some of its
combinations, this disengagement of hydrogen being an immediate consequence of

the supposed process.

    Notices of Experiments in Thermo-Electricity. By J. Reade, M.D.

   Some experiments were shown by which a brass bar covered with paper, placed
in the focus of a reflecting sheet of copper bent into a semicircular form, and at a
short distance from a spirit-lamp, was made to revolve. This Dr. Reade thought to
be due to the influence of thermo-electricitj'.

                On the Electrization of Needles in different Media.
                            By Prof. C. Matteucci.

    Professor Matteucci has found that needles electrized in air, in oil, or in water,
were differently affected by the current, the magnetism varying with the nature of

the medium in which the needles were placed. The materials employed were the
oil of turpentine, olive oil, alcohol and water, and also plates of mica. The discharge
of a Leyden jar was then passed near the needles suspended in these fluids, and the
amount of magnetization ascertained.

   On Crystallography and a new Goniometer. By H. B. Leeson, M.D.

   This new system of crystallography was, during the last session of the Chemical
Society, brought under the notice of that body, and illustrated by models and instru-

ments. Dr. Leeson's goniometer consists in adapting to a microscope a polarizing
prism ; the crj^stal observed through this polarizing eye-piece of course presents two

faces instead of one, but by turning the eye-piece until these two angles are made to
correspond, the true angle of inclination from the axial line is obtained, and its value
is read off from a graduated circle within which the polarizing arrangement moves.

On the Influence which finely divided Platina exerts on the Electrodes of a
                Voltameter. By the Rev. T. R. Robinson, B.D.

    Having occasion some years ago to construct a small voltaic battery on Daniell's
principle, and wishing to make it as powerful as was consistent with a limited size,
I was led to determine its constants by Ohm's theory. Using the voltameter, and
grouping observations by the means used in astronomy, I succeeded in this ; and
when Mr. Wheatstone's paper on the ' Rheostat ' appeared, wished to confirm by

that instrument my results. The facility of its application led me to other examina-
tions, one of which I have ventured to lay before the Section, as it seems to me im-

portant in its bearing on a matter lately brought before the scientific world by Grove
and Faraday, namely the intimate connexion of all or nearly all the molecular forces.
The galvanometer used by me, being intended to measure powerful currents, con-
sisted of a simple needle suspended in the centre of a massive rectangle of copper.
I was in hopes that this simplicity of construction might give some simple relation
between the deflection and force, but it was not so ; the denominator of Ohm's ex-
pression of the force of the current is

as given by careful interpolation ; but I have not tried whether this can be deduced
from theory. The needle's magnetism was constantly examined and kept at satura-
tion. The rheostat was of Mr. Wheatstone's second kind slightly modified, its wire
copper -r\th of an inch, and 100 turns of it are 70 feet. The value of E, the elec-
tromotive force of Ohm, or rather the intensity of the sum or difference of the che-
mical affinities exerted in the cells is, as in Wheatstone's memoir, expressed by the
number of turns of the rheostat required to bring the needle from 45" to 40░. The
determinations of it are very consistent, provided that the magnetism of the needle is

constant and all the apparatus in given positions*.

* The author adds the vahie of E in the following cases :

Copper, zinc, dilute sulphuric acid                        E = 31'0

Platina, zinc, dilute sulphuric acid                       E = 4S'0

Daniell's cell                                             E = 57-0

Ditto, with mur. acid and ammonio-chloride of copper       E = 53*9

=Zinc in dilute mur. acid, copper and amixtureofsulph. of copper and nitr.ofannmon. E 68'0

Grove's cell                                               E = 13-2

These values neither change with the concentration of the fluids nor with the temperatures.
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                                                                  4/

   When one of these cells is connected with a voltameter, no decomposition takes

place that is sensible, though a feeble current passes. With two a slight extrication
of gas takes place at first and ceases, though it may be made continuous by reversing
the direction of the current. Three act steadily: the inactivity of the others is owing
to what has been called polarization of the electrodes, but which I would rather name
electrolytic resistance. It may be measured as E in turns of the rheostat, and was,
with the particular charges which I then used, 2'5 E. Obviously, therefore, two cells
could not decompose it, for in that case by Ohm's theory the energy of the current

                            p_ 2 E -- 2-5 E
                                 2R+r+y

(y being the resistance of the voltameter) is negative.

    This antagonist force is, I believe, referred to the accumulation of nascent hydrogen
and its peroxide on the electrodes ; and it seemed likely that the evolution of these

substances might be promoted by coating the platina with that metal io a state of

fine division. This was performed by filling the voltameter with chloride of platina,
immersing in it a positive platina wire, and making the electrodes negative. The case
was now altered ; one cell decomposed feebly with chlorine compounds as charges,
but decidedly with sulphates; two give 1*1 cubic inch of the mixed gases in five

minutes. With higher numbers the difference is also decided. The quantities given
by 3 cells had been 2 "5, now 5 '5

                              6 ,, ,, 99 ,, 11-8

                                   6 double ,, 18-5 ,, 25-3

My first impression was that the electrolytic resistance must have been lessened, for

the fact of decomposition implies that n E is greater than e in the formula ; but on

=examining it I found that e E X 2-49. Therefore I infer that the force which thus

assists the battery in subverting the affinity of oxygen for hydrogen is of such a
nature that the galvanometer does not take cognizance of it, and therefore is not elec-

tric. What then is its nature ? The only explanation which occurs to me is, that

the energetic capillary attraction which appears to exist at the surface of this platina
coating may be, like heat or electricity, convertible into chemical attraction, or that

the film of water in contact with it being decomposed, the heat evolved by its con-
densing a new one (for the intensity of this capillary force is very great) may, as in

Grove's recent discovery, aid the separation of the gases. I may add that this pe-
culiar action is more energetic at the positive electrode than the other. I removed
the coating from one of the plates by filling the voltameter with muriatic acid, and
making it positive. The surface retained however some of it which could not be re-
moved. When this was the negative electrode, more gas was evolved than when it
was positive. With 2 cells the quantities are 2'18 and 2'68, with 6 cells 8'60 and
9" 12. It maybe added, that in all these cases the resistance of the voltameter itself

appears to have been the same, the different measures varying from 38 to 35.

On the Electricity of Tension in the Voltaic Battery,
            By John P. Gassiot, F.R.S.

The author, referring to a paper presented to the Royal Society in December 1843,

remarks that the water battery he then used, which with 3520 pairs gave a continued

series of sparks, is at this time nearly as energetic in its action as at first, merely re-

quiring to be refilled with water from time to time as it evaporates.

This was the only arrangement of the voltaic battery by which he was then en-

abled to exalt the effects of tension so as to obtain the electrical spark before contact

of the terminals ; although with the assistance of an exceedingly delicate gold-leaf

electroscope, he at that time elicited distinct signs of tension in a single cell of Grove's

nitric acid battery, and subsequently in one of copper and zinc charged with sul-

phuric acid. But in all the different series of experiments described in the paper

referred to, he invariably found that the higher the chemical affinities of the elements,

the greater was the development of the effects of tension. For instance, to produce

a certain extent of tension with the gas battery of Grove when charged with oxygen

and hydrogen, ten or twelve pairs of cells  were  required                                  with hydrogen and  chlo-
                                                                                         ;

element, two pairs ; and while it took sixteen cells of the water battery to produce a
given effect on the electroscope, ten of the same cells when charged with dilute acid
produced the same effect in the same instrument.

The static effects of a voltaic battery are very feebly developed, except when the

battery is insulated, and the difficulties of insulation in an extended series are at all
times great. In the battery excited by acid solutions these difficulties are much in-

creased, in consequence of the conducting power of the liquids ; still they are not

author determined on constructing one, in which the effects of tension

should be heightened to the extent of exhibiting the spark before the
circuit was completed, which he hoped to accomplish without being

compelled to extend the series to any extraordinary number, as he had

done in the water battery previously described.

For this purpose he had 100 glass cells constructed three inches deep,

with stems seven inches long ; the zinc of each series was attached to

a slip of platinum foil ; each cell was carefully charged in the usual

manner (but only half-full), with strong nitric and dilute sulphuric

acid, and great care was taken that the outside of each cell with the
stem was perfectly dry. To the terminals of this battery were attached

the copper plates of the micrometer electrometer described in a former

paper (Phil. Trans. 1840). On approximating the plates of this in-

strument to about Twoth of an inch, a series of minute sparks took

place, and in a few seconds the usual voltaic arc was produced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              this arc
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

could then be elongated to the extent of half an inch, in consequence of

the particles of the copper having passed between the plates.

If, in lieu of the copper plates, pieces of charcoal be similarly ap-

proximated to 3^ooths of an inch, the arc is at once produced, instead

of the sparks as from the discs ; the loose particles of the carbon being

more easily detached by the force of tension, and consequently at once

producing the arc.

The author believes that this is the first instance in which a true spark

has been obtained from so small a series of the voltaic battery.

       On the Decomposition of Water into its constituent Gases by Heat.
                               Brj W. R. Grove, F.It.S.

    Mr. Grove called attention in the first place to the fact, proved by Cavendish
and the French philosophers, that oxygen and hydrogen being exposed to a high

temperature the electric spark immediately combined to form water. He stated his
belief that the explosion of the mixed gases by the electric spark was due only to the
heat of the spark, and not to any specific electrical effect. He then announced his
discovery that similar processes to those by which water may be formed are capable

of decomposing water. Priestley's method for decomposing gases by passing them
through heated tubes was described, and the advantages of using a form of eudio-
meter devised by Mr. Grove, in which an incandescent platina wire was employed
to effect combination and decomposition, were pointed out. By an apparatus of this

kind, ammonia, camphor, the protoxide and peroxide of nitrogen were readily de-

composed. It was stated that hydrogen gas exposed to the ignited wire always
showed the presence of oxygen, and that it is impossible to pass hydrogen gas
through water without its taking up so much oxygen as to acquire the power of

giving luminosity to phosphorus in the dark.
    It was found that if equal volumes of hydrogen and carbonic acid were exposed to

the action of the ignited wire, there was a contraction to one volume, leaving a resi-
due of carbonic oxide. If carbonic oxide alone was exposed to the wire over water,
the gas expanded in volume, and the carbonic oxide, taking oxygen from the water,
was converted into carbonic acid. Here we have two dissimilar results produced by
the same cause. By means of hydrogen we take oxygen from carbonic acid, leaving
carbonic oxide ; and by means of carbonic oxide we take oxygen from water, leaving
hydrogen. If steam is formed in the eudiometric tube and acted on by the ignited

wire, on cooling a small bubble of gas is formed, -which is found to be mixed oxj'gen
and hydrogen in the proportions in which they form water. This is the result of the
first action of the heated wire : in a few seconds a small bubble of gas is formed ;

but if the action be indefinitely continued, the gas does not increase in quantity.
It is however easy to remove the bubble after it is formed, and bring a fresh supply
of steam under the influence of the heated wire, and thus to collect a sufficient

quantity of gas for an eudiometric examination.
   Numerous forms of apparatus were described by which this result can be ob-

tained. It might be objected that, as the wire was ignited by a voltaic battery, the
decomposition was not due to the heat of the wire, but to an electric action. This
objection would not indeed be maintained by those who were well acquainted with
electrical phaenomena. With the view, however, of removing all doubt, the use of
the battery was entirely done away with, and all the results obtained by the agency
of heat alone, in the following manner :

    Into a silver tube a narrow tube of platina is soldered ; and this is again connected
with a bent tube which admits of the removal of any gas formed. The tubes being
filled with distilled water, and the open extremity immersed in a vessel of water, the
flame of an oxyhydrogen blowpipe is made to act upon the narrow tube of platina,
by which this is brought to a white heat. The water is of course instantly con-
verted into steam, and this steam is decomposed by the agency of the heat alone.

By apparent boiling, we thus convert steam into mixed oxygen and hydrogen gases
and this operation may be continued for any length of time by bringing a fresh

supply of steam under the influence of the ignited platina. If a fused or intensely-
heated globule of platina is plunged into water, bubbles of oxyhydrogen gas imme-

diately ascend from it, which may be collected in an inverted tube.
    Prof. Grove went on to show the probable connexion between this phsenomenon

of decomposition, and the spheroidal state of fluids when projected on capsules of
heated platina ; this had been referred to a repulsive action of a coating of steam
enveloping the spheroid of fluid ; but in all probability the spheroidal drop was
made to assume a state of tension approaching decomposition by the agency of the
heat to which it was exposed. He also entered into several considerations suggested
by the above facts as to the relation of heat to chemical affinity, as well as their

geological bearings and possible practical applications.

 Notice of a Gas Furnacefor Organic Analysis, By John Percy, M.D.

   In this arrangement, gas burnt, mixed with air through wire-gauze, is substituted
for charcoal. The advantages are its extreme cleanliness, and the power which the
operator possesses of regulating at will the heat, which is not practicable in the or-
dinary furnace for organic analysis with charcoal.

      Extraordinary appearance in the Flame of a common mould candle.

                             By E. R. J. Knowles.

   The writer's attention was suddenly attracted by the light of the candle flitting,
as though a moth had flown into the flame, when to his surprise instead of an insect
struggling he saw a bright spot revolving with great rapidity in the flame ; on exa-
mining it, the bright spot was found to be the end of a very fine filament attached to
the side of the wick about half-way up the ignited part, and thus held to it, while
the extremity with the bright spot of light revolved in a circle like a " Catherine

--wheel," the circle described being about ^th or -fVths of an inch in diameter. It

moved with a velocity of about three or four revolutions in a second, and ceased
revolving in about three seconds. As stated, when it commenced it was a very small
luminous point, and it increased visibly in size as it revolved, becoming eventually a

ball or aggregation of carbon, suspended by a single thread like a very fine hair.

   On the Origin of the Coal of Silesia. By Professor Goppert of Breslau.
            Communicated by Sir R. L Murchison, G.C.iSt.S., J^.Ii,S.

The Societj' of Sciences of Holland at Haarlem, proposed in the year 1844, the

 following prize questions :

     1st. To point out by accurate investigation of the different coal-measures, whe-
 ther the beds of coal derived their origin solely from the vegetables which once lived

 upon their present locality, or whether they originated from plants which had been

 floated thither from other places.
    2nd. To inquire whether different coal layers have had a different origin.

    At the session of that Society of the 23rd of May, 1846, a paper sent in by me
 was honoured with both prizes : the suggester of the questions. Professor Von Breda,

 received a silver medal.

    Regretting very much that I am unable to attend the present meeting of the
 British Association, I beg to submit to the Society's indulgent criticism some ex-

 tracts from the before-mentioned paper, the materials for which were derived from

the coal formations of Silesia. I am now about to extend this inquiry, at the re-

 quest of the Prussian authorities, to the other coal strata situated in the Rhenish

 provinces of Westphalia.
    Geologists had rarely found in former years any well-preserved plants in the coal

 itself, and had inferred its composition from the plants that lie in the shale,

&c. associated with the coal : my observations in Upper and Lower Silesia prove

the correctness of this inference, as I have met with extended coal layers in

which the plants (Sigillaria, Stigmaria, Calamites, Lepidodendra, Niiggeratlda) are
still so well preserved that we can distinguish with the naked eye the individual spe-
cies. These' stems, or more properly their barks, lie pressed flat one upon the other,
commonly without the inner parenchyma (yet sometimes the latter is preserved
and converted into coal), in such a manner that we are able still to recognise, under
the microscope, the cells of the parench}'ma. Besides this, the so-called mineral
charcoal, or fibrous anthracite, does not occur here in single little fragments as it
is found elsewhere in the coal, but in broad compressed stems a foot long, which
offer the structure of the Araucaria; of our present period (Arancarites carbonarius,

mihi)
    According to the predominance of one or the other genus of plants, I distinguish

at many places in Upper Silesia, coal of Sigillaria, Araucarian coal, and Lepido-
dendron coal, of which the last is far the rarest.

   In consequence of these observations I can now give a very simple explanation
of the way in which coal has been formed. The Sigillariae (Stigmaria), Lepido-
dendrese, Calamitese, containing a softer parenchyme, soon began to be decomposed
and disaggregated ; but when this process of decomposition was terminated, by early
depositions covering the vegetable mass, and the formation of coal was rendered
possible, the Araucarije, which were much harder, and therefore not equally ad-
vanced in decomposition, were introduced into the mass in longer fragments, in
which the ligneous structure, viz. the parenchymatous wood, cells and medullary
rays, are still clearly discernible even under a simple lens. By a more detailed re-
search into the situations which are occupied by all the species of plants detected in the
coal itself (which species amount to eighty in number), compared with those plants
which occur in the slate-clays and sandstonesof the Silesian coal-pits (which produce
about four millions of tons a-year), certain positive relations, or modes of distribu-
tion, became apparent, such as could not be overlooked. I observed a separation

into groups, or the consociated occurrence of certain species ; the failing of one
species and the substitution of another of the same genus in one and the same coal
stratum ; and also a different condition of the vegetables in the strata superimposed

one on another.
   Besides this, the mode of preservation of the fossil plants (ferns with flexible but

browned leaflets, &c.), the uniform continuity of many strata with the same thick-
ness over a space of many German miles, the multitude of upright stems, of which
as many as 200 have already been observed, with other conditions not noticed here,

are proofs of tranquil deposition over the present localities.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  51

   On the other hand, calculation shows, that to form such thick strata of coal as

 occur in our country (to the thickness of from thirtj' to sixty feet), the plants which
could grow upon the same area, even in their most luxuriant condition, would never
have sufficed. I therefore cannot but suppose that a large part of our layers of
coal have been formed after the manner of our peat moors, during a long course
of time ; and certainly in the humid way, as I have formerly attempted to show,
and as I have more recently exemplified satisfactorily by experiments. If, for in-
stance, we keep vegetables in boiling water for a long time (for three months to a
year), they are converted into brown coal (lignite), and they acquire at last a totally
black coal-like condition, if we add a small quantity of sulphate of iron, in the
proportion of half a drachm to six ounces of plants ; no one will doubt that this
salt, which occurs so commonly in coal, has largely cooperated in the formation of

the mineral.

   I may state that many sphserosiderites of the coal have been produced just as
our marsh iron ores (Limonite, Rasenerz) now are.

              On Sea Water, and the Effects of Variation in its Currents.
                          By Prof. FoRCHHAMMER of Copenhagen.

     The author, referring to a chemical examination of sea water in different latitudes
 and currents, tried to show the influence which a change in oceanic currents might
 have had upon the climate of the North of Europe. The inquiries of Prof. Steenstrup
 and Loven respecting the changes in the forest- trees and marine animals indicated a
 slow increase of the mean temperature of Northern Europe. To account for this. Dr.
 Forchhammer supposed the British Channel to have been closed, and a polar current to
 have passed' over the lower parts of Northern Russia into the BothnianGulf, and thence
 into the German Ocean. The separation of England from France was supposed to
 have taken place in recent times ; and without quoting the zoological evidence col-

--lected by British naturalists, he would refer to physical features, such as the va-

 rious changes which the Rhine and the Scheldt suffer at their mouths, and which even
 the smallest rivulet on the western shore of the Cimbrian Peninsula undergoes.

--These rivers turn their mouths towards that side from which the tide comes, one ha-

ving, in historical times, changed its mouth more than thirty miles to the south. The
mouth of the Rhine has been known for about 2000 years ; and since the time of
the Romans, when it flowed straight towards the north, where at present the Zuy-
der Zee is, it heis been seen constantly turning towards the west. From this change,
he inferi"ed a change in the direction of the tide, which he supposes to have arrived
formerly at the coast of Holland from the north, instead of from the west, as at pre-
sent. The marshes on the southern and eastern sides of the German Ocean become
broader in proportion as they approach the mouth of the present channel ; a circum-
stance the very reverse of what might have been expected under present circum-
stances, since the clay is never deposited when there is any considerable motion in
the water. On the contrary, if the Channel were shut up, then the present locality
of the marshes would be that best adapted for their formation : from which he infers
that the principal marshes were formed before the opening of the Channel. The
earliest accounts of the Channel date from the fourth century b.c, and at the time
of Alexander the Great we find that news of a very great inundation in the north-

em countries (the Cimbrian flood) had reached Greece ; and a tradition still ex-
isting in Jutland connects such a flood with the opening of the Channel. Abng

all the western part of the Cimbrian Peninsula occurs a bed of pebbles, and in some
places occur rolled pieces of the clay of the marshes, which must be ascribed to an
inundation washing away the lighter materials. This inundation the author regards
as that of which both history and tradition speak ; and he thinks it was occasioned
by the first opening of the Channel. These changes were in close connexion with a
depression of the greater part of Northern and Western Europe ; which is indicated
along the coasts of Denmark and England by submerged forests and peat-mosses.
On the shore of the dukedom of Sieswig a tumulus has been found in a submerged
forest ; it contained knives of flint, and shows that the subsidence took place after
the country- was inhabited. The continuous elevation of the North of Europe would
lead to this result,-^that the White Sea would flow over the lower parts of Russia

                                                                         e2

and Finland, bringing cold water and masses of ice into the German Ocean, which
being at that epoch a bay receiving waters also which had flowed round the northern
coast of Scotland, must have been materially influenced in its climate, so as to have
been colder than it is now.

On the Fislies of the London Clay. By M. Agassiz.

The Professor stated that since his last report the number of species known from

the Paris basin increased ; whilst few new forms had been obtained in the London

clay. He had however been interested in the examination of specimens of the teeth

of the saw-fish (Pristis) ; and had noticed some curious changes which they under-

went during the growth of the animal. The young teeth were covered with enamel,

and had a notch in their posterior margin ; whilst in old tusks the bony material

alone existed and the margin was entire. On these grounds he considered the

three species of Pristis described by Shaw (P. semi-sagittatus, microdon and ciispi-

datus) as constituting in reality only one. Widely as these teeth differed in appear-

ance from the flat, pavement-like teeth of the Sting-rays {Myliohatis) , their micro-

scopic structure was identical ; and Prof. Miiller of Berlin had lately shown that

the Pristis was not a shark, but belonged to the family of Rays. The Professor

then pointed out a peculiarity in the construction of the ventral fins of the Medi-

terranean Goby, a fish which fixes itself to the bottom by its fins ; that act also like

springs in enabling the fish to rise from the bottom. He expected soon to be able

not only to discriminate every individual bone of any importance in the skeleton of
a fish, but also to distinguish the separate fin rays. M. Agassiz then made some

general remarks on the geographical distribution of recent fishes. There were many

-- --families of which the flying-fish (Exoccetus) was an example which were found

equally in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Others, like the Sharks and

Rays, were found in every sea from the Arctic circle to the tropics, but the species

differed on each coast ; whilst some families were confined to the Indian seas, and

co-extensive only with the great land animals of that region. The Goniodontes

were peculiar to the freshwaters of South America ; but these were connected with

the Ganoides of North America ; and these again closely allied to the Sturgeon, whose

We Newaffinities have hitherto been little understood.
                   have here, confined to the

World, all the representatives of an order widely dispersed over the ancient strata.

Looking at the distribution of a particular species, like the Silurus, confined to the

Danube, Rhine, and a few other freshwaters of Europe, it might be asked by what

means it had wandered from one locality to another ; to which he would reply that

these freshwater fish must have been created in the very streams in which they now

live, and in the same proportion as now. They leave the egg in so short a time, that

it was quite impossible they should be transported by birds or otherwise. The fishes

in the Paris basin appeared to have lived on a coral reef or rocky bottom, whilst

those of the London clay were such as in existing seas are found in shallow seas

and muddy waters.

                On th? Artesian Well on the Southampton Common.
                                 By J. R. Keele, M.R.C.I.

   It will be seen on reference to the map that Southampton is situated about the

middle of a tertiary basin, and in its geological position is not very different from
London or Paris. Tlie supply of water hitherto obtained has chiefly been from
private wells : almost every house in the town of any pretension as to size or value
has one, varying in depth from 10 to 25 feet. It is not known that any well
in the town exceeds that depth, since beyond that point, in most parts df the
town, we enter the bed of London clay, which lies under the whole district. There
is also a fluctuating supply obtained from the Common, about a mile-and-a-half

or two miles from the town. The extent of the Common is about 360 acres, and

its elevation varies from 100 to 200 feet above the sea-level of the town; the

quantity of water got from this quarter has been gained by intersecting the Common

in various directions by drains of varying depth from 10 to 20 feet : the water
thus collected flows into three reservoirs, from whence it is conveyed into the town

by iron pipes. This supply is variable according to the season ; in the winter
            TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  33

there is abundance ; and in the spring it affords 19,000 or 20,000 cubic feet per diem :
in the summer it has fallen as low as 3600, as in September last. Under these

circumstances it became necessary to seek for a larger supply. The town is situ-

ated on a tongue of land with the rivers Itchen and Test on each side discharging

their waters into the estuary called the Southampton Water. The inhabitants

would gladly have availed themselves of a supply from the waters of the Itchen,

but the late owner of that part of the river which would have been most suitable

for this purpose would not grant the supply but upon terms that were unsatis-

factoiy to the rate-payers. This mode of supply was therefore abandoned ; and the
greater distance of the River Test being an objection on account of the expense it

would have entailed upon them, it was also given up ; the commissioners were thus
thrown back upon their own resources, and determined to ascertain the practicabi-

lity of forming an Artesian Well. For this purpose an experimental boring was

made on the Common, as a preliminary step, in Nov. 1835, and was continued till
the chalk formation was reached, in January 1836, at the depth of 480 feet.

In this experiment the diluvial gravel and sand, and upper tertiary strata, over-

lying the London clay were found to be about 80 feet in thickness, the bed of London

clay about 300 feet, and the plastic dfay, resting on the chalk, another 100 feet ; the
boring was continued 50 feet further, when it having been reported that an ample

supply of water was to be found at that depth, an act of parliament was soon after

obtained for providing the means necessary ; and a plan having been fixed on, the           ^,J. ^
undertaking commenced by sinking an iron shield made in segments, which, bolted
                                                                                            ^..-╖-^
together, formed as a whole a cylinder of 13 feet in diameter ; this shield the con-
tractor purposed sinking to the depth of 160 feet, and from that point to bore to              C\~^

the depth of 400 feet, commencing with a hole of 30 inches, diminishing gradually,

and ending with one of 20 inches in the chalk formation.

  The work began in July 1838. Two steam-engines were provided, each of

twenty-horses power. The estimate and contract for the performance of the work

was 10,180Z., for which the contractor undertook to supply from the well 40,000

cubic feet of water per diem, and provided four gentlemen as securities for the due

performance of the work. A spot of land, near where the experimental boring had

been made, was chosen for the purpose, being about 150 feet above the sea-level of

the town.

Soon after the comraencment of the work a failure took place : in sinking the

iron shield, or cylinder, more difficulty was found than had been anticipated.

Upon arriving at the depth of 60 feet it began to show alarming signs of weak-

ness and unfitness for supporting the enormous pressure it had to sustain ; it
had, besides this, taken an oblique, instead of a vertical direction. The contractor

was therefore obliged to suspend his proceedings, and have recourse to other means

of sustaining the pressure on the cylinder by additional supports framed within it of

timber, and in this way preventing any sudden disruption by which the lives of the
men employed on the work might have been sacrificed. At this period the under-

taking was given up by the contractor, and the four gentlemen who had been

accepted as his securities were compelled to go on with the work. They began

by repairing the shield, which had been broken in several places, and having ren-

dered it secure, with great labour and expense, a cylinder of smaller dimensions was

framed within the old one, of 9 feet 10 inches in diameter, formed by eight tiers of

plates, or sections, each 5 feet in depth, and|^ths of an inch in thickness, of cast iron.

The old cylinder being first supported by strong chains, the new one was forced

down through the sand by hea\'y pressure till it was lowered to a sufficient depth,

and rendered secure by resting on a dome of brickwork, built under it by under-

pinning, in sections of 3 feet at a time, gradually increasing in diameter till the

original diameter of tfie shaft was again attained. The shaft was then carried
down in solid 14 inch brickwork, set in Roman cement. At the depth of 85 feet

they passed through a solid mass of very hard stone full of black water-worn

pebbles, and loaded with shells of various kinds, characteristic of the London clay.
On the 1st of February 1840, the shaft was complete to the depth of 100 feet ; the
quantity of water which now iiowed into the well was kept under by tv?o pumps,

and estimated at about 4000 cubic feet per diem. April 2, 160 feet of the shaft was

Acomplete.  question now arose as to future proceedings : the original plan was

at the depth of 560 feet. The undertakers now proposed to continue the work by a
shaft of 7 feet in diameter, carried the whole way into the chalk, instead of boring
as originally intended. The commissioners acceded to this alteration, and agreed
to share the additional expense, provided the contractors would have a shaft of larger
dimensions than 7 feet. The contractors having agreed to this proposal, it was
continued onward with a shaft diminished in diameter from 14 feet to 1 1 feet 6 inches.
At this period of the work the candles could hardly be kept lighted in the well, and
 they were obliged to have an air-tube constructed of zinc, with a pair of bellows
 attached, worked by the steam-engine, for the purpose of ventilating the well.

    The work was frequently impeded by large masses of stone, full of shells
and rounded pebbles, which had to be raised out of the shaft ; and it was observed
at this time, on looking upwards from the bottom, that the shaft was filled with a
dense vapour like fog or steam, and it was thought that if the bellows and air-tube
had not been employed it would have been impossible to have proceeded with the
work.

    Some of the beds of stone occupied a space of 6 feet in depth, particularly one
from 174 to 180 feet in the well. The work however still proceeded, and on the
 10th of September the shaft was 214 feet. It was then reduced to 10 feet in
diameter. By October Slat 270 feet of the shaft was complete, and then reduced

 to 8 feet 6 inches.
    It was the custom of the excavators at this time to bore onwards several feet

before they began another section ; by this means water was found at the depth of
 312 feet in considerable quantity, in a bed of sand, which obliged them to discon-
tinue the shaft in brickwork and employ iron cylinders : by this means the influx
 of water was got over, and the work advanced slowly till it had attained the depth
of 322 feet. The soil having again become more solid, the shaft was again resumed
 in brickwork of 7 feet in diameter. At this depth the quantity of water raised by
the pumps amounted to 30,240 gallons in twenty-four hours. There appears to
have been no peculiar difficulty in proceeding with the shaft from this period.

    On the 14th of August, 1841, a change of colour was perceived in the soil, and

 it was found they had arrived at the surface of the plastic clay, being 380 feet from
 the top of the well. The whole bed of plastic clay was then passed through with
 no other difficulties than those which took place from accidents to the machinery :
 very little sand and no water was found in that formation.

    The shaft was continued onward in brickwork of 7 feet diameter till the chalk
was reached, on the 8th of November. The workmen were then employed in
finishing the brick shaft, which was carried down to the solid chalk, and rested 3
 feet below its surface. The excavation was then continued onward, of the same
 diameter, without brickwork, and the chalk kept fair with the inside face of the shaft.

 On the 4th of December they had attained the depth of 520 feet, the work having
 been carried on day and night. The quantity of water which now flowed into the

 well from the chalk was ascertained to be about 3 gallons a minute.
    The temperature of the water was now taken at the bottom of the well and found

 to range between 61░ and 62░ of Fahrenheit; the temperature of water at the sur-
 face was 44░ ; the atmosphere of the well at 50 feet, was 54░; at 160 feet it was 60░
 at 543 feet it was 65".

    On the 22nd of December an accident happened to the machinery, and the work
was suspended to the 3rd of January, 1842 : the shaft was now 550 feet deep.

    On Friday, March 4, it was again measured, and found to be 5622 feet below

 the surface of the earth. At this period, the pumping having been discontinued one
 week, the water rose 400 feet in the shaft, which amounted in quantity to 21,578
cubic feet. The well was now of the depth required, but the quantity of water was
 not sufficient for the full performance of the contract.

    The town being in great want of water, public meetings were held, and great
 complaints of the scarcity were continually heard.

    The contractors finding they had been deceived by the report that an abundant
 supply of water was to be obtained from a depth much less tlian that to which they
 had carried the work, thought it best that the shaft should be carried on still further.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  55

   as being the best mode of obtaining the quantity of water required. They there-
   fore made a proposal of this kind to the commissioners, which, if adopted, would in
   all probability have been successful in obtaining the quantity of water required, or
   have led to the plan of making lateral galleries or drift ways in the chalk, and fol-
   lowing up any indications of water which might have been found, as was afterwards
   suggested by Dr. Buckland. The commissioners, however, would not accede to the
   proposed continuation of the shaft, and upon their refusal the contractors determined
  to carry it no further, but commence boring. They therefore purchased the im-
  plements necessary, at the cost of 1000?. ; and the work was carried on from a stage
  fixed about 40 feet below the surface of the well, from whence the boring-rod was
  conducted to the bottom of the shaft by means of an iron tube fixed in the centre of
  the well. By this means the operation of boring was carried on through the column
  of water, and the enormous expense which they had hitherto sustained of pump-
  ing day and night was saved. The commissioners seem not to have been prepared

 --for this expedient expecting, perhaps, that the inhabitants would continue to re-

  ceive the overflow of the well while the work was in progress as they had hitherto
  done, free of expense ; finding, however, this was not to be the case, and a scarcity
  of water being severely felt during every summer, they were obliged to come to terms
  with the contractors for a supply of water from the well.

     In the meantime the operation of boring, which commenced in March 1842, was
  carried on with the greatest, labour and perseverance to March 1844, with a 7iinch
  auger, and other tools necessary for breaking up flints, &c. The progress of the
 work during this long period was at times very slow, from the numerous difiiculties
 and impediments encountered. It would be occupying too much time to relate all
 the misfortunes they met with from the breaking of their boring-rods and other ma-
 chinery, which appear to have been quite as many and as difiicult to overcome as those
  encountered by the fortunate and skilful constructors of that unrivalled work at
 Crenelle, of which the French nation may well be proud. It will be sufficient
 to say that all have been surmounted by the skill and ingenuity of Mr. Docura
 and Mr. Joseph Hill, under whose management the boring was conducted, and
 carried to the depth of 1260 feet. After the commencement and during the con-
 tinuance of this operation, the quantity of water was found to increase progressively,
 gradually rising in the shaft to much higher levels ; and at the time the boring was
 suspended in 1844 the water rose to within 40 feet of the surface, where it reached

  the boring stage*.

     Previous to the commencement of the boring in 1842, 600,000 gallons of water
 per month were raised from the well to supply the inhabitants when the scarcity
 of water became very pressing. In 1844, after having made considerable progress

 in the boring, the contractors entered into a further agreement to raise from the
 shaft 1,200,000 gallons per month. In 1845, during upwards of four months'
 daily pumping, the delivery of water was at the rate of upwards of 1,500,000 gal-
 lons per month. Alterations were then made in the machinery for pumping,

 which enabled the contractors to raise the water from a much greater depth in the

 shaft, and the result was, that on a trial of eight successive days, the quantity of
 water raised exceeded 725,000 gallons, being at a rate of upwards of 2,500,000 gallons

per month. When the pumping was stopped in November 1845, it was found that

 the water rose rapidly to its' former level, viz. 40 feet from the surface, at the fol-

--lowing rate : at 120 feet from the surface, the water rose 2 feet per hour ; at 130

 feet, 2 feet 4 inches ; at 140 feet, 2 feet 7 inches ; at 150 feet, 2 feet 10 inches.
     In measuring the capacity of the shaft at these depths, it will be found that at

 120 feet the water flows into the well at the rate of 277 cubic feet per hour ; at
 130 feet, at the rate of 310 cubic feet per hour; at 140 feet, at the rate of 343 cubic
feet per hour ; at 150 feet, at the rate of 376 cubic feet per hour ; and so on, in-

creasing 33 feet every 10 feet in descending the well.

 --* Memoranda recorded by Mr. Joseph Hill. Previous to boring, the water-level in the

well was 57 feet from the surface ; since the boring the water has risen to 40 feet, being an in-

crease of 17 feet in the water-level of the well. On the 27th of July, 1845, after the pumping

--was suspended, the water was found to have risen 68 feet in tliirty-eight hours. 1846. On

the 28th of August, the pumping having been stopped at the depth of 306 feet, in 13 hours

the water rose in the well to 225 feet, being 81 feet during that space of time.

   The quantity of water which the shaft will contain below the present water level

is as follows :

120 feet at 13 feet inches diameter    15,927 cubic feet.
 50 feet at 11 feet 6 inches diameter    5193 cubic feet.
 50 feet at 10 feet inches diameter      3927 cubic feet.
 50 feet at 8 feet 6 inches diameter     2837 cubic feet.

250 feet at 7 feet inches diameter

   In conclusion, the question we have now to settle is, whether it is better to be

content with the well in its present condition, or continue the boring, for the chance
of obtaining a larger and less expensive supply from the greensand formation.
The example of our neighbours on the other side of the channel certainly affords us

much encouragement to proceed with the work ; but we have not sufficient confi-
dence in our own opinions to venture on such a step without the advice of those
whose scientific knowledge and better judgement we are most anxious to obtain.

On the ApplicahUity of M. Fauvelle's Mode of Boring Artesian Wells to the

    Well at Southampton, and to other Wells, and to Sinkings for Coal, Salt and

  other Mineral Beds. By the Very Rev. W. Buckland, D.D., Dean of

    Westminster, F.R.S.

  Dr. Buckland recommended that the boring on Southampton Common should be
continued by M. Fauvelle's method. He stated that there was probability of ob-

taining a more abundant supply of water by going deeper into the chalk ; but that
it would rise no higher in the shaft than the level of the nearest outlet at Otter-
bourne, where the water of the chalk makes its escape. From the observations of
Mr. Clutterbuck, it appeared that the water stands gradually higher in the wells
on the line of railroad between Southampton and Basingstoke, at the rate of about

a foot higher for every mile.
   The water in the greensand beds next below the chalk was derived from rain that

falls in districts where these sandy strata form the surface of the country; the nearest
of these surfaces being in the axis of the Isle of Wight, and in the Vale of Peters-
field, and the Vale of Pusey. From these three districts (unless where cut ofi^ by a
fault) there was probably a subterraneous passage for water through the interstices
of the upper greensand beds, beneath the whole of the Hampshire basin, this water
being upheld by subjacent impervious beds of gaulf clay. The height to which this
water could rise through a hole bored in the chalk, would depend on the levels at
which the springs from the greensand nearest to Southampton find their issue.
These levels should be ascertained, especially near Petersfield.

On the occurrence of Cypris in a part of the Tertiary Freshivater Strata of
         the Isle of Wight. By Joseph Prestwich, Jun., F.G.S.

   Although a species of this small crustacean abounds in the terti ary lacustrine de-

posits of Auvergne, and is not uncommon in theupperbedsof the Paris basin, whilst
lower in its strata Pi'I. D'Archiac quotes a new species in the ' Gres de Beauchamp,'
and the Cypris punctata from the plastic clay or lignite group, yet it is extremely rare
in the English tertiary series. In the London basin I believe that no freshwater form
of it has been found ; one species of the marine form, the Cytherina, has been met
with at Highgate. In the Hampshire basin, mention is made by Mr. Lyell, in the
third volume of the Transactions of the Geological Society, of the rare occurrence of
an undescribed, and, I think, a tuberculated s])ecies in the freshwater strata at Hordwell
Cliff. In the fine sections of Alum Bay, Headon Hill, and White Cliff Bay, in the Isle
of Wight, amongst the other abundant organic remains, I never detected any fossil
Cyprides. Having lately had an opportunity of making a hasty visit to Hampstead
Cliff, about 1 i mile east of Yarmouth, I there found a species of Cypris in considerable
abundance. The cliff being composed chiefly of beds of clay and marl, forms a sur-
face easily acted on by the weather, and presents innumerable slips and prolonged

In fact, at present only two or three small openings, where the succession and order
of the strata are clearly exhibited, occur. The best one is near the brow of the cliflF

   This appears to repose on red and green marls, with few or no fossils, and at the
bottom of the cliff a thin band of ironstone full of Paludina lenta crops out.

  We thus have in the lower part of this section a deposit containing essentially

freshwater Testacea, becoming more mixed as we ascend, with shells frequenting
sestuaries. Impressions of plants are not uncommon, and seed vessels (of the same

species as those at Tolland's Bay) are found in abundance in stratum Jc.
   It is a singular feature in this group, which I believe to form the upper beds of the

freshwater formation of the Isle of Wight, that a large proportion of the species
occurring in it are new ; thus the two characteristic fossils are a species of the Po-
tamides and one of Melania, neither of which do I find described. The Cypris also

fis peculiar to this locality. It is distinctly different from the Cypris aba, neither is

it tuberculated. Some very small vertebrae and bones are far from rare. Professor
Sedgwick, as far back as 1818, described in the ' Annals of Philosophy' the peculiar
mixed freshwater and aestuary character of the strata in this locality. Since then
they have not been much noticed. I hope that they will now be more closely ex-
amined, for I have little doubt but that, from the peculiarity of conditions, they
will yield an interesting series of organic remains. I have merely time to point
them out.
--58 REPORT 1846.

   In a note in the last number of the ' Journal of the Geological Society,' I alluded
to the discovery by Mr. Pratt of impressions of plants in a stratum which I believed
to correspond with No. 17 in the Alum Bay section. This I can now confirm, and
testify to their great abundance and beautiful state of preservation, but from their
light colour (being nearly that of the clay) they were long overlooked.

   With regard to Headon Hill, I regretted to find its cliffs so fallen down and its
fine sections comparatively so obscure ; still the interpolated marine beds, Nos. 56 to
60, can easily be traced at intervals. The fossils of these beds can now be best pro-
cured at the eastern extremity of the hill. At Colwell Bay however the section
continues extremely well exposed and full of interest.

 On the Arrangement and Nomenclature of some of the Suhcretaceous Strata.
                            By W. H. FxTTON, M.D., F.R.S.

    This communication included a summary of the latest inquiries on the strata im-
 mediately beneath the chalk in England ; with a table of the fossils (connected with
 a paper previously read before the Geological Society of London), from a new col-
 lection made by the author in the cliffs near Atherfield, in the Isle of Wight, from
 the gault down to the Weald clay. The specimens were named by Mr. Morris, and
 compared with the series in the Geological Society's Museum catalogued by Professor
 Edward Forbes. This tabulated arrangement exhibits about 150 species, in their
 true places ; so that numerous results can be obtained from it, respecting their re-
 lative positions and distribution in the series of strata. 1. The accumulation of
 species in the lower part of the section is very remarkable ; about 130 of the total
 number originating within 150 feet from the bottom, while not more than twenty

 other species originate in the remaining portion ; the thickness of the entire section
 being 800 feet. The absolute numbers also of shells diminishes rapidly upwards, and
 in the strata near the top of the section in this part of the Isle of Wight, even in-
 dications of fossils are rare ; though near Shanklin, and near Folkstone in Kent, the
 fossils of the corresponding beds are more numerous and distinct. 2. These and

--other facts indicate the existence of only one series of fossils, throughout a period of

 continuous but unequal deposition, the gault, with its peculiar and characteristic

--fossils, being immediately above, a result which perfectly accords with the view

 taken by Professor Forbes, in a paper published by himself and Captain Ibbetson,
 in the 'Geological Journal' (vol. i.). 3. The upper and less fossiliferous portion of
 the section here, is distinguished, if not separated, from the lower beds by the pre-
 sence of a very remarkable group of ferruginous concretional bands, which occurs in
ia corresponding place, at Horse-ledge, west of Shanklin Chine ; at Parham Park, in
 Sussex ; and at Sandgate, in Kent : including in all those places the same fossils,
 Thetis, Gervillia, Trigonia, Rostellaria, &c. 4. From the general mode of distribution
 of the species, as above described, and the great variation in the components and
 proportion of the beds which form the sections of the lower greensand in different

places, it may be inferred that subdivisions, founded on the occurrence, or grouping

 of the species, cannot be expected to be either generally prevalent or very precise.
5. The remarkable deposit of Neufchatel {Terrain Ne'ocomien) appears to be the
equivalent of the lower part only of the section near Atherfield, the upper divisions
being wanting at the former place. In most of the published sections of the sub-
cretaceous groups in France and other places, an upper division or series of strata,
like this of the English coast, is likewise found, under the names of sables verts, sable
ferruyineux, jaune, &c. The Atherfield section, therefore, includes the Terrain N^o-
comien, with the addition of the group last mentioned, which at Blackgang Chine is
not less than 250 feet in thickness.

Captain Ibbetson and Prof. Forbes exhibited models and sections of various parts

of the Isle of Wight, and pointed out the localities and geological features most in-

teresting to visitors.  ________

On certain Deviations of the Plumb-line from its Mean Direction, as observed
   in the neighbourhood of Shanklin Down, in the Isle of Wight, during the
  progress of the Ordnance Survey. By W. Hopkins, F.R.S.

   The difference of latitude between Greenwich and the station of the Ordnance sur-
vej'ors at Dunnose, on the north side of Shanklin Down, as determined by triangu-
lation, was greater by 2'22 seconds than as determined by zenith sector observations.
When, however, a new station was chosen on the south side of Shanklin Down, the
difference of latitude, as determined by triangulation, was less by 3"09 seconds than
it appeared to be when determined by the zenith sector. These discrepancies would

be accounted for, if the mass intervening between the stations at Shanklin Down

were sufficient to produce, by its attraction on the plumb-line, the observed devia-
tions. The requisite calculations for proving the adequacy of this cause had not
been made ; the tendency, however, would necessarily be to produce effects of the
same nature as those observed; and the author thought it probable that the intensity
of the attraction of the hill would be found sufficient to account for the phaeno-

On Railway Sections made on the Line of the Great Western Railway, between

                 Bristol and Taunton. By W. Sanders, F.G.S.

The general section is made to the scale of 33 inches to the mile, or 1 to 1920;

extending over a length of 45 miles. The colours are those of the Ordnance Survey.

   In four places the sections are enlarged fourfold, or 40 feet to the inch ; and full
details are given on the scale of 4 feet to the inch. The colours of the Ordnance

Survey are taken as a basis, and others are introduced to describe local facts. The

railway passes first through the junction beds of red marl and lias ; then for six
or seven miles through new red sandstone, interrupted only at one place, where

a tunnel, 324 feet in length, pierces the upper beds of the  carboniferous limestone
                                                                                                                                                             ;

then for about twelve miles chiefly over alluvial tracts, separated by cuttings of new

red sandstone beds, also touching the southern margin of the Nailsea coal-field.

At twenty-one miles occurs the Uphill cutting, passing through new red sandstone

and lias, and then carboniferous limestone, at the base of which is seen some masses

of trappean rock. The railway is then carried along an alluvial plain of seventeen

miles in length, interrupted only in one place, at three miles north of Bridgewater,

by a deep cutting through new red marls and lias at Puriton. From the termina-

tion of the alluvial tract to Taunton, the course is over a moderately level country

of new red sandstone, and little occurs to attract the attention of the geologist, ex-

cept the occasional appearance of diluvial gravel, which is seen to contain an in-

creasing proportion of the killas as the observer approaches Taunton. There are

four enlarged drawings.

   It is desirable to notice first, that called the Ashton cutting, where the carboni-
ferous beds are displayed in three places. Over the two smaller masses and on the

sides of the larger one are seen the usual boulder conglomerate, consisting of large

and small fragments of limestone, partially water-worn, cemented by the ordinary
red clay. As the superincumbent strata are carried over the two small masses of

limestone, and apparently tend to ascend over the rock at the tunnel, it might be
supposed that a local elevation had taken place subsequent to the deposit of the new

red sandstones. This mny have been the case, but the inclination and curving of
the beds may have been original ; and I incline to this opinion, since, on the pre-

sumption of the limestone having been elevated by violent force arising from igneous
action, the conglomerate adjoining the limestone would have been pierced and thrust

aside, and greater displacement manifested in the marly clays above.

   At the Uphill section the evidence differs : here not only are violent dislocations
of the red marls and lias produced, so that the lias beds dip at an angle of 70░ or
more towards the plane of intersection between the lias and the limestone, which

plane itself dips in the same direction ; but, in addition, the igneous rock appears in
full force ; and it clearly bears relation not only to the fault, which brings into juxta-
position the limestone and lias, but to an extensive fault in the limestone itself, by

which the whole series of beds on one side differs from that on the other.

   On the nature of the trap rock and its metamorphic influence on the limestone.
--60 REPORT 1846.

the Rev. D. Williams of Bleadon has sent to the Geological Societ)' papers which

have been published in their volume of Proceedings ; my own view differs very ma-

terially from that of Mr. Williams, and I prefer making no further remark on this

matter.

   I pass on to the new red sandstone. The first section at Pylle-hill traverses the
upper part of the red and pale-blue marls. Here the stratum containing the stron-
tian nodules is displayed, and at this spot were found those beautiful crystallizations
of strontian, specimens of which may be seen in many mineralogical collections of

this country ; the crystals being not only remarkably large, but presenting modifi-
cations highly interesting to the crystallographer. The Ashton cutting does not

touch the red marls, but is limited entirely to the sandstones beneath the marls.

On the drawing the layers of stone are marked with dark-red lines, and the detailed

description also inserted. The Uphill and Puriton sections show the red and blue

marls and the only remark at present necessary is, that in the Uphill section the
                                 ;

strontian and gypsum of other localities are here replaced by nodular cavernous con-

cretions of minute crystals of carbonate of lime.

   I now proceed to the consideration of the lias strata : the lower divisions of the
lias are seen in three of the sections. The general features of the Pylle-hill and
Uphill sections are the same, and the organic remains usually accompanying these

beds are found in each. In the Puriton section the corresponding beds are ex-

panded to a much greater thickness than any other with which I am acquainted in
the Bristol district. Very few fossils have been obtained on this spot, and the shaly

clays intervening between the limestones are so thickened and are so uniform in
composition, that the symmetrical structure of the mass causes the face of the cliff
to present a series of very smooth divisional planes in two sets, the direction and dip

of which are set forth in the details of the section.

   I am unwilling to close these remarks without adverting to the classification which
M. Agassiz has adopted for the position of the bone-bed of the ^ust cliff. By this

naturalist, and by other eminent persons also, the Aust bone-bed is classed as a part
of the Triassic series, in consequence of the presence in each of the same species of
fishes. The facts I wish to state, bearing on this question, are these : the strata
of the lias, which are beneath the white lias limestones, of which lower division the
Gotham marble forms the upper bed and the bone-bed the lowest, were deemed by
Mr. Conybeare sufficiently characteristic as a group of sedimentary deposits, irre-

--spective of its organic contents, to merit a distinguishing name the lower marls.

   This group then contains throughout its whole extent the same, or apparently
the same, fish-scales and fish-teeth as are preserved in the bone-bed. Besides the
occasional occurrence of such relics in the clays of this group, there are in the Aust
cliff three calcareous layers above the bone-bed containing these remains abun-
dantly. In the Pylle-hill and Uphill strata occur the same number of such beds,
and the latter section affords but a poor equivalent of the bone-bed. In the Puriton
sections there is one, and probably more than one calcareous stratum yielding fish-

scales, and the bone-bed is very faintly exhibited. Further I am not aware of these
remains above the Cotham marble. There is also a Pecten peculiar to this group,

but I cannot state the species, as I believe it to be undescribed. Should any one be
disposed to connect the whole group of lower maris with the bone-bed and remove
them from the lias, there would arise this objection : the Cotham bed, the highest
limit of the lower marls, contains not only the fish-scales, but insects of the same spe-
cies as are found in the white limestones above, and the same likewise as were found

by Mr. Edmund Higgins of Clifton at Aust, at a distance of only ten feet above the
bone-bed. Moreover, Mr. Higgins has discovered the Cypris with plants in the

white limestones in association with the elytra of insects, and a few weeks ago I dis-
covered in the Pylle-hill cutting, in the midst of the lower marls, the Cypris with

the plant Naiadites lanceolate. I am therefore inclined to think that the whole
group of strata, including the Cotham marble above and the bone-bed at the base,
should be treated as a subordinate member of the lias formation, and that no portion

of the same should be considered as an equivalent of any part of the Triassic group.
The decision of the question must however depend upon a much closer examination
of the organic contents than I have been able to devote to them.

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.         61

On three Sections of the Oolitic Formations on the Cfreat Western Railway, at
       the West End of Sapperton Tunnel. By Captain Ibbetson, F. G.S.

   The author presented a short communication to accompany three detailed sections
surveyed by the author for the Geological Survey of Great Britain, for the purpose of
showing the continuation of strata described by Mr. Lonsdale, and in the ' Geology
of Cheltenham,' by Sir R. I. Murchison, by Mr. Buckmanand Mr. Strickland.

   The section at the mouth of the tunnel shows the great oolite, fuller's earth, and
the upper rag of the inferior oolite, which contain three remarkable strata ; viz. a zone
two feet thick, consisting of a mass of Trigonia costata, and another species of Tri-
gonia angulata, &c. ; the second, composed of Gryphma cymbium. &c. ; and the third
an immense quantity of Terebratula, particularly T. fimbria. The beds were noticed
by Mr. Lonsdale as being found at Witcombe Hill near Bath, and by Mr. Buckman
as occurring in the Lineover section. The only lithological difference between the
Sapperton sections and the Lineover section is, that the thin bed of fossiliferous

clay at Lineover is at Sapperton a very hard grit, crystaUine, and a mass of com-
minuted fossils. The second section contains the upper rag of the inferior oolite,

with the three zones above-mentioned ; and the third the upper and lower rags of
the inferior oolite, separated by a mass of soft freestone split obliquely, very cry-
stalline, and full of comminuted fossils.

On the Age of the Silurian Limestone of Hay Head, near Barr Beacon, in
                     Staffordshire. By James Buckman, F.G.S.

The limestone rocks and shale of Hay Head, celebrated as the original locality

from whence was obtained the Barr Trilobite (Bumasius barriensis), were referred
by Sir R. L Murchison to the Wenlock series of the upper Silurian system. This

opinion having been doubted by Burmeister, who places the Barr Trilobite in the

lower Silurian division, Mr. Buckman commenced an examination of all the fossils

associated with that species at Hay Head. Of the fifty-six species there obtained,

fifty-three belong exclusively to the upper Silurian beds, and have also been found in

the Wenlock series of Dudley ; whilst only one, and that a doubtful species, can be

referred to a lower bed. The author hence concludes that Sir R. L Murchison's

sections and notes upon this locality are correct ; though he considers it probable

that a seam of the coal measures occupies a small tract in the valley between Hay

Head and the town of Walsall.  __^_^

Notice of the Discovery of a new Species of Hypanthocrinite in the Upper

                   Silurian Strata. By James Buckman, F.G.S.

   The genus Hypanthocrinites of Phillips, of which a single species was known to
SirR. L Murchison, and is figured in the ' Silurian System' under the name of Hy-
panthocrinites decorus, pi. 17, f. 3, is in itself so remarkable, and presents such pecu-
liarities of structure, that any addition to the list of species cannot be considered
otherwise than interesting to the fossil zoologist. Through the kindness of Augus-
tus Lewis, Esq. of Wolverhampton, to whom the discovery is due, Mr. Buckman
is permitted to lay a beautiful and unique specimen of a new species before the

Geological Section of the Association.

   From the specimen itself, and from an enlarged drawing which he has made of
it, as well as of the previously known species, there is no diflBculty in making out
the following distinctive characters : Hypanthocrinites granulatus, Lewis's MSS.
Head large, obtusely conical, apex surmounted by a small proboscis. Inter-digital

ribs square on their outer margins, which are dotted by minute granulations ; these
are terminated by smooth plates, concave on their outer surfaces. Fingers like those
of the H. decorus, but larger. Body and columns absent.

   This species therefore differs from the H. decorus in being of a much larger size,
with a more obtuse apex ; in its small proboscis, which is only about one-fourth

the size of that of the smaller species ; in its ribs being flat externally instead of

convex ; and in these again being granulated, whilst in the H. decorus they are smooth
the ribs in the last-mentioned species are surmounted by large tubercular plates,
╖whilst these are narrow and concave in the new specimen.
--62 REPORT 1846.

   The specimen described was discovered in the shale between Hay Head and
Walsall, which is now being cut through for a canal, and is the only example that

has yet been obtained of this very fine and remarkable fossil.

    Mr. James Yates exhibited a series of specimens of Zamia Gigas (Lindley's Fossil
Flora, iii. 165), from Runswick, near Whitby, and offered some observations on
the apparent structure and connection of the several parts of the plant.

   On the Mus/ief Band, commonly called the Blaxk-hand Ironstone of tJie
                   Coal-jkldof Scotland. By Robert Bald.

    This band of ironstone was discovered, about forty years ago, by Mr. David
Mushet, of the Calder Iron-works, near Glasgow. It had been frequently passed
through, but was thrown away as rubbish till Mr. Mushet ascertained its value,

--when extensive mines were opened for working it. Two bands of this ironstone are

found in the great coal-fields of Lanark, one fourteen inches thick ; the other,
which is seventy-three fathoms lower, is sixteen inches thick. The ironstone of

the Mushet band is much more easily reducible than the ordinary clay ironstone,
and requires less fuel. In Scotland it appears to be co-extensive with the coal for-
mation. In South Wales also it is found ; but there is little of it in England or

Ireland. Fifty yeaxs ago there were only five iron-works in Scotland, comprising

about fifteen blast furnaces, which, together, produced 540 tons of iron per week.

There are now 100 blast furnaces in action, which produce 12,000 tons per week,
or 624,000 tons in the year, the value of which, at г3 per ton, is г1,872,000.
This great increase Mr. Bald attributed to the discovery of the Mushet ironstone,
and to the introduction of the hot-blast. He also mentioned that Mr. Mushet,
who is now in his seventieth year, has published a volume on the manufacture of
iron, containing an analysis of every ironstone and ore he could obtain ; and he

trusted his labours would, at least, be recognized in scientific societies, although the

pecuniary advantage arising from his discoveries had fallen into other hands.

        On the Extent of the NortJiwkh Salt-field.
       By G. Wareing Ormerod, M.A., F.G.S.

   The prevailing direction of the faults in the coal-field of South Lancashire ap-
proaches to the magnetic north and south. Of those faults some extend to the new

red sandstone of Cheshire, under which they probably pass ; others can be traced

across the new red' sandstone. Of the last, one passes in a magnetic north and

south direction through the coal-field of Lancashire, by the west of Wrightington
and Haydock- lodge, and Warrington. Here it enters on the new red sandstone of

Cheshire, and passes by the west of Hill Cliflf and Northwich, forming the south-

western boundary of the Northwich salt-field. At Barnton and Hartford to the

west of this line of fault rock-salt has not been discovered, though sunk for to the

depths of 300 and 400 feet respectively. At Northwich, to the east of the line, rock-

salt occurs, as shown in the following section.

                  TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                         63

strata have been penetrated to 214 feet below sea-level without finding rock-salt.
The brine rises there to a height of about 130 feet above sea- level ; whilst at Wins-

ford rock-salt beds, similar (as far as worked) to those at Northwich, occur at a

depth to the upper bed of from 90 to 120 feet below sea-level. The brine rises

there to a height of about twenty-five feet above sea-level. The line thence passes

into Staffordshire, near Whitmore.

A fault ranging from south-west to north-east, passes by the north-west of the

Peckforton hills across Delamere Forest, by the north-west of Northwich, dividing

that salt from the easterly ends of the Waterstone, or lower beds of the keuper, and

thence to the east of Timperley. The north- east boundary of the Northwich salt
was not determined. The south-east is formed by a line parallel to the north-west

side, about 1300 yards distant therefrom.

Within this area frequent subsidences of the land take place. From this cause

the locks on and the banks of the Weever have been here raised. The land where a

Afactory stood, near Northwich-bridge, has sunk so as to form a wharf.  few

years since, the subsidence near the junction of Whitton-brook and the Weever was

at the rate of three inches per week : at this point a lake is now rapidly forming.

The salt pans at the works by the Weever have been frequently raised, and many
are now abandoned. The course of Whitton-brook, which in 1811 was made six
feet deep, now varies in depth from ten to thirty feet. About two miles to the

north of Northwich, near the north-western boundary fault, some fields are sinking.

In this area the brine stands at the same level, and varies simultaneously in all the

pits. That the rock-salt of Northwich does not extend beyond the above limits, is
further shown by the fact, that the neighbouring ground beyond the above boundary

--fines does not sink, and the brine where found beyond the said boundary is reached

and stands at various levels all differing from that at Northwich.

Minute descriptions of the salt, and the methods of working the same being given

in various well-known works, the same were not here noticed.

Notice ofthe Coal of India, being an Analysis ofa Report communicated to the

ByIndian Government on this subject.       Prof'. Ansted, M.A., F.R.S. &c.

--The coal districts of India may be considered as five in number, three in Northern

India and one in Cutch, whilst the fifth includes the province of Arracan and the

coast of the Birman empire near Tenasserini. Of these the Cutch coal is certainly

not of the carboniferous epoch, and it appears to be of little importance at present

and unpromising.

   The whole district, extending from the neighbourhood of Hoosungabad on the
Nerbudda river (lat. 23░ N. long. 78░ E.), on the left or south bank of the river, and

extending in a north-easterly direction for a distance of about 400 miles to Palamow,

thence eastward, for 250 miles, to Burdwan, near Calcutta, and running north-

ward, for 150 miles, to Rajmahal, exhibits, it would appear, at intervals by no means

distant, a continually repeated outcrop of rocks, consisting of sandstones and shales,

with occasional limestone. Throughout this wide tract a number of beds of coal

have been recognised, of variable thickness and value, but all appearing to exhibit

evidence of the existence there of a great coal-district.

On the flanks of the Garrow Mountains, near the Burhampootei', and on both

banks of that vast river, we find another, perhaps a continued outcrop of similar

beds, also containing coal, and reaching in a north-easterly direction for nearly 400

miles. The intermediate plains, whose breadth between Rajmahal and Jumalpore

is about 100 miles, are chiefly alluvial, and thus it is possible that there exists a vast

range of carboniferous strata, reaching for upwards of 1000 miles along the flanks

of the Himalaya Mountains, the distance from the mountain chain gradually in-

creasing as we advance westward, the mountains trending northwards and the out-

crop of the carboniferous bed southwards, until finally, the distance between them

being upwards of 500 miles, the relation is not easily recognised.

I. Commencing with the neighbourhood of Calcutta, we have first to consider

the Burdwan coal-district, with which I shall group the Adji and the Rajmahal

fields, all these being on the banks of either the Hooghley or Ganges, or on the tri-

butaries of these rivers. The Burdwan district has been long known, and a good
--64 REPORT 1846.

deal worked. The workable beds of coal are nine and seven feet thick respectively.

They are associated with sandstone, shale, and a little clay- ii'ons tone, and about six

other thinner seams of coal, while other thick beds are mentioned, but their real ex-

istence as separate beds is doubtful. There are now thirteen spots at which this

coal is worked, but most of them are surface workings. The deepest sinking is 190

feet. The distance to Calcutta is about ninety miles, but the actual transit of coal

is nearly 200 miles. There would seem to be a continuous outcrop of the same kind

of rocks from Burdwan up the Adji river, and northwards to Rajmahal. On the Adji

river the coal has been worked in more than one spot, and is found to be of about

the same quality as that of Burdwan ; but neither of them is considered of nearly so
good quality as the English coal. Further on, at Rajmahal, coal is known to exist,

but has not yet been much worked. The quality of that which has been obtained

does not appear good.

II. The Burdwan coal-field appears to be directly connected with a district at

Palamow, in which coal has been worked in no fewer than four places. The coal

here apparently reposes in a valley inclosed by hills of granite, and is associated

with a good deal of iron. There are several beds that are of workable size, but a

good deal of the coal is heavy and of inferior quality, and some of it appears to be

anthracitic. These coal-beds are not far from the Soane river, and about 100 miles

from its confluence with the Ganges, a little above Dinapoor and Patna ; but the

Soane is not at present navigable. To the west of Palamow the carboniferous beds

are described as appearing along two irregular lines, the one towards the south-west

for 150 miles, reaching bej'ond Koorbah, and the other more westward, by Sohage-

poor, to the Nerbudda. ITiese beds appear to connect themselves with the Burdwan

coal-field ; and near Ramgurh coal has been obtained in two or three places. This

coal is said to be of very good quality and of considerable thickness ; but there can
be little doubt that a statement made in the report, of the bed of coal being 200

yards in thickness, must be owing to some misunderstanding of the account and

sketch originally communicated. It seems certain, however, from the extent of the

outcrop, that the seam must be one of considerable magnitude. Westwards, again,

from Palamow, and at a distance of about fifty miles, coal has been found in seve-

ral places in Singrowli, but the beds at present known are thin ; and again, to the
south-west, the same mineral occurs at Sirgoojah, where fine coal has been seen,

but is not used at present. Between the Singrowli coal and Jubbulpore excellent

coal has been found in several places, indicating an extensive coal-field ; but the

nature and thickness of the beds are not stated.

The Nerbudda district, although from the drainage of the country it belongs to

the Bombay side of India, is manifestly more related, so far as the old rocks are

concerned, with the Bengal territory. The coal is about 350 miles from Bombay,

and the Nerbudda river is at present not navigable. There seem to be three districts

in the Nerbudda valley in which coal is found, but the most important of them is

that near Gurrawarra, about midway between Hoosungabad and Jubbulpore. The

coal here, indeed, appears to be perhaps the best hitherto found in India, and exists

in beds three in number, whose thickness respectively is said to be 20 feet, 40 feet,

and 25i feet. There are also other beds, one of which is four feet.
   The discovery of this, the Benar coal-field, promises to be of great importance.

It is also very near another basin, where there are beds also of excellent quality, one

of them six feet in thickness. At Jubbulpore itself coal has been found at a depth

of seventy feet, one bed being nearly twelve feet thick.

WeIII. Let us consider now the district east of Calcutta.  there find true car-

l)oniferous rocks on both flanks of the Garrow mountains, commencing near Jumal-

pore, and thence continuing north-eastwards, for a distance amounting on the whole

to nearly 400 miles, through Lower and Upper Assam. The district nearest Cal-

cutta is Silhet, on the south flanks of the Garrow, where eleven beds of coal have

been determined, whose total thickness as already ascertained amounts to eighty-five

feet. This coal is of excellent quality, and can as readily be conveyed to the Upper

Ganges as the Burdwan coal. The most remarkable beds occur at Cherra Ponji;

but these appear irregular, although they are undoubtedly of great thickness in seve-

ral spots, amounting sometimes to nearly thirty feet. There are also other import-

ant beds. They have been known for more than ten years, but have not been
       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                   65

worked ; and since their first discovery large quantities of iron have been smelted

with charcoal.

   After passing the districts in which the coal has been thus clearly exhibited, we
proceed next to the Assam districts, also more or less continuous, and extending for
about 350 miles chiefly along the south side of the Burhampooter ; the whole being
divided into the two groups of Lower and Upper Assam, separated at Bishenath, 170
miles above Calcutta. Six coal-fields are enumerated in the Upper district, and three
in the Lower ; but the latter, although it would seem not so promising, are looked

on as scarcely less important in consequence of their greater accessibility.
   So far as details are concerned, the Lower Assam coal offers little positive informa-

tion ; the indications consisting rather of rolled fragments drifted, than of distinct and
well-marked beds. It is called lignite in a report from Lieut. Vetch ; but both coal
and lignite are terms frequently used without reference to any peculiar character of
the mineral, or any geological position. Similar beds of coal or lignite to those found
in Lower Assam, south of the Burhampooter, are also mentioned as occurring on the
north in three of the streams flowing into that river from the Bootan range. The
Upper Assam coal is manifestly of great interest, and likely to prove very important.
It is associated with abundance of clay ironstone.

   About eighty miles above Bishenath, other beds, stated to be six feet thick, have
been worked for the sake of trying the oeconomic value of the coal. It is described
by the commander of one of the Assam Company's steamers, in a letter dated 24th
January, 1845, as far the best he ever had on board a steamer, and far superior to
any coal in Calcutta. From the growing importance of the tea-trade from Assam,
this is likely, therefore, to be of great value. Still further up the country there are
several important beds, dipping, it would appear, at so high an angle, and placed so
unfavourably with regard to present means of transport, that it would be difficult to
work them. The other beds that appear in this district are exposed to the same
difficulty; and the coal throughout Northern India appears to be in this respect un-

favourably placed.

   Passing on now to the other districts in India and the East, in which carboniferous
rocks and beds of coal have been met with, I have to enumerate two, the Tenasserim
and the Arracan districts, which, from their vicinity to India and their geographical
position, are of considerable importance. The former has been known for some
years, and there are said to be four localities at which coal appears ; but of these
only one seems likely to prove of oeconomic value. From the accounts given of this

coal there is every reason to conclude, that one of the beds is not of the carboni-
ferous period ; and although another (on the Thian Khan) has been the subject of a
far more favourable report, being called cannel coal, and stated by Mr. Prinsep to be

an admirable coal for gas, there is yet much probability of the whole being of the

tertiary period. These beds have been described in the 'Journal of the Asiatic So-

ciety' for 1838.
   In Arracan there are eleven beds of coal, but all of them are thin, and their posi-

tion nearly vertical. They are said to be associated with sandstones, limestones and
shales ; but it is clear that they can at present be looked at only as indications, and
not of any practical importance.

Notices ofsome Fossil Mammalia of South America. By Prof. Owen, F.R.S.

Since the publication of his descriptions of the fossil mammalia collected by Mr.

ADarwin, the following additional species had come under observation.  new spe-

cies of the gliriform genus of Pachyderms called Toxodon, was founded on an entire

lower jaw, with the intermaxillary part of the upper jaw of a specimen equalling the

Toxodon plafemis in size, transmitted from Buenos Ayres. The new species, which

Prof. Owen proposed to call Toxodon angustidens, is distinguished by the nearly equal

size of the outer and inner incisors of the upper jaw, the transverse diameter of the

inner or median one being two inches ; and by the narrower transverse diameter of

the inferior molars. Prof. Owen considered the characters of this second species of

Toxodon as confirming in ever)- respect his ideas of the affinities of the genus ex-

pressed by the title, ' Description of the cranium of the Toxodon platensis, a gigantic

extinct mammiferous animal, referable to the order Pachydermata, but with affinities

to the Rodentia, Edentata, and herbivorous Cetacea/ under which his original me-

moir was published in 1838. M. Quatrefages, in his ' Considerations sur les Carac-
teres Zoologiques des Rongeurs,' 4to, 1840, had corrected what he assumed to have
been Frof. Owen's allocation of the Toxodon to the Rodent order. M. Quatrefages
thought the so-called incisors of the Toxodon to be canines, affirming that their

roots extended to the maxillary bones above the first molars ; and he regards the

Toxodon as having a nearer affinity to the Morse (Trichecus). Prof. Owen referred

to his ' Odontography,' p. 411, for a refutation of Geoffroy St. Hilaire's ideas that

the scalpriform incisors of Rodents were canines ; and alluded to the enamelled
complex molars of the Toxodon as opposing M. Quatrefages' idea of its relationship

to Trichecus.

  An almost entire skull of the Mastodon Andium had been transmitted to the British

Museum from the post-pleiocene beds of the Pampas of Buenos Ayres ; its molar

dentition was described, and a distinctive character of its tusks, in a strip of enamel

two inches broad along their outer sides, was pointed out.

Macrauchenia. To this genus of tridactyle Pachyderms, which is nearly allied

to the Palaeotherium by the structure of the feet, and to the Llamas (Auchenia) in

the structure of the neck. Prof. Owen had referred a molar tooth of the lower jaw

(No. 952, Mus. Coll. Chir), on account of its crown being composed of two upright

Ahalf cylinders of equal height, as in the Palaeotherium.   left ramus of the lower

jaw, from the tertiary deposits of Buenos Ayres, has been received, containing six

molar teeth, three true and three false, the last four showing the same form or pattern

as the single fossil tooth from Patagonia, demonstrating the resemblance with the

lower molar teeth of the Palaeothere, except in this difference, viz. the absence of the

third lobe in the last molar, by which the generic distinction of the South American

Pachj'derm was estabhshed ; and an approach made to the rhinoceros. The Ma-
crauchenia, to which Prof. Owen provisionally referred the fossil in question, differed

however, like the Palseothere, from the Rhinoceros, in the greater exterior convexity

and equal height of the two semi-cylindrical lobes of which the last premolar and

the three true molars were composed ; and it further differed from both Palaeothere

and Rhinoceros in the more simple form of the second and third premolars ; the

enamel is smooth and the dentine compact, and the coronal cement forms a thin

layer. The longitudinal extent of the six molar teeth was nine inches.

ANesodon, n. g.  genus allied to the preceding, but resembling the Anoplothe-

rium, in the absence of any vacant interspace in the entire dental series, and in the

equal height of canines and incisor.^;, was established on the anterior part of the lower

jaw and on two molar teeth of the upper jaw, discovered by Capt. Sulivan, R.N., in

an arenaceous tertiary deposit on the coast of Patagonia. The incisors, canines, and

premolars of the lower jaw ai-e not only in contact, but overlap each other like

scales or tiles, and the molar teeth of both upper and lower jaw are characterized by
islands of enamel, whence the generic name proposed. The incisors are six in num-
ber. The characters described by Prof. Owen show some resemblance to Toxodon,

in which also the large procumbent incisors overlap each other : the interval between

Toxodon and Macrauchenia is evidently partly filled by the present remarkable genus.

The extent of the sloping symphysis, the breadth of the lower jaw behind the sym-

physis, and the depth of the ramus at the beginning of the first true molar, were

severally two inches. The quadruped to which these fossils belonged must have
been about the size of the Llama. Prof. Owen proposed to call the species Nesodon

imhricatus, in allusion to the tile-like, overlapping arrangement of the anterior teeth.

A second larger species of Nesodon was indicated by four or five detached teeth of

the lower jaw from the same deposits. This species, of the size of the Zebra, it was

proposed to call Nesodon Sulivani.

As a check to the undue increase of so many large herbivorous species of the

Megatherioid and Pachydermal orders, the great Machairodus, discovered in the

caves of Brazil by Dr. Lund, who first supposed it a hysena, was well-adapted. An

almost entire skull had been, thence, transmitted to Paris, and had been referred
Aby M. de Blainville to the genus Felis, who had published a figure of it.
                                                                            speci-

men of the same, or a closely allied species, displaying some characters not pre-

served in the Parisian specimen, had been transmitted from the tertiary deposits
of Buenos Ayres. Prof. Owen pointed out several differences establishing the, at
least, subgeneric distinction of this remarkable carnivore, which equalled the

Bengal Tiger in size, and had upper canine teeth of thrice the length. Aa Prof.

Owen could not determine any specific distinction in the present fossil from the
Hymna neogea or " SmUodon" of Dr. Lund, he proposed to call the species " Ma-

chairodus neogmis." This, happily extinct, most formidable and destructive of the
carnivorous genera, had anciently an extensive geographical range through a great
extent of South America, in India, and throughout Europe ; fossil remains of differ-
ent species having been found in old pleiocene deposits in Germany and France, in
the newer pleiocene of the Val d'Arno, and in the bone-caves of England. Our
own ancient Machairodus latidens of Devonshire, added to the other species, con-
firms the propriety of keeping the genus distinct from the typical Felis.

   Of the gigantic extinct Armadilloes, Prof. Owen added to the former species, which

he had called Glyptodon clavipes, the following, viz. Glypfodon reticulatus, Glyptodon

ornatus, Glyptodon tubercidatus, and Glyptodon clavicaudatus. An enormous tail of
the latter, now in the British Museum, showed several of the ossicles of the dermo-

skeletal sheath produced into huge tubercles, the whole resembhng the club of the

giant Gog or Magog. Prof. Owen thought that the present knowledge of the co-exist-

ence with those large herbivorous Armadilloes of a gigantic carnivorous species like
Machairodus, gave some insight into their need of a complete and strong defence of
all the exposed parts of the body and the tail, since they had not the powerful claws
with which the Megatherioid quadrupeds might have waged war with the Machai-
rodus. With regard to the Megatherium, the remains recently transmitted confirmed
Prof. Owen's ideas of its closer affinity to the Sloths than to the Ant-eaters or Arma-
dilloes ; and had enabled him completely to reconstruct both the fore and hind ex-

tremities, and correct some errors in Cuvier's descriptions.

   Mr. Edwards communicated a list of the fossils of Bracklestone Bay, Sussex. Of

the classes Conchifera, Brachiopoda, and Gasteropoda, there are 161 described spe-
cies, and seventy-nine undescribed ; seventy-four of which are also found at Bar-
ton. Of the 161 described species, 106 are identified with French and fifty-five with
English species. Respecting Foraminifera, Corals, and Cephalopoda, the author

states that they are under examination.

Notice of some Tertiary Rocks in the Islands stretching from Java to Timor.

                         By J. B. Jukes, M.A., F.G.S.

   Behind the town of Coupang, in the island of Timor, the land rises in gently
sloping hills to the height of 500 or OOO feet, the nature of which is exposed in a
narrow precipitous valley. These cliffs and the shore itself are composed of a very
recent tertiary formation, which appears to be a raised coral reef, abounding in
Astresa, Meandrina and Pontes, with shells of Strombus, Conus, Nerita, Area, Pec-
ten, Venus and Lucina. On a ledge about 150 feet above the sea, Mr. Jukes found
a Tridacna two feet across, bedded in the rock, with closed valves, just as he had
often seen them in the barrier reefs. The thickness of this formation was proba-
bly several hundred feet; and it seemed to spread far and wide over the country,
wrapping round the central mountains, which were lofty, and probably volcanic,
peaks. Samou Island appeared to be wholly composed of this rock, often forming
precipices 200 or 300 feet in height. Sandalwood Island presents a lofty coast of
cliffs and hills, rising 2000 feet above the sea, and attaining a still greater elevation
inland. All the coast cliffs were regularly stratified in thick horizontal beds ; white
when fresh broken, but weathering nearly black. The cliffs and precipices of Sum-
bawa are equally lofty, and exhibit the same regular bedding. The island of Lom-
bock slopes gradually from its southern shore to a great conical volcanic mass,
11,400 feet high, which towers from its north-east corner. The southern coast-
cliffs, about 200 feet high, were composed of a white, horizontally-stratified rock,
covered by a considerable thickness of brown and yellow thin-bedded rocks. The
island of Madura was found to be composed of the same white, chalk-like strata
this island rises in one or two terraces into slightly undulating plains, with groups
of flat tabular hills, often rocky and precipitous, and occasionally 1000 feet above
the sea ; on the opposite side of the Straits of Madura these hills continue some
distance along the north coast of Java. They are wholly composed of limestone,
probably tertiary ; and resemble the coral rock of a fringing reef, having a similar

                                                                        f2

black, rugged and honeycombed surface, and white interior, sometimes crystalline,
at others earthy and powdery, and occasionally exhibiting a coralline structure.
Within the delta of the river Kediri, there are small island-like masses of the same
rock; and in one of these were nodules of chert and coarse earthy limestone, with
small bivalve shells (Venus, or Cyrena). Along the south coast of the eastern end
of Java are some great calcareous formations, containing fossils, which were noticed
by Dr. Horsfield in his geological map of Java. From all these particulars, the

--author concludes that a great tertiary formation of very recent origin and being, in

fact, but a raised fringing reef--clings to the flanks of all the volcanic islands from
the east end of Timor to the west end of Java ; and that, narrow as these islands
are in proportion to their length, their actual volcanic portion is confined within
still narrower limits ; and huge as are the piles of volcanic materials gradually accu-
mulated in some of the mountains, they owe a good part of these materials, and
their elevation also, to a comparatively recent period in the earth's history, during
the existence of creatures now living on the earth.

                        Sketch of the Geological Structure of Australia,

                          By J. B. Jukes, M.A., F.G.S.

   This document was chiefly drawn up from the author's own observations during
four years, in which he had opportunity, as naturalist of H.M.S. Fly, of seeing the

 greater part of the Australian coast. Along the eastern coast there is one con-
tinuous line of hills, extending from Bass's Straits to Cape York in Torres Straits, a
 distance of 2400 miles ; bej'ond which it is prolonged in rocky islands up to the

coast of New Guinea. This chain has a granitic axis, flanked by metamorphic and

palseozoic rocks in the south, as described by Count Strzelecki. From Port Bowen,
in lat. 22░ 30', the author's own observations commenced. The coast principally
 consisted of schists, porphyries and basalts ; at Cape Upstart granite occurred, and
was extensively developed on the coast to the northward, and far into the interior,
 forming hills 4000 feet high. North of Cape Melville, the granite almost disap-
 peared ; and instead, great masses of porphyry with felspathic, quartzose and me-
 tamorphic rocks composed all the headlands and islands. This line of coast appears
 to cut obliquely through a chain having granite for its axis, flanked by porphyries
 and metamorphic rocks. On the south-east coast, the crest of the main chain lies
 70 or 100 miles from the shore, leaving a considerable space, which is occupied by
 stratified rocks, consisting of palaeozoic shales, sandstones, &c. The same rocks are
 found on the western flank of the chain, in the district of Port Phillip, and its coal-
beds exist at Western Port. West of the coast range granite shows itself in the bed
 of the Bogan, just before it enters the Darling, and in the upper parts of the Gle-
 nelg. South of the Murray, it forms the north and south ranges of the Pyrenees,
the range of Mount Byng, &c. The great mass of the Grampians, more than 4000
 feet high, is composed of sandstone similar to that of Sydney ; south of which are a
 number of volcanic cones and vast sheets of lava. Over all the lower parts of the
 country, from Port Phillip to the Murray, is spread a great tertiary formation,
 abounding in shells, echinoderms, and corals. At Cape Jervis, South Australia,
 the rocks consist of mica-slate, gneiss and clay-slate ; and at Adelaide of coarse
 chlorite schist, and about Gawler Town, blue clay-slate prevails. Veins of copper
 and lead abound in the various ranges. The interior appears to consist everywhere
 of tertiary clays and sandstone ; which also form the coast, for 600 miles, from
 Streaky Bay on the east to Mount Ragged on the west of the Great Bight. About
 Mount Ragged granite is again seen, and frequently forms hills to the west, whose
 bases are concealed by the tertiary. From King George's Sound, an elevated di-
 strict runs northward at least 250 ^iles, consisting of granite, metamorphic rocks,
 gneiss, &c. Between this district and the sea, is a low plain, twenty miles wide, of
 recent tertiary rocks, which extend northward to the islands forming the western
 boundary of Shark's Bay, forming the whole western coast of the Swan River
 Colony. Along the north-west coast from Shark's Bay to Dampier's Land is a vast
 tract of flat country, scarcely raised above the sea level, and fronted by dunes of
 sand. Between Collier's Bay and Cambridge Gulf is a great promontory of strati-
 fied sandstone hke that of Sydney. The next portion of the coast described from
 personal observation is that at Port Essington, which consists of a red or white fer╗

ruginous sandstone, horizontally stratified. This formation seems also to extend
round the whole Gulf of Carpentaria, and to the Victoria River. The sandstone
abounds in ferruginous concretions, which sometimes compose its entire mass,
which then looks like the refuse of an iron furnace, or part of a lava stream. These

masses form the headlands and projecting points of the cliffs. On account of their

similarity to the tertiary sandstones of Port Phillip, the author infers their simi-

larity in age. In concluding, the author remarks the parallelism of all the known
mountain chains in Australia, the majority being N.N.E. and S.W., and none vary-
ing more than two points from north and south. He also cites the opinion of
Capt. Sturt, that one vast desert plain stretches from the great Australian Bight to

the Gulf of Carpentaria ; and observes that the only great extent of country unac-
counted for, is on the north-west side, where the range between Cambridge Gulf
and Buccaneer's Archipelago may rise into some importance in the interior.

   Granite abounds in the Mahra country, which is a part of the King Mountains,
N.E. from Abomey. The mountains run in curved lines towards the N.W. and
S E. The lesser ranges, which border the King Mountains, are stratified, often
dipping east (15░ to 20░), and farther ofFt he beds are horizontal. They are all of

the granitic or gneiss character.

   On the mountain Kpalloko, the loftiest from its base in the Mahra countrj',

are several towns. The escarpment on the north is perpendicular. The rocks are
formed in curved beds.

   About 100 miles beyond the mountains, in lat. 11░ 30' N., are calcareous and
ferruginous springs ; and sulphur (Kao) is found abundantly in the mountains.

               Note on Graphic Granite. By A. C. G. Jobeet.

--The inspection of several samples of graphic granite have led me to the conclusion,
    1st, that there are cases where it can be successfully demonstrated that during the
process of the refrigeration of the granite, the crystals of quartz were formed first
in the middle of the felspathic melted matter.

   2ndly. That during the subsequent process of the consolidation of the felspar,
the quartz crystals remained for a time in a gelatinous state.

   3rdly. That the circumstances which have accompanied the production of graphic
granite, such as the movements of the mineral matter injected in veins, and lateral
pressure, have modified the crystals of quartz, so as to destroy, partially, the pris-
matic regular shape, in flattening them, and sometimes imprinting upon them forms
corresponding to the felspathic ciystallization.

   4thly. That it is to these modifications in the form of the prismatic crystals of
quartz that the particular aspect of the graphic granite is due.

  These facts may lead to important deductions : for instance, if it is clearly de-

monstrated that in the granitic masses the crystals of quartz have existed in a ge-
latinous state, whilst the felspar passed from the liquid to the solid state, this cir-

cumstance will explain many accidents in the granitic envelope, such as the forma-
tion of quartz veins and dikes in natural contemporaneous fissures, through the
pressure of superincumbent masses, and even also the formation of felspathic dikes
in a granite where the quartz was predominant, if the fissure has been produced
in a yielding mass, when the felspathic elements were still in a liquid state.

observation that several rare species nowr living in our seas appear at a comparatively
recent period to have been much more abundant ; and the inference that they are
now gradually dying out, which leads to the probable conjecture that many of the
late tertiary forms became extinct within the historic period. 4. The observations

 On the Physical Character of the Table-land of Abessinia. By Charles T.
    Beke, Esq., Ph.D., F.S.A., F.R.G.S., Corresponding Member of the Geo-

    graphical Society of Paris.
    The object of this memoir is to show the true character of the high table-land of
Abessinia, in which the numerous head-streams of the Nile have their origin.
    The opinion expressed by Professor Ritter in his Erdkunde, and generally enter-
tained on his authority, with respect to this table-land is, that it consists of a suc-
cession of terraces rising one above the other, the lowest being towards the Red Sea,
and the highest being in Enarea, where the line of separation between the waters
 flowing into the Nile and those of the rivers having their course to the Indian
 Ocean is considered to exist.
    Dr. Rtippell was the first to show that so far from the high land rising in ter-
races as it recedes from the coast, its summit line is towards the coast itself, and
that from thence it falls gradually towards the interior. And this view is entirely
corroborated by the two vertical sections of the Abessinian plateau, from north to
south, and from east to west, exhibited by Dr. Beke to the meeting*. These sec-
tions show that at Halai on the summit of Mount Taranta, twenty-three geographi-
cal miles from the Red Sea at Ziilla (A.dule), near Massowah, the edge of the table-
 land has an absolute elevation of 8625 feet, which gives a rise of 1 in 16'15

--equal to an angle of 3░ 33' to the eastern slope. On the other hand, at Khartum,

at the junction of the White and Blue Rivers, in nearly the same latitude as Halai,
and at a distance of 380 geographical miles from that place, the elevation of the
Nile is 1525 feet. The fall in that direction is therefore only 1 in 324, which gives
rather more than ten minutes and a half of a degree, as the angle of the western
 slope towards the interior of the continent. Consequently, on a line along the
fifteenth parallel of north latitude, the eastern slope of the Abessinian mountain-
chain towards the sea is to the western counter- slope towards the Nile as 20 to I.

    If the proportion of the two slopes, instead of being estimated on a direct east
and west line, be calculated on one in the general direction of the courses of the
principal rivers, namely from S.E. to N.W., the result is as follows. Khartiim
lies very nearly to the north-west of Melka-Kuyu, the ford over the Hawash on
the way from Tadjurrah to Shoa, at which spot the absolute elevation of that river
is about 2200 feet. The height of the eastern edge of the table-land on the summit

--of the Chakka mountains behind Ankdbar, the capital of Shoa not far from the
--direct line between the two extreme points is about 9000 feet ; and as this locality

is thirty-eight geographical miles from M^lka-Kuyu, it gives a rise of 1 in 38'83 to

--the eastern slope equal to an angle of 1░ 41'. On the other hand, the distance

from the summit of the Chakka to Khartum being about 532 miles, the fall of the
counter-slope is 1 in 429, equal to an angle of 8'. These calculations make there-
fore the proportion of the two slopes to be as 12*6 to 1.

    In this latter instance the eastern slope is taken, not from the level of the ocean,
but from that of the Hawash, which river is here the recipient of the waters of that
slope, in the same way as the Nile itself is the recipient of those of the western
counter-slope. From the Hawash to the sea is about 200 miles, which gives a fall
of 1 in 550, equal to an angle of six and a quarter minutes of a degree, for the low
 desert country inhabited by the Beduin Dankali tribes.

   As a whole, the table-land of Abessinia may be described as a succession of ex-
tensive undulating plains, declining very gradually towards the west and north-
west, and being intersected by numerous streams ; which streams, after a short

Geographical Society.

course on the level of the plateau, fall abruptly into deep-cut valleys, in which they
soon reach a depression of from 3000 to 4000 feet below the general level of the table-

--land. The valleys of the larger streams are of considerable width that of the

Abai to the south' of the peninsula of Godjara, is at least twenty-five railes from the
extreme points where it breaks from the table-land on either side. As the country
within the valleys is exceedingly wild and irregular, with all the characters of a
mountainous one, nothing is easier for a traveller, who has not first taken a com-
prehensive view of the entire region, and who, on crossing a river, finds himself
shut up within a mass of broken country rising around him on all sides to a relative
elevation of 3000 or 4000 feet or even more, than to suppose that, in ascending this
broken country on either side, he is crossing a mountain chain ; whereas, on reach-
ing the summit, he has merely arrived upon the table-land. It is important to bear
this in mind in the perusal of the works of travellers in Abessinia, many of whom,
under the impression thus alluded to, place mountains, where mountains, in the ordi-

nary acceptation of the term, do not exist.
   Where the rivers begin to break from the table-land, which they do by fissures

in the rocky surface, at first only a few yards in breadth, but gradually opening to
the extent of several miles, they at once form ciataracts of 80 or 100 feet, or even
more, in height, and then continue down a succession of falls and rapids, so as to
descend several thousand feet in a course of a few miles. For example, the Abai,
in a distance of only twenty-five miles between the two bridges over it, in the north-
east of Godjam, falls upwards of 2000 feet, or 80 feet per mile ; and in the next eighty
miles of its course it falls nearly 1000 feet more. So too, in a distance of 100 miles
between Angolalia, the Galla capital of Shoa, and the ford of the Derra Gallas,

on the way to Godjam, the difference of elevation between the head-streams of the
Djamma, a principal tributary of the Abai, and the Abai itself is nearly 5600 feet

which gives a fall of 56 feet per mile.
   The uniformity of the surface of the table-land is further broken by higher

mountain masses, which, in some parts, as in Samien, Angot, Godjam, Miecha,
KafFa, &c., attain an absolute elevation of from 11,000 to 15,000 feet. These
greater elevations do not however appear to form parts of any regular system, but
to be distinct, isolated masses, unconnected either with each other or with the

general bearing of the entire plateau.

  A remarkable peculiarity of this table-land is, that many of its principal rivers

have a spiral course, so that after having formed a curve of greater or less extent--

--mostly, as would appear, round these higher mountain masses, they return upon

themselves at a comparatively short distance from their sources. As instances are
mentioned the Mareb, the Bellegas, the Abai, the Gibbe, and the Godjeb. This
latter river, of which the first accounts were given by Dr. Beke, is not the head of
the Jubb or Gowin, as has been imagined, but one of the principal arms of the Bahr-

el-Abyad or true Nile.

   AUthe streams of the western counter-slope of the Abessinian chain are aflluents

of the Nile, and their easternmost branches take their rise at the extreme eastern
edge of the table-land, which is thus the limit of the basin of the Nile, and the
watershed between its affluents and those of the rivers flowing eastward and south-

ward towards the Indian Ocean. On the seaward side of this watershed, the de-
clivity being much more abrupt and its extent much more limited, the rivers must
necessarily be of secondary importance. Of these, the Hawash, the Haines's River,
and the Jubb or Gowin (which latter river is apparently the lower course of the

--Wabbi the Oby of de Barros*), are mentioned as instances ; and the author infers

that to the south of the equator the watershed continues along southwards at a
comparatively short distance from the eastern coast, so that when once the south-
ern limits of the basin of the Nile are passed, the far greater mass of the immense

tropical rains find their way to the ocean by the rivers discharging themselves into

it on the western coast.

  --* Addition by the Author.--The Gowin or Jubb,--the pseudo-Godjeb (Gochob'> of Sir Wil-

liam C. Harris, which river enters the sea at Juba near the equator, and which was ascended
by Mr. Arc Angelo in February 1844, is manifestly the " Webigi-weyna" of M.Antoine d'Ab-
badie. As Wabbi (Webi) is an appellative signifying " river," this name should be read
*' Wabbi-Giweyna," that is to say, the river Gowin. M. Rochet d'Hericourt places the source

--of this river in the country of Korchassi, to the south of lake Zuwai. 12th March, 1847.

--72 REPORT 1846.

    Along the watershed, that is to say at the extreme eastern edge of the table-land,
 several lakes of some magnitude are situate, namely, A'shangi, Hai'k and Zuwai
 and the great lake Zambezi, or Nyassi, lying further to the south, would appear to
be, in like manner, placed near the line along which the minor streams falling
 into the Indian ocean are divided from those of larger size which flow towards the

 Atlantic.

    The memoir concludes with directing attention to an important practical result
 which is to be arrived at from this brief survey of the physical character of the
 Abessinian plateau. " It is, namely, that the eastern coast of Africa presents

 facilities for the exploration of the interior of that continent very superior to those

--afforded by the western coast. For, when the narrow belt of low land along the

 coast of the Indian Ocean which from its general dryness, arising from the

--absence of large rivers, is far from unhealthy at most seasons of the year is once

 passed and the eastern edge of the elevated table-land is attained, a cUmate is met
,with which is not merely congenial to European constitutions, but is absolutely

--more healthy than that of most countries. Here that is to say, on the elevated
--plateau, and not in the low desert country along the sea-coast travellers might wait

 in safety, and even with advantage to their health, till suitable opportunities should
 present themselves for penetrating westward into the interior; and in the event of
 their having to retrace their steps, they would only return upon a healthy and de-

 lightful country. On the other hand, the climate of the western coast is notoriously
 such, that a traveller is necessitated to press forwards, whatever may be the time of

 the year, whatever the condition of the country, whatever even his state of health.

 And should he, from sickness or any other unforeseen circumstance, be compelled
 to abandon his journey, he must do so with the painful knowledge that the further
 he retrogrades the more baleful are the districts which he has to traverse and the

 less likelihood there is of his ever reaching the coast."

Synopsis of a proposal respecting a Physico-Geographical Survey of the British

   Islands, partiailarly in relation to Agriculture. By W. Desborough

   CooLEY, Esq. Communicated by Sir R. I. Murchison, G.C.S., F.R.S.

    1. Phj'sical geography, or that branch of knowledge which treats of natural
phaenomena and their laws collectively, as they are modified by geographical position,

furnishes some of the chief elements of agricultural science. It teaches the rela-

tions of comparative climate, without a knowledge of which the results of local

experience cannot be safely applied to any extent in agriculture.

2. It is well known that as climate depends fundamentally on the distribution of

land and water, on the winds, and is affected probably by other influences not so

easily recognised, its changes and gradations deviate widely from the simple rules

deducible from geographical position. The lines marking certain degrees of mean

nmtemperature, of summer heat and of extreme cold, do not                                     in parallels of lati-

tude ; nor are they parallel to one another, but diverge as we proceed from W. to E.

3. The lines above described, and which are denominated respectively Isothermal,

Isotheral and Isocheimal, are, notwithstanding their apparent irregularity, the

fixed boundaries of very interesting natural domains ; for they mark out the several

zones of vegetable life, and the regions suited to the cultivation of different kinds

of plants.

   4. To the determination of these lines may be added observations of some other

phaenomena which also contribute to ascertain the conditions of vegetation ; as rain,

its quantity at different seasons ; humidity without rain ; the temperature of the

earth ; its form, conducting and radiating properties, &c.

  A5. knowledge of these particulars can only be derived from observations in

sufficient number systematically made, and referable to a common standard.

6. The phsenomena of physical geography may be considered as determined in a

general way for the north ol Europe (Denmark), and for the south of Europe also

   7. The anomalies characteristic of the western or oceanic climate increase rapidly
towards its furthest limit. There is a wide difference, in respect of climate, between
the Isle of Thanet and Limerick or Clare ; between Norfolk and Sligo. ITiis is
clearly expressed by the changed aspect of indigenous vegetation as we go west-
wards towards the Atlantic. The exact registration of those differences would be
the means of developing and revealing the natural laws to which the labours of the
husbandman are unquestionably subject.

   8. Where the constants of climate are fully ascertained, the vigorous growth of
every kind of plant will be found to be restricted within limits which depend on
obvious and assignable conditions, and the region suited to the cultivation of any
plant may be accurately defined. Or we may reverse the process and tell the ca-
pabilities of any region.

   9. But in the absence of this kind of knowledge, agriculture is necessarily
founded to a great degree on imitation, without any reference to natural limits.
Examples, recommended by success, are followed in situations where similar suc-
cess is unattainable. Owing to the vague, indeterminate, uncollected and unar-
ranged condition in which the data whereon the agriculturist ought to found his
calculations at present lie, he must either practice empirically or imitate servilely

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

and he is constantly misled by examples, from want of the means of divesting them
of fallacy, by estimating accurately the local element of their character. Through-
out the British Isles the climate varies far more than the system of agriculture yet

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

the farmer may reasonably expect to find his labours more profitable the more

closely his system harmonizes with nature.
   10. The steady progress of scientific agriculture must be preceded by the deter-

mination of the constants of climate. The discoveries of the chemist may then be
turned to account by the farmer, when we shall be able to state in a definite and

authentic manner, the natural conditions of eveiy spot of land in the kingdom.

   11. The time is now come when every country must, with a view to profit,
strenuously endeavour to confine itself to that kind of cultivation for which nature
has especially adapted it ; otherwise it must be a loser in the general and free com-
petition. The loss of protection is the loss of an artificial and forced, and there-
fore, abstractedly speaking, a bad system. If this truth be understood and acted
on by the farmer, the result will be an increase of production more than counter-

balancing the supposed loss.
   12. At the same time there has taken place an increase, in an almost miraculous

degree, of the facilities of internal communication, extremely favourable to that
more active system of interchange which must be expected to arise whenever agri-
culturists, quitting the trammels of a uniform routine, learn to take advantage of

every natural capability throughout the United Kingdom. It is now no longer
necessary or expedient that the farmer should be guided by the demands of the
market in his own locality. The east and west can now exchange produce without

delay or difficulty, and will, no doubt, frequently find their profit in so doing.

    13. In setting forth the demarcations of climate within the British Islands, it
would be desirable to enumerate at the same time all the useful plants and objects
of culture, in different parts of the world, which seem capable of flourishing within
the limits described. This kind of knowledge has a tendency to correct the spirit of
routine and obstinately contracted views which render farmers at times so indocile.

   14. The constants of climate, with all other physico-geographical data, and the
necessary collateral information carefully and clearly arranged, so as to be easily

and universally applicable, ought to be published in the cheapest possible form, and

given to the people.

   The author, acknowledging the invention of a Georama to be due to M. Langlard,
in 1825, stated the objects he had in view in attempting to execute this great re-
presentation of the globe, and the success which he had met with.

   M. Guerin had established in Paris this method of teaching geography, by por-
traying on a large scale the actual features of the land and sea, and offered reasons
in favour of an efibrt to introduce the georama, and the system of instruction con-
nected with it, in London.

                      ZOOLOGY AND BOTANY.

Genei-al Observations on the Geographical Distribution of the Flora of India,

  with Remarks on the Vegetatio7i of its Lakes*. By Piof. Royle, M.D.

The author stated, that though the plains of India were generally considered to
support only tropical vegetation, yet this differed very much both in the different
parts of the country and at different seasons of the year. The plains, moreover,
might be distinguished into moist and dry; in the former, embankments were re-

quired to prevent inundation ; and in the latter, canals for irrigation. In the rainy
season, however, most parts supported a tropical vegetation, and rice could be suc-
cessfully cultivated. So in particular localities, covered with priniEeval forests, some
tropical plants extended even to some of the hot valleys in the neighbourhood of
Cashmere. In the cold weather, however, that is in the winter season, some Euro-
pean plants make their appearance in the plains, especially of North-west India;
and wheat and barley are as successfully cultivated as in Europe. So in ascending
its mountains, especially the Himalayas, every variety of vegetation is met with,
almost as much as in proceeding from the equator to the poles, being perfectly tropical
at the base, European on the ascent, and polar at the summits of its lofty jieaks.
The mountains however are also under the influence of the rainy season, and are,
indeed, for a great part of the season covered with a canopy of clouds in consequence
of the air heated and loaded with moisture in the valleys rising to an elevation
where the temperature is below the point of deposition or dew-point. Considerable
uniformity of temperature and moisture is produced, in consequence of there being
little cooling at night and but little heating during the day, from the sun being
unable to penetrate the cloudy canopy, and we therefore see some of the Balsams,
Scitamineae and Orchideie flourishing at elevations where they could not exist for a
day during the dry heat of summer or the piercing cold of winter.

   In so extensive a territory and diversified a climate there is necessarily a numerous
and a varied flora. The known species of the Indian flora are about 10,000 in
number, the luajority of course characteristic species, but on the Himalaya of an
European type. The vegetation of the different parts of the Indian empire bears a
resemblance to that of different countries where there is a similarity of climate, and
about 250 species which are found in the plains and mountains of India, also occur
in other, some of them very distant parts of the world. The vegetation of different
tropical countries is very similar, and they are subjected to the influence of the same
physical states. The affinity is very perceptible between the botany of the southern
parts of India and that of the Indian Archipelago; the same thing occurs witfi the
flora of southern China ; this therefore resembles that of southern India. Mr. Brown
long since remarked that about 200 species of the Australian flora are also found in
the islands of the southern Pacific as well as in India. Dr. Jack observed at Sin-
gapore niany remarkable points of coincidence between its productions and those of
continental and western India on one hand, and the islands of the Eastern Ar-
chipelago on the other; while the prevalence of some Epacrideae connected it with

that of New Holland. The botany of a great part of the drier parts of India has

a great resemblance to that of the west coast of Africa, as originally remarked by

Mr. Brown, who ascertained that there were about 40 species common to those
distant regions. Dr. Royle in the sanie way remarks a correspondence between the
flora of Egypt and that of the drier parts of northern India, and also that some of

the characteristic forms of the Mediterranean flora approach its north-western

frontier.

   The Himalaya mountains have a tropical vegetation at their base and in their
valleys. At elevations of 6000 and 7000 feet, the climate is temperate, and the flora
corresponds with that of European regions and of the Caucasus, both in its arboreous
and herbaceous vegetation, and in the prevalence of many of the same species which
are found here in our fields. Among them also are several genera, which, until the
last few years, were thought to be peculiar to China, and others to North America.

dentally omitted in the Report for that year.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  75

Several, indeed, of the species are identical with those found in these distant coun-
tries, separated on one hand by the cold and arid deserts of Tartary, and on the other

by the hot and equally arid plains of India and of Africa, as well as the sea. Some

of the peaks however, having the characteristics of polar climates, have also that of
the vegetation ; and it is curious to see all the families and many of the same genera
on these isolated peaks and the remote Melville Island, The northern face of the
Himalayas, or the Tibetan region, has. the closest resemblance in its genera, and even
many of its species, to that of the Atlas mountains and of Siberia, with a sprinkling

of the Mediterranean flora. The author, having taken this general view, remarked
on the correspondence between the vegetation of even distant countries wherever
there was a correspondence in climate, and called attention to the curious resem-
blance in the belts of vegetation at different elevations on the Himalayas with that
of different latitudes, as detailed in the author's ' Illustrations of Himalayan Botany,*
Dr, Royle inquired with reference to some of the geological explanations of successive

--elevations of mountain ranges at what period the vegetation of the peaks, for in-

stance, came to resemble that of polar regions ?

   Among the various subjects, Dr. Royle stated, to which he might draw the notice of

the Section, there was one, he thought, particularly worthy of the attention of those
favourably situated for making observations ; and that was the thick vegetation which
clothes the surface of many of the lakes of India. Dr, Royle stated that he himself
having been chiefly in the north of India, had not seen this vegetation to the extent
in which it existed in the more southern parts of India; but even there it was suffi-
ciently substantial to support numbers of the smaller Graliae, and among them the
Chinese Jacana, But having on one occasion been detained on the banks of some
of these lakes on the north-west of Bengal, he had been much struck with the thick
and varied vegetation of the floating masses with which their surfaces were covered.
These consist of numerous stems, leaf and flower-stalks of a variety of plants closely
interlaced and matted together, the younger parts requiring both light and air for
the performance of their functions, finding their way to the surface; while the older

are pushed downwards, when the more herbaceous parts rot and decay. Among

these plants are most of the gener.T and some of the species even, which are found
in similar situations in Europe; but with them such plants as Mschynomenc aspera

with its thick cellular stem, Convolvulus edulis, Herpestes Monniera, and Ulricularia

stellaris, MarsUea quadrij'olia, 'IVapa bispinosa and 6icor?JW, with i'fiecKioi Polygonum
and Dysopliylla verticillata. The last is particularly interesting from its long jointed

and striated stem with its whorls of leaves. Of most of them it may be observed that

they have little or no root ; the floating stems are long and slender, very cellular, with
the vascular bundles arranged round the circumference, with little or rather with no-
thing like bark. By Dr. Buchanan Hamilton these lakes have been seen of much greater
extent, and covered with a much more dense vegetation, so much so, indeed, that he
describes the floating masses to be sufficiently substantial for cattle to graze upon the
grasses with which they became covered, but that occasionally some fall through and

are lost. He describes, moreover, some bushes and trees as growing in the midst of
the water, and among them a Rose, a Barringtonia, and a Cephalanthus.

    It is hardly possible to witness such vegetation, without calling to mind some of
the explanations given of the formation of coal in the ancient periods of the world,

 and of the indications often presented to us in coal fields of a tropical vegetation, in

situations where no tropical plants could now grow. But without proceeding fur-

ther, it is interesting to compare the vegetation of these lakes with that of the Indian
 coal-fields of Burdwan, which are in their immediate vicinity. The first thing that

 will strike an observer is, that there is no remarkable difference between what was
 the former flora of these localities, and what might take place at the present day.
 One great difference is certainly observable in the Indian coal-fields, and that is the
 immense mass of ferns of which they seem to be composed, while no ferns are at
 present found in their neighbourhood. This however is owing to the country and

 the plains of India generally being open, and therefore extremely hot and dry for

 some months in the year. One fern, Asplenium radiation, is found near Delhi, in the

 sides of wells, in tlie peninsula of India, and also in Arabia. Cheilanlhes dealbata and

 Lygodium microphyllum occur in the neighbouring Rajmuhl hills. But in the same

latitude, and not very distant, where the country is covered with forests, producing
76 REPORT-- 1846.

shade and moisture, numerous ferns, and even tree ferns are found, as in Siihet.
The strata of the Burdwan coal-basins of Ranigunge and Chinakooree yielded the
author abundant remains of the Ranigunge reed, Vertebraria indica, the marsileaceous
genus, Trizygia speciosa, and species of Pecopteris, Glossopteris, &c. G. Browniana
is interesting as having been found in these coal-fields, and according to Brongniart,

in New Holland, in the coal of the Hawkesbury river, near Port Jackson. Zamia

JBuckanani has also been found, and a palm which has been called Zeugophi/Uites
calamoites. With a little more moisture, or even the umbrageous covering of a
forest, these, and other similar plants, would grow with luxuriance in these localities.

    Seeing therefore that heat, with moisture, is capable at the present day of sup-
porting a vegetation similar to that of coal-fields, it would in ancient times only have
required the presence of heat and moisture for the vegetation of coal-fields to have
flourished. If the mass of the earth was in ancient times of a higher temperature,

as is inferred from many geological and zoological phaenomena, it is evident that,
water being present, copious evaporation would necessarily take place as it now does
in tropical countries. If the internal heat were uniform at different points of the
globe's surface, then vvould the evaporation be uniform, and there would be an
absence of those upper and lower currents of the atmosphere which now carry the
heated and moisture-loaded air of the tropics to polar regions, and send the cold air
of the latter towards the equator. As the air, loaded with moisture, ascended into
the atmosphere, it would at length reach an elevation where the reduction of tem-
perature would proceed beyond the point of deposition of moisture, and the whole
of what had been raised by the aid of heat and air would be constantly depositing in
the form of clouds and rain. Moisture would thus everywhere be preserved, and
the cloudiness from the steady action of the heat below and of the cold above would
necessarily also be constant. This would produce uniformity of temperature ; for
radiation from the surface would be obviated, and the solar rays would not penetrate
the cloudy canopy more than they do in rainy weather at the present time. In
6uch a climate, tropical plants would be able to grow equally well in any latitude,
and there might be intermixed with them many others to which dryness was not
essential. In conclusion, the author remarked, such a cloudy canopy may be observed
to a partial extent, even in the present day. Humboldt has described it as occurring
on the Andes ; the author had himself observed it for days together on the Hima-
layas, and partially so during the whole of the rains ; Dr. M'Clelland and others
have described it as occurring for months together in the valley of Assam. If it ex-
isted in northern regions in early times, and the sources of heat were, as Dr. Royle

assumed, internal, then could tropical vegetation not only exist in polar regions
during the summer season, but it would not be destroyed in winter. Growth would
only be stopped, as in the present day, during the darkness of night. As the
internal heat diminished and receded from the surface, the cloudy canopy would by
degrees be at a lower and a lower elevation, until, like the snow-line of the present, it
would be at the surface of the earth in high latitudes. These regions would become
as they are now, and immediately under the influence of external cold, and thus
a glacial might succeed a tropical vegetation. In situations where a lofty peak
raised itself above the canopy of clouds, it would become exposed to the cooling
effects of radiation, and would, as in the present day, attract to itself and condense

much of the floating moisture of the atmosphere, and give origin to mighty and rapid
rivers, which would plough the mountain side and overspread the level plain.

     A Synopsis of the Classification of the Genera of British Birds.

                 By John Hogg, M.A., F.R.S., F.L.S., ^-c.

   The author, having completed his classification of birds,which has been carried out
on the same principles as that portion published in the Report of the Fourteenth
Meeting of the British Association, although in some respects modified from it, gave
in this communication his arrangement of the genera of the birds hitherto met with

in the British Islands.
   It will be seen that he has been compelled to increase the families, and that he

has not inserted the stihfamilies, esteeming them unnecessary, and as too much
lengthening the classification. The author has been very careful in the choice of the
        TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                        77

genera, and he trusts it will be found that he has only retained those which are really
distinct; and whilst he has, after due consideration, thought it requisite to add to
the number of those which British ornithologists usually employ, he has at the same
time reduced those too numerous genera of certain authors, and especially of the
Prince of Canino. Likewise, with regard to subgenera, the use of which the author
must always maintain to be extremely disadvantageous to science, he has wholly
omitted all notice of them.

 On the Figures of Birds observed on a Tomb at Memphis. By J. Bonomi.

 --Since his last communication the author had received the following note from Mr.

Moreing : " The gigantic nests to which you refer, were seen by me in the years

1829 and 1830, during the time I was attached to the Surveying Expedition in the
Red Sea. 1 do not remember having seen them to the south of Cossier, but to the
north of that town, and about the entrance to the Sea of Suez, I observed many.
They were always situated en the small sandy spits and islands with which the Red
Sea abounds ; but you are mistaken if you suppose them to be entirely the work of
the birds which breed in them. They varied both in size and height, and were
evidently formed in the first instance by the wash of the sea heaving up pieces of
broken coral, drift wood, and other rubbish on the extremity of a sand spit. The
birds added to the mound thus formed; and placed their nests on the top, to pro-
tect themselves from the spray in rough weather, i am not clear as to the species
of bird which make use of these singular nests, but believe that more than one kind
of gull avail themselves of the security thus offered."

latter and that of allied species were noticed in detail in the paper, which was
illustrated by figures of the crania of the two forms from Sierra Leone, whence the
specimens were brought by Dr. M'Cormac of Belfast, and presented by him to the
museum of that town.

Recollections of Researches into the Natural and Economic History of certain

BySpecies of the Clupeadce, Coregoni,and Salmonidce.  R. Knox, J!f.Z).

   The author stated that his object was to bring before the Association, and after-
wards before the Academy of Sciences of Paris, a brief view of the inquiries made by

himself and his brother into the natural history of certain inipo'tant gregarious
fishes. His discovery that tlie food of the Vendace or Vengis, of Lochmaben, con-
sisted exclusively of the minute, or rather microscopic Entomostraca inhabiting the
lakes of Lochmaben, was first communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
This discovery, which at the time appeared to the author and to a few others of the
highest importatice in natural history science, had, in his opinion, been misunderstood

by the public, and by most naturalists to whom he had spoken; they adheringf to

the old opinion, that certain fishes, to be afterwards spoken of, preyed on the Ento-
mostraca merely occasionally; at other times on small shell-fish, animalcules, minute
or small fishes, &c., just as they could get them : which opinions the author endea-
voured to show were contrary to the facts. After discovering that fishes so niune-

--rous, so productive and of such a size as the Vendace, subsisted solely on one de-

scription of food, the Entomostraca, a sort of food over which man can exercise

--little control, especially in the ocean, the author knowing that, up to his time, the

real food of the herring and of several other species of fish had never been dis-
covered, prosecuted his inquiries into this important branch. The result was the
discovery that, whilst the Vendace lives exclusively on the Entomostraca, the same
may be said of the herring ; that is, of most of its varieties. The finer kinds of lake
trout, also the Char, live chiefly on the Entomostraca. Dr.Knox gave an outline of

 a superior kind of trout, which he thinks has not been described by naturalists : he
 calls it the " Estuary Trout," brackish waters being the locality it prefers. Its food
 differs from all others he has examined. Should it prove, on future inquiry, that the
 brackish water is the limit to its usual, or natural range, it may furnish a means of de-
 ciding on some difficult legal questions. As regards the celebrated questions raised
 by the Drumlanrig experiments, to which his first memoir gave, as he believes, tiie
 exciting cause. Dr. Knox thinks it not proved that the salmon smolt, that is the young
 salmon, ever remains longer in the river than a few weeks after rising from the gravel
 and thinks that the opinions founded on the Drumlanrig experiments are in this re-
 spect erroneous. 2nd. As regards the question of the parr, no new fact was added
 to its previous history by these experiments ; the parr markings, which may be again
 made visible on scraping off the scales of the smolt, was a fact well-known to anglers
 who at the close of the day found it difficult to say which were true parr and which
 salmon smolts. Mr. Scrope first gave a beautiful drawing of this fact. 3d. For at least
 a hundred years the opinion that the parr was the young of the salmon prevailed
 universally in Annandale. 4th. Willoughby had proved that the salmon-egg may be
 impregnated by the milt of the parr j an experiment curious enough physiologically,
' but otherwise of no practical importance, 5th. Mr. Hogg and a great many others had
 marked the spring parr, and found that they returned to the rivers full-grown salmon.
 Thus no new fact was added to the natural history of the salmon by the Drumlanrig
 experiments. The author declined giving a decided opinion as to the real nature of
 the true parr; but, so far as his observations had yet gone, he believes that there is
 a fish which may be called the true parr, hitherto confounded with many other
 species having par?- markings ; and that this true parr may ultimately prove a hybrid
 between the salmon or salmon trout and certain species of river trout.

will ultimately be preferred to all others ; even to that in wax.

           On the Egg-purse and Embryo of a Species of Myliobatus.
I By J. Couch, F.L.S.

   The author commenced by stating that the egg-purse was found in August 1845,
in the refuse of a trawl-boat by Mr. Peach; and was obtained a few miles south of
Fowey, in Cornwall. After mentioning how little is known of the egg-cases of the
rays and sharks, he minutely described it ; and showed the difference between it and
others, particularly dwelling on the structure of the surface, it being reticulated,
whereas all the other egg purses are smooth. In the egg-purse was a living young

fish, which proves to belong to the genus Myliobatus of Cuvier, characterized by
having the pectoral expansion separated from the head. These, from the direction
of the wings, have been fancifully called sea-eagles. Ruysch, whose figures are for
the most part copies from preceding authors without being improvements on the
originals, but who, at plate 9. fig. 9, has given one tolerably characteristic,
remarks that it has been called " Sea Toad," from the form of the head resembling
that creature ; and the comparison seems appropriate, from the elevated head with
a protuberant and lateral eye. The same author says that this fish is viviparous;
an assertion which the foregoing account shows to be incorrect.

On the Crustacea found by Prof. E. Forbes and Mr. M"=Andrew in their

   Having been requested by my friends Prof. Forbes and Mr. M'Andrew to com-
municate to the Section some observations on the contributions to carcinology made

by those gentlemen in their recent cruises, I gladly comply with their wish; and
although 1 have not to record many actual novelties in the species collected, yet

       TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.     81

several interesting facts have been establisiied which may be of future importance in
their collateral bearing upon matters of more general interest and importance than
the mere discovery of isolated species or forms. In regard however to one entirely
new form, there are some points of peculiar interest to which I shall presently take

an opportunity of referring.

   I have thought it best to consider the species procured under three heads. Of

the species found in the northern cruises of Mr. M'Andrew, in the first instance
alone, and afterwards accompanied by Prof. Forbes, I will enumerate those found
in water under twenty fathoms j and secondly, those in w^ater above that depth;
and thirdly, those which have been found in the excursion which these gentlemen
have recently concluded along the south-western coast. The following is the list of
the more interesting species found principally in Loch Fyne, in water under twenty
fathoms. Of the natatorial type of the Brachyura we have only two species,

Portunus corrugatus and depurator; and amongst the Macrura, Pandalus annulicornis
and a new species of Hippolyte, to which I propose to give the name of H. MacAndrew.
In deeper water the forms are more interesting. In Loch Fyne we have Ebalia Pen-

nantii ; oflfZetland Ebalia Cranckii, a species first discovered on the south-west coast

Eurynome aspera occurs off the Isle of Man ; Atelccydus helerodon, Litliodes arcticvs

in Loch Fyne, off the Isle of Man, and off the coast of Zetland ; Galathea nexa and
its near ally Munida Rondeletii (G. rugosa of authors), both in deep water off Zetland
and in Loch Fyne; and here I v/ould make a remark or two on these two species.
The localities in which they were found upon this occasion prove them both to be deep
sea species, which other observations have also shown. I would also remark that the
possession of a new species closely allied to our native species of Leach's genus Munida,
procured by my friend Mr. Darwin in his voyage, clearly shows the propriety of Leach's
having separated genericaliy the Galathea rugosa from the other species of that

Fabrician genus and as the latter is absolutely more rugose than the species origi-
                                                                                                        ;

nally so designated, I have thought it proper to assign to it a new specific appellation,
and have given it that of Rondeletii, after the first naturalist who distinguished and
figured it. Of Galathea nexa I have only to remark, that there is no one character

to indicate any difference in its habits from its immediate congeners, G. squamifera
and strigosa, and yet both the latter are shore species, where, as far as I know, G. nexa

is always found in deep water. On the latter species was found a parasite of the
genus Bopyrus, which will probably prove to be a new species. Crangon Cata-

phractus {Pontophilus sinnosus of Leach) was found off Zetland, and to these I have
to add Leachia lacertosa of Johnston. But by far the most interesting of all the ac-

quisitions of my friends in their northern cruises, is the discovery of an entirely new

genus of the fossorial type of the Macroura, belonging to the family of the Thalassi-
nidae, but differing in many important characters from all known genera of that

group. In the first place, instead of the monstrous and abnormal character of tlie

first pair of thoracic members, we find them here of nearly the normal construction

of the higher and more typical macrourous forms. But the most remarkable cir-

mcumstance connected with this animal has yet to be mentioned. It was found

one instance at the depth of no less than 180 fathoms, and as at this great depth it
is also fossorial amongst sandy mud, we can scarcely imagine of what use any organs
of vision could be to an animal so situated. I find accordingly, that although it
possesses eyes, they are of no avail as organs of distinct vision, as they possess no pig-
ment, nor, as far as I have observed, have they cornese ; and I presume that the
other parts essential for high powers of sight are also wholly wanting. Amongst a
collection of the crustacea of the coasts of Ireland, formed by Mr. Thompson, and

which he has obligingly placed in my hands, I found a pair of peculiar claws of some

species of Crustacea with which I was wholly unacquainted ; they were taken from
the stomach of some deep-water ground-feeding fish, and I now discover that they
belong to the species in question. Mr. M'Andrew took it alive in Loch Fyne and

the Mull of Galloway, by the dredge; and that gentleman and Prof. Forbes after-

wards obtained it off Zetland.

  The recent cruise of my friends round the western coast has been fruitful in the
acquisition of species of interest, although only one addition has been made by it to

the list of English crustacea. The more usual species, Stenorhynchus tenuirosiris,
Atelecyclus heterodon, Portunus depurator and pusillus, Gonoplox angulata, Eurynome

aspera, and Ebalia Pennantii, require only to be enumerated. Xantho rivulosa, re-
cently discovered to be a British species, is also included. In addition to Pagurus
Prideauxii, I find also two of the new species of Pagurus, which I have recently de-
scribed ; of these two, P. Icevis was first discovered by Mr. Thompson on the Irish

coast ; the other was found off Plymouth by Mr. Codes, and first described by me
under the name of P. Forbesii. Lithodes arctica, a northern form, is also in the

present collection ; but the most interesting amongst tiie fruits of this little expedi-
tion is a fine specimen of a species of the natatory type of the Brachyura, a Portunus

entirely new to our fauna, and which appears to me to be P. longipes of Risso, a
Mediterranean species. It differs from the only specimen I have in my collection
of the latter species, but this may arise from my Mediterranean specimen being very

        On the Structure of the Pycrwgonidece. By Dr. Carpenter.

   The President exhibited a specimen of a beetle {Blaps viortisaga), which has been
found imbedded in some artificial concrete, where it must have been at least sixteen

On the Dissimilarity in the Calcifying Functions of Mollushs, whose organi-
         zation is in other respects similar. By L. Reeve, F.L.S. S^c.

  --Each of the four shell-secreting kinds of Cephalopods the Cuttle-fish, the Paper

--Nautilus, the Pearly Nautilus, and the Spirule or Ram's Horn exhibits a different

method of forming its shell, (this shell differing in microscopic structure, and secreted
from different parts of the system,) although strictly allied in all those elements of ana-
tomical detail which constitute the soft parts or animal frame. Whilst the calcareous
portion of the Cuttle-fish is merely represented by an internal bony plate, consist-
ing mainly of carbonate of lime, the shell of the Pearly Nautilus constitutes a huge
mechanical apparatus, secreted from the mantle enveloping the visceral mass, and

-- --consisting of two separate deposits an outer crust, and an inner nacre for the

purpose of buoying up its inhabitant under the different mutations of pressure to
which it is subjected in its deep region of habitation. The shell of the Paper
Nautilus, on the otiier hand, is a light elastic boat, transparent and permeable to
light, secreted only by the female for the purpose of oviposition ; and in this animal
the office of calcification is transferred, by some mysterious order, from the mantle to
the hinder pair of arms. The Spirule is again totally different, it being contained
 within the mantle of an animal, far larger, in proportion, than that of the other Ce-
phalopods, under circumstances which are at present unknown. The drawing exhi-

bited was taken from a living specimen, recently collected at New Zealand, by Mr.

 Earl, for the first time in perfect condition ; but, as the proprietor is unwilling that
it should be dissected, Mr. Reeve could only state that it enclosed a problem in the
physiological history of the Cephalopods, which it was extremely desirable to solve.

The next point to which he directed the attention of the Section was the curious
 difference which occurs in the growth of the Cowry and the Olive; but this he had
already more fully communicated to the Linnean Society.

   The peculiarities of structure in this animal are chiefly to be found in the repro-

 ductive system, which in several respects presents a remarkable similarity to that of
 Helix. There are well-developed multifid vesicles, and an elongated sac containing
 a singular organ in the form of a curved cylinder beset with numerous palmate spines.

         Notices of some new and rare British species of naked Mollusca.

                 By Joshua Alder and Albany Hancock.

   The first species was a small mollusk belonging to the order Inferobrancldata,
This animal closely resembled the animals figured by M. de Quatrefages under the
generic names of Pelta and Chalides, and placed by him as the lowest forms of his
new order, Phlebenterata. This animal sti'ongly resembles the Limapontia nigra of
Dr. Johnston ; but whether it be identical with that animal or not, the authors were
fully convinced that its characters had been imperfectly understood by M. de Qua-
trefages. The other naked moliusks found by the authors were a new species of
Eumenis, Eolis Drummondi, Eolis alba, and Goniodoris castanea.

         On the Hybernation of Snails. By Rev. T. Rankin, M.A.

   From the author's observations on the habits oi Helix hortensis, he concluded,
1. That snails hybernate. 2. That in their state of hybernation they undergo less
torpor than some other animals which hybsrnate. 3. That they are destructive to

trees as well as to plants.

The object of this communication was to inform naturalists visiting the island what

species they might expect to find in the classes indicated, which are less known than

the other departments of its natural history: lists of these were given. Rare and in-

teresting species were noticed, and the localities where they had been obtained by the

author particularized. Freshwater Bay and the adjacent coast to the east of it, were

stated to be the best localities for the marine invertebrate animals and Algae. Of land

subject as the published memoirs on the zoology of the Swiss lake afforded data on,

Aincluding the birds, fishes, mollusca, and certain families of the insects.  brief no-

of its shores and waters, concluded the paper.

Notes on the Natural History of Corfu. By Captain Portlock, li.E.

  On the Pulmograde Medusce of the British Seas. By Prof. E. Forbes.

   At the Birmingham Meeting, in 1839, the author, in conjunction with Prof. Good-
sir, brought forward a first essay towards an investigation of the British AcalephEe,
selecting the ciliograde species for illustration. Since that time he has yearly availed
himself of every opportunity of pursuing the inquiry, but has abstained from publish-
ing, hoping to gain more complete knowledge of a difficult and much-confused branch
of zoology. Having now however examined more than twice the recorded number
of British Medusfe and become acquainted with numerous new specific and several
new generic forms of great interest to the naturalist, he ventures to lay before the
Section an outline of the data in his possession. These data are in great part due to
the opportunities afforded him by his voyages round the coasts of Britain with his
friend, Mr. M'Andrew. After pointing out the difficulties attending the study of
these animals, and giving a brief view of the present state of the subject generally.
Prof Forbes insisted on the necessity in future of naturalists abstaining from jiublish-
insf imperfect observations respecting them, and urged the adoption of the descrip-
tions of Milne-Edwards, Sars, and VViil as models for those who were ready seriously
to engage in the study. He called attention to the important observations on their
development lately made by his friend Prof. Reid of St. Andrews, and expressed a
hope that ere long the return of the Arctic Expedition would bring a great mass of
new materials of the most accurate description through the observations of Mr. H.
Goodsir. In grouping the British species, Prof. Forbes calls attention to the mutual
correspondence of certain characters; viz. of the condition of the reproductive, di-
gestive, and sensitive systems. He proposes to group all the British Medusae under
such as have hooded and such as have naked ocelli. The first character is combined
with a conspicuous and comparatively complicated reproductive system, and a rami-

--fied gastrovascular apparatus. All the Pulmograda with naked ocelli have simple

vessels, with one exception, a new and most beautiful generic form, the type of a
subsection by itself The remainder form three natural groups, as will be seen in

--the following general table, exhibiting the arrangement of the British Pulmograde

Medusae:

          On the Marine Zoology of Cornwall. By C. W. Peach.

  --The Author had added several new zoophytes to our Fauna one Actinia new

to the British Islands, and named by Dr. Johnston Actinia chrysanthellum. It buries
itself in sand under stones in Fovvey Harbour ; and has twelve tentacula. Several
calcareous Corallines have been also observed, differing from all that are at present
figured. He exhibited, also, a beautiful series of the rare Echinus Flemingii; and a
magnificent specimen of Echinus sphcera ; also another large and fine specimen,
which, if not a new species, differs much from all others, and requires a careful
examination ; he had noticed it in various stages of growth. After noticing the
Eolides and Annelidas, he mentioned the circumstance of having got the Gyvmolepas
 Cuvieri from the bottom of a vessel which came into Fowey Harbour in January of
the present year ; and after minutely describing it, showed that although exposed to
the full influence, for one month, of the freshwater which passed down the harbour
on the receding tide, it continued to thrive long after the whole of the common Bar-
nacle, which accompanied it, had ceased to exist.

  A paper was read from Dr. Bell Salter, giving directions for the guidance of

botanists in their excursion to the Isle of Wight, and giving a list of flowering plants
of interest found in various parts of the island.

On the Embryogeny of Pulmogrades and Ciliogrades.
                 By John Price, M.A.

About the end of June 1845, a great number of the ova of Cyanea aurita and

Medusa capillata? {Stinger) v/ere collected from dotnesticated specimens, arid kept

in sea-water. After moving about for a few days, as ciliated pear-shaped germs,

they became more sedate ;  assumed first  a  square, and then an octagon form                                                                                                         gave
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

out tentacles from each angle; "produced" the convex surface into an adhesive

peduncle; and, being attached thereby to the glass, appeared ever after as whitish

Hydras. I was not then aware of the metamorphoses recorded by Sir I. Dalzel,
Sars, or others ; but was soon informed of them by friends who saw these larvae.

During eighteen weeks I looked earnestly (but sceptically) for the fissiparous or gem-

miparous reproduction alleged by others, but in vain. Subtraction was the only rule

worked in this " Infant School" of mine: of Addition, Multiplication or Division

they seemed to know nothing. By October 4 the countless host were reduced to

three; which, though trebled in size, had not undergone the slightest change in form

from the zoanthoid type first assumed. I need not send Jigui-es of them, as several

scientific friends have pronounced my drawings exactly like those of previous ob-

servers, including now Steeiistrup. However, about the same time, a single (much

larger) individual was discovered adhering to one of the other jars. Under a lens,

this had every appearance of being a compound zoophyte ; in time, five or six sepa-

rate individuals were found to have clustered round the original centre; and subse-

quently, some of these having apparently enlarged and separated, the number by

June 1846 amounted to more than thirty, all very near to the same spot. I say

"apparently" separated, as there was not sufficiently exact attention bestowed upon

the phaenomena to remove, from a scep)tic, all doubts whether the clusters were

more than parasitic adhesions (as in Actinia, or Tubularia indivisa), or whether tiie

new individuals might not have emerged from the sand and other rubbish in the jar,

during unobserved intervals. But I must confess I am all but satisfied that veritable

reproduction has repeatedly occurred. At this moment (about eleven months from

the discovery of the single larger Hydra) I am able, amidst much rubbish which I

am afraid to remove, to count thirty-five, after several losses. One is at least three

times the average size, and shows, if I mistake not, a л?.r-sided mouth (an anomaly,

perhaps, portending an approaching change) with about thirty-two tentacles sur-

rounding, in single row, a considerable circum-oral area. Every one of them remains

as true a zoanth as ever. Some minute turbinates in the same jar are constantly

falling a prey to these "monsters of the deep," and may be seen hanging in chains,

or engulfed in the stomach, whilst the floor is strewed with empty shells. I have

 observed no difference between the embryos of the Cyanea and Med. capAlata ?
 {Stinger') after they lost their respective colours (lilac and tawny) and became
digitate. Both alike make little cruises and rotate, before they fix themselves ; hoth
affect the form of a fist with one or two fingers extended, and revert, by contraction,
to the octagon form. But in the Stinger alone have I seen the germs remaining, for
 some time after exclusion, in the same mulberry clusters in which they had occupied
 the sinuses of the plicate ovary. I have this year, 1846, collected the ova of a very
 different Medusa. These were, at first sight, pyriform like the others ; but after-
wards proved to be (what I have never discovered in any other species) much com-
pressed, and, from a swinging fashion in swimming, were often seen edgeways, and
looked like little Planarice. They are now as decided Hydrce as the others, and can
just be discerned as such with the naked eye. I have only seen the ova of two
other Pulmogrades ; both very minute and of the Moorish-arch form : cdl agree in

being pyriform, locomotive (ciliomotive ?) and peristaltic, which last habit I conceive
to be the means of steering.

  --Embryogeny of Ciliogrades, Of the true Beroe I can say very little : I am p7-etty

sure I have had their ova two or three times, looking very like those of Cydippe
pileus, but never succeeded in hatching them. However small the Beroe, and I
sometimes meet with them as small as a pin's head, it differs in no respect but size
from the adult, having eight ciliamina (ciliary arches). But C. pileus (a much com-

moner animal at Birkenhead) has afforded me repeated opportunities of watching
the whole process, though with many interruptions. One first sees a little darkish

but reflecting spherule in the centre of a proportionably very large, transparent, and

--scarcely visible pellicle : it very soon looks granidar like boiled sago tvithin and

ivithout ; then shows a few obscure cilia enlarges at one end, and becomes accu-
rately acorn-shaped, with only four arches of cilia, which are, towards the base (or

mcup of the acorn), immensely large proportion, much-curved, and move wj-y slowly

in general. The mouth is large, and appai'ently linear instead of the convolvulus
form of the adult, and seems to take in certain granular bodies which float within the
pellicle. The two very long trains are extended even in ovo, where there is ample
room for "little master" to play about (it is amirsery rather than a, shell); the trains
are gathered into a knotty bunch instead of a cork-screw circus, appear to have no
side filaments, and certainly have no internal sheath for their reception. After
escaping from the shell, they exhibit greater activity, with startling alternations of
extreme, crawling slowness during the extension of the trains, and the most fantastic

capers after suddenly retracting the latter. These creatures are just visible to the
naked eye, and as they are not easy to keep alive, I have never seen the next step
of their metamorphosis, but have often met with Cydippes of the size of hempseed in
the normal form, with convolvulus mouths, eight ciliamina, fringed trains retractile

into pockets, and all the airs and graces of the full-grown individuals.

    On the Quasi-osseous System of Aealeplice. By John Price, M.A.

   The author described minutely the tessellated structure of the polygonal central
patch in the great brown Stinger {Medma capillata ?), and noticed the degrep of
analogy which this structure may be thought to offer to the osseous arrangements in
higher grades of life. He offered suggestions as to the respiratory and nutritious
processes in Rhizostoma, and presented some ground for doubt regarding the true

nature of the supposed eyes of Acalephae.
   The author appended notices regarding Beroe {pvataX), especially its internal

contractions, and recommended the examination of the structure of this singular
Acaleph, by microscopic investigation of the process of natui-al decay, "which in
Acalephae is apt to take place symmetrically, so that the anatomy is laid bare bit by
bit, whilst vitality remains almost unimpaired in the very last shred of the frame,"

interesting remarks and queries occur.]

          On the Cultivation of Silk in England. By Mrs, Whitby.
  A letter was received from Mrs, Whitby, of Newlands near Lymington, Hants,

wherein she stated to the Association the encouraging result of an experiment, begun

ten years ago on her own estate j and she exhibited specimens of raw and manufac-
 tured silk with full details. She began by planting various sorts of mulberry-trees,
 of which she finds the dwarf Philippine is by far the best, as producing more leaf, and
 (from the facility with which its cuttings are struck) more easily propagated than any
other. Of the various races of the silk-worm, she finds that by procuring the eggs
 of the large Italian sort, of four changes, she obtains as great a proportion, and as
good a quality of silk, as they do in Italy or France. The testimony of several emi-
 nent manufacturers in- London, Manchester and Coventry attests this ; and Mrs.
Whitby has had the satisfaction of presenting twenty yards of rich and brilliant da-
mask, manufactured from silk grown at Newlands, to Her Majesty Queen Victoria,
who was graciously pleased to accept of this indication of a new source of riches in

 her dominions.
    After making every allowance for occasional unfavourable seasons, and labour,

 machinery, outlay of money, &c., it will be found that land laid out for furnishing

--food for this valuable caterpillar, will yield at least г20 per annum.

    The computation is briefly as follows : 'One oz. of eggs produce 40,000 worms,
 which require HOOlbs. of leaves; deducting 25 percent, for accidents, there will re-
main 30,000 cocoons weighing 75 lbs., which at 10 lbs. per cwt. of silk, will yield
7i lbs. of the best raw silk (besides refuse), equal, at 23s. per lb., to SI. 12s. 6d. One
 acre of land bearing 1225 plants of six or eight years' growth, yields 4900 lbs. of
 leaves, and will consequently feed 3Joz. of eggs, which at 8Z. 12s. 6d. nett per oz.
 as above stated, yields 301. 3s. 9d., and deducting 33 per cent, for labour, machinery,
 &c., 10/., there will remain a final profit per acre on 320z. of eggs, 20/.

    On the Structure q/" Cristatella mucedo. St/ Prof. Allman, M.R.I.A.

    In this beautiful little Bryozoon, added to the Irish Fauna by Prof. Allman,
 several interesting peculiarities of structure were detailed. Of these the author con-
 sidered one of the most important to be the detection of a small roundish body,
 situated at the upper end of the pharynx, and which he believed to be a nervous
ganglion. The author also dwelt upon the existence of a delicate calyciform mem-
 brane which unites the bases of the tentaculse, and is of very general occurrence
 among the freshwater Bryozoa. This structure he considered peculiarly interesting,
 as it tended vvitli other facts to homologize the tentacular system of the Bryozoa
 with the branchial sac of the true Ascidiae. Several peculiarities in the digestive
 and muscular systems were also alluded to, the nuiscular fibre being shown to be
 obscurely striated, and to exhibit a tendency to break itself into discs. The ova in
 their young state are inclosed in a ciliated membrane, and the hooked spines with
 which, in their more mature condition, they are furnished, are developed within the
 ciliated investment, being of subsequent growth, but yet fully formed previously to
the ova quitting the parent. The facts detailed in the present communication were

luscan nature of the Bryozoa.

          Observations on the true Nature of the Tendril in the Cucumber.
                             Bij T. Bell Salter, M.D., F.L.S.

    While it is now admitted that the tendril is a modification of some essential part
 of the plant, it is in most plants sufficiently obvious what organ is so altered, as for

 instance, the leaf or petiole in the leguminose plants, the peduncle in Passiflora,
,and the primary axis of the plant in the vine; in this family it is not so obvious.

In the monstrous state of a cucumber [)lant now shown, where all the parts appear
in a more elementary form than in its natural state, we have this question satisfac-
 torily solved. While the female flower is resolved into an aggregation of thick
 adherent leaves, and the staminate flowers into an aggregation of leaves not adherent,
 we see the tendril as a simple slender leaf, and not abranch bearing any aggregation
 of leaves, as it would be were it any modification of a branch, or any part of the in-
 florescence. It would appear from this that the tendril in this genus and family

represents the leaf, while the developed leaf next to it is the first leaf of a sessile
 axillary branch.

On an undescribedAlga allied to Coleochaete scutata. By Professor Allm an.

   This paper contained a description of an alga discovered in certain subalpine streams
in Ireland. It presents the appearance of small perceptibly elevated discs of a dark
green colour, varying in size from about half a line to three lines in diameter, and

attached to the upper surface of stones in the most rapid part of the current. When

several plants grow upon the same stone they often become confluent, and form
patches of indefinite figure and extent. Each plant is of a firm, almost cartilaginous
consistence, and an ordinary lens shows it to be furnished with a margin divided into
rounded lobes. Under a higher magnifying power the structure is found to consist
of numerous disc-shaped laminae, placed one over the other with an imbricated
arrangement, the margin of each projecting beyond that of the superposed lamina.
The lowest lamina is always the youngest, and each consists of many dichotomously
branched series of nucleated cells, which radiate from a common centre, and are
united at their edges into a continuous frond. In no specimens, though examined
at various seasons and at different stages of development, were the sheathed setae of
Coleochcete detected. From the only described species of Coleochcete, therefore, the
present plant differs in its lobed outline, in its imbricated structure, in its firm con-
sistence, in its large size, in the absence of seta;, and in its habitat. The author be-
lieves it to be generically distinct from all hitherto described forms, though standing
near to ColeochcBte or Phyllactidium ; he proposes for it the name of Sorodiscus

rivularis.

On the means of obviating ilue ravages of the Potato Disease, by raising fully-
  grown healthy Potatoesfrom seed in one season. JByW. Hogan, M.R.I.A.

   The method was discovered by M. Zander of Boitzenburg, who has practised it

for six years with the greatest success*.

   The following extracts are from M. Zander's published letter :
    " I first raised potatoes from seed .six years ago. I sowed an eighth of an ounce,
and obtained nearly seven sacks of fully-grown, perfectly sound potatoes, although
in the same year almost all the potatoes in my neighbourhood were affected by
pock-mark and dry-rot. I have regularly raised potatoes from seed ever since,
and they have remained sound during the whole time, and last year (1845), when
the disease had spread over all Europe, and attained the greatest virulence in this
neighbourhood, those potatoes which I had previously raised from seed, as well as
those of the preceding year, continued perfectly exempt from disease. I have given
potatoes raised from лeed to my friends and acquaintances, and those have also
remained perfectly free from the universally prevailing disease. From an ounce
of seed you may raise upwards of fifty sacks of potatoes : the smallest crop I ever
had from half an ounce was twenty-four sacks.

  --" The seed is saved in the following manner : the berries should be gathered in

autumn, before the frost sets in, and be preserved in a dry place, where frost cannot
reach them, until the end of January, when the berries should be broken by the
hand and placed in a tub or other vessel for six or eight days to ferment; water should
then be thrown on them and well-stirred in order to separate the pulg and husks
from the seed, which should then be dried and cleaned, and kept in a warm dry
place until the middle of March.

   " In the middle of March or beginning of April, the seed should be thinly sown in a
hot-bed, and by the middle of May there will be fine healthy plants which may be
jjut out into the field ; care should be taken to put them out before they form tu-
bers, and tlie seed-bed should be kept moderately moist while they remain in it.
They should be planted out after rain, and be put at about the same distance from
one another as potatoes generally stand in the field."

  --The foregoing extracts contain two most important statements : one, that it is

possible to raise an abundance of fully-grown potatoes from seed in one season ; and
the other, that such potatoes will resist and escape the generally prevailing disease,
for six years at least. Mr. Hogan then entered into a statement of his own observa-
tions on this mode of cultivation in two widely-separated localities in Germany,

   * In a report made by M. Zander, he states that his plan was equally successful with the

crop of 1846.
--90 REPORT 1846.

which perfectly confirmed M, Zander's statement as to the first point, but sug-
gested that many experiments must be made in various places and under various
circumstances, before it can be certainly said, that potatoes raised in this way would
resist and escape the disease, though he expressed his hope and expectation that

they would.

                              Ott proposed Substitutes for the Potato.

                    By T. D. Morriss-Stirling, F.R.S.E.

   The Jerusalem artichoke, Scorzonera, and plants containing starch in their roots,
were proposed; and as a means of improving the potato plant itself, it was suggested
that hybrid plants should be produced between the Solanum tuberosum and some

hardy species of Solanum, such as the Solanum nigrum.

   Dr. Lankester exhibited the woody fibres of the Lavatera arborea which had been
sent to the Section by Capt. Peterson through Capt. Ibbetson; with the suggestion
that it might be of use in the arts and manufactures of the country. This plant
grows abundantly on some spots in the Isle of Wight, and could probably be easily

cultivated.

       On the Development of Cells. By A. Henfrey, F.L.S.

   The author believed that in all cases these were developed from a folding-in of
the primordial utricle. He was inclined to regard the evidence hitherto produced
of the production of cells from cytoblasts as inconclusive. He did not think that

the cytoblasts were the eflScient cause of the development of the new cells ; but

that their presence in certain cases of multiplication of cells by division had led
Muller, Schleiden and others to a misconception of their function. The cytoblast

is usually present at an early period of cell-life and of the full size; and cell-division

takes place, or commences, at an epoch when the cytoblast completely fills that

portion of the primordial utricle which is about to form a new cell. When the

utricle expands to form a cell, the cytoblast remains either on its walls or free in the

Wecavity.  have here an appearance simulating the development of membranes

from a cytoblast as described by Schleiden ; and it is probable that these appearances

have given rise to Schleiden's theory.

Comparison oftlie Periods of the Flowering of Plants in the early Spring of
   IS-ie, in the Botanic Garden of Belfast, and the Jardin des Planles at

  Paris. By W. Thompson*.

The comparison showed that the same species flowered much earlier at Belfast

than at Paris; though at the latter locality the spring of 1846 was the earliest of the

last forty years. It was suggested that returns of this kind from the Botanic Gardens

of the United Kingdom, and these again compared with similar catalogues from the
public gardens on the continent, would possess much interest in various points of

view.      __╗^_

       Notes on additions to tJie Flora of Ireland. By W. Thompson.

  A few species of phaenogamic and cryptogamic plants were noticed as additions to

the flora of Ireland, and specimens exhibited. The phaenogamic species were chiefly

collected by Mr. D. Orr, foreman in the Belfast Botanic Garden.

  Notice of the Shea Butter-Tree groiving in Africa. By J. F. Duncan.

   This tree was first discovered by Mungo Park. It produces from its seeds a

quantity of oily matter, which is used by the natives as butter. It is as hard as

tallow, and may be used for making it. Some candles made of the oily secretion

were exhibited to the Section and burnt ; where they gave as good a light as those
from anj' other oleaginous compound used for this purpose.

   Mr. J. F. Duncan forwarded a fruit in many respects resembling an orange which

he had observed to grow abundantly in Africa. When pulled from the tree in a

ripe state the interior substance is about tiie consistence of an orange, and is con-
sidered superior to anything manufactured in England, as soap.

On the Foliage and Inflorescence of the genera Phyllanthus and Xylophylla.
                               By B. Clarke, F.L.S.

   The leafy appendages from which the flowers in most of the species of these genera
spring have been described by authors in general, up to the present time, as branches.
The author, having examined their structure and relations closely, has come to the

conclusion that they are in almost all cases true leaves. Several species of the
genera Phyllanthus and Xylophylla were described, and the author's views of their
structure explained by drawings. In conclusion, he suggested whether the additional
leaf-buds which are sometimes seen in the axils of leaves do not originate from the
base of the petiole. Such buds occur in the genus Rubus ; in some species of which
the additional bud is developed beneath the axillai-y bud instead of on one side of it.

   The following letter from the Hon. F. Strangways was communicated by Sir R.I.

--Murchison, G.S.St.S. : In the neighbourhood of Alexandersbad,near\Vunsiedel, a

few miles south of the road from Bayreuth toEger, in the Fichtelgebirge, is a moun-

-- --tain called now the Louisenberg formerly the Luchsberg which is much visited by

strangers on account of some of its natural peculiarities. It appears not to consist of
any mass of rock in situ, but to be an enormous heap of disconnected, but rounded
fragments of granite, thrown confusedly upon one another, leaving arches and pas-
sages and grottoes of various sizes wherever the interstices have not been filled up
with smaller pieces, together with granitic gravel. The whole is so overgrown with
woodjthat, except where paths have been made,it is difficult to penetrate. The round-
ing of the blocks seems to be rather the effect of disintegration than of water. One of
the caverns or chambers, formed by a single flat table of granite resting horizontally,

as a roof, upon other masses, is a tolerably exact circle of nearly sixty feet English in
diameter. Many that penetrate deeper into the mountain or mass of rocks are mere
crevices; but they present a remarkable phaenomenon, which is not observable in the
more open ones. This phaenomenon consists in a pale but beautiful greenish-yellow

phosphorescent light, which, as the observer proceeds into the cave, becomes stronger
and stronger, till it can be compared only to that of hundreds of glowworms lying

close together on the ground ; and it is singular that the light, however strong it
may be, does not assume the appearance of a sheet, but always seems to lie in spots,

though close together. On taking up some of the mould upon which this phospho-
rescence appears to rest and bringing it to daylight, its own light, as might be ex-

pected, is overcome, and disappears ; nothing being seen in the hand but the black
earth, a little sand, some minute whitish cryptoganiic powder (?) and a few fronds

of a very small filmy moss of a pale, transparent green colour. On taking the mould
back into the darkness, the phosphorescence re-appears, but so much dimmed that it

should seem as if the brightest disturbance had a tendency to dissipate it, and that it
required time and repose to form or collect it anew. The traditions of the country,
or rather the superstitions, have long pointed out this mountain both as the reposi-
tory of gold and precious stones, and as the abode of evil spirits, or Kobolds, who
amuse themselves by tantalizing credulous mortals with the view of gems and riches
without end, which, when touched, are turned into dross or vanish from the sight.
The explanation given by this phaenomenon to such a belief, current among a simple
and imaginative people, is evident. The original name of the mountain itself,
Luchsberg, i, e. Lynxberg, is somewhat expressive of this peculiarity.

On the Physiology of the Encephalon. By W. B. Carpenter, M.D.,F.R.S.

The object of this communication was to bring under consideration the inferences
to which we are led by the study of Comparative Anatomy, in regard to the functions
of different parts of the human encephalon. He first pointed out that our com-

parisons need not be restricted to vertebrated animals, since the ganglionic centres

of invertebrata may be shown to be analogous with certain portions of the cerebro-
spinal system of the vertebrata. He stated it to be a universal fact, that all organs
of special sense have distinct ganglionic centres, which must be regarded as the
instruments of their respective sensations and as the sources of motions directly
connected with those sensations ; and that the whole cephalic mass of invertebrated
animals was composed of a collection of such ganglia, without any vestige (except
in the highest) of cerebrum or cerebellum. These organs make their first appear-
ance in fishes ; and bear at first but a small proportion to the chain of sensory
ganglia, which forms the anterior termination of the spinal cord. In fishes we find
distinct olfactive, optic and auditory nervous ganglia, together with thalami optici
and corpora striata, the degree of development of which has no reference to that of

the cerebrum ; in fact, the bodies usually called the cerebral lobes of fishes are (ex-
cept in the sharks, &c., which have vestiges of cerebral hemispheres) almost entirely
composed of the homologues of the corpora striata. Hence Dr. Carpenter con-
sidered that these bodies, instead of being appendages to the cerebrum, really belong
to the group of sensorial ganglia, and are to be regarded as together making up the

ganglionic centres of common or tactile sensation, and of the movements prompted
or directed by it. This chain of ganglia, although comparatively small in man, with
reference to the bulk of the cerebral hemispheres, still exists in him, and must be
regarded as the instrument of the same operations as those to which it ministers in

the lower animals. Arguing from actions in the latter, and analogous phsenomena

in man in health and in disease, the author attributes to the sensory ganglia the
formation of sensations, and the origination of respondent movements, which may
be distinguished as consensual. To this category the purely instinctive actions of the
lower animals, which seem executed without any idea of purpose, and in simple

respondence to the promptings of sensation, appear referrible ; together with a variety
 of actions in man, such as that of yawning, from the sight or sound of the act in

another. Dr. Carpenter hence endeavoured to show that we must regard the
 cerebrum as the instrument of the formation of ideas, of the memory of ideas and
 sensations, and of the intellectual processes founded upon them, which terminate in
an act of the will ; and he pointed out that ideas may produce the same effect on
 muscular movement as sensations themselves, as when the suggestion of the idea of
yawning induces the action. He also showed how the anatomical connexions of
 the cerebrum with the sensory ganglia would cause its communicating fibres to exert
 an influence on the latter, corresponding with that which is effected by the sensations
 directly received from the organs of sense. With respect to the emotions, he endea-
 voured to show that they may be regarded as compound states resulting from the
 simple feelings of pleasure and pain associated with certain ideas, or classes of
 ideas : the feelings of pleasure or pain he would locate, with the sensations which
 commonly excite them, in the sensorial ganglia ; whilst the formation of the ideas,
 which are essential parts of the emotions and propensities, is clearly a cerebral ope-
 ration : and he showed, in conclusion, how this view of the functions of the principal
 parts of the encephalon harmonizes with the known duplex action of the emotions,
 first in producing involuntary movements, and secondly in stimulating and influencing

 the reasoning processes.

           On the Relations of Sensation to the higher Mental Processes.
                          By R. Fowler, 3LD., F.R.S.

    The author observed that man, when viewed as a whole, should be considered as
 consisting of a body, constituting the instrument of the mind, as the telescope is of

 the eye, adjustible but not adjusted : that its indications are perceived through the
TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  93

medium of the muscular sense, as the images reflected, or refracted in telescopes are

the signs of external objects to the eye. Animals have adjustments ready-made :

man has to learn his. To see and to touch, as an artist, or even in the common
usages of life, a man just couched is as an infant ; till he can adjust he sees, as we

do with an unadjusted telescope, merely a vague light. This gives rise to search.
To see with intelligence, we must look, that is, exert the combined adjustments : this
constitutes an appreciable distinction between sensation and perception. The unad-
justed impressions pass the mind as vague trains of thought, linked and associated

sequences, the machinery of reveries and dreams. That searching to obtain well-
defined perceptions is effected by adjustments, attention to our own working observa-
tion will afford abundant proof; but a more protracted attention is necessary to
prove, and to convince a man, that his memory and powers of conception equally
depend on the mind's perception of a reiteration of the adjustments of sensation. But
that this is so we have proof, in the corporeal actions induced by conception being
like those produced by sensation in the presence of the objects. Thus conception of

--savoury food excites secretion in the salivary glands the conception of an insult

excites the feelings and gestures of anger, &c. In the power of forming and giving
fixity of tenure to conceptions men differ widely. It is to this power Dr. Johnson
alludes, when, in his Tour to the Hebrides, he says, that whatever can make the past,
the distant and the future prevail over the present, raises us in the scale of thinking

beings. Now Dr. Darwin and Sir David Brewster have shown that these concep-

tions are effected by adjustments of the body; in other words, that the "mind's eye"
is, in fact, the body's eye. To have vivid conceptions disposable by our volition,
forms the orator, the poet, the sculptor and the painter. After numerous illustra-
tions of this faculty and allusions to it by the poets, the author stated that these
sensations, perceptions and conceptions do not exist in an insulated state ; the ad-
justments by which they are affected are so linked and associated by retransmissions

through the brain to the other organs of sense, that they reciprocally call up each
other. This linked association of adjustments he took to be the machinery by which
the association of our ideas is effected, and that the propensity of our structure to these
functional adjustments constituted all we had of ideas which had been denominated

innate ; and he considered that this reciprocating perception from different sources
of sensation (as the eye and ear) gave birth to the ideal theory of " species, images
of forms and colour of things without their matter," of the old metaphysicians. In
conclusion, the author contended that Mr. Hume's opinion on the non-existence of
the idea of power, and of cause and effect (except as antecedent and consequent),

and the arguments and facts adduced against that opinion, receive an elucidation

from the consideration of the modes of action of the muscular sense, but of which

neither Mr. Hume nor his critics could at that time have been apprised, as the dis-

covery had not been completed.

   Yet these impressions (our guides in all corporeal exertions) belong alike to men
and all inferior animals, and must have been at all times, and in all places where
muscular exertions have occurred. Yet such is the law of sensation, that the mind
passes this muscular feeling unnoticed, and attends solely to his perception of the
object by which the sensation was excited. Thus the attention of the seaman who
heaves the lead is directed only to the contact of the lead when it touches the bot-
tom. Every boy who throws a stone, every horse on its approach to a leap, estimates
its power by these feelings, although thinking at the time only of the distant object
of its aim. I think any man capable of making his sensations the subjects of his
thoughts, may satisfy himself that our ideas of cause and power have their source
in these and like evanescent muscular feelings or impressions.

    Is it not, too, from similar feelings of muscular power, recognised from day to day
to be the same which we have felt from our earlier years, that we are assured of the
continuance of our personal identity ?

          On the Cause of the Stood's Circulation through the Liver.
                          By Charles Searle, M.D.

   After alluding to the powers which circulate the blood in the system generally, the
author declared it to be still a problem by what combined forces the portal circula-
--94 REPORT 1846.

--tion was carried on in the liver, one cause of the general circulation being appa-

rently absent, namely, the oxygenation of the blood in the arterial system, in the

portal system the blood being deemed wholly venous. The solution of the problem

depended, he thought, on the fact that the stomach and bowels were (like the cuta-

neous) a respiratory surface, by which the portal blood becomes oxygenated to the

necessary degree. In support of this view he adduced the experiments of Majendie,

who found eleven per cent, of oxygen in the stomach of criminals examined after

decapitation, and  carbonic acid  and  nitrogen in  the intestines                                                               the  source of this
                                                                                                                              ;

oxygen he believes to be the air swallowed with the food and saliva, and in combi-

nation with cold water. This oxygen he believes to be absorbed by the veins and

lacteals, and communicated as a source of power to the portal vessels. He deemed

the absorbing power of the gastric and mesenteric veins to be increased by the dimi-

nution of the quantity of blood in the vessels by the secretion of bile. In conclusion,

he thought the ruminant animals required an additional supply of oxygen to main-

tain the respiratory function over their large gastro-intestinal surface, and that this

was supplied from their peculiar function of rumination.

        On some Diseases resulting from the immoderate Use of Tobacco.
                             By T. Laycock, M.D.

   The diseased action from the continuous and immoderate use of this poisonous
substance Avas observed to pervade the mucous membranes of the digestive and re-
spiratory systems, producing congestive inflammation of the fauces and stomach,
and of the nares, frontal sinuses, larynx, and bronchial lining of the lungs. Gas-
tritis with the symptoms of aggravated indigestion and heemoptoe were among the
worst results of these affections ; but it was found in many cases to produce disease

--of the circulating organs and of the nervous system weakening the force and regu-

larity of the heart's action, and diminishing the intellectual and moral powers. In
conclusion. Dr. Laycock read a report from Dr. Wright confirming his own obser-
vations, and containing experiments demonstrating the physiological action of the
drug on animals.

pean and native, with few exceptions, appear to have got through the current husiness

of each year ; and to a greater or less extent to have diminished the arrears of former

years.

The administration by natives appears to have worked quite as well as before

from ninety-seven to ninetj^-nine per cent, of the whole civil business having been

performed by them ; and sufficieiitlj' well performed, if the amount of appeals, and

Anumber of reversals of decisions, be the standards by which to judge.                         decided

improvement has taken place in the shortening the average duration of suits in all
the courts under the Bengal and Agra governments ; in the highest court of appeal,

(corresponding to Chancery) from one year seven months and eight days in 1841, to
one year and one month in 1844. The Zillah and city judges (European) shortened

the time of their average decisions from ten months and eleven days in 1841, to seven

months and seven days in 1844; the principal Sudder Ameens from seven months

and ten days, to five months and twenty-two days; the Sudder Ameens from eleven
months and fourteen days, to five months and five days ; and the Moonsiffs from five
months and nineteen days, to four months and fourteen days, from 1841 to 1844 re-

spectively; the last three descriptions of judges being natives. The Agra judges

--were a still shorter average time in their decisions than those of Bengal, the Su-

preme Appellate Court reducing its time from seven months and thirteen and a half
days, to six months and eighteen days; the European Zillah judges from seven
months and three days, to four months and sixteen days ; the principal Sudder Ameens
from three months and eleven days, to three months and seven days ; and the Moon-
siffs from three months and one day, to two months and twenty-one days. The Sud-
der Ameens had slightly increased their former average time.

The value of the litigated property before the tribunals in Bengal, varied from

7,845,178/. in 1841, to 3,006,154/. in 1844; before those of Agra, for the same

periods, from 1,637,941/. to 1,442,861/.

Colonel Sykes observes, that an opinion obtains in England, and even in India,

that the land-tax is oppressive to the cultivators or farmers ; but under the Bombay

government for the years 1842, 1843, and 1844, the only farmers or cultivators in
jail at the instance of government for arrears of land-tax were nine, five, and two
only for the respective years ; and as this was out of a population of between six and

seven millions of souls, it cannot be believed that the laud-tax is of the oppressive

character represented.                                          ^^^^^

Statistics of the Criminal Courts of India. By Lieut.-Colonel Sykes, F.R.S,

The author submitted detailed tables of the operation of the various criminal

courts under the four governments of Bengal, Agra, Madras, and Bombay. The

want of a common form for the returns from the several courts under the respective

governments occasioned discrepancies in the amount of the information suppUed;

a drawback upon the utility of the returns which can be easily remedied. In the

Bengal courts, out of 322,394 prisoners tried in the four years, from 1841 to 1844,

both inclusive, 112 offenders were condemned to death, being only 0-034 per cent, of

the whole offenders, or one in 2878 criminals. In the Madras courts 271,842

offenders were tried during the four half-years, commencing with the second half of

1842 and ending with the first half of 1844, both inclusive ; of this number eighty-

four were condemned to death, or 0"031 per cent., or one in 3236 criminals ; a
singular approximation to the proportions under Bengal. In the Bombay courts, in

The criminal courts of Bengal, Agra and Bombay, permit of appeals against their

sentences to the Nizamut or Foujdary Adawlut, the supreme criminal court; and the

importance of this privilege is manifested b}' the fact, that the Nizamut Adawlut of Bom-

bay, in 1843, annulled ninety sentences and mitigated eighty-nine others out of 1021

appealed. Important modifications or revocations of sentences appear also to have
taken place under the Agra government. The Bengal returns do not show the

decisions in appeals ; and, under the Madras government, the returns do not indicate

that appeals are permitted.

imprisonments were discouraged.

Statistics of the Government Charitable Dispensaries of hidia.

                  By Lieut.-Colonel Sykes, F.R.S.

The chief object of the author was to show the practical good resulting from the

education afforded in medicine and surgery to young natives of India, principally in

the Medical College of Calcutta. Young natives, having passed certain prescribed

examinations, were appointed to the charge of government charitable dispensaries

benevolently established by the government of India in Bengal and the north-west
provinces. The dispensaries, seventeen in number, were respectively in charge of

the native sub-assistant surgeons ; but under the control of the civil surgeon of the

station, or that of the superintending surgeon of the district. Both the superintcnd-

ant and the native sub-assistant surgeons were directed to report half-yearly, for the

information of government, to the medical board at Calcutta. These reports were
made in English, and several of the reports of the natives were not distinguishable

from those of the highly-educated European surgeons, whether in grammatical con-

struction, technical phraseology, perspicuity in expression, or rational observation.

Some of the reports embraced the writer's views upon the drainage and sanatory con-
dition of towns; the influence of intramural or proximate burial-grounds (Mahome-

dan) upon public health                                                                                                            the meteorology of the seasons, as influencing disease ;  the
                                                                                                                                ;

superstitions and prejudices of caste in the people, as debarring the ^leople from de-

--riving the full benefit of the dispensaries; upon the use of the dispensaries as schools

of instruction ; these, and many other topics, are ably noticed in several of the re-

ports. All the sub-assistant surgeons use the knife with dexterity and success, am-

putating limbs, cutting for the stone, couching for cataract, &c. ; and some of them

send drawings of the stones they extract; others report upon the introduction and use
of new medicines (unknown to English pharmacy) ; and one of them (Ham Narraen
Dofs, of Cawnpoor) gives a botanical description, and sends a drawing of a plant (a

Convolvulus) producing a new medicine, a substitute for rhubarb ; others give a che-
mical analysis of the new medicines they introduce, and sometimes re-analyse

medicines with metallic bases used by the hakeems or physicians of the countrj'. In

all, 232 new medicines are brought to notice. The reports are accompanied by tabu-

lated returns of the diseases treated, arranged under fifty-eight heads, with a column

of ' alii morbj,' which, in spite of the fifty-eight diseases enumerated, is very compre-

hensive in its character. The returns from the majority of the dispensaries are for

six half-yeai-s, and these Colonel Sykes has arranged, added up, and analysed. The
results showed that the " House List" and the " Out Patient" practice embraced

267,456 cases, of which 168,871 were cured, 2417 died, and 96,768 ceased to attend,

and the results were not known. Colonel Sykes treats in detail of local peculiarities

--in the development of diseases. He concludes his paper with the following observa-

tions: " In conclusion, it has been contemptuously said, and is still said, that in case
the Company's government in India were swept away, not a monument of its existence

would remain to attest its former state and power. No doubt the governments that

have preceded the British in India left sufficient proofs of their existence. The early

Buddhist and Hindoo aulhoiities have indeed left prodigious monuments of their wealth,
of their power, of their perseverance, and of their religious enthusiasm, in their mighty
cave-temples, and vast religious edifices. The Mahomedans, too, have studded the

lands with their magnificent maiisolea, testifying rather to their pride tlian their piety.

And what have the British done? I say that we have raised greater and more lasting

monuments than all these. One small extract from a report of a native sub-assistant

mysurgeon shall justify  assertion.  Chimman Loll, of Delhi, says

' 1st August 1841. One hoy, about twelve years of age, who had been blind from
       cataract in both eyes from the age of two years, was operated on by couch-
       ing, and restored to sight.'

   " The faculty given to a single native to perform the godlike office of restoring the
blind of his countrymen to sight, is a more glorious monument than all the works of
art that human pride or human ambition have ever burthened the earth with ; but
when we find scores of such individuals endued with such a faculty, and thousands,
nay tens of thousands possibly, the recipients of the blessing they can confer; when
we find the medical board of the Bengal government reporting to government on the
22d August 1843, 'We have every reason to believe that the benevolent intentions
of government in founding these institutions (the dispensaries) have been fully realized;

and we feel confident that future annual results will add to the intrinsic value of the
dispensaries, which are so well adapted, by their internal ceconomy, to obtain the con-
fidence of the native inhabitants. Many have had their sight restored, others have
been cured of hydrocele, and relieved when in the last stage of dropsy. Several also
have derived effectual relief from the successful operations for stone in the bladder
a few have been saved from a miserable death by the amputation of diseased mem-
bers; and large tumours have been removed. Such operations could not have been
achieved by native practitioners without producing an impression on the minds of the
most apathetic natives ; and they must tend to spread far and wide the value of the
government dispensaries.' Then, I say, and with a thorough conviction of the truth

of my assertions, in case the seeds of knowledge we have thus sown fructify to a gene-

ral and luxuriant harvest, that we shall have left a monument, compared with which
those of Ashoca, Chandra Gupta and Shah Jehan, or of any other Indian potentate,
will sink into insignificance, and their names shall fall on men's ears unheeded ; while
those of Lord Auckland, as projector, and of Goodeve and Mouatt and others as zealous
promoters of scientific native medical education, shall remain embalmed in the me-

mory of a grateful Indian posterity."
   Colonel Sykes only cursorily noticed the charitable dispensaries under the Madras

and Bombay governments, in consequence of the absence of detailed reports.

On the Medical Relief to the Parochial Poor of Scotland under the
               Old Poor Law. By Prof. Alison, M.D.

It was stated that as the objections made by Dr. Chalmers and others to establishing

a legal and adequate provision for the poor in Scotland did not apply to medical

relief, the efficiency of that relief, under the old Scottish law, would be a fair test

of the efficacy of the voluntary system of charity. An association of medical prac-

titioners was formed at Edinburgh, in November 1845, to collect information on this

subject. It appeared that in Edinburgh there was no provision for medical relief

from the poor-funds, except for the indoor paupers in the charity workhouse. Previous

to 1815 no assistance was given by any institution to the sick poor at home ; and though

since that period the duty had been gratuitously undertaken by the oflScers of several

dispensaries, it had not been effectually or regularly performed. In the Canongate, the

dispensary aid to the poor came to a sudden close in the midst of the late epidemic

fever, in consequence of the death of one of the medical officers who had acted as

treasurer. By the recent Act ten duly qualified and paid officers have been appointed

to take charge of the sick paupers in the different districts ; but Dr. Alison lamented

that the provision had been abandoned which compelled the parishes to combine in

giving relief, as in Edinburgh the rich congregate at one extremity of the city and

the poor at the other. In Glasgow relief has been given by paid medical attendants

for some years. Retimis were obtained from forty towns, exclusive of Edinburgh

--and Glasgow ; from which it appeared that in sixteen of these towns there was
                                                                   H

absolutely no requited medical relief, either from the public authorities or from
voluntary subscriptions. In four, an occasional payment, never exceeding a few
shillings, had been made on special occasions. In Campbeltown 10/. was allowed to

the professional men durins; the epidemic fevei'. In Kirkintilloch a similar sum was
given, but by a private individual. In Dundee during the same fever 5/. each was
allowed to six dispensary surgeons. In some other places 21. was given to a surgeon;
and in others a small allowance was made for drugs. In anticipation of the new
 Poor Law, 10/. has been allowed annually for medical relief in Alloa. In Dunbar

 61. 6s., but this includes the supply of drugs. In Dunfermline 20/. a year, not

 including drugs. In Greenock 25/. per annum has been paid to each of three
 district surgeons. In Kilmarnock 10/. each to three surgeons. In Wick 15/. is
 divided between two surgeons. In Dumfries 10/. to one surgeon. The unrequited
 medical labour is stated by twenty-five gentlemen, and ranges from 5/. to 220/.
 annually in value, giving an average of 40/. per annum. But this is not the only

--tax levied on the charitable feelings of medical men ; in ninety per cent, of the

 cases they had to furnish wine, food, &c. out of their own substance ; and in
 thirty-three of the forty towns brought under review, no change has been made in
 this system. Passing over the returns of infirmaries and dispensaries supported by
 voluntary contributions as lather imperfect, we come to the medical relief in the
 rural districts. The number of returns made amounts to 325. Out of these, ninety-
 four have received some remuneration, but only thirty-nine annually. Of these
 thirty-nine, only thirteen have received sums above 51. ; twenty-six above \l. and less
 than 51.; and nine 1/. or mider. Ten are paid t)y the bounty of private individuals;
 and of these one is paid GO/, by a nobleman, and another 40/. by a landed proprietor;
 both, howevei-, have the charge of extensive districts, and as there is no fund on
 which they can draw for drugs or necessaries, there are large drawbacks to be made
 from the remuneration. Twenty-three have received gratuities for their services,
 chiefly during the prevalence of epidemics. In one case this gratuity amounted to
 20/., and in fourteen it was under 51. ; in two cases it was only three shillings. In
 one of these cases this three shillings was the only remuneration for twelve years'
 attendance on paupers averaging seventy constant and thirteen occasional patients : in
 the other, the three shillings was a remuneration for passing paupers of other parishes,
 and nothing was allowed for twenty-one years of attendance on resident paupers,
 averaging forty-four constant on the district roll. 211, or above sixty per cent.,
 have never received any remifneration of any kind for their professional attendance
 on the parochial poor, or for the drugs which they have deemed it necessary to supply
 to them ; and 208 add that they have had occasion to give wine, food, &c. from their
 ov>'n limited funds, and that they had occasion to defray all travelling expenses when
 they made distant visits. 136 have estimated the money value of the unrequited

--labour which they have bestowed on the parochial poor : it amounts to 34,447/.

 annually, or an average of 253/. each. The complaints of inattention to sick paupers
 by the parochial authorities are very general ; and when applications were made
 for the repayment of different outlays, they were almost invariably refused. It was
 stated that since the abstract presented to the British Association had been compiled,
 several additional returns had been obtained ; but they in no degree tend to weaken
 the general impression likely to be produced by the preceding statement, and it was
 therefore deemed unnecessary to tabulate them.

          Oxford University Statistics. By James Heywood, F.R.S.

    A remarkable proof of the interest felt by eminent statesmen in the ancient univer-

 sities has been recently afforded in the preparation of a memorial to the Vice-Chan-
 cellor and heads of houses at Oxford, for university extension. The memorialists
 were Oxonians, and several of them had previously obtained the highest academical
 honours of a double first class ; but they had observed with regret the continuance of
 a system of large expenditure among the junior members of the university, and they

were on that account desirous that the educational advantages of Oxford should he

rendered more accessible to the sons of parents with limited incomes. Their memo-
rial in favour of the extension of the univer.sities was sij:ned by many eminent persons.

   "Our university," observed these memorialists, "take up education where our

schools leave it, yet no one can say that they have been strengthened or extended

whether for clergy or laity, in proportion to the growing population of the country,
its increasing empire, or deepening responsibilities."

last six years, and commented on the general res..".ts :

    It appeared that returns had been collected from 1987 families, in which the
number of children was 1 0,076, giving an average of more than five in a family.
The number of males was 5091, and of females 4985, which gives a proportion of
51 to 50. From these he constructed a table, showing the number out of which one
child would die in one year, according to the experience of families.

In 1838 the total number of coal-mines in Belgium was 307, with 470 pits in work
and 172 in process of construction, employing 37,171 persons ; being an increase of
84o4, or twenty-eight per cent, on the number employed in 1829. The increase of
the quantity of coal raised was not accurately ascertained, but it appeared to be about
thirty-seven per cent. The average cost of production is 10s. 8d. per ton, and the
average price 23s. Id, for first quality, and 16i'. 6^d. for the second quality of coal

used coke and ninety-two charcoal. The total number of accidents from 1821 to
1840 was 1352, Avhich occasioned severe hurts to 882, and deaths to 1710, making
a total of 2592 sufferers.

On Plate Glass-making in England in 1 84'6, contrasted with what it was in
                                 1827. By H. Howard,

   The writer furnished carefully all the materials for establishing this comparison.
Amongst other results he stated, that in 1827 plate glass was sold for about 1 2s.
average per foot, to the extent of about 5000 feet per week; in 1835, for from 8s.
to 9s. per foot, to the extent of about 7000 feet ; in 1844, for from 6s. to 7s. per foot,

--reaching about 23,000 feet; and in 1846, for from 5s. to Gs., about 40,000 feet per

week. The sale is now about 45,000 feet weekly. He mentioned that, in 1829, a
plate glass manufactory ceased operations because of the small profit realized when

selling at 12*. ; while, in 1846, a company, with a paid-up capital of 130,000/., realized
a net profit of 30,000/., selling at from 5s. to 6s. Looking at this extraordinary in-

crease, in spite of the severity of excise restrictions, the author asks, what would be
the probable demand if the price were reduced to 4s. or 3s. Qd. per foot, which,
free as the trade now is from excise interference, would yield an ample profit 1

On the Statistics of Education in Glasgow in 1846. By A. Liddell.

This enumeration was collected by the Statistical Committee of the Sunday School

Union of Glasgow. The returns show great disparity in the amount of instruction

in the different districts into which the city has been divided. In Glasgow, instruc-

tion in the common branches of education may be had at the lowest rates; and when

parents are so poor as to be unable to pay, it may be had gratis. The great amount

of ignorance that prevails arises therefore from the apathy of parents ; and in many

cases, from their cupidity in sending their children to work at very tender years for

the produce of their labour. To counteract this evil, various acts of parliament have

been passed for the purpose of regulating the labour of children. The Factories Re-

it has been found that unless the service of youths can be got for as many working

hours as that of an adult they cannot be profitably employed in these factories. No

record exists by which we can learn the exact number of children employed in Glas-

gow prior to the passing of this Act, but there must have been several thousands;

whereas, in March last, only 53 were so employed; and in Aberdeen, where for-

merly there were about 1000, there were at the same date only 45. The Act 8 and

9 Vict. c. 29, which came into operation in the beginning of this year, seems to be

working more efficiently in promoting the education of the youths in the calico print

works, to which class of factories this Act is restricted. It provides that the children

shall have 150 hours' instruction every six months, between the hours of 8 in the

morning and 6 in the evening. It is found that this enactment does not materially

interfere with the oeconomical working of this class of factories: consequently the

children are still continued in employment ; and, as far as can be ascertained from

the few months' operation of the Act, they are making much more rapid progress

than when receiving the same amount of instruction after work hours, which, being

optional, was in many cases neglected altogether. In Glasgow, lack of education is
much greater among the lower orders than in the country districts of Scotland ; this

in part arises from the wretchedly low pittance hitherto allowed to paupers; which

compels many of them to resort to manufacturing towns for the purpose of obtaining
                                                                                                                                                              ;

emplovment for tlieir children. It has been ascertained, from the Statistics of the
Night" Asylum for the houseless and the police offices, that 46 per cent, of the paupers

are not natives of Glasgow. An amendment of the Poor Law of Scotland passed the
legislature last year, which, it is hoped, may in some respects remedy this evil.

Under the authority of this Act, the parochial boards in the cities of Glasgow and
Edinburgh have resolved on having industrial schools for the purpose of supporting
and educating poor children. These schools have been for some time in operation in
Aberdeen and Perth ; and if generally adopted, may be expected to remedy the evil

complained of in some degree.

Stadstics of Crime in England and Wales, for the years 1842, 1843, and

                      1844. By F. G. P. Neison, F.L.S.

The first point to which attention was directed, was the necessity of viewing age as

an element in every investigation into the amount and progress of crime. From an

arrangement of the criminal returns for the above three years, in relation to popula-

tion, it appeared that the tendency to crime among the male population, at different

terms of life, will be found to vary from ╖7702 per cent, to -1694 per cent., or, in

other words, the tendency to crime at one period of life is more than quadruple that

at another. Similar results will be found for the female population, but with a lower

specific intensity ^o crime. It was further shown, that in the counties and districts

of England and Wales a different distribution of the population is found over the va-

rious terms of life. In Anglesea, Caermarthen, and Dorset, the proportion of the po-

pulation alive in the quinquennial term of life, 20-25, is under 8 per cent, of the

whole; while in Lancaster, Middlesex, and Monmouth, the proportion varies from 10

to upwards of 11 per cent. ; and, since the tendency to crime at the same periods of

life is more than quadruple that at other periods, it follows that, although the tendency

to crime in those two groups were precisely the same at the respective terms of life,

there would still, in reference to the whole population, appear to be an excess of crime

in the three latter counties ; therefore any method of investigation in whicli the ele-

ment of age is omitted can never show the relative amount of crime. In illustration

of this principle, it was shown that during the years 1842, 1843 and 1844, the pro-

portion  of criminals  in England  was  1  in  every 336  of the  male population                                                                        but  if the
                                                                                                                                                      ;

population during those years had been under the same distribution in regard to age

as in the year 1821, the proportion of criminals would have been only 1 in every

365 of the male population. Again, assuming the same tendency to crime at the

respective terms of life to prevail, the differences in the distribution of the popu-

lation would, for Glasgow, produce 1 criminal in every 304 of the male population

and in two districts of the metropolis the difference is so much as to give 1 in every 338

--for Bethnal Green ; while in St. George's, Hanover-Square, the ratio would be as high

as 1 in 280 : showing a difference, or rather an error, in any such method of inves-

tigation of 21 per cent. The results for England and Wales establish the same truth.

In Dorset, Anglesea, Cardigan, Caermarthen, Montgomery, Merioneth, and Pembroke,
the ratio of crime would be one in every 360; but in Lancaster, Middlesex, Mon-

mouth, and Glamorgan, the average would vary from 1 in 325 to 1 in 313 of the male

population. It was thus made evident, that calculations on the progress and amount

of crime in which the element of age is neglected cannot be relied on, as they would

lead to the fallacious conclusion, that districts in which the same ratio of crime pre-

Availed were at least 20 per cent, in excess of the average of the whole kingdom.

series of tables were brought forward, pointing to the existence of an interesting law

in the development of crime. It was found that, in the male sex, from age 20, crime

in each successive term of life decreases at the rate of 33^ per cent., and in the fe-

male sex at the rate of 25 per cent. ; so that if two tables were formed,-- one in

--which the numbers resulting from such a law were given, and the other showing the

actual number of criminals, the one table, particularly in reference to the female sex,

would be almost identical with the other. The paper went into an analysis of

the various causes generally believed to increase or lessen the amount of crime in va-

rious districts ; such as the prevalence of manufacturing, mining, and agricultural in-

terests, the greater or less amount of wealth, and the degree of education. In the

group of the manufacturing and mining districts, it was found that the actual

crime was less than the average of England and Wales by 2-3 per cent. ; but in
           ----

TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  103

 the agricultural group of counties there is an excess of 5-9 per cent, of crime. Again,
if the whole group of the manufacturing and mining counties be subdivided, it will
be seen that in the northern mining districts crime is 52-1 percent, below tlie ave-
rage for the whole country ; and in the cotton and woollen manufacturing districts
 crime is 7'0 per cent, under the average; but, on the other hand, in the districts
where the silk and linen fabrics are manufactured there is an excess of 8-5 per
cent, of crime, and in the hardware, pottery, and glass manufacturing districts the
excess of crime is o3"5 per cent, above the average of England and Wales. It, how-
ever, appeared evident that tliere is something in the condition of the mining and
manufacturing population having an influence in i-egulating the amount of crime,
one district showing an excess of 33-.5 per cent, and another being under the ave-
rage by, at least, 52 per cent. This led to an inquiry into the supposed increase of
juvenile crime ; and a series of tables were presented showing the relative amount of
crime at the younger and at the more matured periods of life, by which it appeared
that if the general result for any or all of the groups or districts, whether in con-
nexion with an increase or decrease of crime, be compared with the corresponding

feature at the juvenile ages, there will not be found a single instance in which the
character of that result is so strongly confirmed by the facts for the younger ages as
by those at the more advanced period. It follows that if any change be found to take
place in the criminal calendar of a given district, such fluctuation will be promoted,
not so much by juvenile crime, as by an increase or decrease among persons in mature
life, when the conduct and dispositions of individuals come more under the influenca

of external circumstances. In order to obtain, as far as possible, districts in which

the manufacturing or agricultural feature decidedly prevailed, a variety of combina-
tions were made, in order to exclude foreign and disturbing elements. This was
done to determine the legitimate influence of each particular condition of the people

when uiiassociated, as far as may be, with other and different conditions; and the

followin,o; is an abstract of the results obtained :

of education only which prevailed ; a means being thus afforded of comparing two
sections of a community similarly circumstanced in regai'd to manufactures, in regard
to agriculture, or in regard to wealth as the case might be, in fact, differing only in
regard to one important element of the inquiry, namely education ; and hence the

+In the above, the sign  signifies that the ratio of crime in that particular section

--is above the average for England and Wales ; and the figures themselves point out
the ratio per cent. The sign  is intended to indicate that the amount of crime is

below the average. The last column gives the difference per cent, in the same di-

strict, which appears from dividing it into two sections, in the one of which there is
the least degree of education, and in the other the highest. To the friends of edu-
cation, the above results must be gratifying; showing, as they do, the immense ad-
vantao-es resulting from even the most elementary and mechanical acquirements to-

wards education. There does not appear a single group in which there is not a

striking difference in favour of education. In fact, a proper analysis of all the com-

bined facts show, that following up the simple test here adopted, namely, the quali-
fication of individuals writing their own names, the mere inability to do that much,
is sufficient to account for, at least, one-third of the whole amount of crime in England

and Wales.                    ^

On the Annual Consumption of Coal and the probable duration of the Coal-
                        Fields. By E. R. J. Knowles.

   The author computed the annual consumption of coal at 38,000,000 tons as an
average increasing with the population, and classified it under the following heads :

Coal for household uses averaging I'l ton each person           22,000,000 tons.
Coal for manufacturing operations                               12,500,000 ...
Coal for foreign exports

                                                        Total... 37,000,000 tons.

Allowing for errors two and a half per cent, on above           925,000 ...

Thus making the total amount annually consumed                  37,925,000 tons,

or nearly 38,000,000 tons for the present population, about 20,000,000. The extent

of the coal-fields of England were taken at 5200 square miles (including the coal
under the crop of the magnesian limestone, but not that under the new red sand-

stone), allowing an average of 20,000,000 tons to the square mile ; and thence, after

making allowance for the coal worked out, and for the population being eventually

doubled, it was deduced that the coal-fields of England contain an ample supply for

at least 1500 j'eais. Of the annual amount consumed for manufacturing operations,

it was stated that the proportion of coal consumed for the purposes of steam-navi-

gation (including the Royal Navy) most probably amounts to 1,0/5,000 tons, and

for railway locomotion on 3000 miles of railway, to about 300,000 tons. It was

remarked that 2840 miles in progress will probably consume about 275,000 tons of

coal   in addition  to the above                                                          to which a proper allowance for the lines, for which

acts of parliament have recently been obtained, is to be added.

The above computations were offered only as an approximate calculation of an

annual average with the present amount of population, many of the items being

liable to great fluctuation, as in the case of coal consumed for the manufacture of

iron : but it is only from an average that the probable duration of the coal-fields can

be computed even approximately.

                  On a new Method of Borinc/ for Artesian Springs,
                     By M. Fauvelle of Perpignan, in France.

(A PAPER furnished by M. Arago to Mr. Vignolles, for the purpose of being com-
municated to the Association, M, Arago himself being prevented by illness from

attending.)

--The paper was an abridged translation of M. Fauvelle's own account, in which he
says,  "In   1833, I was present at the boring of an artesian well at                                                             Rivesaltes                                        the

water was found, and spouted up abundantly. They proceeded to the tubing, and

for that purpose enlarged the bore-hole from the top downwards, I was struck by

 observing  that  it was  no  longer                                                      necessary  to  draw the  boring  tools  to  get rid  of                                   the

.

material, and that the water, rising from the bottom, brought up with it, in a state

of solution, all the soil which the enlarging tools detached from the sides. I imme-

diately observed to my friend, JM. Bassal, who was with me, ' This is a remarkable

fact, and one very easy to    imitate                                                     if,  through a hollow    boring  rod,       water  be                                     sent
                                                                ;

down into the bore-hole as it is sunk, the water, in coming up again, must bring

with it all the drilled particles.' On this principle I started to establish a new me-

thod of boring. The apparatus is composed of a hollow boring rod, formed of wrought

iron tubes screwed end to end : the lower end of the hollow rod is armed with a per-

forating tool, suited to the character of the strata which have to be encountered.

The diameter of the tool is larger than the diameter of the tubular rod, in order to

form around it an annular space through which the water and the excavated material
may rise up. The upper end of the hollow rod is connected with a force-pump by

jointed or flexible tubes, which will follow the descending movement of the boring

tube for an extent of some yards. This boring tube may be either worked by a ro-
tatory movement with a turning handle, or by percussion with a jumper. The

frame and tackle for lifting, lowering, and sustaining the boring tube, offer nothing

particular. When the boring tube is to be worked the pump must be first put in

motion. Through the interior of the tube acolumn of water is sent down to the bottom of

the bore-holes, which water, rising in the annular space between the exterior of the

hollow boring rod and the sides of the bore-hole, creates an ascending current which

carries up the triturated soil : the boring tube is then worked like an ordinary boring

rod ; and as the material is acted upon by the tool at the lower end, it is immediately

cai'ried up to the top of the bore-hole by the ascending current of water. It is a

consequence of this operation that the cuttings being constantly carried up by the

water, there is no longer any occasion to draw up the boring tube to clear them

away, making a very great saving of time. Another important and certainly no less
advantage, is, that the boring tools never get clogged by the soil ; they work con-

stantly (without meeting obstructions) through the strata to be penetrated, thus

getting rid at once of nine-tenths of the difficulties of boring. It addition, it should
be mentioned, that experience has shown there are no shps iu any ground which orл
--106 REPORT 1846.

 dinary boring-rods can penetrate ; that the boring tube works at 100 yards in depth
 with as much facility as when only 10 yards down, and that from the very circum-
 stance of its being a hollow rod, it presents more resistance to torsion than a solid
 rod of equal thickness and quite as much resistance to traction: these are the prin-
 cipal advantages of the new system of boring. Indeed these advantages have been
 fully confirmed by the borings which I have just completed at Perpignan. This
 boring was commenced on the 1st of July and was completed on the 23rd, by finding
 the artesian water at a depth of 170 metres (560 English feet). If from these twenty-
 three days, each of ten hours' work, are deducted three Sundays and six lost days,
 there remain fourteen days or 140 hours of actual work ; which is upwards of I
 m^tre per hour, that is, ten times the work of an ordinary boring rod. In the
 method I have described, it will be perceived that the water is injected through

the interior of the boring rod. Experience has taught me that when gravel, or

 stones of some size are likely to be met with, it is better to inject the water by the
bore-hole, and let it rise through the boring tube. The additional velocity which
may be thereby given to the water, and the greater accuracy of calibre of the tube,
allow the free ascent of all substances which may be found at the bottom of the bore-
hole, and which the former mode of working may not so readily accomplish. I have
brought up by this latter way stones of 6 centimetres long and 3 thick (2i by 1^
English inches). The idea of making the water remount through the interior of the
boring tube suggests an easy mode of boring below a film (sheet) of flowing water :
it would be sufficient to close the orifice of the bore-hole hermetically, still, however,
so as to allow the boring tube to work, but yet so that the flowing water should be
always forced down to the bottom of the bore-hole to find its way to a vent : it would
thus draw up and cany away all the detritus. If, in addition to the above, we con-
sider the possibility of making the hollow stem of the boring rod of wood, and of ba-
lancing it so that it would weigh no more than the water in which it has to move, the
problem of boring to depths of 1000 metres (1100 yards) and upwards would appear
to be solved. In the square of St. Dominique, at Perpignan, a boring had been car-
ried on upon the old method for upwards of eleven months for the purpose of form-
ing an artesian well, and the water had not been found." Fauvelle placed his new
tube alongside the old boring tackle, and soon got down to a depth of nearly 100
yards, when an accident occurred which would have required some days to remedy.
Fauvelle decided upon abandoning the bore-hole already sunk so deep, and com-
mencing a new one, satisfied that there would thereby be a saving in time. The rate
of sinking was equal to four English feet per hour of the time the hollow boring rod
was actually at work, the depth of 560 English feet having been obtained in 140
working hours, for a bore-hole of about six English inches in diameter. M. Arago,
who had seen the rods of Fauvelle at work, mentions how fully they answered, and
that the large powerful tools at the bottom of the hollow boring rod cut easily through
the hardest strata j he confirmed the fact of the large-sized stones and gravel coming
up with the ascending current, having himself watched them. He also mentioned
that such was the opinion of the people in the vicinity of Perpignan, and so much was
water wanted that orders for the sinking upwards of 200 artesian wells had been
given to Fauvelle. The introduction of this system into this country, especially if
combined with the Chinese or percussive system of boring as practised with bore-
holes of very large diameter at the Saarbruck mines, and at many other places on
the Continent, must be productive of great benefit, and would not merely effect a
saving of money and labour, but the paramount advantage of immediately solving

   It may be defined as a self-acting blow-off apparatus. Mr. Lamb has a theory that
" blowing-off " should take place near the top of a boiler rather than from the bottom.
He conceives that the carbonate of lime floats by means of small bubbles of steam

adhering to each particle of lime. His contrivance consists of a large copper float

closing the orifice of a blow-off pipe in the boiler. When the water has risen above

a certain height, the blow-off valve is opened by the float, and so delivers the boiler

the feed-water, so as to heat it on entering. The apparatus is simple, and is stated
to have worked perfectly well.

JExperiments on the Tubular Bridge proposed by Mr. Stephenson for cross-

                  ing the Me7iai Straits, By W. Fairbairn.

        The experiments undertaken to ascertain the best form of

        bridge for carrying the Chester and Holyhead Railway across

        the Menai Straits have led to valuable and important results.

        They have put us in possession of facts which will greatly in-

        crease our knowledge of the properties of a material whose

        powers of combination were but imperfectly understood ; for,

        exclusive of the rapidly increasing use of wrought iron in the

        construction of ships, boilers and other vessels, its application

        to bridges of the tubular form is perfectly novel, and originated

        with Mr. Robert Stephenson. Experiments of the most con-

        clusive character were those made upon a model tube of a large

        scale, containing nearly all the elements of the proposed bridge,

        and the various conditions with regard toform and construction

        which had been developed by the previous inquiries. At first

        it occurred to Mr. Fairbairn that the strongest form would be

        that wherein the top and bottom consisted of a series of pipes,

        with riveted plates on their upper and lower sides. This form

        of top would possess great rigidity, and is well-adapted to re-

        sist the crushing forces to which it is subjected ; and the bot-
        tom section appeared equally powerful to resist tension. Mr.

        Fairbairn is inclined to think that this is the strongest form

        that can be devised ; but practical difficulties present them-

        selves in its construction, as an easy access to the different

        parts for the purposes of painting, repairs, &c. is absolutely

        necessary. The scale of the model tube is exactly one-sixth of

        the bridge across one of the spans of the Straits, 450 feet*

        it is also one-sixth of the depth, one-sixth the width, and, as

        near as possible, one-sixth the thickness of the plates. With

        these proportions and form, the experiments proceeded as fol-

        --lows : In each of the experiments the weights were laid on

        about a ton at a time ; and the deflection was carefully taken,
        as well as the defects of elasticity after the load was removed.

        suspended. One of the principal ob-

        jects of this inquiry was to determine

'"^''^  the ratio or proportion between the top
        and bottom sides of the tube. Taking

the experiment immediately preceding, it was found that the area of the top to that of
--108 REPORT 1846.

the bottom, in a rectangular tube, should be as 5 to 3. These proportions were de-
duced from the experiments on the smaller description of tubes, or those having the
corrugated top, and thick plates on the upper sides. The plates forming the top of
the model tube were rather thicker than intended, and consequently gave (according
to the former experiments) a preponderating power of resistance to that part. To
obviate this disparity, two additional strips, (ji in. by 5-i6ths in, thick, about 4 cwt.,
were riveted along the bottom to an extent of 20 ft. on each side of the shackle. This
increase raised the area of the bottom to nearly thirteen inches, being about the ratio
of 5 to 3 or 23*5 to 13. With these proportions, and having repaired the fractured
part by the introduction of some new plates, the experiment proceeded as before.

  --Second experiment. Breaking weight, 97, 1 02 lbs. =43'3 tons. Ultimate deflection,
--4'1 1 inches. Permanent set could not be taken. In this experiment the tube failed,

by one of the ends giving way, which caused the sides to collapse. The weak point
in this experiment was evidently a want of stiffness in the sides. To remedy this
evil, and keep them in form, a number of vertical ribs, composed of light angle iron,
were riveted along the interior of each side, at distances of 2 ft. ; and having again
restored the injured parts, the tube was a third time subjected to the usual tests.

  --Third experiment. Breaking weight, 126, 138 lbs. =56-3 tons. Ultimate deflection,
--6*68 inches. Permanent set, or defects of e!asticity=l'96 in. After suspending a

weight of 121,443 lbs., the platform unfortunately gave way, causing an interruption
to the experiment. This was, however, speedily repaired, and the experiment con-
tinued, when the tube was ultimately torn asunder, through the bottom plates, by
a weight of 12(), 138 lbs. The above experiment was one of the most satisfactory
description, as, at the moment of fracture, the cellular top gave evident symptoms
of yielding to a crushing force, by the puckerings of each side, which were gra-
dually enlarged as the deflection increased. These appearances became more ap-
parent as the joints of the plates on the top side had cut a nuniber of the rivets
in two, and the holes had slid over each other to an extent of nearly 3-lOths of
an inch. The conclusive nature of the whole of the experiments on the model
tube is highly satisfactory : they exhibit extraordinary powers of resistance ; and
considering that the weight of the whole material contained in the tube does not
exceed 5 tons; that the distance between the supports is 75 ft.; and the load in
the middle 1 1 times its own weight, or 22 times if equally distributed, it is probably
not over-rating its powers to state that hollow beams of wrought iron, constructed on
this principle, will be found (whether used for bridges or for buildings) about three
times stronger than any other description of girders.

Experiments on the Tubular Bridge proposed hij Mr. Stephenson for cross-

             ing the Menai Straits. By E. Hodgkinson, F.R.S.

    Finding that a number of experiments had been made upon cylindrical and ellip-
 tical tubes, and a few upon rectangular ones, Mr. Hodgkinson expressed a con-
 viction that the tubes then tried and others proposed, would not be the best for the
 intended purpose, though they would afford valuable introductory knowledge. He
 urged that the tube, to bear the greatest weight, must be formed as a large beam
 or girder, having its top and bottom equally capable of resistance, and with sides
 strong and stiff enough to keep them at their proper distance ; and as it was
 found that the tube usually gave way at the top by buckling, and hence would
 require additional metal, and might perhaps be very heavy, he suggested that
 the top should be formed of cylindrical tubes, as he felt that these tubes, or some-
 thing analogous to them, would best resist the strain to which -the top would be
 exposed. The following are some of the leading results ; and, first, those from

--the fracture of two similar tubes, as in the following table :

The ultimate deflexion of the former tube was about 2f in., and that of the latter

--about 3^ in. To ascertain the power of such a tube to bear a side strain as from
--the action of the wind the smaller tube above, alter being well-repaired, was laid

on its side, and broken, from a mean of two experiments, with 15'2 tbns. Hence

its lateral strength was if of its vertical nearly ; and in a narrower tube it would be

Aconsiderably less.  number of experiments were made to determine the resistance

of plates of wrought iron to a force of compression ; and from these considerable in-

formation has been obtained with respect to the laws of their resistance to flexure or

buckling. The following table contains the weights, external dimensions, and weights

of greatest resistance of some of the tubes 10 feet long, which were subjected to

a force of compression :

committee, however, in concluding their labours, stated that they were not able to
deduce from them any law, or semblance of alawj that the resistance increased

with the velocity, but it did not appear to do so according to any simple function of

the velocity, neither as the velocity directly, nor as the square of the velocity. Since

that time the question has been a qucBstio vexata among practical men and mathema-

Aticians.  paper read at the Royal Society last winter comes to the same conclusion

as the old committee of the British Association, viz. that no law is manifested in
the experiments, of which at high velocities the results are quite anomalous. The

consequences of errors on such a point have become now so serious, especially where

velocities of 50 or 60 miles an hour are attempted, that it has been thought desirable
that the question should be, if possible, thoroughly resolved. For this purpose I have
undertaken a series of practical experiments, on a large scale, with railway trains of

a great variety of size and weight, and at velocities as high as 61 miles an hour.
They were made on the South-VVestern, London and Brighton, South- Eastern, Shef-

field and Manchester, and Croydon Atmospheric Railways. I have combined with
these the experiments formerly made by the British Association, and some by Mr.
Harding on the broad gauge ; and it is the result of this great variety of facts which
I wish to lay before the Section. The experiments themselves are arranged in the

following table :

first instance, all the questionable experiments. I found it necessary to discard all

the experiments made with accelerating velocities, and to retain only such as were

made on uniform velocities, in the same circumstances, over a large space; most of

my own experiments having a steady uniform velocity over from one mile to six. I

--liave also selected those which were most free from the action of wind an element

of much importance. By thus weeding out the experiments, and taking only the

most unquestionable, I simplified the subject very materially. Those which remain

are given in the table. In this table the weight of each train in tons is shown, and

the number of pounds of force required to keep each ton weight of that train in mo-

tion at a given number of miles per hour, is shown by actual experiment. The

--analysis of those experiments I made as follows : I take the friction of the axles and

wheels as an ascertained quantity equal in the best-conditioned carriages to 6 lbs. per

ton of train. This I conceive we may consider to have been proved by all experiments

of friction, including those of Mr. Morin, the latest and best, to be a source of re-

sistance constant at all velocities. This I call friction proper, and I consider it as the
--first element of resistance. Friction propei-, the first element of resistance, or
                         =R, C OT,
       = m ^6 lbs., and                                               [1.]

where                    the mass of the train in tons weight.

The second element of resistance is the resistance of the air to the front of the train.

This has been variously estimated, and somewhat erroneously. Some persons have

taken for it Smeaton's tables of the force of the wind. But such a table gives a

q\iantity quite in excess ; for these tables were made from the force of the wind upon

a thin plate, a case where the minus pressure behhid is added to the plus pressure

before the plate ; whereas, in the case of the railway train, there is a solid body,

whose third dimension extends the whole length of the train. I have therefore taken,

not the table of the force of the wind, but a table of the resistance of air calculated

from the height due to the velocity, which I have found to represent most accurately

the resistance of fluids to bodies passing through them ; and I have taken this as the

second essential element in the resistance to railway trains. Resistance of the air,

the second element :     R. = ApлS

A = =where                                                            [2.]

       the area in square feet of the front of the train, and p weight of a

column of air, whose base is a square foot, and whose length is the height due to the

velocity of one mile an hour ; v being the velocity of the train.

   After having deducted from the results of the experiments the sum of these two re-

sistances, 1 have found a large amount still unaccounted for ; and I find this quantity
to be not only large, but dependent also on the velocity. The question which I now

submit to the Section is the determination of the nature and cause of this third ele-

ment of resistance. The third element of resistance appears by the experiments to

increase very nearly as the velocity, simply; that is, it amounts at 10 miles an hour

to about 3 lbs., at 30 miles an hour to 10 lbs., and at 60 miles an hour to 20 lbs. per

ton. It is therefore proportioned to the mass or weight of the train and to the ve-

locity jointly. Other resistances due to velocity or third element :

                         B,^=Bmv,                                                     [3.]

mwhere ^ lb., the weight of the train in tons, and v its velocity in miles an hour.

Whence the total resistance (R) to any train of any weight moving with any velocity

is to be obtained from the formula                                                    [4.]

               R=R^+R^ + R^ = Apv^ +Bmv + Cm

The results of this formula are shown in the last column of the table ; and from the

close manner in which they follow the experiments through their various and ap-

parently anomalous results, they may be regarded as an approximation to the truth

sufficiently close for all practical purposes. The next question discussed was the

--nature of this third element resistance. The author attributed it mainly to the con-

cussions, oscillations, frictions and flexures to which all the portions both of the train

and permanent way are subject, at high velocity.

Osier has contrived an arrangement by which this is registered in connexion with the
time and the direction. Meteorologists however are chiefly intei-ested about the ve-
locity, or rather the actual space traversed by atmospheric currents. The velocity at
any instant can be computed from the observed pressure ; but the mean velocity for a
given period cannot easily be derived from the mean pressure. But Whewell's in-
strument gives the desired result immediately, recording the space itself. As con-
structed by him, however, it is liable to errors, which Mr. Snow Harris pointed out at
the Plymouth meeting ; at the same time producing a series of observations which
seemed so important to Dr. Robinson, that he endeavoured to contrive a machine which
should perform the same office more precisely, and whose indications should have an

invariable value. He was enabled to do this by the application of a fact which he

learned from the late Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Esq. : if hemispherical cups be car-

ried by horizontal arms attached to a vertical axis, with their diametral planes verti-

cal, they constitute an effective windmill, which Dr. Robinson has found revolves with

one-third of the wind's velociti/. To the bottom of the axis is attached wheelwork ac-

tuating a revolving disc, which rotates through a degree for every mile traversed by

Athe wind.     pencil moved in the direction of the radius by clockwork, at the rate of

half an inch pet hour, traces on paper fixed on this disc the curve of space and time.

A similar disc connected with a powerful vane records the curve of direction and time

as however such vanes (especially in high winds) are in perpetual oscillation, there

is attached to it a regulator consisting of a small water-wheel revolving in a cistern,
with a speed five times that of the vane. This of course obeys any slow change of
direction without difficulty, but presents so great a resistance to any rapid shift, that
the eddies are past before it yields. This, though not absolutely, yet in a great mea-

sure, steadies the vane. The machine erected at the Armagh Observatory acts in a
very satisfactory manner, moving when no air of Avind can be felt, yet acting with
perfect steadiness in severe gales, during one of which Lind's gauge showed a pressure
of 2з inches of water. He then explained how the daily results were to be summed
up by resolving them according to axes of coordinates directed to the north and east,
and illustrated the method by exhibiting the process for the first six months of the

current year.

     On the Sailing Potvers of tioo Yachts, built on the Wave Principle.
                               By J. Phipps, M.D.

   The first was built for Dr. Corrigan, of Dublin, in 1844 j a small open boat 24
feet by 6, of 3j tons, which did so well that she was able to beat everything near her
own size, and to sail with those which exceed it in some instances as far as four
times. She was dry in seas where they were wet, was very stiflF, sure in stays, and
steered well at all times. The secondis a yacht of 45 tons, O.M., for Samuel Hodder,
Esq., of Ringabella; built from the drawing by Mr. Peasley, of Passage West, in
Cork. She appears to have the following qualities : a first-rate performance, at-
tained without sacrifice of any good quality, large accommodation, and high stability.
She is weatherly, steady and easy, dry in the worst weather, and pitches and ascends
less than any vessel 1 was ever in. She turns so sharply that no 10-ton yacht

can do it quicker, and steers so well, scudding in a gale of wind, that notwithstand-
ing an unbalanced state, from an injudicious shift of mast, she neither broaches to
nor is compelled to lay to, which a companion of larger size (60 tons), and of tried
sea qualities, was forced to do, and, in consequence, arrived from Cork to Dublin 14

hours after the Wave-built yacht. In a race at Kingstown for the Railway Cup of
100 guineas, in which she was matched against the best boats of the three countries,

--in a time race, including one fine yacht of 100 tons, she won and did the course

exactly in 4 h. 22 m. 58 s.-- it being 46 nautic miles. Making no allowance for tack-
ing or starting from absolute rest, the rate of this is 10^ knots per hour. This is a
great result for a principle yet in its infancy. The same vessel left Holyhead in a gale
of wind, with storm-sails, main-sail stowed, and everything made snug ; with a reefed
tiy-sail, a double-reefed fore-sail, and third jib. She lay in one stretch to the Irish
coast, where she tacked to the southward, beating down to the Arklow light in 11
hours. Six persons on board, being separately questioned, agreed that the time from
Holyhead to the Irish coast was 4^ hours. Making every reasonable allowance, less

than 50 nautic miles could not have been done ; and this gives a velocity of 1 1 nautic
                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                         113

miles per hour,-- an unrecorded speed forships of any size, closehauled, but surprising
for a vessel of 45 tons, and in a very rough sea. It was, in fact, remarked on board,
that, as the wind freshened, her pace increased without limit. This agrees with the
fact stated by Capt. Fishbourne of the Flambeau steamer, on wave lines, that she
had a speed greatest in the worst weather, as compared with her rival. It is perhaps

possible to improve sailing vessels greatly, as compared with steamers. When so

improved, they might be used where sailing vessels nearly compete with steamers at

present. This may be further helped by the diminution of insurance and of the pre-

sent unnecessary waste of human life.

Mr. Bodmer communicated the result of experiments on long and short stroked

steam-engines.     ___^_

Dr. Bevan exhibited his mode of applying atmospheric air to propulsion.

but he had applied it with advantage.

        On Vulcanized Caoutchouc. By W. Brockedon, F.R.S.

Mr. Brockedon stated that the discovery in this country was due to Mr. Hancock

of the firm of C. Macintosh and Co., Manchester, and that he made it whilst experi-

menting to fuse caoutchouc and sulphur together. He found that though the sul-

phur was at 300░, the rubber, which alone would have melted at about 220░ and

Aabsorbed the sulphur, was thus protected from melting.  chemical union of a cer-

tain portion of the sulphur with the caoutchouc took place ; and it was found that

this process might be carried far enough to carbonize the caoutchouc to the condition

of horn, but never to melt it. Mr. Hancock then united sulphur mechanically with

rubber ; and also dissolved sulphur in the solvents of caoutchouc ; and heating these

materials so prepared to the necessary degree, found that the change was effected

called vulcanized. The new properties which rubber thus acquires are most import-

ant in the hands of mechanical engineers, from the increased and permanent elasticity

of the vulcanized rubber; it is being brought into extensive application and use for

railways, lying between the rail or the chair and the sleeper; for the drag and buffer

springs and side springs of railway carriages, waggons and trucks ; for washers for

steam, gas, and water-pipes, being permanently elastic .it low temperatures as well

as at very high ; even for steam pipes at 50 and 60 lbs. to the inch, they have formed

Aa perfect joint.  Nasmyth steam-hammer of 5 tons weight has fallen 18 inches on

a piece i an inch thick and 2 inches square without any injury to the form of the

Arubber.  cannon-ball resting on a piece of vulcanized rubber 1 inch thick has been

emshed and broken without leaving, except upon close examination, any trace of its

eflfects on the rubber, when a hole like a leech-bite might be found which had closed

after the blow. The layer of corrugated rubber, which had been placed between the

rail and the sleeper, after two years' service on the Great Western Line, betrayed no

trace of injury or effect of pressure.

   Upon this new material the solvents of common rubber have no longer the action
of solvents ; the rubber slowly absorbs them but is not dissolved by them, and when

the essential oils are evaporated the vulcanized rubber regains all its strength and
elasticity. Its elasticity is permanent and invariable ; no cold of our climate has any
power to harden it, or the heat of any climate to injure it. These are properties which

cannot fail of bringing it extensively into use in the mechanical arts.

Notice on the Aborigines of Newfoundland. By J. Beete Jukes, M.A., F.G.S.

In this paper the author stated that, from all the information he procured in New-
foundland in the years 1839 and 1840, he believed the aborigines of that country to
be a branch of the Red Indians of North America, and that they had no affinity with
the Esquimaux ; that they were acquainted with the Esquimaux, and despised them
for their dirty habits; that they were on friendly terms with the mountaineers of
Labrador, whom they called Shaunamunc ; and that about twenty years ago the last
remnant of the Boeothics, or Aborigines of Newfoundland, were probably received by
the mountaineers and incorporated into their tribes.

Notes on the three Races of Men inhabiting the Islands of the Indian andPacifc
                    Oceans. By J. Beete Jukes, M.A., F.G.S.

    In this paper the author stated his belief, derived from personal observation, that
in the islands included between the eastern coast of Africa and the western coast of

--America, there were at least three races of men: 1st. The Malayo-Polynesian race.

2nd. The Papuan race. 3rd. The Australian race.
   He believed that these three races would be found to differ one from the other,

physically, morally and intellectually. He then detailed some of these differences,

 and showed that whichever class of characters were taken, the differences between
the races became equally strongly marked. As a good external physical mark, the
 hair might be taken ; when the first race might be called the straight-haired ; the
 second, the frizzle-haired; and the third, the curlj'-haired. The author entered some-
 jvhat at length into a comparison of the manners and customs of the two latter races,
 as they had hitherto often been confounded together, and showed that there was as
 strongly marked a distinction, whether the structure and aspect of the body, the dis-
 position or powers of the mind, or the habits and customs, arts, implements, and weapons
 of the people were taken as the standard of comparison, between the second race and

 the third as between the second and the first. He stated that the third race, or

 Australian, vas strictly confined to the continent of Australia, and the islands im-

 mediately adjacent to its shores. He described the second, or Papua race, as stretching
 from Mangeray or Flores, through Timor, New Guinea, and the adjacent islands,
 the Louisiade, the Solomon Archipelago, the New Hebrides, and New Caledonia, to
 the Fejee Islands. Some outlying tribes of this race might be found, perhaps, in
 islands to the west of Flores, and the inhabitants of the Andamans apparently be-

 longed to them ; and even some of the hill tribes of the interior of India seemed to re-
 semble them. On the south-east again they seemed to have reached Van Diemen's Land,
 and mingled there with the Australian race. The first race, or the Malayo-Polynesian,
 occupied all the other islands, namely, Madagascar, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes,

 the Philippines, Carolines, Friendly Islands, New Zealand, and all the other islands
 to the eastward over the whole Pacific Ocean. The principal object of the paper

            On the Natives of Timor and Macassar. By Mrs. Short.

    The former are of dark complexions, of five feet six inches in height, and well-
proportioned. They are inclined to gambling, slaving, and drinking ; they are in-
genious artificers and careful of the dead. They worship the devil, and are very
superstitious. Their dress is picturesque. The people of Macassar are superior
physically to the natives of Timor ; their deportment is bold and independent, and
eye beautifully fierce. . Great attention is paid by the females to the dressing of their
hair. They indulge in cock-fighting ; but are industrious and take great pride in the
neatness of their houses and gardens. The tribe of the people of Macassar de-
signated Bugis, are a very commanding people, and ornament themselves with valuable
jewellery. They are very susceptible of insult and revengeful.

--into three divisions: 1. The Comanche or Jetan. 2. The Lemparack. 3. The

Tenuha. They constituted the largest native tribe in Texas; they possessed few
traditions, and were unacquainted with agriculture ; consequently their habits were
mio-ratory. During war, they acknowledged one chief; they had an idea of a future
state, but of a very gross nature, believing in the existence of evil spirits and witch-
craft. The author, in conclusion, gave some remarks on their mode of conducting
war, and on their treaties.

On tlm Delta and Alluvial Deposits of the Mississippi, and other points in the
   Geology of North America, observed in the years 1845-46. By Charles
   Lyell, M.A., F.R.S. and V.P.G.S.

       (A Discourse delivered at the Evening Meeting, Monday, Sept. 14, 1846.)

   The delta of the Mississippi may be defined as that part of the great alluvial plain
which lies below or to the south of the branching off of the highest arm of the river

called the Atchafalaya. This delta is about 14,000 square miles in area, and ele-
vated from a few inches to ten feet above the level of the sea. The greater part of
it protrudes into the Gulf of Mexico beyond the general coast- line. The level plain
to the north, as far as Cape Girardeau in the Missouri, above the junction of the
Ohio, is of the same character, including, according to Mr. Forshey, an area of about
16,000 square miles, and is therefore larger than the delta. It is very variable in
width from east to west, being near its northern extremity, or at the mouth of the
Ohio, 50 miles wide, at Memphis 30, at the mouth of the White River 80, and con-
tracting again further south, at Grand Gulf, to 33 miles. The delta and alluvial plain
rise by so gradual a slope from the sea as to attain at the junction of the Ohio (a
distance of 800 miles by the river) an elevation of only 200 feet above the Gulf of
Mexico.

   Mr. Lyell first described the low mud-banks covered with reeds at the mouths of
the Mississippi and the pilot-station called the Balize ; then passed to the quantity
of drift-wood choking up the bayons or channels intersecting the banks ; and, lastly,
enlarged on the long, narrow promontory formed by the great river and its banks

between New Orleans and the Balize. The advance of this singular tongue of land

has been generally supposed to have been very rapid; but Mr. Lyell, and Dr. Car-
penter who accompanied him, arrived at an opposite conclusion. After comparing
the present state of this region with the map published by Charlevoix 120 years ago,
they doubt whether the land has on the whole gained more than a mile in the course
of a century.

  A large excavation eighteen feet deep, made for the gas-works at New Orleans and

still in progress in March 1846, shows that much of the soil there consists of fine
clay or mud, containing innumerable stools of trees, buried at various levels in an

erect position, with their roots attached, implying the former existence there of fresh-
water swamps covered with trees, over which the sediment of the Mississippi was
spread during inundations, so as slowly to raise the level of the ground. As the site

of the excavation is now about nine feet above the sea, the lowest of these upright
trees imply that the region where they grew has sunk down about nine feet below the
sea-level. The exposure also in the vertical banks of the Mississippi at low water, for
118 REPORT 1846.

hundreds of miles above the head of the delta, of the stumps of trees buried with

their roots in their natural position, three tiers being occasionally seen one above the
other, shows that the river in its wanderings has opened a channel through ancient
morasses, where trees once grew, and where alluvial matter gradually accumulated.
The old deserted bed also of the river, with its banks raised fifteen feet above the

adjoining low ground, bears testimony to the frequent shifting of the place of the

main stream, and the like inference may be drawn from the occurrence here and
there of crescent -shaped lakes, each many miles in length, and half a mile or more

in breadth, which have once constituted great curves or bends of the river, but are
now often far distant from it.

   The Mississippi, by the constant undermining of its banks, checks the rise of large

commercial towns on its borders, and causes a singular contrast between the wealth

and splendour of 800 or more fine steamers, some of which may truly be called
floating palaces, and the flat monotonous wilderness of uncleared land which ex-

tends for hundreds of miles on both sides of the great navigable stream.
   Mr. Lyell visited, in March 1846, the region shaken for three months, in 1811-12,

by the earthquake of New Madrid. One portion of it, situated in the States of Mis-

souri and Arkansas, is now called "the sunk country." It extends about seventy

miles north and south, and thirty east and west, and is for the most part submerged.

Many dead trees are still standing erect in the swamps ; a far greater number lie

prostrate. Even on the drj' ground in the vicinity, all the forest trees which are of

prior date to 181 1 are leafless ; they are supposed to have been killed by the loosening
of their roots by the repeated shocks of 1811-12. Numerous rents are also observa-

ble in the ground where it opened in 1811, and many sink-holes or cavities, from ten
to thirty yards wide and twenty feet or more in depth, now interrupt the general level
of the plain, which were formed by the spouting out of large quantities of sand and

mud during the earthquake.
   In attempting to compute the minimum of time required for the accumulation of

the aUuvial matter in the delta and valley of the Mississippi, Mr. Lyell referred to a

series of experiments made by Dr. Riddell at New Orleans, showing that the mean

annual proportion of sediment in the river was to the water t^V 5 in weight, or about

^__ in volume. From the obsei-vations of the same gentleman and those of Dr.

Carpenter, and of Mr. Forshey, an eminent engineer of Louisiana, the average width,
depth and velocity of the Mississippi, and thence the mean annual discharge of water

are deduced.

In assuming 528 feet (or the tenth of a mile) as the probable thickness of the de-

posit of mud and sand in the delta, Mr. Lyell founds his conjecture on the depth of

the Gulf of Mexico, between the southern point of Florida and the Balize, which

equals on an average 100 fathoms. The area of the delta being about 14,000 square

statute miles, and the quantity of solid matter annually brought down by the river

3,702,758,400 cubic feet, it must have taken 67,000 years for the formation of the

whole ; and if the alluvial matter of the plain above be 264 feet deep, or half that of

the delta, it has required 33,500 more years for its accumulation, even if its area be

estimated as only equal to that of the delta, whereas it is in fact larger. If some

deduction be made from the time here stated, in consequence of the effect of drift-

wood, which must have aided in filling up more rapidly the space above alluded to,

a far more important allowance must be made on the other hand for the loss of mat-
ter owing to the finer particles of mud not settling at the mouth of the river, but being

swept out far to sea, and even conveyed into the Atlantic by the gulf-stream. Yet

the whole period during which the Mississippi has transported its earthy burthen

to the ocean, though perhaps far exceeding 100,000 years, must be insignificant in a

geological point of view, since the bluffs or cliffs bounding the great valley (and there-

fore older in date), and which are from 50 to 250 feet in perpendicular height, con-

sist in great part of loam, containing land, fluviatile and lacustrine shells of species

still inhabiting the same country. These fossil shells, occurring in a deposit re-

sembling the loess of the Rhine, are associated with the bones of the mastodon, ele-

phant, tapir, mylodon, and other megatheroid animals ; also a species of horse, ox,

and other mammalia, most of them of extinct species. The loam rests at Vicksburg

and other places on eocene or lower tertiary strata, which in their turn repose on

Acretaceous rocks.  section from Vicksburg to Darier, through the States of Mis-

sissippi, Alabama and Georgia, exhibits this superposition as well as that of the cre-

taceous strata on carboniferous rocks at Tuscaloosa. Mr. Lyell ascertained that the

huge fossil cetacean, named Zeuglodon by Owen, is confined to the eocene deposits.

In the cretaceous strata the remains of the mosasaurus and other reptiles occur

without any cetacea. The coal-fields of Alabama were next alluded to, from which

fossil plants have been procured by Professor Brumby and Mr. Lyell, of the genera

Sphenopteris, Neuropteris, Calamites, Lepidodendron, Sigillaria, Stigmaria and

others, most of them identical in species, as determined by Mr. Charles Bunbury, with

fossils of Northumberland. This fact is the more worthy of notice, because the

coal of Tuscaloosa, situated in latitude 33░ 10' north, is further south than any region

in which this ancient fossil flora had previously been studied, whether in Europe or

North America ; and it affords therefore a new proof of the wide extension of a uni-

form flora in the carboniferous epoch. Mr. Lyell, adverting to the opinion recently

adopted by several able botanists, that the climate of the coal period was remarka-

ble for its moisture, equability and freedom from cold, rather than the intensity of

its tropical heat, stated that this conclusion, as well as the oscillations of tempera-

ture implied by the glacial period, is confirmatoiy of the theory first advanced by

him in 1830, to explain the ancient geological changes of climate by geographical re-

volutions in the position of land and sea.

The lapse of ages implied by the distinctness of the fossils of the eocene, creta-

ceous, carboniferous and other strata, is such, that were we to endeavour to give an

idea of it, we must estimate its duration, not by years, as in the case of the delta,

but by such units as would be constituted by the interval between the beginning of

the delta and our own times.
   " It is now fifty years," said Mr. Lyell, " since Plaj'fair, after studying the rocks

in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, in company with Dr. Hutton and Sir James

Hall, was so struck with the evidence they afforded of the immensity of past time,

that he observed ' how much farther reason may go than imagination can venture

to follow.' These views were common to the most illustrious of his contemporaries,

and since that time have been adopted by all geologists, whether their minds have

been formed by the literature of France or of Germany, of Italy or Scandinavia, or

of England                                                      all have arrived at  the  same conclusion respecting  the great antiquity
                                                             ;

of the globe, and that too in opposition to their earlier prepossessions, and to the

popular belief of their age. It must be confessed, that while this unanimity is satis-

factory as a remarkable test of truth, it is somewhat melancholy to reflect that at the

end of half a century, when so many millions have passed through our schools and

colleges since Playfair wrote that eloquent passage, there is still so great a discord-

ance between the opinions of scientific men and the great mass of the community.

Had there been annual gatherings such as this, where they who are entitled to speak

with authority address themselves to a numerous assembly drawn from the higher

classes of society, who, by their cultivation and influence, must direct the education

and form the opinions of the many of humbler station, it is impossible that so un-

desirable and unsound a state of things should have now prevailed, as that there
should be one creed for the philosopher and another for the multitude. Had there
been meetings like this, even for a quarter of a century, we should already have
gained for geology the same victory that has been so triumphantly won by the astro-

nomer. The earth's antiquity, together with the history of successive races of orga-

nic beings, would have been ere this as cheerfully and universally acknowledged as

the earth's motion, or the number, magnitude and relative distances of the heavenly

bodies. I am sure it would be superfluous if I were to declare, in an assembly like

mythis,   deep conviction, which all of you share, that the further we extend our re-

searches into the wonders of creation in time and space, the more do we exalt, refine

and elevate our conceptions of the Divine Artificer of the universe."

Mr. Lyell concluded this discourse by announcing his corroboration of the dis-

covery recently made by Dr. King at Greensburg, thirt}-^ miles from Pittsburg in

Pennsylvania, of the occurrence of fossil foot-prints of a large reptilian in the mid-

dle of the ancient coal measures. They project in relief from the lower surface of

slabs of sandstone, and are also found impressed on the subjacent layers of fine

unctuous clay. This is the first well-established example of a vertebrated animal,

more highly organized than fishes, being met with in a stratum of such high an-

tiquity.
