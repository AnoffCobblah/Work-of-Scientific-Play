connection with a Report drawn up by a Committee of the International Congress!
-- ----

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.  IxXV

of Hygiene and Demography. It is understood that this Report has been presented
to your Honourable Board by the British Medical Association. The British Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, having regard to the importance of the question
from a physiological point of view, as bearing upon the health of the community,
passed a resolution requesting the Council of the Association to urge upon your
Honourable Board the importance of publishing the Report above referred to, and
the Association appointed a committee of their body to continue the further collection
of statistics on the subject.

    I am therefore instructed by the Council to submit this recommendation, and to

urge upon your Honourable Board the importance of the publication of this Report.
                          I have the honour to be. Sir, your most obedient servant,

                                                                        ARCH. GEIKIE, President.

     The following reply was received on January 29 :

                                      Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W.,

                                                                                     January 28, 1893.

   --Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt

of your letter of the 19th ultimo, in which, on behalf of the Council of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, you urge upon the Board the importance

of publishing the Report made on behalf of the British Medical Association by Dr.
F. Warner on the Physical and Mental condition of 50,000 school children ; and to
state that, while the Board fully recognise the value of the Report in question, they
do not consider that they can undertake its publication.

                                                          I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

                                                   WM. E. KNOLLTS, Assistant Secreta/ry.

                   Sir A. Geikie,

President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

        (J) That the Council be requested to draw the attention of Her Majesty's
             Government to the Anthropometric method for the measurement of criminals,
             which is successfully in operation in France, Austria, and other Continental
             countries, and which has been found effective in the identification of
             habitual criminals, and consequently in the prevention and repression of

                crime.

      Council resolved that

       Considering the recognised need of a better system of identification than is now
             in use in the United Kingdom and its Dependencies, whether for detecting
            deserters who apply for re-enlistment, or old offenders among those who are
             accused of crime, or for the prevention of personation, more especially
            among the illiterate, the Council of the British Association express their
             opinion that the Anthropometric methods in use in France and elsewhere

               deserves serious inquiry as to their efficiency, the cost of their maintenance,
             their general utility, and the propriety of introducing them, or any modifi-

           cation of them, into the Criminal Department of the Home Office, into the
           Recruiting Departments of the Army and Navy, or into Indian and Colonial

               Administration.

     Copies of this resolution and the following letter, signed by the President

of the Association, were sent to the Secretaries of State for the Home

Department, Array, Navy, India, and the Colonies :

                                                                                                                June 1893.

     The Council of the British Association for the Advancement of Science having
had under consideration the question of the best means for the identification of

criminals, I am desired to lay before you the inclosed Report on this subject which

the Council have adopted. Good evidence has been submitted to them that anthro-
pometric methods, that is to say, the classification of measurements of bodily marks
and of finger prints, afford a ready and inexpensive method of identification, and the
progress made abroad in organising these methods justifies the hope that the subject
may be deemed worthy of serious inquiry by the various Government Departments

of this country.
                        ·

IXX Vi  --REPOBT 1893.

    It is believed by the Council that the facilities at the command of these Depart-
ments would enable a more correct judgment to be formed, both of the real value to
the nation of improved means of identification and of the efficiency and costs of the
methods above referred to, than could be obtained through the exertions, however

zealous, of private persons.

    I therefore venture to hope that you may be willing that inquiries be instituted

in the Department over which you preside. The Council will be ready to furnish

any information at their disposal which may be desired.

                                                 I have the honour to be, your obedient servant,

                                                                          ARCH. GEIKIE, Presidmt.

   --The following replies have been received :

                                    War Office, Pall Mall, S.W., Jutie 28, 1893.

   --Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Campbell-Bannerman to acknowledge the

receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, forwarding a copy of a Eeport from the
British Association for the Advancement of Science relative to the anthropometric
method of identifying persons charged with crime.

    In reply, I am to acquaint you that the working of this system in France was not

long since the subject of careful consideration on the part of the Secretary of State

for War, who came to the conclusion that, although the sj'stem appeared to be ad-
mirably adapted for the identification of criminals, it was not desirable it should be
introduced into the British Army.

                                                                         I am, Sir, vour obedient servant,

                                                                        RALPH THOMPSON.

                                             India Office, Whitehall, S.W., July 11, 1893.

   --Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge

the receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, and, in reply, to state that anthropometry
according to the system invented by M. Bertillon has been introduced into India by

the Government, and is now being tried there as an experiment.

                                                                        I am. Sir, j'our obedient servant,

   --Sir, My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having had under consideration

your letter of the 19th June last, on the subject of an improved mode of registration
of physical measurements, kc, of persons entered into the Government services with
a view to the identification of criminals, I am commanded by their Lordships to
acquaint you that they are not prepared to introduce the Continental system of
anthropological examination into the Naval Recruiting Department, as the present
mode of noting the physical measurements of all persons who may be entered, together
with any particular marks or scars, is deemed sufhcient for official purposes, so far
as the identification of men is concerned, and that, as a rule, no difficulty arises in

identifying deserters.

                                                                        I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

                               Burlington House, W.

        (c) That the letter of Professor E. Wiedemann and the communications from

           the Committees of Sections B and C on the subject of the headings of

               Reports be referred to the Council.

     The Council resolved that the subject of a Report should be mentioned
first, then the names of the Committee, and finally the titles of any

Appendices.

                                    PRESIDENT.

We --are assembled this evening as representatives of the sciences men

and women who seek to advance knowledge by scientific methods. The

common ground on which we stand is that of belief in the paramount

value o.f the end for which we are striving, of its inherent power to make

men wiser, happier, and better ; and oar common purpose is to strengthen

Weand encourage one another in our efforts for its attainment.  have

come to learn what progress has been made in departments of knowledge

which lie outside of our own special scientific interests and occupations,

to widen our views, and to correct whatever misconceptions may have

arisen from the necessity which limits each of ns to his own field of study
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and, above all, we are here for the purpose of bringing our divided ener-

gies into effectual and combined action.

     Probably few of the members of the Association are fully aware of
the influence which it has exercised during the last half-century and
more in furthering the scientific development of this country. Wide as
is the range of its activity, there has been no great question in the field

of scientific inquiry which it has failed to discuss ; no important line of
investigation which it has not promoted ; no great discovery which it has
not welcomed. After more than sixty years of existence it still finds

itself in the energy of middle life, looking back with satisfaction to what
it has accomplished in its youth, and forward to an even more efficient
future. One of the first of the national associations which exist in different
countries for the advancement of science, its influence has been more felt
than that of its successors because it is more wanted. The wealthiest

-- --country in the world, which has profited more vastly more by science

than any other, England stands alone in the discredit of refusing the

necessary expenditure for its development, and cares not that other nations

should reap the harvest for which her own sons have laboured.

It is surely our duty not to rest satisfied with the reflection that

England in the past has accomplished so much, but rather to unite and

ao-itate in the confidence of eventual success. It is not the fault of

governments, but of the nation, that the claims of science are not recog-

Wenised.  have against us an overwhelming majority of the community,

not merely of the ignorant, but of those who regard themselves as edu-

cated, who value science only in so far as it can be  turned into  money

-- --for we are still in great measure in greater measure than any other
--nation of shopkeepers. Let us who are of the minority the remnant

who believe that truth is in itself of supreme value, and the knowledge of

--it of supreme utility do all that we can to bring public opinion to our

side, so that the century which has given Young, Faraday, Lyell, Darwin,

Maxwell, and Thomson to England, may before it closes see us pre-

pared to take our part with other countries in combined action for the

full development of natural knowledge.

Last year the necessity of an imperial observatory for physical

science was, as no doubt many are aware, the subject of a discussion in
Section A, which derived its interest from the number of leading

physicists who took part in it, and especially from the presence and active
participation of the distinguished man who is at the head of the National

Physical Laboratory at Berlin. The equally pressing necessity for a

central institution for chemistry, on a scale commensurate with the

practical importance of that science, has been insisted upon in this

Association and elsewhere by distinguished chemists. As regards

biology I shall have a word to say in the same direction this evening.

Of these three requirements it may be that the first is the most pressing.

If so, let us all, whatever branch of science we represent, unite our efforts

to realise it, in the assurance that if once the claim of science to liberal

public support is admitted, the rest will follow.

     In selecting a subject on which to address you this evening I have

followed the example of my predecessors in limiting myself to matters
more or less connected with my own scientific occupations, believing

that in discussing wbat most interests myself I should have the best

chance of interesting you. The circumstance that at the last meeting of

Dthe British Association in this town. Section assumed for the first time

the title which it has since held, that of the Section of Biology, suggested

to me that I might take the word ' biology ' as my starting-point, giving

you some account of its origin and first use, and of the relations which

subsist between biology and other branches of natural science.

                  Origin and Meaning of the Term ' Biology.'

    The word 'biology,' which is now so familiar as comprising the snm

of the knowledge which has as yet been acquired concerning living

nature, was unknown until after the beginning of the present century.
The term was first employed by Treviranus, who proposed to himself as
a life-task the development of a new science, the aim of which should be
to study the forms and phenomena of life, its origin and the conditions
and laws of its existence, and embodied what was known on these subjects

in a book of seven volumes, which he entitled ' Biology, or the Philosophy
of Living Nature.' For its construction the material was very scanty,
and was chiefly derived from the anatomists and physiologists. For
botanists were entirely occupied in completing the work which Linnaeus
had begun, and the scope of zoology was in like manner limited to the

description and classification of animals. It was a new thing to regard

the study of living nature as a science by itself, worthy to occupy a place
by the side of natural philosophy, and it was therefore necessary to vindi-
cate its claim to such a position. Treviranus declined to found this claim
on its useful applications to the arts of agriculture and medicine, con-
sidering that to regard any subject of study in relation to our bodily

-- --wants in other words to utility was to narrow it, but dwelt rather

on its value as a discipline and on its surpassing interest. He commends

biology to his readers as a study which, above all others, ' nourishes and
maintains the taste for simplicity and nobleness ; which affords to the
intellect ever new material for reflection, and to the imagination an in-

exhaustible source of attractive images.
      Being himself a mathematician as well as a naturalist, he approaches

the subject both from the side of natural philosophy and from that of

natural history, and desires to found the new science on the fundamental

distinction between living and non-living material. In discussing this
distinction, he takes as his point of departure the constancy with which
the activities which manifest themselves in the universe are balanced,
emphasising the impossibility of excluding from that balance the vital
activities of plants and animals. The difference between vital and
physical processes he accordingly finds, not in the nature of the processes
 themselves, but in their co-ordination; that is, in their adaptedness to
 a given purpose, and to the peculiar and special relation in which the
 organism stands to the external world. All of this is expressed in a pro-
position diflBicult to translate into English, in which he defines life as
 consisting in the reaction of the organism to extei'nal influences, and
 contrasts the uniformity of vital reactions with the variety of their

 exciting causes.'

--Einwirkungen der Aussenwelt.' Treviranus, Biologie oder PhilvsojjMe der lebenden

 Natur, Gottingen, 1802, vol. i. p. 83.
6 KEPOET 1893.

     The purpose which I have in view in taking yon back as I have done
to the beginning of the century is not merely to commemorate the work

done by the wonderfully acute writer to whom we owe the first scientific

conception of the science of life as a whole, but to show that this con-
ception, as expressed in the definition I have given you as its foundation,

can still be accepted as true. It suggests the idea of organisin as that to

which all other biological ideas must relate. It also suggests, although

perhaps it does not express it, that action is not an attribute of the

--organism but of its essence that if, on the one hand, protoplasm is the

basis of life, life is the basis of protoplasm. Their relations to each

Weother are reciprocal.  think of the visible structure only in con-

nection with the invisible process. The definition is also of value as

indicating at once the two lines of inquiry into which the science has

divided by the natural evolution of knowledge. These two lines may be

easily educed from the general principle from which Treviranns started,

according to which it is the fundamental characteristic of the organism

that all that goes on in it is to the advantage of the whole. I need

scarcely say that this fundamental conception of organism has at all

times presented itself to the minds of those who have sought to under-

stand the distinction between living and non-living. Without going

back to the true father and founder of biology, Aristotle, we may recall

with interest the language employed in relation to it by the physiologists

of three hundred years ago. It was at that time expressed by the term

--consensus partium which was defined as the concurrence of parts in

action, of such a nature that each does qitod suum est, all combining

to bring about one eSect ' as if they had been in secret council,' but at

the same time cunstanti quadaw, naturoi lerjo} Professor Huxley has

made familiar to us how a century later Descartes imagined to himself a

mechanism to carry out this consensus, based on such scanty knowledge

as was then available of the structure of the nervous system. The dis-

coveries of the early part of the present century relating to reflex action

and the functions of sensory and motor nerves, served to realise in a

wonderful way his anticipations as to the channels of influence, afferent

and efferent, by which the consensus is maintained ; and in recent times

(as we hope to learn from Professor Horsley's lecture on the physiology

of the nervous system) these channels have been investigated with

extraordinary minuteness and success.

Whether with the old writers we speak about co^isensus, with Treviranus

about adaptation, or are content to take organism as our point of departure,

it means that, regarding a plant or an animal as an organism, we concern

ourselves primarily with its activities or, to use the word which best ex-

Nowpresses it, its energies.  the first thing that strikes us in beginning

to think about the activities of an organism is that they are naturally

distinguishable into two kinds, according as we consider the action of

the whole organism in its relation to the external world or to other

organisms, or the action of the parts or organs in their relation to each

other. The distinction to which we are thus led between the infernal

and external relations of plants and animals has of course always existed,

but has only lately come into such prominence that it divides biologists

--more or less completely into two camps on the one hand those who

make it their aim to investigate the actions of the organism and its parts

by the accepted methods of physics and chemistry, carrying this investi-

gation as far as the conditions under which each process manifests itself

will permit ; on the other those who interest themselves rather in con-

sidering the place which each organism occupies, and the part which it

plays in the economy of nature. It is apparent that the two lines of

inquiry, although they equally relate to what the organism does, rather

than to what it is, and therefore both have equal right to be included in

the one great science of life, or biology, yet lead in directions which,

are scarcely even parallel. So marked, indeed, is the distinction, that

Professor Haeckel some twenty years ago proposed to separate the study

of organisms with reference to their jolace in nature under the designa-

tion of ' oecology,' defining it as comprising ' the relations of the animal

to its organic as well as to its inorganic environment, particularly its

friendly or hostile relations to those animals or plants with which it

conies into direct contact.' · Whether this term expresses it or not, the

distinction is a fundamental one. Whether with the cecologist we

regard the organism in relation to the world, or with the physiologist as

a wonderful complex of vital energies, the two branches have this in

common, that both studies fix their attention, not on stuffed animals,

butterflies in cases, or even microscopical sections of the animal or plant

-- --body all of which relate to the framework of life but on life itself.

The conception of biology which was developed by Treviranus as far

as the knowledge of plants and animals which then existed rendered

possible, seems to me still to express the scope of the science. I should
have liked, had it been within my power, to present to you both aspects

of the subject in equal fulness ; but I feel that I shall best profit by the

mypresent opportunity if I derive  illustrations chiefly from the division of

--biology to which I am attached that which concerns the internal rela-

mytions of the organism, it being  object not to specialise in either

direction, but, as Treviranus desired to do, to regard biology as part

--surely a very important part of the great science of nature.

The origin of life, the first transition from non-living to living, is a

     ' These he identifies with 'those complicated mutual relations which Darwin

--designates as conditions of the struggle for existence.' Along with chorology the
--distribution of animals oecology constitutes what he calls Relatiotis-Physiologie.

riddle whicli lies outside of our scope. No seriously-minded person,

however, doubts tliat organised nature as it now presents itself to us

has become what it is by a process of gradual perfecting or advance-

ment, brought about by the elimination of those organisms which failed

to obey the fundamental principle of adaptation which Treviranus indi-

cated. Each step, therefore, in this evolution is a reaction to external

influences, the motive of which is essentially the same as that by which

from moment to moment the organism governs itself. And the whole

process is a necessary outcome of the fact that those organisms are most

prosperous which look best after theu' own welfare. As in that part of

biology which deals with the internal relations of the organism, the

interest of the individual is in like manner the sole motive by which

Weevery energy is guided.  may take what Treviranus called selfish
-- --adaptation ZweckmdssigTieit filr sich selher as a connecting link

between the two branches of biological study. Out of this relation

springs another which I need not say was not recognised until after the

--Darwinian epoch that, I mean, which subsists between the two evolu-

tions, that of the race and that of the individual. Treviranus, no less

distinctly than his great contemporary Lamarck, was well aware that

the affinities of plants and animals must be estimated according to their

developmental value, and consequently that classification must be founded

on development ; but it occurred to no one what the real link was between

descent and develojDment ; nor was it, indeed, until several years after the

publication of the ' Origin ' that Haeckel enunciated that ' biogenetic

law ' according to which the development of any individual organism is

but a memory, a recapitulation by the individual of the development of

--the race of the process for which Fritz Miiller had coined the excellent

word ' phylogenesis ; and that each stage of the former is but a transitory
                                                                                                     '

reappearance of a bygone epoch in its ancestral history. If, therefore,

we are right in regarding ontogenesis as dependent on phylogenesis, the

origin of the former must correspond with that of the latter ; that is,

on the power which the race or the organism at every stage of its

existence possesses of profiting by every condition or circumstance for its

own advancement.

From the short summary of the connection between different parts of

our science you will see that biology naturally falls into three divisions,

and these are even more sharply distinguished by their methods than by

their subjects ; namely, Physiology, of which the methods are entirely

experimental ; Morphology, the science which deals with the forms and

structure of plants and animals, and of which it may be said that the

body is anatomy, the soul, development ; and finally CEcologij, which uses

all the knowledge it can obtain from the other two, but chiefly rests on

the exploration of the endless varied phenomena of animal and plant life

as they manifest themselves under natural conditions. This last branch

--of biology the science which concerns itself with the external relations of

plants and animals to each other, and to the past and present conditions

--of their existence is by far the most attractive. In it those qualities of

mind which especially distinguish the naturalist find their liighest
exercise, and it represents more than any other branch of the subject
what Treviranus termed the ' philosophy of living nature.' Notwith-
standing the very general interest which several of its problems excite at
the present moment I do not propose to discuss any of them, but rather
to limit myself to the humbler task of showing that the fundamental idea
which finds one form of expression in the world of living beings regarded

-- --as a whole the prevalence of the best manifests itself with equal dis-

tinctness, and plays an equally essential part in the internal relations of

--the organism and in the great science which treats of them Physiology.

    Origin and Scope of Modern Physiglogt.

    Just as there was no true philosophy of living natare until Darwin,

we may with almost equal truth say that physiology did not exist as a

science before Johannes Miiller. For although the sum of his numerous

achievements in comparative anatomy and physiology, notwithstanding

their extraordiuaiy number and importance, could not be compared for

merit and fruitfulness with the one discovery which furnished the key to

so many riddles, he, no less than Darwin, by his influence on his suc-

cessors was the beginner of a new era.

    Miiller taught in Berlin from 1833 to 1857. During that time a

gradual change was in progress in the way in which biologists regarded

the fundamental problem of life. Miiller himself, in common with

Treviranus and all the biological teachers of his time, was a vitalist, i.e.,

necessary consequence held that phenomena should be classified or dis-

tinguished, according to the forces which produced them, as vital or

--physical, and that all those processes that is groups or series of phe-

--nomena in living organisms for which, in the then very imperfect know-

ledge which existed, no obvious physical explanation could be found,

were sufficiently explained when they were stated to be dependent on so-

called vital laws. But during the period of Miiller's greatest activity

times were changing, and he was changing with them. During his long

career as professor at Berlin he became more and more objective in his

tendencies, and exercised an influence in the same direction on the men

of the next generation, teaching them that it was better and more useful

to  observe than to  philosophise                                                  so  that, although  he  himself                                                                                                                                                                                                                             is   truly

donment of theory for fact, of speculation for experiment. Physiologists

ceased to theorise because they found something better to do. May I try

to give you a sketch of this era of progress ?
     Great discoveries as to the structure of plants and animals had been

made in the course of the previous decade, those especially which had

resulted from the introduction of the microscope as an instrument of

research. By its aid Schwann had been able to show that all organised
structures are built up of those particles of living substance which we
now call cells, and recognise as the seats and sources of every kind of
vital activity. Hugo Mohl, working in another direction, had given the
name ' protoplasm ' to a certain hyaline substance which forms the lining of
the cells of plants, though no one as yet knew that it was the essential

--constituent of all living structures the basis of life no less in animals
-- --than in plants. And, finally, a new branch of study histology founded

on observations which the microscope had for the first time rendered
possible, had come into existence. Bowman, one of the earliest and most
successful cultivators of this new science, called it physiological anatomy,'
and justified the title by the very important inferences as to the secreting
function of epithelial cells and as to the nature of muscular contraction,
which he deduced from his admirable anatomical researches. From struc-
ture to function, from microscopical observation to physiological experi-
ment, the transition was natural. Anatomy was able to answer some

questions, but asked many more. Fifty years ago physiologists had

--microscopes but had no laboratories. English physiologists Bowman,
--Paget, Sharpey were at the same time anatomists, and in Berlin

Johannes Miiller, along with anatomy and physiology, taught compara-
tive anatomy and pathology. But soon that specialisation which, how-

ever much we may regret its necessity, is an essential concomitant of
progress, became more and more inevitable. The structural conditions

on which the processes of life depend had become, if not known, at least
accessible to investigation ; but very little indeed had been ascertained of

--the nature of the processes themselves so little indeed that if at this

moment we could blot from the records of physiology the whole of the

information which had been acquired, say in 1840, the loss would be diffi-

--cult to trace not that the previously known facts were of little value,

but because every fact of moment has since been subjected to experi-
mental verification. It is for this reason that, without any hesitation, we
accord to Miiller and to his successors Briicke, du Bois-Reymond, Helm-
holtz, who were his pupils, and Ludwig, in Germany, and to Claude

Bernard ^ in France, the title of founders of our science. For it is

     ' The first part of the Physiological Anatomy appeared in 1843. It was concluded

in 1856.

raries : Ludwig graduated in 1839, Bernard in 1843, the other three between those

ADDRESS.  1

  the work which they began at that remarkable time (1845-55), and which
  is now being carried on by their pupils or their pupils' pupils in England,
  America, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, and even in that
  youngest contributor to the advancement of science, Japan, that physio-

  logy has been gradually built up to whatever completeness it has at

  present attained.

      What were the conditions which brought about this great advance

  which coincided with the middle of the century ? There is but little

  diflficulty in answering the question. I have already said that the change
  was not one of doctrine, but of method. There was, however, a leading

 idea in the minds of those who were chiefly concerned in bringing it
 about. That leading notion was, that, however complicated may be the

 conditions under which vital energies manifest themselves, they can be
 split into processes which are identical in nature with those of the non-

  living world, and, as a corollary to this, that the analysing of a vital

 process into its physical and chemical constituents, so as to bring these

 constituents into measurable relation with physical or chemical standards,

 is the only mode of investigating them which can lead to satisfactory

 results.

      There were several circumstances which at that time tended to make

 the younger physiologists (and all of the men to whom I have just

 referred were then young) sanguine, perhaps too sanguine, in the hope
 that the application of experimental methods derived from the exact

 sciences would aiford solutions of many physiological problems. One of
 these was the progress which had been made in the science of chemistry,
 and particularly the discovery that many of the compounds which before

had been regarded as special products of vital processes could be
 produced in the laboratory, and the more complete knowledge which had
been thereby acquired of their chemical constitutions and relations. In

like manner, the new school profited by the advances which had been
made in physics, partly by borrowing from the physical laboratory various
improved methods of observing the phenomena of living beings, but

chiefly in consequence of the direct bearing of the crowning discovery of
that epoch (that of the conservation of energy) on the discussions which
then took place as to the relations between vital and physical forces;

in connection with which it may be noted that two of those who (along

with Mr. Joule and your President at the last Nottingham meeting) took

-- --a prominent part in that discovery Helmholtz and J. R. Mayer were

physiologists as much as they were physicists. I will not attempt even

to enumerate the achievements of that epoch of progress. I may, how-
ever, without risk of wearying you, indicate the lines along which research
at first proceeded, and draw your attention to the contrast between then

and now. At present a young observer who is zealous to engage in re-
search finds himself provided with the most elaborate means of investiga-

tion, the chief obstacle to his success being that the problems which have
12 REPORT-- 1893.

beeu. left over by his predecessors are of extreme difficulty, all of tbe
easier questions having been worked out. There were then also difficul-
ties, but of an entirely different kind. The work to be done was in itself
easiei", but the means for doing it were wanting, and every investigator

had to depend on his own resources. Consequently the successful men

were those who, in addition to scientific training, possessed the ingenuity
to devise and the skill to carry out methods for themselves. The work
by which du Bois-Reymond laid the foundation of animal electricity
would not have been possible had not its author, besides being a trained

physicist, known how to do as good work in a small room in the upper
floor of the old University Building at Berlin as any which is now done
in his splendid laboratory. Had Ludwig not possessed mechanical apti-

tude, in addition to scientific knowledge, he would have been unable to
devise the apparatus by which he measured and recorded the variations

of arterial pressure (1848), and verified the principles which Young had
laid down thirty years before as to the mechanics of the circulation.
Nor, lastly, could Helmholtz, had he not been a great deal more than a
mere physiologist, have made those measurements of the time-relations of

muscular and nervous responses to stimulation, which not only afford a
solid foundation for all that has been done since in the same direction,
but have served as models of physiological experiment, and as evidence

that perfect work was possible and was done by capable men, even when

there were no physiological laboi-atories.
     Each of these examples relates to work done within a year or two of

the middle of the century.' If it were possible to enter more fully on the
scientific history of the time, we should, I think, find the clearest evidence,
first, that the foundation was laid in anatomical discoveries, in which it
is gratifying to remember that English anatomists (Allen Thomson,
Bowman, Goodsir, Sharpey) took considerable share ; secondly, that
progress was rendered possible by the rapid advances which, during the
previous decade, had been made in jjhysics and chemistry, and the partici-
pation of physiology in the general awakening of the scientific spirit
which these discoveries produced. I venture, however, to think that,
notwithstanding the operation of these two causes, or rather combinations
of causes, the development of our science would have been delayed had it
not been for the exceptional endowments of the four or five young experi-

menters whose names T have mentioned, each of whom was capable of
becoming a master in his own branch, and of guiding the future progress

of inquiry.

      Just as the affinities of an organism can be best learned fi'om its

development, so the scope of a science may be most easily judged of by

the tendencies whicli it exhibits in its origin. I wish now to complete

the sketch I have endeavoured to give of the way in which physiology

entered on the career it has since followed for the last half-century, by

a few words as to the influence exercised on general physiological theory

Weby the progress of research.  have seen that no real advance was

made until it became possible to investigate the phenomena of life by

methods which approached more or less closely to those of the phy-

sicist, in exactitude. The methods of investigation being physical or

chemical, the organism itself naturally came to be considered as a complex

of such processes, and nothing more. And in particular the idea of

adaptation, which, as I have endeavoured to show, is not a consequence

of organism, but its essence, was in great measure lost sight of. Not, I

think, because it was any more possible than before to conceive of the

organism otherwise than as a working together of parts for the good of

the whole, but rather that, if I may so express it, the minds of men were

so occupied with new facts that they had not time to elaborate theories.

The old meaning of the term 'adaptation ' as the equivalent of ' design ' had
been abandoned, and no new meaning had yet been given to it, and con-

sequently the word ' mechanism ' came to be employed as the equivalent of

^process,' as if the constant concomitance or sequence of two events was in

itself a sufficient reason for assuming a mechanical relation between them.

As in daily life so also in science, the misuse of words leads to miscon-

ceptions. To assert thab the link between a and b is mechanical, for no

better reason than that i always follows a, is an error of statement, which

is apt to lead the incautious reader or hearer to imagine that the relation

between a and b is understood, when in fact its nature may be wholly

unknown. "Whether or not at the time which we are considering, some

physiological writers showed a tendency to commit this error, I do not

think that it found expression in any generally accepted theory of life.

It may, however, be admitted that the rapid progress of experimental in-

vestigation led to too confident anticipations, and that to some enthusiastic

minds it appeared as if we were approaching within measurable distance

of the end of knowledge. Such a tendency is, I think, a natural result

of every signal advance. In an eloquent Harveian oration, delivered last
autumn by Dr. Bridges, it was indicated how, after Harvey's great dis-

covery of the circulation, men were too apt to found upon it explanations

of all phenomena whether of health or disease, to such an extent that the

practice of medicine was even prejudicially affected by it. In respect of

its scientific importance the epoch we are considering may well be com-
pared with that of Harvey, and may have been followed by an undue

preference of the new as compared with the old, but no more permanent

unfavourable results have shown themselves. As regards the science of

medicine we need only remember that it was during the years between

1845 and 1860 that Yirchow made those researches by which he brought

the processes of disease into immediate relation with the normal processes
 14 EEPORT-- 1893.

 of cell-development and growth, and so, by making pathology a part of
 physiology, secured its subsequent progress and'its influence on practical

 medicine. Similarly in physiology, the achievements of those years led
 on without any interruption or drawback to those of the following gene-

 ration ; while in general biology, the revolution in the mode of regarding
 the internal processes of the animal or plant organism which resulted
 from these achievements, prepared the way for the acceptance of the still
 greater revolution which the Darwinian epoch brought about in the views
entertained by naturalists of the relations of plants and animals to each
 other and to their surroundings.

      It has been said that every science of observation begins by going out
 botanising, by which, I suppose, is meant that collecting and recording
observations is the first thing to be done in entering on a new field of
inquiry. The remark would scarcely be true of physiology, even at the
earliest stage of its development, for the most elementary of its facts
 could scarcely be picked up as one gathers flowers in a wood. Each of
the processes which go to make up the complex of life requires separate
investigation, and in each case the investigation must consist in first
splitting up the process into its constituent phenomena, and then deter-
mining their relation to each other, to the process of which they form
part, and to the conditions under which they manifest themselves. It
will, I think, be found that even in the simplest inquiry into the nature of
vital processes some such order as this is followed. Thus, for example,
if muscular contraction be the subject on which we seek information,
it is obvious that, in order to measure its duration, the mechanical work
it accomplishes, the heat wasted in doing it, the electro-motive forces
which it develops, and the changes of form associated with these phe-
nomena, special modes of observation must be used for each of them,
that each measurement must be in the first instance separately made,
under special conditions, and by methods specially adapted to the
required purpose. In the synthetic part of the inquiry the guidance of
experiment must again be sought for the purpose of discriminating
between apparent and real causes, and of determining the order in which
the phenomena occur. Even the simplest experimental investigations
of vital processes are beset with difficulties. For, in addition to the
extreme complexity of the phenomena to be examined and the un-
certainties which arise from the relative inconstancy of the conditions
of all that goes on in the living organism, there is this additional draw-
back, that, whereas in the exact sciences experiment is guided by well-

ascertained laws, here the only principle of universal application is that
of adaptation, and that even this cannot, like a law of physics, be taken

as a basis for deductions, but only as a summary expression of that
relation between external exciting causes and the reactions to which

they give rise, which, in accordance with Treviranus' definition, is the

essentia] character of vital activity.

ADDRESS.  15

                      The Specific Energies of the Organism.

     When in 182o J. Miiller was engaged in investigating the physiology

 of vision and hearing he introduced into the discussion a term, ' specific
 energy,' the use of which by Helmholtz ' in his physiological writings has
 rendered it familiar to all students. Both writers mean by the word
 energy, not the ' capacity of doing woi^k,' but simply activity, using it in
 its old-fashioned meaning, that of the Greek word from which it is de-
 rived. With the qualification ' specific ' it serves, perhaps, better than any
 other expression to indicate the way in which adaptation manifests itself.
 In this more extended sense the ' specific energy ' of a part or organ
 whether that part be a secreting cell, a motor cell of the brain or
 spinal cord, or one of the photogenous cells which produce the light
 of the glowworm, or the protoplasmic plate which generates the dis-

--charge of the torpedo is simply the special action which it normally

 performs, its norma or rule of action being in each instance the interest
 of the organism as a whole of which it forms part, and the exciting cause
 some influence outside of the excited structure, technically called

 a stimulus. It thus stands for a characteristic of liviner structures

 which seems to be universal. The apparent exceptions are to be found in
those bodily activities which, following Bichat, we call vegetative, because
they go on, so to speak, as a matter of course; but the more closely we
look into them the more does it appear that they form no exception to the
general rule, that every link in the chain of living action, however uniform
that action may be, is a response to an antecedent influence. Nor can it
well be doubted that, as every living cell or tissue is called upon to act in
the interest of the whole, the organism must be capable of influencing
every part so as to regulate its action. For, although there are some in-
stances in which the channels of this influence are as yet unknown, the
tendency of recent investigations has been to diminish the number of such
instances. In general there is no diSiculty in determining both the
nature of the central influence exercised and the relation between it and
the normal function. It may help to illustrate this relation to refer to the
expressive word Auslosung by which it has for many years been designated
by German writers. This word stands for the performance of function by

the ' letting off"' of ' specific energies.' Carrying out the notion of ' letting

off'' as expressing the link between action and reaction, we might com-
pare the whole process to the mode of working of a repeating clock (or
other similar mechanism), in which case the pressure of the finger on the
button would represent the external influence or stimulus, the striking
of the clock, tbe normal reaction. And now may I ask you to consider

--in detail one or two illustrations of physiological reaction of the letting

off of specific energy ?

     ' Handh. der physiologischen Optik, 1886, p. 233. Helmholtz uses the word in

--the plural the ' energies of the nerves of special sense.'
16 BEPOET-- 1893.

The repeater may serve as a good example, inasmuch as it, is, in

biological language, a highly differentiated structure, to which a single

function is assigned. So also in the living organism, we find the best

examples of specific energy where Miiller found them, namely, in the

most differentiated, or, as we are apt to call them, the highest structures.

The retina, with the part of the brain which belongs to it, together con-

stitute such a structure, and will afford us therefore the illustration we

want, with this advantage for our present purpose, that the phenomena

are such as we all have it in our power to observe in ourselves. In

the visual apparatus the principle of riormality of reaction is fully

exemplified. In the physical sense the word ' light ' stands for ether

vibrations, but in the sensuous or subjective sense for sensations. The

swings are the stimulus, the sensations are the reaction. Between the

two comes the link, the ' letting off,' which it is our business to under-

stand. Here let us remember that the man who first recognised this

distinction between the physical and the physiological was not a bio-

logist, but a physicist. It was Young who first made clear (though his

doctrine fell on unappreciative ears) that, although in vision the external

influences which give rise to the sensation of light are infinitely varied,

the responses need not be more than three in number, each being, in

Miiller's language, a ' specific energy ' of some part of the visual appa-

Weratus.  speak of the organ of vision as highly differentiated, an

expression which carries with it the suggestion of a distinction of rank

between different vital processes. The suggestion is a true one ; for it

would be possible to arrange all those parts or organs of which the

bodies of the higher animals consist in a series, placing at the lower end

of the series those of which the functions are continuous, and therefore

called vegetative ; at the other, those highly specialised structures, as, e.g.,
those in the brain, which in response to physical light produce physiolo-

gical, that is subjective, light ; or, to take another instance, the so-called

motor cells of the surface of the brain, which in response to a stimulus

of much greater complexity produce voluntary motion. And just as in

civilised society an individual is valued according to his power of doing

one thing well, so the high rank which is assigned to the structure, or

rather to the 'specific energy' which it represents, belongs to it by

virtue of its specialisation. And if it be asked how this conformity is

manifested, the answer is, by the quality, intensity, duration, and ex-

tension of the response, in all which respects vision serves as so good an

example, that we can readily understand how it happened that it was in

this field that the relation between response and stimulus was first

clearly recognised. I need scarcely say that, however interesting it

might be to follow out the lines of inquiry thus indicated, we can-

not attempt it this evening. All that I can do is to mention one or two

recent observations which, while they serve as illustrations, may perhaps

be sufficiently novel to interest even those who are at home in the subject.
                                                                                       --;

     Probably everyone is acquainted with some of tlie familiar proofs that

an object is seen for a much longer period than it is actually exposed to
view ; that the visual reaction lasts much longer than its cause. More

precise observations teach us that this response is regulated accordino- to

laws which it has in common with all the higher functions of an organism.

If, for example, the cells in the brain of the torpedo are 'let off'

--that is, awakened by an external stimulus the electrical discharo-e

which, as in the case of vision, follows after a certain interval, lasts a

certain time, first rapidly increasing to a maximum of intensity, then

more slowly diminishing. In like manner, as regards the visual appa-

ratus, we have, in the response to a sudden invasion of the eye by lio-ht, a

rise and fall of a similar character. In the case of the electrical organ

and in many analogous instances, it is easy to investigate the time rela-

tions of the successive phenomena, so as to represent them graphically.
Again, it is found that in many physiological reactions, the period of

rising ' energy ' (as Helmholtz called it) is followed by a period during

which the responding structure is not only inactive, but its capacity for

energising is so completely lost that the same exciting cause which a

moment before 'let off' the characteristic response is now without effect.

As regards vision, it has long been believed that these general charac-

teristics of physiological reaction have their counterpart in the visual

process, the most striking evidence being that in the contemplation of a

--lightning flash or, better, of an instantaneously illuminated white disc '

the eye seems to receive a double stroke, indicating that, althouo-h the

stimulus is single and instantaneous, the response is reduplicated. The

most precise of the methods we until lately possessed for investigating

the wax and wane of the visual reaction, were not only difficult to carry

out but left a large margin of uncertainty. It was therefore particularly

satisfactory when M. Charpentier, of Nancy, whose merits as an in-

vestigator are perhaps less known than they deserve to be, devised an

experiment of extreme simplicity which enables us, not only to observe,

but to measure with great facility both phases of the reaction. It is

difficult to explain even the simplest apparatus without diagrams you
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

bar, followed by a second at the same distance from itself but much

the angular distance of the bar from the black border is in proportion

example, when the disc makes half a revolution in a second the dis-
tance is ten degrees, this obviously means that when light bursts into

the eye, the extinction happens one-eighteenth of a second after the

excitation.'

     The fact thus demonstrated, that the visual reaction consequent on an
instantaneous illumination exhibits the alternations I have described, has
enabled M. Charpentier to make out another fact in relation to the visual
reaction which is, I think, of equal importance. In all the instances,
excepting the retina, in which the physiological response to stimulus has

--a definite time-limitation, and in so far resembles an explosion in other

words, in all the higher forms of specific energy, it can be shown experi-
mentally that the process is propagated from the jiart first directly acted
on to other contiguous parts of similar endowment. Thus in the simplest
of all known phenomena of this kind, the electrical change, by which the
leaf of the Dion^a plant responds to the slightest touch of its sensitive
hairs, is propagated from one side of the leaf to the other, so that in the
opposite lobe the response occui'S after a delay which is proportional to
the distance between the spot excited and the spot observed. That in
the retina there is also such propagation has not only been surmised from
analogy, but inferred from certain observed facts. M. Charpentier has
row been able by a method which, although simple, I must not attempt
to describe, not only to prove its existence, but to measure its rate of

progress over the visual field.

     There is another aspect of the visual response to the stimulus of light

which, if I am not trespassing too long on your patience, may, I think, be

interesting to consider. As the relations between the sensations of colour
and the physical properties of the light which excites them, are among the
most certain and invariable in the whole range of vital reactions, it is

obvious that they afford as fruitful a field for physiological investigation

Weas those in which white light is concerned.  have on one side

physical facts, that is, wave-lengths or vibration-rates; on the other,

-- --facts in consciousness namely, sensations of colour so simple that

notwithstanding their subjective character there is no difficulty in

measuring either their intensity or their duration. Between these there

are lines of influence, neither physical nor psychological, which pass from

the former to the latter through the visual apparatus (retina, nerve,

brain). It is these lines of influence which interest the physiologist.

The structure of the visual apparatus afiTords us no clues to trace them

by. The most important fact we know about them is that they must be

at least three in number.

It has been lately assumed by some that vision, like every other

specific energy, having been developed progressively, objects were seen

by the most elementary forms of eye only in chiaroscuro, that afterwards

some colours were distinguished, eventually all. As regards hearino- it

is so. The organ which, on structural grounds, we consider to represent

--that of hearing in animals low in the scale of organisation as, e.g.,
--in the Ctenopliora has nothing to do with sound, · but confers on its

possessor the power of judging of the direction of its own movements in

the water in which it swims, and of guiding these movements accordingly.

In the lowest vertebrates, as, e.g., in the dogfish, although the auditory

apparatus is much more complicated in structure, and plainly corresponds

with our own, we still find the particular part which is concerned in

hearing scarcely traceable. All that is provided for is that sixth sense,

which the higher animals also possess, and which enables them to judge

of the direction of their own movements. But a stage higher in the

vertebrate series we find the special mechanisms by which we ourselves

--appreciate sounds beginning to appear not supplanting or taking the

place of the imperfect organ, but added to it. As regards hearing,

therefore, a new function is acquired without any transformation or

Wefusion of the old into it.  ourselves possess the sixth sense, by which

we keep our balance and which serves as the guide to our bodily move-

ments. It resides in the part of the internal ear which is called the

labyrinth. At the same time we enjoy along with it the possession of the

cochlea, that more complicated apparatus by which we are able to hear

sounds and to discriminate their vibration-rates.

As regards vision, evidence of this kind is wanting. There is, so far

as I know, no proof that visual organs which are so imperfect as to be

inca.pable of distinguishing the forms of objects, may not be affected

differently by their colours. Even if it could be shown that the least

perfect forms of eye possess only the power of discriminating between

light and darkness, the question whether in our own such a faculty exists

separately from that of distinguishing colours is one which can only be

settled by experiment. As in all sensations of colour the sensation of

brightness is mixed, it is obvious that one of the first points to be deter,

mined is whether the latter represents a ' specific energy ' or merely a

certain combination of specific energies which are excited by colours.
The question is not whether there is such a thing as white lio-ht, but
whether we possess a separate faculty by which we judge of lio-ht and

--shade a question which, although we have derived our knowledge of it

chiefly from physical experiment, is one of eye and brain, not of wave-

lengths or vibration-rates, and is therefore essentially physiological.

There is a Grerman proverb which says, 'Bei Nacht sind alle Katzen

grau.' The fact which this proverb expresses presents itself experiment-
ally when a spectrum projected on a white surface is watched, while the

intensity of the light is gradually diminished. As the colours fade away
they become indistinguishable as such, the last seen being the primary
red and green. Finally they also disappear, but a grey band of light
still remains, of which the most luminous part is that which before was
green.' Without entering into details, let us consider what this tells us
of the specific energy of the visual apparatus. Whether or not the
faculty by which we see grey in the dark is one which we possess in
common with animals of imperfectly developed vision, there seems little
doubt that there are individuals of our own species who, in the fullest

sense of the expression, have no eye for colour ; in whom all colour sense

is absent persons who inhabit a world of grey, seeing all things as they
                                                   ;

might have done had they and their ancestors always lived nocturnal
lives. In the theory of colour vision, as it is commonly stated, no reference

is made to such a faculty as we are now discussing.

     Professor Hering, whose observations as to the diminished spectrum

I referred to just now, who was among the first to subject the vision of

the totally colour-blind to accurate examination, is of opinion, on that
and on other grounds, that the sensation of light and shade is a specific
faculty. Very recently the same view has been advocated on a wide basis
by a distingaished psychologist, Professor Ebbinghaus.'^ Happily, as
regaids the actual experimental results relating to both these main
subjects, there seems to be a complete coincidence of observation between

observers who interpret them differently. Thus the recent elaborate
investigations of Captain Abney ^ (with General Festing), representing

graphically the results of his measurements of the subjective values of
the difi'erent parts of the diminished spectrum, as well as those of the
fully illuminated spectrum as seen by the totally colour-blind, are in the
closest accord with the observations of Hering, and have, moreover, been
substantially confirmed in both points by the measurements of Dr. Konig
in Helmholtz' laboratory at Berlin.'* That observers of such eminence

as the three persons whom I have mentioned, employing different methods

and with a different purpose in view, and without reference to each
other's work, should arrive in so complicated an inquiry at coincident
results, augurs well for the speedy settlement of this long-debated
question. At present the inference seems to be that such a specific
energy as Hering's theory of vision postulates actually exists, and that
it has for associates the colour-perceiving activities of the visual appa-
ratus, provided that these are present ; but that whenever the intensity

                             EXPEEIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.

    Resisting the temptation to pursue this subject further, I will now ask
you to follow me into a region which, although closely connected with

--the subjects we have been considering, is beset with greater difficulties

the subject in which, under the name of Physiological or Experimental

Psychology, physiologists and psychologists have of late years taken a

--common interest a borderland not between fact and fancy, but between

two methods of investigation of questions which are closely related,
which here, though they do not overlap, at least interdigitate. It is

manifest that, quite irrespectively of any foregone conclusion as to the
dependence of mind on processes of which the biologist is accustomed to
take cognizance, mind must be regarded as one of the ' specific energies '
of the organism, and should on that ground be included in the subject-
matter of physiology. As, however, our science, like other sciences, is
limited not merely by its subject but also by its method, it actually takes

in only so much of psychology as is experimental. Thus sensation,

although it is psychological, and the investigation of its relation to the
special structures by which the mind keeps itself informed of what goes
on in the outside world, have always been considered to be in the physio-

logical sphere. And it is by anatomical researches relating to the

minute structure and to the development of the brain, by observation
of the facts of disease, and, above all, by physiological experiment,
that those changes in the ganglion cells of the brain and spinal cord
which are the immediate antecedents of every kind of bodily action have

--been traced. Between the two that is, between sensation and the

--beginning of action there is an intervening region which the physio-

logist has hitherto willingly resigned to psychology, feeling his incompe-

--tence to use the only instrument by which it can be explored that of

introspection. This consideration enables us to understand the course

which the new study (I will not claim for it the title of a new science,

regarding it as merely a part of the great science of life) has hitherto

followed, and why physiologists have been unwilling to enter on it. The

study of the less complicated internal relations of the organism has

afforded so many difficult problems that the most difficult of all have

been deferred ; so that although the psycho-physical method was initiated
by E. H. Weber in the middle of the present century, by investigations '
which formed part of the work done at that epoch of discovery, and
although Professor Wnndt, also a physiologist, has taken a larger share in
the more recent development of the new study, it is chiefly by psycho-
logists that the researches which have given to it its importance as a new
discipline have been conducted.

     Although, therefore, experimental psychology has derived its methods

from physical science, the result has been not so much that ^physiologists

have become philosophers, as that philosophers have become experimental

psychologists. In our own universities, in those of America, and still
more in those of Germany, psychological students of mature age are to
be found who are willing to place themselves in the dissecting-room side
by side with beginners in anatomy, in order to acquire that exact know-
ledge of the framework of the oi-ganism without which no man can
understand its working. Those, therefore, who are apprehensive lest the
regions of mind should be invaded by the insaniens sainentia of the

laboratory, may, I think, console themselves with the thought that the

invaders are for the most part men who before they became laboratory

workers had already given their allegiance to philosophy their purpose
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

being not to relinquish definitively, but merely to lay aside for a time,
the weapons in the use of which they had been trained, in order to learn

the use of ours. The motive that has encouraged them has not been any
hope of finding an experimental solution of any of the ultimate problems
of philosophy, but the conviction that, inasmuch as the relation between
mental stimuli and the mental processes which they awaken is of the
same order with the relation between every other vital process and its
specific determinant, the only hope of ascertaining its nature must lie in
the employment of the same methods of comparative measurement which
the biologist uses for similar purposes. Not that there is necessarily
anything scientific in mere measurement, but that measurement affords
the only means by which it can be determined whether or not the same
conformity in the relation between stimulus and reaction which we have
accepted as the fundamental characteristic of life, is also to be found in
mind, notwithstanding that mental processes have no known physical
concomitants. The results of experimental psychology tend to show
that it is so, and consequently that in so far the processes in question are
as truly functions of organism as the contraction of a muscle, or as the
changes produced in the retinal pigment by light.

     I will make no attempt even to enumerate the special lines of inquiry

·which during the last decade have been conducted with such vigour in
all parts of the world, all of them traceable to the influence of the

Leipzig school ; but will content myself with saying that the general

purpose of these investigations has been to determine with the utmost

atlainable precision the nature of psychical relations. Some of these

investigations begin with those simpler reactions which more or less

resemble those of an automatic mechanism, proceeding to those in which

the resulting action or movement is modified by the influence of auxiliary

or antagonistic conditions, or changed by the simultaneous or antecedent

action on the reagent of other stimuli, in all of which cases the efi'ect

can be expressed quantitatively                                                                                                                                                                        others  lead  to  results which  do  not  so
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

readily admit of measurement. In pursuing this course of inquiry the

physiologist finds himself as he proceeds more and more the coadjutor

of the psychologist, less and less his director; for whatever advantage

the former may have in the mere technique of observation, the things

with which he has to do are revealed only to introspection, and can be

studied only by methods which lie outside of his sphere. I might in

--illustration of this refer to many recent experimental researches such,

for example, as those by which it has been sought to obtain exact data

as to the physiological concomitants of pleasure and of pain, or as to the

influence of weariness and recuperation, as modifiers of psychological

reactions. Another outwork of the mental citadel which has been

invaded by the experimental method is that of memory. Even here it
can be shown that in the comparison of transitory as compared with

--permanent memory as, for example, in the getting ofi" by heart of a

wholly uninteresting series of words, with subsequent oblivion and

--reacquisition the labour of acquiring and reacquiring may be measured,

and consequently the relation between them ; and that this ratio varies

according to a simple numerical law.

    I think it not unlikely that the only efi'ect of what I have said may

be to suggest to some of my hearers the question. What is the use of
such inquiries ? Experimental psychology has, to the best of my

knowledge, no technical application. The only satisfactory answer I
can give is that it has exercised, and will exercise in future, a helpful

infiuence on the science of life. Every science of observation, and each

branch of it, derives from the peculiarities of its methods certain ten-

Wedencies which are apt to predominate unduly.                                                                                                                                                                           speak of this as

specialisation, and are constantly striving to resist its infiuence. The
most successful way of doing so is by availing ourselves of the counter-
acting influence which two opposite tendencies mutually exercise when

they are simultaneous. He that is skilled in the methods of introspec-
tion naturally (if I may be permitted to say so) looks at the same thing

from an opposite point of view to that of the experimentahst. It is,
therefore, good that the two should so work together that the tendency

of the experimentalist to imagine the existence of mechanism where none
24 KEPOET-- 1893.

--is proved to exist of the psychologist to approacli the phenomena of
--mind too exclusively from the subjective side^ may mutually correct and

assist each other.

                                   Phototaxis and Chemiotaxis.

     Considering that every organism must have sprung from a unicellular
ancestor, some have thought that unless we are prepared to admit a
deferred epigenesis oi mind, we must look for psychical manifestations
even among the lowest animals, and that as in the protozoon all the
vital activities are blended together, mind should be present among them
not merely potentially but actually, though in diminished degree.

     Such a hypothesis involves ultimate questions which it is unneces-
sary to enter upon : it will, bowever, be of interest in connection with
our present subject to discuss the phenomena which served as a basis for

--it those which relate to what may be termed the behaviour of unicellular

organisms and of individual cells, in so far as these last are capable of
reacting to external influences. The observations which afford us most
information are those in which the stimuli employed can be easily
measured, such as electrical currents, light, or chemical agents in

solution.

     A. single instance, or at most two, must suffice to illustrate the in-
fluence of light in directing the movements of freely moving cells, or, as
it is termed, phototaxis. The rod-like purple organism called by Engel-

mann Bacterium photometricum ' is such a light-lover that if you place

a drop of v^ater containing these organisms under the microscope, and

focus the smallest possible beam of light on a particular spot in the field,
the spot acts as a light trap and becomes so crowded with the little
rodlets as to acquire a deep port- wine colour. If instead of making his

trap of white light, he projected on the field a microscopic spectrum,

Engelmann found that the rodlets showed their preference for a spectral

colour whicb is absorbed when transmitted through their bodies. By

the aid of a light trap of the same kind, the very well-known spindle-
shaped and flagellate cell of Euglena can be shown to have a similar
power of discriminating colour, but its preference is different. This
familiar organism advances with its flagellum forwards, the sharp end of
the spindle having a red or orange eye point. Accordingly, the light it

--loves is again that which is most absorbed viz., the blue of the spectrum

(line f).

    These examples may serve as an introduction to a similar one in

which the directing cause of movement is not physical but chemical.
The spectral light trap is used in the way already described ; the or-

ganisms to be observed are not coloured, but bacteria of that common

sort which twenty years ago we used to call Bacterium termo, and which

is recognised as the ordinary determining cause of putrefaction. These

organisms do not care for light, but are great oxygen-lovers. Conse-

quently, if you illuminate with your spectrum a filament of a confervoid

alga, placed in water containing bacteria, the assimilation of carbon and

consequent disengagement of oxygen are most active in the part of the

filament which receives the red rays (b to c). To this part, therefore,

where there is a dark band of absorption, the bacteria which want

oxygen are attracted in crowds. The motive which brings them together

is their desire for oxygen. Let us compare other instances in which the

source of attraction is food.

The Plasmodia of the myxomycetes, particularly one which has been

recently investigated by Mr. Arthur Lister,' may be taken as a typical
instance of what may be called the chemical allurement of living proto-

plasm. In this organism, which in the active state is an expansion of

labile living material, the delicacy of the reaction is comparable to that

of the sense of smell in those animals in which the olfactory organs are

adapted to an aquatic life. Just as, for example, tlie dogfish is attracted

by food which it cannot see, so the plasmodium of Badhamia becomes

--aware, as if it smelled it, of the presence of its food a particular kind of

fungus. I have no diagram to explain this, but will ask you to imagine

an expansion of living material, quite structureless, spreading itself

along a wet surface ; that this expansion of transparent material is

bounded  by an irregular  coast-line                                             and that somewhere  near  the  coast
                                                                              ;

there has been placed a fragment of the material on which the Badhamia

feeds. The presence of this bit of Stereum produces an excitement at

the part of the plasmodium next to it. Towards this centre of activity

streams of living material converge. Soon the afHux leads to an out-

growth of the Plasmodium, which in a few minutes advances towards the

desired fragment, envelopes, and incorporates it.

May I give you another example also derived from the physiology of

plants ? Very shortly after the publication of Engelmann's observations

of the attraction of bacteria by oxygen, PfeSer made the remarkable

discovery that the movements of the antherozoids of ferns and of mosses

are guided by impressions derived from chemical sources, by the allure-

ment exercised upon them by certain chemical substances in solution

in one of the instances mentioned by sugar, in the other by an organic

acid. The method consisted in introducing the substance to be tested,

in any required strength, into a minute capillary tube closed at one end,

and placing it under the microscope in water inhabited by antherozoids,

which thereupon showed their predilection for the substance, or the

contrary, by its effect on their movements. In accordance with the

principle followed in experimental psychology, Pfeffer ' made it his object

to determine, not the relative effects of different doses, but the smallest

perceptible increase of dose which the organism was able to detect, with

--this result that, just as in measurements of the relation between stimulus

and reaction in ourselves we find that the sensational value of a stimulus
depends, not on its absolute intensity, but on the ratio between that
intensity and the previous excitation, so in this simplest of vital reagents
the same so-called psycho-physical law manifests itself. It is not, how-
ever, with a view to this interesting relation that I have referred to
Pfeffer's discovery, but because it serves as a centre around which other
phenomena, observed alike in plants and animals, have been grouped.
As a general designation of reactions of this kind Pfefifer devised the
term Chemotaxis, or, as we in England prefer to call it, Chemiotaxis.
Pfeffer's contrivance for chemiotactic testing was borrowed from the
pathologists, who have long used it for the purpose of determining the
relation between a great variety of chemical compounds or products, and

the colourless corpuscles of the blood. I need, I am sure, make no

apology for referring to a question which, although purely pathological,

--is of very great biological interest the theory of the process by which,

not only in man, but also, as Metschnikoff has strikingly shown, in

animals far down in the scale of develc»pment, the organism protects

itself against such harmful things as, whether particulate or not, are able
to penetrate its framework. Since Cohnheim's great discovery in 1867

we have known that the central phenomenon of what is termed by
pathologists inflammation is what would now be called a chemiotactic

one ; for it consists in the gathering together, like that of vultures to a

carcase, of those migratory cells which have their home in the blood
stream and in the lymphatic system, to any point where the living tissue
of the body has been injured or damaged, as if the products of dis-
integration which are set free where such damage occurs were attractive

to them.

     The fact of chemiotaxis, therefore, as a constituent phenomenon of
the process of inflammation, was familiar in pathology long before it was
understood. Cohnheim himself attributed it to changes in the channels
along which the cells moved, and this explanation was generally accepted,
though some writers, at all events, recognised its incompleteness. But
no sooner was Pfeffer's discovery known than Leber,^ who for years had
been working at the subject from the pathological side, at once saw that
the two processes were of similar nature. Then followed a variety of
researches of great interest, by which the importance of chemiotaxis in
relation to the destruction of disease-producing microphytes was proved,

that of Bucliner ' on the chemical excitability of leucocytes being

among the most important. Mnch discussion has taken place, as many

present are aware, as to the kind of wandering cells, or leucocytes,

which in the first instance attack morbific microbes, and how they deal
with them. The question is not by any means decided. It has, however,
I venture to think, been conclusively shown that the process of destruc-

tion is a chemical one, that the destructive agent has its source in the

--chemiotactic cells that is, cells which act under the orders of chemical

stimuli. Two Cambridge observers, Messrs. Kanthack and Hardy,- have

lately shown that, in the particular instance which they have investigated,
the cells which are most directly concerned in the destruction of morbific
bacilli, aUhough chemiotactic, do not possess the power of incorporating
either bacilli or particles of any other kind. While, therefore, we must
regard the relation between the process of devitalising and that of
incorporating as not yet sufficiently determined, it is now no longer

possible to regard the latter as essential to the former.

     There seems, therefore, to be very little doubt that chemiotactic cells are

among the agents by which the human or animal organism protects itself
against infection. There are, however, many questions connected with
this action which have not yet been answered. The first of these are

--chemical ones that of the nature of the attractive substance and that

of the process by which the living carriers of infection are destroyed.

Another point to be determined is how far the process admits of adapta-

tion to the pai'ticular infection which is present in each case, and to the
state of liability or immunity of the infected individual. The subject is
therefore of great complication. None of the points I have suggested

can be settled by experiments in glass tubes such as I have described to

you. These serve only as indications of the course to be followed in

--much more complicated and difficult investigations when we have to do

with acute diseases as they actually afiTect ourselves or animals of similar

liabilities to ourselves, and find ourselves face to face with the question

of their causes.

     It is possible that many members of the Association are not aware of

-- --the unfavourable I will not say discreditable position that this country

at present occupies in relation to the scientific study of this great sub-

--ject the causes and mode of prevention of infectious diseases. As

regards administrative efficiency in matters relating to public health

England was at one time far ahead of all other countries, and still re-
tains its superiority ; but as regards scientific knowledge we are, in this

subject as in others, content to borrow from our neighbours. Ihose who

desire either to learn the methods of research or to carry out scientific

inquiries have to go to Berlin, to Munich, to Breslau, or to the Pasteur
Institute in Pai-is to obtain what England ought long ago to have pro-
vided. For to us, from the spread of our race all over the world, the
prevention of acute infectious diseases is more important than to any
other nation. At the beginning of this address I urged the claims of
pure science. If I could, I should feel inclined to speak even more
strongly of the application of science to the discovery of the causes of

acute diseases. May I express the hope that the effort which is now

being made to establish in England an Institution for this purpose not

inferior in efficiency to those of other countries, may have the sympathy
of all present ? And now may I ask your attention for a few moments

more to the subject that more immediately concerns us ?

                                                      CONCLBSION.

     The purpose which I have bad in view has been to sbow that there

-- --is one principle that of adaptation which separates biology from the

exact sciences, and that in the vast field of biological inquiry the end we

have is not merely, as in natural philosophy, to investigate the relation
between a phenomenon and the antecedent and concomitant conditions
on which it depends, but to possess this knowledge in constant reference

to the interest of the organism. It may perhaps be thought that this
way of putting it is too teleological, and that in taking, as it were, as

my text this evening so old-fashioned a biologist as Treviranus, I am
yielding to a retrogressive tendency. It is not so. What I have desired

 to insist on is that organism is a fact which encounters the biologist at
every step in his investigations ; that in referring it to any general
 biological principle, such as adaptation, we are only referring it to itself,
 not explaining it ; that no explanation will be attainable until the con-
 ditions of its coming into existence can be subjected to experimental
 investigation so as to correlate them with those of processes in the non-

 living world.

      Those who were present at the meeting of the British Association at
 Liverpool will remember that then, as well as at some subsequent meet-

 ings, the question whether the conditions necessary for such an inquiry
 could be realised was a burning one. This is no longer the case. The

 patient endeavours which were made about that time to obtain experi-
 mental proof of what was called abiogenesis, although they conduced
 materially to that better knowledge which we now possess of the con-

 ditions of life of bacteria, failed in the accomplishment of their purpose.
  The question still remains undetermined ; it has, so to speak, been ad-

 journed sine die. The only approach to it lies at present in the inves-

 tigation of those rare instances in which, although the relations between

 a living organism and its environment ceases as a watch stops when it

--ha3 not been wound, these relations can be re-established the process of

--life re-awakened by the application of the required stimulus.

      I was also desirous to illustrate the relation between physiology
and its two neighbours on either side, natural philosophy (including
chemistry) and psychology. As regards the latter I need add nothing

to what has already been said. As regards the foi-mer, it may be well

to notice that although physiology can never become a mere branch of

applied physics or chemistry, there are parts of physiology wherein

the principles of these sciences may be applied directly. Thus, in the
beginning of the century, Young applied his investigations as to the move-

ments of liquids in a system of elastic tubes, directly to the phenomena
of the circulation ; and a century before, Borelli successfully examined the
mechanisms of locomotion and the action of muscles, without reference to

any, excepting mechanical principles. Similarly, the foundation of our
present knowledge of the process of nutrition was laid in the researches
of Bidder and Schmidt, in 1851, by determinations of the weight and
composition of the body, the daily gain of weight by food or oxygen, the
daily loss by the respiratory and other discharges, all of which could be

accomplished by chemical means. But in by far the greater number of
physiological investigations, both methods (the physical or chemical and

--the physiological) must be brought to bear on the same question to co-

operate for the elucidation of the same problem. In the researches, for
example, which during several years have occupied Professor Bohr, of
Copenhagen, relating to the exchange of gases in respiration, he has

--shown that factors purely physical namely, the partial pressures of

oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood which flows through the pul-

--monary capillaries are, so to speak, interfered with in their action by the

' specific energy ' of the pulmonary tissue, in such a way as to render this

fundamental process, which, since Lavoisier, has justly been regarded as

one of the most important in physiology, much more complicated than we
for a long time supposed it to be. In like manner Heidenhain has proved
that the process of lymphatic absorption, which before we regaided as

--dependent on purely mechanical causes i.e., differences of pressure is

in great measure due to the specific energy of cells, and that in various

processes of secretion the principal part is not, as we were inclined not
many years ago to believe, attributable to liquid diffusion, but to the same

agency. I wish that there had been time to have told you something of
the discoveries which have been made in this particular field by Mr.

Langley, who has made the subject of 'specific energy' of secreting-cells
his own. It is in investigations of this kind, of which any number of
examples could be given, in which vital reactions mix themselves up with

physical and chemical ones so intimately that it is difficult to draw the
line between them, that the physiologist derives most aid from what-

ever chemical and physical training he may be fortunate enough to

possess.

There is, tberefore, no doubt as to the advantages which physiology

derives from the exact sciences. It could scarcely be averred that they

would benefit in anything like the same degree from closer association

with the science of life. Nevertheless, there are some points in respect ot

which that science may have usefully contributed to the advancement of

physics or of chemistry. The discovery of Graham as to the characters

of colloid substances, and as to the dififusion of bodies in solution through

membranes, would never have been made had not Graham ' ploughed,' so

to speak, ' with our heifer.' The relations of certain colouring matters to

oxygen and carbon dioxide would have been unknown, had no experiments

been made on the respii'ation of animals and the assimilative process in

plants ; and, similarly, the vast amount of knowledge which relates to the

chemical action of ferments must be claimed as of physiological origin.

So also there are methods, both physical and chemical, which were

originally devised for physiological purposes. Thus the method by which

meteorological phenomena are continuously recorded graphically, origi-

nated from that used by Ludwig (1847) in his ' Researches on the Circula-

tion '                           the  mercurial  pump, invented by Lothar Meyer,  was perfected in
                              ;

the physiological laboratories of Bonn and Leipzig ; the rendering the

galvanometer needle aperiodic by damping was first realised by du Bois-

--Reymond in all of which cases invention was prompted by the require-

ments of physiological researcb.

Let me conclude with one more instance of a diiferent kind, which

may serve to show how, perhaps, the wonderful ingenuity of contrivance

--which is displayed in certain organised structures the eye, the ear, or
--the organ of voice may be of no less interest to the physicist than to the

physiologist. Johannes Miiller, as is well known, explained the com-

pound eye of insects on the theory that an erect picture is formed on the

convex retina by the combination of pencils of light, received from

different parts of the visual field through the eyelets (ommatidia)

directed to them. Years afterwards it was shown that in each eyelet an

image is foi-med which is reversed. Consequently, the mosaic theory of

Miiller was for a long period discredited on the ground that an erect

picture could not be made up of ' upside-down ' images. Lately the

subject has been reinvestigated, with the result that the mosaic theory

has regained its authority. Professor Exner ^ has proved photographically

that behind each part of the insect's eye an erect picture is formed of

the objects towards which it is directed. There is, therefore, no longer

any difficulty in understanding how the whole field of vision is mapped

out as consistently as it is imaged on our own retina, with the difference,

of course, that the picture is erect. But behind this fact lies a physical

--question that of the relation between the erect picture which is photo-

graphed and the optical structure of the crystal cones which produce it

a question which, although we cannot now enter upon it, is quite as

interesting as the physiological one.

     With this history of a theory which, after having been for thirty
years disbelieved, has been reinstated by the fortunate combination of
methods derived from the two sciences, I will conclude. It may serve
to show how, thougli physiology can never become a part of natural
philosophy, the questions we have to deal with are cognate. Without
forgetting that every phenomenon has to be regarded with reference to
its useful purpose in the organism, the aim of the physiologist is not to
inquire into final causes, but to investigate processes. His question is
ever How, rather than Why.

    May I illustrate this by a simple, perhaps too trivial, story, which

derives its interest from its having been told of the childhood of one of the

greatest natural philosophers of the present century ? ' He was even

then possessed by that insatiable curiosity which is the first quality of
the investigator ; and it is related of him that his habitual question was

' What is the go of it ? ' and if the answer was unsatisfactory, ' What is

the particular go of it ? ' That North Country boy became Professor
Clerk Maxwell. The questions he asked are those which in our various

ways we are all. trying to answer.

Whitaker, Mr. E. B. Ponltou,-Mr. Cuthbert Peek, Dr. Garson, and Mr.

ence which had been held under the new rules of the Association, said

occupied now in relation to tlie Association very much the same position

as one of its Sectional Committees, and for that they were very largely

indebted to Sir Douglas Galton, who had very keenly watched their
proceedings, and had taken a great interest in them. The report of the

Committee was then submitted, and the different subjects which had
engaged attention during the year were dealt with under the heading
of the Association Sections to which they belong.

                                                    Section A.

     The Chairman introduced the subject of temperature variations in
lakes, rivers, and estuaries.

  --Meteorological FhoiograpJnj. Mr.Clayden and Mr. Symons spoke of

the desirability of obtaining photogi'aphs illustrating damage by whirl-

winds and floods, and Mr. W. Watts (Rochdale) said that the society

he represented was taking up the subject. Mr. Symons mentioned the

Helm Wind of Crossfell, and the peculiar cloud accompanying it photo-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

graphs of the latter would be useful. Mr. Watts stated that a difficulty
in photographing the effects of floods arose from the state of the weather
during their occurrence, and Mr. Cashing (Croydon) exhibited photo-
graphs of a recent thunderstorm. The Chairman then remarked that
Mr. Kenward (Birmingham), who was unable to be present, had sent a
letter stating that for some years in Birmingham meteorological observa-
tions had been made in the building called ' The Monument.'

                                                    Section B.

     The Chairman mentioned the subject of the conditions of the atmo-
sphere in manufacturing towns, and Mr. Mark Stirrup (Manchester) and
Mr. Watts (Rochdale) said that observations and experiments were l3eing
made thereon in their respective districts.

                                                     Section C.

    Mr. De Ranee (Section C) stated that the Eighteenth Report of the

Committee on Underground Waters had been read that morning ; that
the Committee thought it should be reappointed, and that a volume
containing abstracts of the previous reports should be published. The
Committee on Coast Erosion hoped to conclude its labours next year.
The Committee on Erratic Blocks continued to do good work. The

local societies could do much to assist this committee by noting the
position of boulders, and by preserving them from destruction.

     Mr. Watts (Rochdale) spoke upon the denudation of high-lying
drainage areas, and some observations he had made on the amount of
material brought down by flood waters, and the degree of protection

given by heather, grass, and peat. He was anxious that other districts

should take up this inquiry in order that comparisons might be possible.
In his district he had found that flood water, after a very heavy flood,
had yielded 900 grains of fine material to the gallon, the material mainly
consisting of leaves, fibi-es, seed spores, and little bits of peat.

     Dr. H. R. Mill said that something had recently been done in Germany

to ascertain the amount of sediment in river water. He thought it very
--38 EEPOET 1893.

desirable that a series of observations should be made to determine the
relative values of woodlands and heather in protecting land, and was
inclined to suggest the formation of a committee for that purpose. Mr.
Watts said he would be glad to give information as to the method

--followed in Rochdale.
      Geological Photography. Mr. Jeffs, Secretary to the Photographic
Committee, being absent, had asked Mr. Arthur S. Reid (East Kent) to
speak about its work. Mr. Reid said that the number of the photographs

was about 700. He exhibited a specimen volume of photographs, and
explained the way in which they were mounted and bound. He thought

it important that some uniform plan of photographing geological subjects
should be adopted, and that the plates used should be orthochromatic or

isochromatic. The Committee had, asked to be reappointed. He hoped

the delegates would try to make their societies active in this matter.
      Mr. William Gray said that he thought the Belfast Naturalists' Field

Club had its work fairly well represented by the photographs exhibited.
They had sent more at first because they then had them in stock ; and
their quality had improved. They were also photographing antiquities,
and producing lantern-slides which were very valuable for educational
purposes. His society had an excellent collection of geological and
antiquarian lantern-slides which it would be delighted to place at the
service of any of the other societies, or of any member of the British

Association interested in educational work.

      Dr. T. Stacey Wilson mentioned that the Birmingham Philosophical
 Society had appointed a sub-committee for geological photography.

      Mr. J. Barclay Murdoch, as Secretary to the Glasgow Geological
 Society, said that his society had not sent in any photographs because it

had been found difficult to organise the work. He had, however, drawn

up a preliminary list of localities to be illustrated, and this list had been
circulated among the members, who were asked to return either photo-
graphs of the places named or information as to photographs of them

 already existing.

      The Chairman recommended orthochromatic plates. They might be
more expensive, but they were decidedly preferable for geological photo-

graphs.

                                                  Section D.

      The Chairman invited remarks on the destruction of native plants and

--of wild birds' eggs.
      I)isap2^earance of Native Plants. The Rev. E. P. Knubley (Yorks.

 Nat. Union) alluded to the report presented to Section D on this

 subject, which had been drawn up by Mr. D. E. Boyd. In it were men-
 tioned some of the causes leading to the disappearance of native plants,
 such as marine erosion, agricultural drainage, and the growth of towns
 and villages. In addition to these influences were the formation of
 herbaria, the exchange of botanical specimens, the removal of plants
 into gardens, and the large numbers of ferns and other plants exposed
 for sale and there were great difficulties in the way of any attempts at

                                                        ;

 prohibitive legislation. Many plants had wholly or almost wholly dis-

 appeared from the west of Scotland. Mr. Watts said that two or three
 members of the Rochdale Society proposed to work at this subject.

 Mr. Mark Stirrup had a short paper by Mr. Leo H. Grindon on the dis-

appearance of wild plants in the neighbourhood of Manchester. The
Chairman thought it might be read at the second Conference. Mr.
Cuthbert Peek remarked on the great difficulty of obtaining a conviction
in cases in which ferns and other wild plants had been taken from private

grounds.

  --Destruction of Wild Birds' Eggs. The Rev. E. P. Knubley said terrible

damage had been done by the destruction of birds' eggs. It was a sei'ious
matter, but it was very difficult to know what to do iu regard to it. For
instance, take the case of the great skua, which nested in the Shetland
Islands : in 1890 it is said that not a single chick was reared on the
whole of the Foula colony. Every egg was taken, and in 1891 all the
eggs of the first laying were taken by the inhabitants and sold to dealers.
Other rare birds which nested in the Shetland Islands were also perse-

cuted. He had it on good authority that last year not more than two or

three nests of the red-throated diver got off their young ; and the black-
throated divers were not more fortunate. One shilling apiece was given
by dealers for the eggs of the red-tliroated diver, and 10s. a brace for
those of the black-tliroated diver. The whimbrels, which also nested on
the same islands, had been reduced to about twenty pairs, and were
likely to disappear. The red-necked plialarope was very much iu the
same circumstances. The dealers gave a commission to a local man,
who was to get about 8d. a dozen for every egg collected of all sorts and
kinds. The local men in turn got the herd boys to sweep tlie country of
every egg they could lay hands on, big and little, and for these they got
about Id. a dozen. That was one way in which parts of Scotland had
been regularly swept, and that in spite of such protection as the owners

could afford. They had men who followed about strangers all day, but

the natives took the eggs at night. Then, again, he might mention

that he heard that in Edinburgh there was a gentleman who made it
his boast that he had over 100 eggs of the golden eagle. What was to

be done with a case of that kind ? In some parts of England things
were not any better. The nesting stations of the lesser tern which
exi.sted on the Fifeshire coast, the Lincolnshire coast, and at Spurn, in
Yorkshire, would shortly disappear altogether. The oyster-catcher and
the Arctic tern had practically ceased to nest on the Lincolnshire and
Yorkshire coasts, and the ringed plover was much scarcer than formerly.

The redshanks and greenshanks had in many parts also been persecuted
to the death. The nests of the bearded reedling, whose breeding station
in the British Islands was the Norfolk Broads, had been to his own
knowledge systematically poached for sale for a number of years. The
only hope seemed to him to be in the creation of a public feeling against

the extermination of these birds. It would be difficult to advocate any-
thing like legislation. The most practical plan he had seen was this
that the Imperial Legislature should gr.ant powers to the County Councils

to protect known nesting-places in their districts for certain months of
the year, say from April 1 to June 30. Such a plan would be simple,

and might be effective ; but for one thing they should endeavour to do
all in their power to help the owners and occupiers of land to protect the
birds and their eggs during the breeding season. They might also see if
they could not enlist the aid of the gamekeepers, who, with the farmers
and proprietors, were beginning to find out that all birds were not their
enemies. Collectors and dealers should also be discouraged. Just as he
came thei-e that day he had been told that 200 eggs of the stormy petrel
40 REPORT-- 1893.

liad been taken from one island on the west coast of Ireland and given to
one dealer.

     Mr. E. B. Poulton (Oxford) said that if they discouraged the purchase
of eggs, the trade of the dealer would soon cease.

     Mr. G. J. Symons said it was an old saying that there would be no
thieves if there were no receivers ; and possibly there would be no dealers
if there were no collectors. They should discourage as much as they

could this spoliation of the nests of rare birds.

     Mr. Mills (Chesterfield) thought it would do good if some small recog-
nition were given to gamekeepers to assist in protecting the nests of

the birds.

     The Chairman asked if it would not strengthen the hands of Mr.
Knubley if the meeting was to pass some resolution on the subject.

     Sir Douglas Galton hoped any resolution of the kind would make an

appeal to egg-collectors.

                  Section E.

The Chairman remarked that last year there had been a discussion on

the cost and age of ordnance maps ; also on the teaching of geography in

primary schools.

Sir Douglas Galton said that a departmental committee on the subject

of ordnance maps had been appointed, and he had been informed by Sir

Archibald Geikie that its report would soon be published, and that it

would be the means of removing many of the difficulties complained of.

It was, of course, no use discussing the matter before the publication of

the report.

    Mr. Eli Sowerbutts did not expect much from this departmental

report, and had little information to offer about the teaching of geo-

graphy in schools, as he had not had a reply from a single society. But

there had been an examination about India in the upper schools of

Yorkshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire. Three hundred pupils only asked

Afor papers, and out of 103 who sat three passed.  Cheshire girl of

fourteen was first, a Yorkshire man of thirty-one second, and a Yorkshire

lad third. This examination amply demonstrated the extreme badness

of the teaching of geography in these schools. He would be glad if the

delegates would try and help them next year. The examination would be

in Yorkshire, and they would go back to the primary schools.

                                                     Section G.

   --Flameless Explosives. Professor Merivale said he had nothing to

report. The Durham strike had interfered with their arrangements, the

proposed laboratories having been utilised as stables.

                                              Section H.

     Dr. Garson reported that there had been no applications to the Com-

mittee last year for aid in connection with anthropological exploration.

He contended, however, that local bodies, when they meant to make such

explorations, should give them notice. Valuable hints could be given
them as to how they should proceed. Local committees intending to
explore ancient dwellings, burial places, &c., should communicate with

the Committee in aid of Anthropological Exploration, 3 Hanover Square,
London. General Pitt- Rivers was the cliairman of this committee, and
no one could be better qualified to give advice as to the conduct of an
exploration. Local societies might also do useful work by the description
of specimens in local museums, accounts of which might be published in
their ' Proceedings ' for the information of workers dwelling elsewhere.

     The Secretary, at the request of the Chairman, read an extract from
a letter of Mr. Kenward, of Birmingham, giving particulars of an anthro-
pometric laboratory established at Birmingham, like that of Mr. Francis
Galton at South Kensington.

                SECOND CONFERENCE, AUGUST 9.

      The Corresponding Societies Committee were represented by Professor
 R. Meldola (Chairman) and Messrs. Symons, Whitaker, Cuthbert Peek,
 Garson, Poulton, Rev. Canon Tristram, Sir Rawson Rawson, and
T. V. Holmes (Secretary).

      The Chairman suggested that in future some subject in which the
delegates generally were interested, such as the management of local
museums, the relations of County Councils to technical instruction, or the
working of the Technical Education Acts, should be brought before the
Conference in the form of a short j^aper to serve as a basis of discussion.
This proposition met with general approval.

     Mr. Symons mentioned that he had arranged with Mr. GrifiBth that
delegates on the first day of the meeting of the British Association
should be supplied with copies of the reports on subjects in which they
were interested. This would give them longer time than they had at
present to make themselves acquainted with the w'ork which was being

done.

                                                  Section A.

   --Underground Waters. Mr. Symons said that some remarks had been

made on the circulation of underground waters, and he wished that when
wells were sunk the temperature, as well as the depth, of the water
should be taken. It was very easily done, as they had only to send down
a thermometer in the bucket, and taring up the bucket full of water. If
such observations were made at the same hour of the day throughout the
year they would be of very considerable use. The depth of water in a
well should always be measured from the surface of the ground.

     Mr. Whitaker said that it was also important that the variation in the
depth of water in a well should be recorded.

                          Section D.

--Disappearance of Native Plants. Mr. Mark Stirrup read a letter

written by Mr. Leo Grindon dealing with the disappearance of native

plants during the last fifty years in the district within a radius of fifteen

miles round Manchester. The wide, uncultivated moorlands (remarked

Mr. Grindon) remained unchanged. Harsh and wiry grasses, a few ferns,

heather, whortleberry, and ci^owberry still renewed themselves perennially

there                     and in the flat country which had been and remained agricul-
                       ;
42 EEPORT-- 1893.

tural or pastoral there was but little change. The changes which had
occurred were referable almost wholly to the enterprise and activity of
the landowners, who had converted peat-mosses and sandy wastes into
land profitable for agriculture or even for building purposes. Hence the
disappearance of Gentiana pneumonanthe and Osmunda, with other less
conspicuous moss and moor plants. However, in other quarters there is
still no lack of the cotton sedge, the Lancashire asphodel, and the Erica
tetralh'. But the dye-polluted streams are forsaken by the forget-me-
nots and other water-loving plants, and many ponds within five or six
miles of the town have been drained or filled up, or converted into lakes
for the adornment of pleasure grounds. These changes have involved
the loss of such plants as the Stratiotes, the Myriophyllnm, and various rare

sedges, the Garex elovgata, for instance, once abundant. Fifty years ago
the little dells, locally called ' doughs,' were noted for their curious

botany. Mere Clough, near Prestwich Mere, once grew in plenty the

Calamagrostis lanceolata, Ghrysosplenium alternifolium, Geum rivale, and
various shade-loving carices. Now all are gone, partly through the

felling of the trees and drying of the soil, partly because the clough

being now a thoroughfare, much trampling down and destruction are

done by the reckless and unobservant.
     Coming to the wilful and deliberate destruction of plants, Mr. Leo

Grindon remarked that the professed botanists and simple collectors of
specimens for the herbarium were but little to blame. The Manchester
flora could not be said to have ever included species existing scarcely
anywhere else, and the local botanists had therefore but little to answer

for. Even the ' Field Naturalists,' who had been an organised body

more than thirty years, could not be charged with wasteful gathering.

Many of the members took home handfuls of wild flowers, but the plants
taken were such as would never be missed. By whom, then, was the

mischief done ? The herb-doctors or ' medical botanists ' had caused
much destruction of plants supposed to have medicinal value, such as the
Erythrcea centaurium.. They were often to be seen in the season returning
home with plants under their arms which had been pulled up by the
roots just as they were coming into bloom. Another destructive agency
was that of the dealers in roots for the garden. One of them had once
asked him to name a locality where he could dig up from 300 to 500 roots
of a certain rather favourite fern, but without obtaining a reply. Another
dealer brought with him a basket and trowel in order to bring away 'all
there was ' from a particular spot, which was consequently not visited
that afternoon, the botanical guide of the party having become aware of
the dealer's plan. Besides ferns, dealers dug up immense numbers of
primroses, cowslips, and oxlips, and had greatly diminished their num-
bers. Thus the mischief done to the local flora was partly due to the
 progress of agriculture and manufactures and the increase in building,
partly to the rapacity of the dealers in ferns and other plants.

     Mr. Mark Stirrup added that he could confirm Mr. Leo Grindon's
remarks from his own experience of the disappearance of ferns and

primroses in the neighbourhood of Manchester within the last fifteen or
twenty years. In one case he remembered that a gentleman sent a horse
 and cart to a certain spot where the Osmunda grew, and removed all the
specimens he could find.

      Mr. Sowerbutts thought it would be well for field naturalists' clubs

to keep the exact localities in which rare plants grew for their own
                                --

                          CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                           43

information only. He thought that Mr. Leo Grinclon was himself largely

responsible for the eradication of rare plants around Manchester, as he
had published a volume called ' Walks about Manchester ' in which their

habitats were described.

Mr. Coates (Perthshire) said their naturalists' field club, in publish-

ing accounts of excursions or notices in papers of rare plants, only indicated

generally where these were  to  be  found                               and  Mr. W. Gray said that the
                                                                     ;

Belfast Naturahsts' Field Club acted in a similar way.

As regards the extermination of native plants, Canon Tristram added

that the neighbourhood of Durham was once one of the richest botanical

districts in the north of England, but that during his lifetime some of the

most interesting species of plants, and also some of the most interesting-

species of butterflies and moths, had been exterminated. The ' lady's

slipper' had disappeared. He had seen advertisements in the 'Gardener's

Chronicle ' offering half a guinea for that plant, the advertisement

always stating where it was supposed to be obtainable. The late

Rowland Burton had remarked to him that the half-dozen plants of

' lady's slipper ' on his property cost him more to protect them than his

pheasants did. The butterfly, Erebia hlancliva, was no longer to be found

in the county of Durham. The rarer orchids and the hart's-tongue fern

were being exterminated in many districts, but public opinion had been

thoroughly efiicient in the preservation of the ferns planted close to the

walks on the banks of the river at Durham, and he looked to the formation
of a public opinion as the best means of preserving plants elsewhere.
Field clubs should make their members feel that their first object was to

preserve, not to destroy.

    Mr. Mark Stirrup said that the preservation of rarities was enjoined
by the Manchester societies. As regards the observations of Mr. Sower-

butts, he did not think the plants mentioned were such as the dealers

--prized.
     Preservation of Wild Birds' Eggs. The Rev. E. P. Knubley (Leeds)
moved the following resolution, which was seconded by Mr. E. B.

Poulton (Oxford) and agreed to:

' The Conference of Delegates, having heard of the threatened extermi-

nation of certain birds, as British breeding species, through the destruction
of their eggs, deprecates the encouragement given to dealers by collectors
through their demands for British-taken eggs, and trusts that the
Corresponding Societies will do all that lies in their power to interest and
influence naturalists, landowners, and others in the preservation of such

birds and their eggs.'

    On this subject Canon Tristram also spoke, and put in a strong plea

for the preservation of birds of prey, pointing to the case of the mice

plague in Dumfries and Lanark shires as a result of destroying the
balance of nature by wholesale killing of birds of prey. The resolution
brought forward by Mr. KnuVdey was cordially adopted by the meeting.

  --Local Muse^tms. The Rev. Canon Tristram (Durham) next addressed

the delegates on the question of making their field clubs more useful.

He strongly advocated that these clubs should combine natural history,

archfeology, and geology ; and that their function should be, not to

destroy, but to preserve all that was rare and curious in a district.

Lately their field excursions in many places had been too much of picnic
parties. On the subject of local museums, the Canon argued that, as a

rule, these should only contain objects of local interest, and he suggested
--44 KBPOET 1893.

that an approach should be made to the County Councils in order to
get assistance for forming museums and keeping them in order. Many
museums had gone to utter decay from the -want of an endowment.
Those at Newcastle, York, Manchester, Liverpool, and Norwich were all
endowed. On the other hand, that at Lynn, in Norfolk, for want of
an endowment was mouldering away. Local societies should try to pro-
mote interest in the local museum, so that they might raise an endow-
ment fund, by the help of wealthy residents and the County Council, in

order to keep a curator, without whom a museum was of little use.

                           Section H.

--Proposed Ethnological Survey. Mr. Brabrook said he was deputed by
Hthe Committee of Section
                           to ask the approval and assistance of the

Corresponding Societies in the organisation of an Ethnological Survey of

the United Kingdom. The attempt to organise this survey was being

made by a committee of delegates from the Society of Antiquaries, the

Anthropological Institute, and the Folklore Society. These delegates

represented the various points of view of the societies electing them, and

he felt sure of the sympathy of the Corresponding Societies in this

movement. The matter was one which would not brook delay every
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

year tended to increase its difficulties, and if postponed much longer it

would become impossible to proceed at all. Several of the Corresponding

Societies had been working in this direction, and it would only be necessary

for them to follow the instructions which would be sent down to them by

the Ethnological Survey Committee when it began its labours. From

the reports of the Corresponding Societies he learnt that thirty-three

of them had been at work on this subject during the last eight years,

and that during that period 100 members of these societies had con-

tributed papers on it to the ' Proceedings.' He would urge them, therefore,
to look at men from the three points of view indicated. He agreed with

the Rev. Canon Tristram that field clubs should include archeology

among their subjects of study. It was absurd to look at man merely

from the natural history point of view, and ignore his archaeological

aspects.

   --Preservation of Ancient Reviains. Mr. Whitaker said that in the

Hampshire district it had been found that a remonstrance against the

destruction of ancient remains usually had a good effect. Proprietors
often did not know the interest and value of antiquities on their estates,
but cared for them after they became aware of it. Certain Government
departments sometimes needed similar education. One of the best
Hampshire tumuli was almost destroyed recently in the making of a rifle

butt.

    Mr. W. Gi'ay remarked that, in Ireland, Government was very anxious

to preserve all monuments, and that the Naturalists' Field Club of
Belfast not only did its best to keep them uninjured but also photo-

graphed them. He had pleasure in exhibiting some of these photographs,

copies of which might be obtained by anyone interested in geology or

archfeology on application to the local secretary.
     The Chairman was sure the Corresponding Societies would do their

best to assist Mr. Brabrook, and he would ask that gentleman if he
would point out in what way the societies could best help him.

Mr. Brabrook said it was a little difficult to do so because the
CORRESPONDlNa SOCIETIES.  45

material was so abundant. He had there the result of an archisolowical

survey of Kent and a scheme applicable to the county of Gloucester.
There were also the books prepared by the Anthropological Institute and
the Folklore Society. All these works gave instructions for working
in the way desired. But their bulk made it necessary that the Committee
should devise something smaller for the exploration, and that would be
the first of its labours. The Committee would then send a pamphlet
containing the needed suggestions to every Corresponding Society.

   --Baihuay Facilities. -Mr. Sowerbutts thought better terms might be

obtained from the railway companies for delegates and others travelling
to meetings of the British Association. The Chairman and Mr. Symons
promised to represent the matter to the Council of the Association.

The Corresponding Societies Committee now have to report that in accord-

ance with this promise a strong committee of the Council was appointed,
on the motion of Professor Meldola, and a representation made to the
authorities at the Clearing House, but no concession could be obtained
beyond what is allowed by Traffic Regulation No. 30, viz., ' Members are
allowed during a Meeting to take railway tickets at the town where the
Meeting is held at a single fare for the double journey to places within a

distance of fifty miles.'

     The Committee recommend the retention of all the societies at
present on the list, with the exception of the Barnsley Naturalists' and
Scientific Society, which had not filled in and returned the schedule at the
time of the Meeting of the Committee.

     In order to make the publications of the Corresponding Societies
available for reference, the Committee decided to have them bound.
Accordingly Mr. Topley and Mr. T. V. Holmes (Secretary) were in-
structed to examine them and to select for binding some of the more
complete and valuable. Fifty-eight volumes have already been bound
and placed on the shelves of the Association. Others will be added from
time to time as the amount of the grant available for this purpose may

allow.

ON THE PELLIAN EQUATION.

Tables connected with the Pellian Equation from the 'point where
      the work luas left by Degen in 1817. Report of the Committee,

      consisting of Professor A. Cayley, Dr. A. E. Forsyth, Professor

     A. Lodge, and Professor J. J. Sylvester. (Dratvn up by

      Professor Cayley.)

We have on the Pellian Equation Degen's tables, the title of which is

' Canon Pellianus sive Tabula simplicissimam fequationis celebratissim£e

y^=ax!^ + l solutionem pro singulis numeri dati valoribus ab 1 usque ad

1000 in numeris rationalibus iisdemque integris exhibens. Autore Carolo
Ferdinando Degen. Hafnise, apud Gerhardum Bonnierum, mdcccxvii. 8°.

--Introductio, pp. v-xxiv. Tabula I. Solutionem sequationis y^ aa;^-- 1=0

exhibens, pp. 3-106. Tabula II. Solutionem sequationis y^ -- ax"+l=0,

quotiescunque valor ipsius a talem admiserit, exhibens, pp. 109-112.'

     The mode of calculation is explained in the Introduction, and illustrated
by the examples of the numbers 209, 173.

     As to the first of these the entry in Table I. is
--74 EEPOET 1893.

the first column), and the third column with o, l, we calculate the num-

++bers of the second column, 29=2.14 + 1, 159=5.29 14, 506=3.159 29,

&c., and the numbers of the third column in like manner, 2=2.1+0,

=11 5.2+1, 35=3.11+2, &c. ; and then writing down as a fourth column

--the numbers of the second row with the signs +, alternately, we have

a series of equations y^-- aa;^=:+A, viz.,

     =+11^-209.0=

14- -209.1- =-13

29- -209.2*                                 = 5-I-

the last of them being
                                       (46551)=-209(3220)== + 1

+this last corresponding as above to the value 1, and the numbers 46551

and 3220 being accordingly the y and x given in the fourth and third
rows of the table.

     As to the second of the foregoing numbers, 173, the only difference ia
that the period has a double middle term, viz., the entry in the Table I.

is

173                         13, 6, ( 1, 1)
                              1, 4, (13, 13)

                            190060
                            2499849

11The first row gives the expression of \/173, viz., that is
a/173 = 13 +                      !1          1      1
                       6-f  (1)+                               &c.,
                                  (l)-H       6-h
                                                    26 +

the denominators being 6, 1, 1, 6, then 26 (the double of the integer part

13), and then again 6, l, l, 6, and so on. In the second row I remark
that Degen prints the parentlaeses (13, 13) for the double middle term.

     The process for the calculation of the x, y is similar to that in the
former case, viz., we have
                                               1

                     ON THE PELLIAN EQUATION.     75

--one, not +1, but l. The final numbers 1118, 85 are consequently

entered not in Table I., but in Table II., viz., the entry in this table is

                     173  85
                          1118

and thence we calculate the numbers y, x of Table I., viz., these are

                                     2499849 = 2.(1118)= + !

                                                190060=2.1118.85

      Generally Table II. gives for each value of a, comprised therein,

+ =values of a-, y, such that 2/^=a«^--l, and then writing yi=2y^ l, Xi 2xy,

we have
              -- -- ++ = =Vi = (^2ax- ly = ia''x* iax" 1 a . 4a;^(aa;--- 1) + 1 aa;,'

SO that .T,, yi are for the same value of a the values of x, y in Table I,
     It is to be remarked that the heading of Table II. is not perfectly accu-

rate, for it purports to give for every value of a, for which a solution

exists, a solution of the equation y'^=ax^--l. What it really gives is the

solution for each value of a for which the period has a double middle

+ =term. But if a.=:a^ l, then obviously we have a solution 7/ a, x=ly

and for any such value of a the period has a single middle term, viz., the
entry in Table I. is

                                                   a- + l

and we in fact have

    In connexion with the subject we have a paper, 'A Table of the
Square Roota of Prime Numbers of the form 4to+1 less than 10000

expanded as Periodic Continued Fractions,' by C. A. Roberts, with Intro-
duction and Explanation by Artemas Martin, the 'Mathematical Magazine,'
vol. ii. (No. 7, for October 1892), pp. 105-120. This extends, in fact, to
numbers up to 10501, but only the denominators of the continued frac-
tions (that is, the first lines of Degen's and the present table) are given :
thus the entry for 1009 is 31 ; 1, (3, 3).

     The paper just referred to notices errors in Degen's tables for the
numbers 853 and 929. For 853 the first line should be

                                     29,4,1,5,1,2,4,1,1,15,19,(2,2)

(l5 instead of Degen's 14). For 929 the first and second lines should be

                                         30, 2,11, 1, 2, 3, 2,7, 5, (2, 2)
                                           1, 29, 5, 40, 19, 16, 25, 8, 11, (23, 23)

     The values of a', y in Table I. and those in Table II. (for the solution

--of ?/2=aa^ 1) are correct for each of the numbers 853 and 929.

national at Sevres. They have not, however, been able to prepare this
report in time for the meeting, and they desire to be reappointed to

continue their investigations.

scheme embodying their recommendations as to its establishment and

maintenance, which has been laid before, and is under the consideration
of, the Admiralty.

     The Committee desire to be reappointed, with the addition of Mr.
Charles Chree in the place of the late Mr, G. M. Whipple.

                                            Magnetical Observations.

 [Made at the Falmouth Observatory, latitude 50° 9' 0" N. and longitude
      5° 4' 35" W., height 167 feet above mean sea level, for the year 1892,
     by Edward Kitto, Superintendent.]

The results in the following tables, Nos. 1,2, 3, 4, are deduced from
the magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration. These were made with the collimator
magnet marked 66a, and the declinometer magnet marked 66c in the

unifllar magnetometer by Elliott Bros., of London. Table No. 5 is
deduced from these observations.

     The inclination was observed with the inclinometer by Dover, of
Charlton, Kent, No. 86, and needles 1 and 2, which are 3| inches in
length, the results of which appear in Table No. 6.

      The declination and horizontal force values given in Tables 1 to 4
are prepared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report
of the Committee of the British Association on Comparing and Reducing
Magnetic Observations.

     The following is a list of the days during the year 1892 which were
selected by the Astronomer Royal as suitable for the determination of
the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been employed in the

preparation of the magnetic tables :

The work of testing resistance coils at the Cavendish Laboratory has

Abeen continued.  table of the coils tested is given. They have

all been ' ohms,' as defined by the resolution of the Committee given in

their last report, and since adopted by the Board of Trade Committee on

electrical standards in the following form :

The resistance offered to an unvarying electric current by a column

of mercury at the temperature of melting ice 14-4521 grammes in mass, of
a constant cross-sectional area, and of a length of 106-3 centimetres, may

be taken as 1 ohm. The relation between the B.A. unit and the ohm is

the following :

                  1 B.A.U.=-9866 ohm.

of members who expressed a preference for the name ' International ' was
greater than the number declaring in favour of any other name, but that
he thought that the Committee would accept whichever of the first three
suggestions commended itself to the French Committee appointed to deal

with the matter.
      During the year Dr. Muirhead has remeasured his standard condenser.

He now finds as the capacity of a condenser constructed twenty-three

years ago to represent '1 microfarad (B.A.U.) the value "09998 micro-

farad.

     Tests have been made during the year on the 1-ohm and 10-ohm
standards of the Association. These are still being continued. The
100-ohm and 1000-ohm standards have now been delivered, and the
tests will be shortly proceeded with. Some experiments were made as
to the amonnt of heating in the coils produced by the current used for
testing. These are detailed in Appendix II. Further valuable informa-
tion on this point is contained in Mr. Griffiths' paper on ' The Value

of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.'

     The Comruittee think it desirable that they should be in a position to
complete the set of resistance standards of the Association, and recom-
mend, therefore, that they be reappointed, with a grant of 25Z., that
Professor G. Carey Foster be Chairman, and Mr. R. T. Glazebrook

Secretary.

                               APPENDIX I.

Supplementary Report of the Electrical Standards Committee of the
                                         Board of Trade.

                       To the Right Hon. A. J. Mundella, M.P.,
                                President of the Board of Trade.

      Subsequently to the presentation of our former report to Sir Michael

Hicks-Beach, in July 1891, we were informed that it was probable that
the German Government would shortly take steps to establish legal

standards for use in connection with electrical supply, and that, with a
view to secure complete agreement between the proposed standards in
Germany and England, the Director of the Physico-Technical Imperial
Institute at Berlin, Professor von Helmholtz, with certain of his assistants,
proposed to visit England for the purpose of making exact comparisons
between the units in use in the two countries, and of attending the meet-
ing of the British Association which was to take place in August in
Edinburgh.

     Having regard to the importance of this communication it appeared
desirable that the Board of Trade should postpone the action recom-
mended in our previous report until after Professor Helmholtz's visit.

     That visit took place early in August, and there was a very full
discussion of the whole subject at the meeting of the British Association
in Edinburgh, at which several of our number were present. The meet-
ing was also attended by Dr. Guillaume, of the Bureau International des

--130 REPORT 1893.

U.S.A., who were well qualified by their scientific attainments to represent

the opinion of their respective countries.

     It appeared from the discussion that a few comparatively slight
modifications of the resolutions included in our pi'evious report would
tend to secure international agreement.

    An extract from the report of the Electrical Standards Committee of

the British Association embodying the results of this discussion was
communicated to us by the Secretary, and will be found in the appendix

to this report.

     Having carefully reconsidered the whole question in view of this
communication, and having received the report of the sub-committee

mentioned in resolution 14 of our previous report, we now desire, for the

resolutions contained in that report, to substitute the following :

                                                    Resolutions.

     1. That it is desirable that new denominations of standards for the
measurement of electricity should be made and approved by her Majesty
in Council as Board of Trade standards.

      2. That the magnitudes of these standards should be determined
on the electro-magnetic system of measurement with reference to the

centimetre as unit of length, the gramme as unit of mass, and the second
as unit of time, and that by the terms centimetre and gramme are meant

the standards of those denominations deposited with the Board of Trade.
     3. That the standard of electrical resistance should be denominated

the ohm, and should have the value 1,000,000,000 in terms of the centi-
metre and second.

     4. That the resistance offered to an unvarying electric current by a
column of mercury at the temperature of melting ice 14'4521 grammes in
mass of a constant cross-sectional area, and of a length of 106'3 centi-

metres, may be adopted as 1 ohm.

      5. That a material standard, constructed in solid metal, should be
adopted as the standard ohm, and should from time to time be verified

by comparison with a column of mercury of known dimensions.

       6. That, for the purpose of replacing the standard, if lost, destroyed,

or damaged, and for ordinary use, a limited number of copies should be
constructed, which should be periodically compared with the standard
ohm.

      7. That resistances constructed in solid metal should be adopted as
Board of Trade standards for multiples and sub-multiples of the ohm.

      8. That the value of the standard of resistance constructed by a com-
mittee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in the

years 1863 and 1864, and known as the British Association unit, may be

 taken as '9866 of the ohm.
      9. That the standard of electrical current should be denominated the

ampere, and should have the value one-tenth (0"1) in terms of the centi-
metre, gramme, and second.

     10. That an unvarying current which, when passed through a solution

of nitrate of silver in water, in accordance with the specification attached

to this report, deposits silver at the rate of O'OOlllB of a gramme per
second may be taken as a current of 1 ampere.

     11. That an alternating current of 1 ampere shall mean a current
ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREJIENTS.                    131

such tLafc the square root of the time average of the square of its strength
at each instant in amperes is unity.

      12. That instruments constructed on the principle of the balance, in
which, by the proper disposition of the conductors, forces of attraction
and repulsion are pi-oduced, which depend upon the amount of current

passing, and are balanced by known weights, should be adopted as the

Board of Trade standards for the measurement of current, whether
unvarying or alternating.

      13. That the standard of electrical pressure should be denominated
the volt, being the pressure which, if steadily applied to a conductor
whose resistance is 1 ohm, will produce a current of 1 ampere.

      14. That the electrical pressure at a temperature of 15° Centigrade

between the poles or electrodes of the voltaic cell known as Clark's cell,
prepared in accordance with the specification attached to this report, may

be taken as not differing from a pressure of 1-434 volt by more than
one part in one thousand.

     15. That an alternating pressure of 1 volt shall mean a pressure

such that the square root of the time-average of the square of its value at
each instant in volts is unity.

     16. That instruments constructed on the principle of Lord Kelvin's
quadrant electi'ometer used idiostatically, and, for high pressures, instru-
ments on the principle of the balance, electrostatic forces being balanced
against a known weight, should be adopted as Board of Trade standards
tor the measurement of pressure, whether unvarying or alternating.

                      Specification referred to in Resolution 10.

     In the following specification the term silver voltameter means the
arrangement of apparatus by means of which an electric current is
passed through a solution of nitrate of silver in water. The silver volta-
meter measures the total electrical quantity which has passed during the
time of the experiment, and by noting this time the time-average of the
current, or if the current has been kept constant the current itself, can

be deduced.
     In employing the silver voltameter to measure currents of about

1 ampere the following arrangements should be adopted. The kathode
on which the silver is to be deposited should take the form of a platinum
bowl not less than 10 centimetres in diameter, and from 4 to 5 centi-

metres in depth.

     The anode should be a plate of pure silver some 30 square centimetres
in area and 2 or 3 millimetres in thickness.

      This is supported horizontally in the liquid near the top of the solu-
tion by a platinum wire passed through holes in the plate at opposite

corners. To prevent the disintegrated silver which is formed on the
--132 REPORT 1893.

anode from falling on to the kathode the anode should be wrapped
roand with pure filter-paper, secured at the back with sealing-wax.

     The liquid should consist of a neutral solution of pure silver nitrate,
containing about fifteen parts by weight of the nitrate to eighty- five parts

of water.

     The resistance of the voltameter changes somewhat as the current
passes. To prevent these changes having too great an eiFect on the
current some resistance besides that of the voltameter should be inserted
in the circuit. The total metallic resistance of the circuit should not be

less than 10 ohms.

                                Method of mahing a Measurement.

     The platinum bowl is washed with nitric acid and distilled water,

dried by heat, and then left to cool in a desiccator. When thoroughly

dry it is weighed carefully.
      It is nearly filled with the solution, and connected to the rest of the

circuit by being placed on a clean copper support to which a binding
screw is attached. This copper support must be insulated.

      The anode is then immersed in the solution, so as to be well covered
 by it and supported in that position ; the connections to the rest of the
 circuit are made.

      Contact is made at the key, noting the time of contact. The current
 is allowed to pass for not less than half an hour, and the time at which
 contact is broken is observed. Care must be taken that the clock used

 is keeping correct time during this interval.

     The solution, is now removed from the bowl and the deposit is washed

 with distilled water and left to soak for at least six hours. It is then
 rinsed successively with distilled water and absolute alcohol and dried in
 a hot-air bath at a temperature of about 160° C. After cooling in a
 desiccator it is weighed again. The gain in weight gives the silver

 deposited.

      To find the current in amperes this weight, expressed in grammes,
 must be divided by the number of seconds during which the current has
 been passed and by -001118.

      The result will be the time-average of the current, if during the

 interval the current has varied.

       In determining by this method the constant of an instrument the
 current should be kept as nearly constant as possible, and the readings
 of the instrument taken at frequent observed intervals of time. These
 observations give a curve from which the reading corresponding to the
 mean current (time-average of the current) can be found. The current,
  as calculated by the voltameter, corresponds to this reading.

                       Specification eefeeked to in Resolution 14.

                                                    Definition of the Cell.

      The cell consists of zinc and mercury in a saturated solution of zinc
 sulphate and mercurous sulphate in water, prepared with mercurous
 sulphate in excess, and is conveniently contained in a cylindrical glass

  vessel.
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

                                                                                                                  Preparation of the Materials.

  --1. Tlie Mercury. To secure purity it should be first treated with acid

in the usual manner and subsequently distilled in vacuo.

   --2. The Zinc. Take a portion of a rod of pure redistilled zinc, solder

to one end a piece of copper wire, clean the whole with glass-paper,

carefully removing any loose pieces of the zinc. Just before making up

the cell dip the zinc into dilute sulphuric acid, wash with distilled water,

and dry with a clean cloth or filter-paper.

   --3. The Zinc Sidphate Solution. Prepare a saturated solution of pure

(' pure recrystallised ') zinc sulphate by mixing in a flask distilled
water with nearly twice its weight of crystals of pure zinc sulphate, and

adding zinc oxide in the proportion of about 2 per cent, by weight of

the zinc sulphate crystals to neutralise any free acid.' The crystals

should be dissolved with the aid of gentle heat, but the temperature

to which the solution is raised should not exceed 30° C. Mercurous

sulphate treated as described in 4 should be added in the proportion of

about 12 per cent, by weight of the zinc sulphate crystals, and the solu-

tion filtered, while still warm, into a stock bottle. Crystals should form

as it cools.

   --4. Th& Mercurous Sulphate. Take mercurous sulphate, purchased as

pure, and wash it thoroughly with cold distilled water by agitation in a

bottle; drain off the water and repeat the process at least twice.' After

the last washing drain off as much of the water as possible.

Mix the washed mercurous sulphate with the zinc sulphate solution,

adding sufficient crystals of zinc sulphate from the stock bottle to ensure

saturation, and a small quantity of pure mercury. Shake these up well

together to form a paste of the consistence of cream. Heat the paste,

but not above a temperature of 30° C. Keep the paste for an hour at

this temperature, agitating it from time to time, then allow it to cool

continue to shake it occasionally while it is cooling. Crystals of zinc

sulphate should then be distinctly visible, and should be distributed

throughout the mass                                                                                               if this is not the case add  more  crystals  from  the
                                                                                                               ;

stock bottle, and repeat the whole process.

This method ensures the formation of a saturated solution of zinc and

mercurous sulphates in water.

Contact is made with the mercury by means of a platinum wire about

No. 22 gauge. This is protected from contact with the other materials

of the cell by being sealed into a glass tube. The ends of the wire

project from the ends of the tube ; one end forms the terminal, the other
end and a portion of the glass tube dip into the mercui-y.

                                            To set up the Cell.

     The cell may conveniently be set up in a small test tube of about

2 centimetres diameter and 6 or 7 centimetres deep. Place the mercury
in the bottom of this tube, filling it to a depth of, say, 1'5 centimetre.
Cut a cork about '6 centimetre thick to fit the tube ; at one side of the
cork bore a hole through which the zinc rod can pass tightly ; at the
other side bore another hole for the glass tube which covers the platinum
wire ; at the edge of the cork cut a nick through which the air can pass

                                                           ' See Notes.
                                                                                               ----

when the cork is pushed into the tube. "Wash the cork thoroughly with
warm water, and leave it to soak in water for some tours before use.

Pass the zinc rod about 1 centimetre through the cork.
      Clean the glass tube and platinum wire carefully, then heat the ex-

posed end of the platinum red-hot, and insert it in the mercury in the
test tube, taking care that the whole of the exposed platinum is covered.

     Shake up the paste and introduce it without contact with the upper
part of the walls of the test tube, filling the tube above the mercury to a
depth of rather more than 2 centimetres.

     Then insert the cork and zinc rod, passing the glass tube through the
hole prepared for it. Push the cork gently down until its lower surface
is nearly in contact with the liquid. The air will thus be nearly all ex-
pelled, and the cell should be left in this condition for at least twenty,
four hours before sealing, which should be done as follows :

     Melt some marine glue until it is fluid enough to pour by its own

weight, and pour it into the test tube above the cork, using sufficient to
cover completely the zinc and soldering. The glass tube should project
above the top of the marine glue.

     The cell thus set up may be mounted in any desirable manner. It is
convenient to arrange the mounting so that the cell may be immersed in

a water-bath up to the level of, say, the upper surface of the cork. Its
temperature can then be determined more accurately than is possible
when the cell is in air.

     In using the cell sadden variations of temperature should as far as

possible be avoided.

                                                                     Notes.

--The Zinc Sulphate Solution. The object to be attained is the pre-

paration of a neutral solution of pure zinc sulphate saturated with

ZnS04,7H20.

At temperatures above 30° C. the zinc sulphate may crystallise out in

another form ; to avoid this 30° C. should be the upper limit of tempera-
ture. At this temperature water will dissolve about 1-9 time its weight

of the crystals. If any of the crystals put in remain undissolved they

will be removed by the filtration.

The amount of zinc oxide required depends on the acidity of the solu-

tion, but 2 per cent, will, in all cases which will arise in practice with

reasonably good zinc sulphate, be ample. Another rule would be to add

the zinc oxide gradually until the solution became slightly milky. The

solution when put into the cell should not contain any free zinc oxide ; if

it does then, when mixed with the mercurous sulphate, zinc sulphate and

mercurous  oxide  are  formed                                   the  latter may be  deposited  on  the  zinc, and

affect the electro-motive force of the cell. The difficulty is avoided by

adding as described about 12 per cent, of mercurous sulphate before

filtration : this is more than sufiBcient to combine with the whole of the

zinc oxide originally put in, if it all remains free ; the mercurous oxide
formed together with any undissolved mercurous sulphate is removed by

the filtration.

  --The Mercurous Sidphate. The treatment of the mercurous sulphate

has for its object the removal of any mercuric sulphate which is often

present as an impurity.

     Mercuric sulphate decomposes in the presence of water into an acid

--and a basic sulphate. The latter is a yellow substance turpeth mineral

practically insoluble in water : its presence at any rate in moderate quan-
tities has no effect on the cell. If, bow ever, it is formed the acid sulphate
is formed also. This is soluble in water and the acid produced affects
the electro-motive force. The object of the washings is to dissolve and
remoVfe this acid sulphate, and for this purpose the three washings
described in the specification will in nearly all cases suffice. If, however,
a great deal of the turpeth mineral is formed it shows that there is a
great deal of the acid sulphate present, and it will then be wiser to obtain
a fresh sample of mercurous sulphate rather than to try by repeated
washings to o'et rid of all the acid.

     The free mercury helps in the process of removing the acid, for the
acid mercuric sulphate attacks it, forming mercurous sulphate and acid
which is washed away.

    The cell may be sealed in a more permanent manner by coating the
marine glue, when it is set, with a solution of sodium silicate and leaving

it to harden.

Extract from the Report of the Electrical Standards Committee of
                                THE Association, August 9, 1892.

   --The following resolutions were agreed to :

     1. That the resistance of a specified column of mercui'y be adopted as

the practical unit of resistance.

     2. That 14"4521 grammes of mercury in the form of a column of

uniform cross-section 106"3 centimetres in length at 0° C. be the specified
column.

     3. That standards in mercury or solid metal having the same resist-
ance as this column be made and deposited as standards of resistance for

industrial purposes.

     4. That such standards be periodically compared with each other,
and also that their values be redetermined at intervals in terms of a
freshly set-up column of mercury.

     It was further agreed that these resolutions be communicated to the
Electrical Standards Committee of the Board of Trade.

     With regard to the units of current and electro-motive force it was
agreed that the number -001118 should be adopted as the number of
grammes of silver deposited per second from a neutral solution of nitrate
of silver by a current of 1 ampere, and the value 1'434 as the electro-

motive force in volts of a Clark cell at 15° C.

     Dr. von Helmholtz expressed his full concurrence in these decisions,
which are, as he informed the Committee, in accord with the recommenda-
tions which have already been laid by the Curatorium of the Reichs-
anstalt, as well as by himself before the German Government.

                         APPENDIX II.

Experiments on tie Effects of the Heating produced in the Coils hy the

             Currents used in Testing. By R. T. Glazebeook.

     Various circumstances (notably the experiments of Mr. Griffiths ')

had made it appear probable that the heating effect in the coils produced
by the current used in making the resistance test might be sufficient to
affect the results of the tests. Some experiments were made to examine

the point directly.

    The resistance of a coil of 100 ohms (nominal value) was measured in
the usual way, i.e. by making a Wheatstone's bridge of four coils whose
nominal values were "l, 10, 10, and 100 ohms. If the coils had been
accurate there would have been a balance ; as it was, one of the 10-ohm
coils needed to be shunted, and the adjustment was made by determining

the value of the shunt when no current passed through the galvanometer.
    As the current in the battery circuit was increased by varying the

number of cells this shunt decreased in value, showing that the effect of

the heating was to produce an apparent diminution of the resistance of

the 1000-ohm coil. This, of course, is as would be anticipated ; for \S^ of

the  current  goes  through the  1-ohm and  one  of the  10-ohm  coils                        the  re-
                                                                                           ;

maining yV goes through the 10-ohm and the 100-ohm. The rise
of temperature will clearly be greatest in the first 10-ohm coil, and to

counterbalance the increase in resistance produced thereby it becomes

necessary to reduce the shunt.

     The following readings were obtained :

however, will vary as the square of the current ; and, since treblingr the

current produces so small a change, we may infer that the total eflPect is

itself small.

     Another coil gave the following results :

the current traversing it. If this adjustment be made we will say that

the apparatus is in an equilibrium position.' '

     If M=coefEcient of mutual induction of standard coil and circum-

                        ference of disc,

          w=rate of rotation of disc (number of revolutions per second),

           R=resistance,
          y=current through standard coil and resistance,

                                                  M??.7=Ry,

or E=Mh.

I do not think that electricians have as yet realised the accuracy and

ease with which absolute measurements of resistance may be made by

this method. The absolute measurement involves measuring first the

coefficient of mutual induction of the standard coil and the circumference

of the rotating disc, and secondly the rate of rotation of the disc.

    Now it lies well within the resources of modern mechanical engineer-

ing to make a standard coil and disc of dimensions known to an accuracy

considerably greater than 1 in 10,000, the coil being constructed of a

single layer of wire wound in a screw thread cut on a cylinder of large

diameter ; and the measurement of the rate of rotation to equal accuracy

is a simple matter. There is difiiculty in maintaining a rate of rotation

constant to this figure for four or five minutes, but with the closest

attention to the lubrication of all the bearings this also might be accom-

plished. Such constancy is well worth striving for, as the ease with

which measurements of resistance can be made by the method largely

dependu upon it.

I do not propose on this occasion to enter into the details of the

method I have adopted in making the measurements, the results of which

I have now to bring before the Section. But it will perhaps be of

interest if I say a few words about the time-measurement.

In measuring a resistance we have to find the rate of rotation corre-

sponding to an equilibrium position. It is easiest in practice to determine

this by interpolation from two determined rates of rotation (near together,

and respectively slower and faster than the required rate) and the

galvanometer deflections corresponding to them, so that each determina-

tion of resistance involves two determinations of galvanometer deflection

and the rates of rotation corresponding to them.

    In order that the galvanometer deflection may be obtained with

sufiicient accuracy from a limited number of reversals (in my observations

the number has been almost uniformly thirty-three, taking about four

minutes in each case) the brush at the circumference of the disc needs

to be perforated and to be supplied with a constant stream of mercury.

Such a brush in its best condition almost entirely eliminates the continual

jerking of the galvanometer needle consequent on thermo-electric changes

Aat the point of contact of brush and disc.                  multiplication of such

brushes at three or four points of the circumference would do this even

more completely.

During the four or five minutes' run the rate of rotation is referred by

more or less current through the electromotor driving the disc, and in

this way maintains the rate of rotation as constant as he can. But

though the electrically maintained fork is laseful for purposes of control

it cannot be relied on to give us the rate of rotation. Its vibration period

is not within my experience constant to the degi-ee of accuracy required.

If stopped and set going again it may start with a period different
by several parts in 10,000. No previous determination of the period

of the fork can therefore be relied on to give us the rate of rotation,

though once stai'ted the fork goes sufficiently uniformly to give us a

means of control.

Accordingly it is necessary to measure the rate of I'otation during

each run while the galvanometer observations are being made. The

rotating disc is, by means of an eccentric attached to its axle, made to

record its revolutions on the tape of a Bain's electro-chemical telegraph

Weinstrument side by side with the record of the standard clock.     have,

then, a time record exactly corresponding to the period of observation

of the galvanometer deflections. During the run the observer at the

galvanometer calls out the galvanometer readings, while the observer at

the tuning-fork controls the speed, and the Bain's instrument records it.
     I have made in this way a number of measurements daring the

months of July and August of a standard resistance of approximately

0005  ohm, prepared      mylast year l)y  assistant,  Mr.  Harrison, and a

student in my laboratory, Mr. Parker, with the following results :

The maximum divergence from the mean is -00000004, or about one

part in 12,000. Mr. Crompton has recently been issuing standards of

low resistance made of manganine sheets, and he was kind enough, at my

suggestion, to send me one for measurement towards the end of July.

It was prepared in his laboratory as a derivative from the Cambridge

ohm by means of his potentiometer. Its value so given was -00050175

at 23° C. Its temperature coefficient appears, from the measurements

made in Mr. Crompton's laboratoi-y, to be so small that we need hardly

Myconsider it for our present purpose.    measurements of this standard

were as follows :

in 1000. Mr. Crompton's resistance is a rectangular sheet of manganine,
and the potential terminals are two screws inserted at a suitable distance
apart in the median line. The screws are not soldered. I thought it
would be of interest to unscrew them, screw them up again, and re-

measure the resistance. The results were

indicating a variation of about one part in 500. I unscrewed them again,
and after screwing them made a new measurement with the following

results

which, compared with the first value "00050222, shows a variation of,

approximately, one part in 280.

   We may therefore conclude that if an accuracy of yV^'^ P^^' cent, is

required of a standard so constructed its potential terminals ought not

to be meddled with after its resistance has been determined.

    In making these measurements my direct object has been to obtain an

accurate and ready method of measuring standards of low resistance.

But I think something more than this comes out of them. It would be

possible in the light of our present experience to constract a Lorenz

apparatus considerably more accurate and easier to use than that in my

laboratory at Cardiff. Such an apparatus placed, let us snppose, in the

National Laboratory, of which we have heard a good deal at recent

meetings of the British Association, might with advantage be kept in

constant use, not only for the calibration of low resistances, but also as

embodying in concrete form a proper ultimate standard of electrical

Weres-istance.      have not in our electrical standard legislation given full

credit  to  the  mechanical  engineer  for  what  he  can  do  for  us               and  I  think
                                                                                  ;

that a coefficient of mutual induction arranged, as in the Lorenz method,

80 as to be easily combined with a time would afford a more satisfiactory

standard of resistance than any wire coil or coils, and one easier to use

for purposes of ultimate reference than any mercury column.

--The Application of Photography to the Elucidation of Meteoro-
     logical Phenomena. Third Report of the Committee, consist-
     ing of Mr. Gr. J. Symons {Chairman), Professor E. Meldola,
    Mr. J. HoPKiNSON, and Mr. A. W. Clatden {Secretary). [Drawn
     up by the Secretary.)

Your Committee beg to report that their work has progressed slowly
during the last year, though it has been greatly hindered by the appoint-
ment of their secretary as principal of the new Technical and University
Extension College at Exeter. The large amount of work involved in the
            ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF METEOEOLOGICAL PHENOMENA.      141

organisation of so novel a type of institution has left little opportunity

for carrying on the work of the Committee.
    Having been thus obliged to postpone much of the work they hoped

to carry out, they have not drawn last year's grant.
     Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made. The number of

persons who have sent in their names as willing to contribute has been

added to, the photographs in your Committee's collection have in-

creased from 861 to 467, and the objects of the Committee have again

been brought before some of the most important photographic societies.
     The result is that the secretary is continually receiving letters asking

for directions for the photography of clouds, for the loan of lantern slides,

and general instruction, the furnishing of which your Committee consider

by no means the least useful part of their functions.

    A fairly exhaustive trial has been made of the comparative merits of

the Sandell plates, and slow plates of the photomechanical type ; from

which it appears that the double film does not possess for cloud photo-

graphy any advantage over the older type of plate. Since also the
management of the latter after exposui-e is the easier, your Committee

adhere to the decision given last year, that the black glass mirror and

slow plate really provide the easiest means of securing good cloud

pictures.

     Attention must be drawn to the excellent pictures of clouds on the
High Alps which have been received from Mr. Greenwood Pim, who has

expressed his willingness to turn his attention to the photography of

high clouds.

     With regard to cload photographs generally, your Committee feel

that their collection already includes suflBciently good examples of all
the commoner varieties of cloud which are capable of being so repre-
sented, and therefore think that there is no scientific object to be served

in simply multiplying prints. Consequently, during the past year they

have not sought such contributions, but in soliciting aid have invited

observers to study especially the changes of high-level clouds. This is

a work of considerable difficulty, and there are probably few persons who

possess at once the requisite skill and sufficient leisure.

The records of cloud forms may thus be said to have been secured,

Howand the next question is,     may they be utilised ' for the elucidation

of meteorological phenomena ' ?

Upon what problems do they bear ? This is easily answered. They

should give first the means of settling precisely what connection there

is between particular cloud forms and other atmospheric conditions,

and in the next place they should give a clue to the explanation of their

own forms.

In order to attack the first problem the great want is an efficient

cloud atlas of the higher clouds, such as was undertaken some time ago by

the International Committee. This atlas has not yet been published, and

in it, moreover, it is proposed to arrange clouds under the names suggested
by Messrs. Hildebrandsson and Abercromby, a system which English

meteorologists have not yet adopted. Indeed, as your Committee have

observed in a previous Report, the system of nomenclature should follow
and not precede the study of the two problems stated.

     The varieties of the lower clouds are pretty well understood ; it is
with the higher clouds that all difficulties arise. Your Committee there-
fore suggest that they should be empowered to arrange for the publica-
 142 REPORT-- 1893.

 tiou of a provisional cloud atlas, or one section of it, under the following

 conditions. Divide all clouds into the three great groups, Cumulus,
 Stratus, and Cirrus. Publish volumes dealing with each of these great
groups, not naming the subordinate varieties, but assigning merely num-

--bers. Thus, supposing there are ten varieties of Cirrus call them

No. 1, No. 2, &c. ; then, if there are ten varieties of cirro-cumulus, let
these be numbered from eleven upwards.

      It seems that if such an atlas were distributed to a number of ob-
servers who are in the habit of making eye-estimations of the quantity
of cloud, it would be quite easy for them to record also the numbers of
the respective types of cloud visible. Since these observations would be
made by meteorologists, and at the same time as records of temperature,

pressure, &c., the results could not fail to be of real importance.

     Again, a meteorologist armed with such an atlas would be able to
note changes of form from one type to another almost as well as the actual

photographer.

                                             Lightning Photographs.

     Not many new photographs of lightning have been received, but

they all agree with the others in the Committee's collection in showing
what has been called the narrow ribbon structure. There has not yet
been any opportunity of ascertaining whether this structure is shown in
negatives on paper, but it is visible in negatives taken on thin films.
This fact confirms the opinion already expressed by your Committee,
that it represents the true form of a lightning flash. Moreover, it cannot
be caused by reflection from the back of the plate, because if so it would
be most evident in the brighter parts of the flash, whereas it is most
evident in the fainter ; also, it would be more pronounced in the margins
of the plate than in the centre, and the apparent orientation of the
ribbon would vary according to the position on the plate. None of these
things are noticeable. The major thickness of the ribbon seems to set
itself in a particular direction, which is constant for all parts of a

branched or other flash, whatever may be the position of the image on

the plate. It is also not a whit more obvious in the margins of the
plate than in the centre. Lastly, it is almost invariably shown more or
less plainly ; why, then, should it be supposed to be due to some error of

observation ?

     It has lately been suggested that it is produced by marginal deforma-

tion of the image. Let us put aside for a moment the fact that the
phenomenon is not marginal at all. Now, if a lens be used which will

not cover the plate properly, so that the margins are out of focus, or if
the camera be purposely put out of focus, it is quite true that the

image of an electric spark may be expanded into a broad ribbon. But

this is characterised by both the margins of the ribbon being brighter than
the centre, while in the true narrow ribbon structure, as shown by light-
ning, the whole is equally bright, or one margin is bright and the other
the faintest part of the image. The explanation is clearly incorrect.

    It may be useful here to draw a definite distinction between a light-

ning ' flash ' and a lightning ' discharge.' Flashes last only a short time,
a mere fraction of a second, though probably a considerably larger frac-
tion than was at one time supposed. The eye is not conscious of any
variations of brilliancy during the flash, and a camera moving with con-
siderable velocity does not resolve it into a number of components.
           ON PHOTOGRAPHS OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.  143

Discharges may consist of a single f3ash, but they frequently consist

of a series of flashes following one another with considerable rapidity

along the same or related paths. The eye is often able to detect alterna-

tions of brilliancy during a discharge, and may resolve it, as a moving

camera will, into a series of flashes accompanied by a persistent luminosity,

which it has already been suggested is probably the flame of burnin»

nitrogen.

     Last year your Committee referred to a photograph taken by Mr. Glew
at Brixton. This was taken in a camera the lens of which was attached
to the hammer of an electinc bell and kept in oscillation during exposure.
The object was to deduce from the known rate of movement of the lens

the duration of the discharge. Unfortunately, however, there is nothino-

to show in which direction the lens was travelling at the moment of each

component flash.

There is one very simple method by which it is quite possible to make

a rough measurement of the duration of a discharge. Let two observers

A Aand B, agree that shall carefully notice the seconds hand of his watch
Awhile B looks at the sky to be sure that does not confuse two separate
Adischarges. If the night is otherwise dark, will see the hand only when

the face is illuminated by the lightning. The secretary to your Com-

mittee has, with the aid of Mrs. Clayden, made many such observations,

and has found that a lightning discharge often lasts as much as two or
thi-ee seconds, and may extend further, the longest time hitherto observed

being no less than seven seconds. During these times, though the

brightness of the light varied considerably, it was quite possible to watch
the hand moving steadily, and not in a series of jerks, as must have been

the case if the continuity of illumination had been an illusion due to per-

sistence of vision. In a similar way it is quite possible to follow the
movements of swaying tree-tops and other objects. It was noted with
some surprise that the light, as far as the eye can see, is often perfectly
steady for as much as a couple of seconds. Since beginning these observa-

tions not a single discharge has been noted of suSicient brevity to prevent

any movement of the watch hand from being seen.

     Now, although such observations are rough, their bearing upon light-
ning photography is important.

    An argument commonly advanced to prove that all photographs of

reduplicated flashes are due to movement of the camera is that the track
to be followed by successive flashes in a given discharge is marked out
by the first, which creates a path of minimum resistance in the form of a
partial vacuum.

But it seems to be forgotten how far this tube of rarefied air must

be moved, and how far the discharging point of the cloud (so to say)

Wemay be displaced by the movement of the air.  know that the wind

is often quite strong during a thunderstorm.

Now, a movement of one mile an hour corresponds to 176 inches a

second.

    Suppose, therefore, we take the first seven values of the Beaufort
scale and see how far such a tube of minimum resistance would be dis-

placed during the existence of a discharge.

     Hence it appears that if a dischai-ge lasts as long as three seconds, the

path of minimum resistance marked out by the first flash might be dis-
placed as much as fifty yards by a strong breeze. Moreover, since the

clouds would be moving at the same rate as the upper part of the vacuous

difference in the readings obtained with a thermometer of ordinary white

glass.

    On May 22 three sets of observations were made, two with the green,

glass and one with the white-glass thermometer : those with the green
were made between X.17 and X.50 and between XI.35 and XI.53,

that with the white-glass instrument between XI. and XI.25.
     The observed excesses of temperature of the green-glass thermometer

above the temperature of the case were 48°'3 F. and 49°"3. The observed

excess of the white glass was only 32°'8. The corresponding calculated
excesses obtained by the method described in the last Report were

respectively 50°-29, 49°-24, and 33°-30.

      It is thus seen that the white- glass bulb rises to about two-thirds .of

the excess indicated by the green-glass bulb. This, however, is no dis-
advantage, for when the temperature of the insolation thermometer is

much above that of the case the simple law which for smaller excesses

connects the rate of cooling with the difference of temperatures is no

longer a sufiBciently near approximation, and the reduction of the observed

results becomes more difl&cult.

As the simultaneous reading of the three thermometers is not an easy

operation, an attempt has been made to replace them by two thermo-

Aelectric junctions.  copper disc, 20 mm. in diameter and about "75 mm.

thick, was soldered at its centre to a piece of iron wire. The wire was so
bent that when the centre of the disc opposite to the soldered joint is

exactly behind the hole in the copper cube, the other end of the wire

makes contact with the copper cube midway between the front and back.
To the edge of the disc a thin copper wire is soldered, which passes
through a glass tube in the central opening of the cube, and is thus insu-
lated from it. The experiment being only preliminary, the iron wire has
been fixed in a hole drilled in the copper plug which usually holds the

insolation thermometer, the glass tube carrying the insulated wire being

passed through the hole in the same plug. The other terminal from the
copper cube is made by fixing a piece of copper wire in the plug which

closes the hole of the case thermometer B in front of the cube. In a per-
manent instrument a binding screw should be attached to the cube in the
plane of the disc. To increase the absorption of heat by the copper disc,
it was blackened by being placed for a short time in sulphuretted
hydrogen. The black surface thus obtained does not, however, com-

pletely absorb the radiation, for, on throwing a beam of sunlight on it, it
is observed that some of the light is scattered. The surface thus obtained

may, in addition, be not permanent.
     The terminals of the thermo-couples were connected to a reflecting

galvanometer of "97 ohm resistance, and the disc exposed to the raj's of
the sun, the lens of the instrument being used. The deflection of the

galvanometer became steady after an exposure of from five to eight
minutes, whereas twenty minutes were required when the green-glass-
bulb thermometer was used.

     In order to determine the value of the deflections a double thermo-

couple was made by soldering to two stout copper wires a bent piece of

thick iron wire. Close to the junctions delicate thermometers were tied,
and the apparatus was so arranged that the thermo-junctions and thermo-
meter bulbs could be plunged in test tubes containing paraffin oil : one

of these test tubes could be heated, and the connections were so made

that the current produced by the heated junction opposed that from the

actinometer. "Whilst the disc in the actinometer was exposed to the solar
radiations, one of the thermo-junctions was heated, and when the galvano-
meter indicated that no current was flowing the thermometers were read.
In one case, in which a deflection of 172 divisions was obtained, the
current was balanced by a difference of temperature of the two junctions

of 8°-27 C.

     If an instrument of this kind could be made photographically self-

recording it would constitute an excellent sunshine-recorder, giving not.
only the time of the shining of the sun, but also a measure of its intensity.

An ordinary reflecting galvanometer would not be very suitable for this

purpose, for variations of the earth's magnetism and the possible movement

of magnetic bodies in its neighbourhood would vitiate the results. An

instrument on the principle of the D'Arsonval galvanometer would be
more appropriate, but a few experiments made with such an instrument
have not given satisfactory results. Another source of error must be
mentioned, namely, the variation of the resistance of the long conducting
 wires by changes of temperature. 'No doubt all these difficulties might
 be overcome in. a properly appointed observatory.

 On the Present State of our Knowledge of Electrolysis and Electro-

                                                    T. C. Fitzpatrick.

      The comparison of the numerical results of electrolytic observations
 is rendered difficult from the fact that the data are scattered in various
 periodicals and expressed by different observers in units that are not com-
 parable without considerable labour. The following table has been

  compiled with the object of facilitating the comparison.

      In the table are included all the observations, as far as they are known

  to the compiler, for the metallic salts and mineral acids ; but amongst the
  solutions of organic substances ai'e not given all those for which Ostwald
  has made observations, as it was thought that they would add unneces-
  sarily to the size of the table. Observations for a number of additional
  substances will be found in Ostwald's papers in ' Journal fiir Chemie,'
  vols, xxxi., xxxii., and xxxiii., and in the ' Zeitschrift fiir physikalische
  Chemie,' vol. i. With this restriction it is hoped that no important
  observations have been omitted, and that in the reduction of results,
  expressed in such varied units, the table is sufficiently free from mistakes
  for it to be of service. The data included refer to the strength and
  specific gravity of solutions, with the corresponding conductivities,
  migration constants, and fluidities. The several columns are as follows :

       I. Percentage composition, i.e. the number of parts by weight of the

  salt (as represented by the chemical formula) in 100 parts of the solution.

       II. The number of gramme molecules per litre, i.e. the number of
   grammes of the salt per litre divided by the chemical equivalent in

   grammes, as given for each salt.
        III. The specific gravities of the solutions : in most cases the specific

   gravities of the solutions are not given by the observers, and the numbers

     IV. The temperatures at which the solutions have the specific
gravities given in the previous column for the given strength of solution.

     V. The conductivity, as expressed by the observer. In the cases iu
which the observer has expressed his results for specific molecular con-
ductivity no numbers are given in this column.

     VI. The temperature at which the conductivities of the solutions have

been determined.

    VII. The temperature coefficient referred to the conductivity at 18°

tivity is the ratio of the conductivity of a column of the liqaid 1 centimetre

long and 1 square centimetre in section to the number of gramme

equivalents per litre.

In some few cases in which no temperature coefficients have been

determined the results have been given for the temperature at which

the observations were made.

The numbers given in the column are the values for the specific

molecular conductivity x 10^.

IX. This column contains the values for specific molecular conduc-

tivity at 18° in C.G.S. units : they are obtained from those in the previous

column by being multiplied by the value of the conductivity of mercury
at 0° in C.G.S. units. This factor is 1-063 X IQ-^.

     X. The migration constant for the anion ; for instance, in the case of
copper sulphate (CUSO4) for (SO4).

XI. The temperatures at which the migration constants have been

determined.

    XII. The number of gramme molecules per litre, as defined for

column II., for which the fluidity data are given in the following columns.
     XIII. The fluidity of the solutions of the strength given in the

previous column.

Most of the results given for the fluidity of solutions are expressed in

terms of the fluidity of water at the same temperature : to obtain the

absolute values for the solutions they have been multiplied by the

value for the fluidity of water at the given temperature. The values used

for this purpose have been taken from Sprnng's observations for the

viscosity of water given in ' Poggendorfi^s Annalen,' vol. clix. p. I.

     To obtain the values for fluidity in C.G.S. units the numbers in this

column must be multiplied by the factor '1019.

XIV. The temperature at vrhich the solutions have the fluidity

given in the previous column.

XV. The temperature coefficient of fluidity at 18°, that is, -                   (s    *)·

     XVI. In the last column are given the references to the various papers
from which the data are taken : against each reference will be found a
number, which appears also against the first of the data which have been
taken from the paper in question.

The first of the above seismographs, constructed in 1883, partly at

the expense of the British Association, still continues to be used as the
standard instrument at the Central Observatory in Tokio.

    I am indebted to Mr. K. Kobayashi, the Director of the Observatory,

for the following table of its records :

                               ietween May 1892 and Ajnil 1893.

an instrument was described which gave a continuous record of tremors
and deflections of the vertical, and reference was made to earth-waves
which had a period of from fifteen to sixty minutes. The Reports for
1887 and 1888 formulated certain laws respecting the occurrence of earth
tremors or pulsations. Full accounts of all this work have been published
in the ' Transactions of the Seismological Society.' Last year I described
to this Association a method for the investigation of earth-pulsations and
earth-tilting, which consisted in making a continuous photographic i-ecord
of the spots of light reflected from mirrors carried by two horizontal
pendulums. These pendulums, which swing in planes at right angles to

each other, are each made from a piece of aluminium wire, 60 mm. in

length, tipped with a needle point resting in an agate cup. This is held

in a horizontal position by means of a quartz fibre. When adjusted so

that the period of swing is from five to six seconds, I find that a deflection

of the spot of hght upon the recording film of 1 mm. with one instrument

corresponds to a tilting of 0"54<", and with the other instrument of 0'68".
The distance of the lamp and film from the mirrors, which are arranged
to swing one above the other, is 3 feet.

    When describing this instrument iu 1892 I referred to it as being

new. In this I was mistaken, as similar arrangements have been used in
Potsdam and other places by Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz (see ' Der,

Ksl. Leop. -Carol. Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher,' Band LX.

No. 1). In Japan the primary object of the observations was to obtain
continuous records of earth-waves (tremors), with the result that with
these records the records of other phenomena like those of earth-tilting
were found. In Potsdam the cycle of observations was reversed, the
primary object being to record small changes in the vertical, with the
unavoidable result that distant earthquakes, tremors, and other phenomena
were also recorded.

     The pendulums I have used have been exceedingly light, and intended
to follow the movements impressed upon them by a succession of earth-

waves.

     The pendulums of Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz were comparatively heavy,
and were adjusted to move with periods of from twelve to eighteen

seconds.

     The results obtained in December and January last are described in
detail in the ' Seismological Journal,' whilst that which has been done
between February and April is briefly as follows :

                                                   Daily Tilting.

      Almost every day the records show that the spots of light have been
displaced in a direction which would correspond with a displacement
should the N.E. or N.N.E. side of the column on which the pendulums
stand be gently raised, and then gently but rather more quickly lowered.
Occasionally the tilting is from the north, the pendulum in the meridian
which records the east and west motion remaining stationary.

     The movement commences about 7 p.m., and continues steadily up to
about 7 or 8 a.m. From this to about 10 a.m. there is a quick return
to the normal position, where it remains until evening. The amount of
tilting which would produce these deflections is from 2" to 10". The
average, as shown in the diagram, is about 4".

                                              Barometrical Effects.

    On the soft, marshy ground near Wilhelmsliaven, Dr. von Rebenr-

Paschwitz observes that a change in the vertical of ^" corresponds to a

change of 1 mm. in barometrical pressure ; in fact, the district behaves as
if it were the vacuum chamber of an aneroid. In Tokio the effects are
not so pronounced, yet in many instances a N.N.B. tilting has corre-
sponded with a rise in the barometer. On two or three days when the

barometrical changes have been small the daily movements have been
small, but there are other instances where the daily movement has
continued and the barometer has been steady. In the smaller movements,
and in the few cases where the direction of one component of the daily
movement has been reversed, there does not appear to be any connection
with the barometer.

    Mr. T. Wada, of the Meteorological Observatory, tells me that the daily
maximum and minimum barometrical changes vary with the season, the

yearly average being as follows :

 is at right angles to a well-defined axis of rock cmmpling, whicli shows

 itself in the N.W. to S.E. strike of the mountains some thirty miles

 distant, and which line of folding probably continues beneath the plain of

 Tokio.

      Another point not to be overlooked is that the direction of earth-
 quake motion across the Tokio plain is in the majority of cases also at
 right angles to the direction of mountain strike. During the next

 summer I shall endeavour to instal horizontal pendulums on the rocks
 themselves, one of them parallel to the dip and the other at right angles

 to this direction.

                                              Irregular Movements.

      It often happens that superimposed upon the daily wave there are
 sinuosities with amplitudes of 1" or 2". These appear to be chiefly
marked on the east and west components of the diagrams. They have
periods of from three to six hours, and generally occur as a sinking
during the early morning or between midnight and 8 or 9 a.m., at which

time the east is usually rising.

     On February 17, March 24 and 26, small earthquakes occurred witb

these sinkings, after which the normal rise was continued. Other earth-
quakes, which, however, were too small to be measured by ordinary
seismographs, were not accompanied by such changes. Before the
earthquake of March 6, which probably was of local origin, the spots of
light had moved off the scale as if by an abnormally large sinking on the

N.E. side. This was at 8.45 p.m. on March 5. I therefore do not know
what happened immediately before the shaking, which took place at

8.52 A.M. next morning.

                                   Earth-waves or Earth-pulsatiotis.

                          (Tremors or Microseismic Disturbances.)

     On February 17, 18, and 19 there was a large and well-marked storm

of tremors. The barometer did not fall to any remarkable extent, the
lowest I noted being 297 in. While the movements were continuing
the east side of the column was depressed about 2", and the daily wave
did not show itself. With other tremor-storms, which were, however,
smaller, the daily wave has been unaffected.

                                                    Earthquakes.

     From the list of earthquakes at the commencement of this report it
will be seen that during the months of February and March nine earth-

quakes were recorded at the Central Observatory in Tokio. Five of
these were measurable by seismographs. Seven out of the nine were
recorded at the University Laboratory, which is about 1^ mile distant

from the central station. Owing to certain of these having occurred
when there had been a temporary interruption in the taking of records
as, for example, when changing a film--it is only possible that three of

the seven disturbances should have been photographically recorded.
     These records are remarkable for their smallness, apparently showing

that, although there had been a sensible motion of the ground, the
mirrors had either remained practically at rest, or else they had not been

movmg for a sufficiently long period of time to produce an impression on
the film. As the films, which were prepared for me by Professor W. K.
220 EEPOET-- 1893.

Burton, are particularly sensitive, I am inclined to the opinion that there

was less tilting accompanying these earthquakes than there is in the

waves which constitute a tremor-storm ; in fact, the earthquakes which

only produced deflections of 2 mm. were elastic tremors, while so-called
tremors which may produce deflections of 25 mm. are earth- waves.

    These observations led me to note the effects produced upon a film
when the mirrors had been caused to swing by placing my finger upon

the iron bed-plate which acts as their support. The result was that

either a band about 12 mm. in length was produced or else the trace
was blurred, and at the blurr a permanent deflection of about 3 mm. was

recorded.

As a result of these experiments I conclude that in all cases where

lines are invariably opposite to each other in both components, and

are seen as transverse markings in the traces, such lines indicate that

the mirrors have been swinging, and the question arises, whether these

are due to undulations from distant earthquakes or whether they are

due to undulations which, if they were continuous, would constitute a

tremor- storm.

     If they are tiltings due to distant earthquakes, then on several occa-

sions as many as fourteen of these disturbances have been noted in
twenty-four hours. On other days the normal lines are unbroken.

Comparing the photographic traces with the list of 101 earthquakes

which were felt in Japan during the month of February, it is seen that

only the large ones, like numbers 54 and 61, have been recorded on the

film. The traces, however, show that there have been many large dis-

turbances which do not coincide iu time with earthquakes noted on the

list. It is possible that these may coincide with disturbances which had

their origin in other countries, or, what is more likely, with disturbances

originating beneath the bed of the Pacific, where, from what we know,

Anseismic activity is at least as great as it is upon the land.  alternative

suggestion is that they are the result of movements similar in character

to those which constitute a tremor-storm ; but whether these are to be

attributed to sudden but gentle bondings of rocky strata, or whether

their origin is to be sought for amongst causes which are more complex,

is for the present a subject about which we are hardly justified in

attempting to formulate an hypothesis.

     Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz in Germany has observed fourteen earth-

-- --quakes if all of these really are earthquakes in eleven months. One

of them corresponds in time to the great disturbance of October 28, 1891,
when Central Japan was devastated.

     Possible Connecticut lehveen these Observations and oilier Phenomena.

     Assuming that with appliances similar to those used by Dr. von Rebeur-

Paschwitz, or to those used in Japan, records of distant earthquakes may

be noted, then it would be possible in England, or any other country, not
only to note unfelt local disturbances, but also to record, at least, very

many of the large disturbances which occur throughout the world.
     The importance of such records in determining the velocity with

which earth-waves are propagated, or, as was suggested by Lord Kelvin,
the determination of elastic constants for the earth's crust, and in solving

other problems, is apparent.

     Already the observations on earth-tilting seem to have gone sufficiently
                    --

         ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN, 221

 far to demand serious attention from practical astronomers. There are
 many reasons for believing that earth jjulsations or undnlations have a
 connection with the escape of fire-damp, and they do not appear to be

 wholly unconnected with the behaviour of certain physical instruments.

 For example, as the result of a long series of observations made with an
 Oertling and a Bunge balance, it seems that there are times when it
 would be impossible to carry out any delicate weighing operations.

      The more important results obtained from the observation of these

 balances were as follows :

      1. The Oertling, which was a light assay balance, moved more than
 the Bunge.

      2. It was seldom that either of the balances was absolutely at rest.
      3. Daring a day the pointer of the Oertling usually crept through

 half a division of the ivory scale.

     4. Although when caused to swing the period of the Oertling was
41 seconds, it would sometimes be found performing complete swings
with periods varying between 17 and 60 seconds. Slower motions might

take 50 minutes.

      5. It was often observed that both balances would start from rest
simultaneously and in the same direction.

      6. Periods of disturbance usually occurred with tromometric disturb-

ances, but both balances have often been found moving when tremors
were not observable, when the weather was calm and the barometer high,
while they have been absolutely at rest during a heavy gale and the

barometer at 29*2 inches.

     7. The oscillations are not always about the same zero, and the zero
for the pointer sometimes changes within a few minutes.

    A detailed account of the above observations is given in the ' Seismo-

logical Journal,' vol. i.

                                 The Earth-waves of Earthquakes.

     From the observations of many who have experienced a large earth-
quake we may be certain that at such times the surfaces of alluvial

plains have been thrown into a series of undulations. During these dis-
turbances, from observations on the behaviour of fluids in vessels the
water in ponds, the irregular and erratic swinging of seismographs, and

the character of the resulting records, it is also clear that undulatory,
wave-like motions have taken place.

     On the occasion of the great earthquake of October 28, 1891, knowing

that bracket and conical pendulum seismographs had been tilted, in the
Twelfth Report to the Association calculations were given of the

maximum slopes of the earth-waves which had caused these movements.
Although these calculations may have been interesting on account of

their novelty, because any arrangement like a heavy horizontal pendulum
when quickly tilted is likely to overswing the point corresponding to that
which it would take if the movement had been very slow, serious objec-

tions may be raised to the accuracy of the results which were obtained.
This consideration led me to devise an angle-measurer in which errors of

this description are not likely to occur. It consists of a balance-beam,

each arm of which carries a heavy weight so adjusted that the system

has but feeble stability. When the stand carrying this is tilted in the

plane of the arm, the arm remains horizontal, while a vertical pointer
222 REPORT-- 1893.

projecting downwards, as in an ordinary balance, is relatively deflected
through an angle corresponding to the tilt. This pointer moves a hori-
zontal lever, at the outer extremity of which a sliding needle writes its

record on a smoked-glass plate. Two such pieces of apparatus at right

angles to each other, writing on the same surface, constitute a complete

instrument.

      In one apparatus the balance-arm with its weights is replaced by
a heavy metal disc, supported in a vertical plane by knife edges at its

centre.

     Already one or two earthquakes have been recorded, and as these are
the first written records of earth- waves, a portion of one of them is here

reproduced :^

                                                                   Fig. 2.

    It shows the E. and W. tilting during a small portion of an earth-

·quake which occurred at 5.40 p.m. on January 8, 1893. The numbers
indicate successive seconds, from which we see that the period of the
waves varied from I- to ^ second. The average angular deflection was
about 2' 40", and the smallest about 1' 30".

     The movement continued over at least 20 seconds, dying out with
hardly perceptible waves having periods of about ^ second. The N. and
S. component of tilting was exceedingly small. The direction in which
the waves were propagated was approximately E.N".E. to W.S.W.

   --Inasmuch as tilting apparently occurs whenever we have vertical

motion, an unpleasant conclusion which, however, is not expressed for

--the first time is that all the records hitherto published in Japan where

vertical motion has been recorded are of but little value. Not only may

the horizontal motion have been exaggerated, but the records of vertical

motion have also suffered distortion, this being greatest when the arm of

the lever seismograph has been parallel to the direction of the wave-
slope. The disturbances in which the vertical component has been
mai'ked form about 10 per cent, of what should be our most important

records.

    What we require to know, for example, as an assistance in investi-

gations relating to construction is the configuration, dimensions, and

rapidity of recurrence of these earth- waves.

     The varying slope of the waves, their period, and their direction of
advance, may be measured by the apparatus described.

      As an attempt to measure the vertical component of these waves, four
lever seismographs have been arranged with their arms at 45° to each
other, it being assumed that the record from the instrument with its arm
most nearly at right angles to the direction of the advancing wave will
be tbe one which will most closely measure the vertical motion.

     Another possible method of measuring this element of earthquake
motion would be to avoid errors consequent on tilting by arranging a
vertical lever seismograph on gimbals.
       ON THE EARTHyUAKB AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 223

     Gyroscopes as adjancts to the solation of these problems have not
hitherto proved themselves successful.

    On the assumption that the earth-waves in alluvium were harmonic

in character and symmetrical in form, in the Report for 1892 it was shown
that they might be 20 feet in length ; and, knowing their length and
period, the velocity of propagation was determined. Even should these
waves have lengths several times this amount, some knowledge of their
form might be obtained by simultaneously measuring the difference
in movement between, say, the heads of a line of stakes at right angles to
the direction of the advancing waves and different points of a wire or rod
parallel to such a line, but only held in position at its two extremities.

    I am led to mention these latter experiments as indications of the

important problems which seismologists have yet before them.

        List of Earthquakes recorded in Japan in February 1893.

     Tlie list of earthquakes appended to this section of the Report is given
as an example of a catalogue which might be compiled from the material
which since 1885 has been accumulating at the Central Meteorological
Observatory in Tokio.

     The approximate centre of a disturbance is indicated by its latitude

and longitude, while the energy of the disturbance may approximately be

deduced from the figures which show in geographical miles the diameter

of the area shaken.

      Hitherto investigations respecting seismic activity, the periodicity of

earthquakes, &c., have been based upon catalogues where only the number
of shocks have been recorded, and where the disturbances of one seismic
area have been inextricably mixed with those from another.

     With a catalogue like the one suggested it would be possible to investi-

gate the rate at which seismic activity is decreasing or increasing either
in a given area or in Japan as a whole, giving values to the shocks pro-
portional to the area they had shaken. It would assist us in determining
whether there is any relationship between the frequency of earthquakes

in neighbouring areas. Inasmuch as many earthquakes seem to be the

result of sudden fractures or yieldings taking place during the process of
rock-crumpling, it does not seem unlikely that the relief of strain along
one axis should be altogether without effect upon neighbouring axes

where folding may also be in operation. One interesting investigation of
the records of a district which has very kindly been made by Mr. F.
Omori has been to plot the shocks which succeeded the great disturb-

ance of 1891 as a curve, the co-ordinates of which are equal intervals of
time and the number of shocks occurring during these intervals.

     It will be remembered that the immediate cause of the disturbance
was the formation of a large fault which can be traced some forty or fifty
miles, together with several minor faults. During the seven months
which followed the great shock no less than 3,000 shocks were recorded.

How many have been recorded up to date has not been calciilated, but

from the appended List for the month of February, that is sixteen months
after the first shock, sixty-two disturbances were noted.

     The curve representing this decrease in activity closely approximates
to a rectangular hyperbola, which now, with an average of two shocks
per day, is becoming asymptotic.

     With the law of decrease deduced from these records Mr. Omori
224  REPOBT 1893.

calculates that it will take about thirty years for the district to regain its

original stability. The records for the Kumamoto earthquake, which took

place in July 1889, show a like result, but with a rate of decrease
directly proportional to the intensity of, or the area shaken by, the primary

disturbance.

     One curious fact connected with the extinction of the Nagoya earth-
quake is that the district of greatest visible faalting, where valleys were
compressed and mountains were lowered, seems to have reached a fair
state of quiescence, while the most active settlement, or the district where
an extension of faulting is now taking place, is at the S.E. extremity of
the main line of original disturbance--a few miles N.E. from Nagoya in
Niwa-gun (N. lat. 35° 20', and E. long. 136° 50').

     Not only would the publication of the catalogue here indicated furnish
material very much better than that which has been hitherto attainable
for the continuation of investigations like those made by Perrey, Mallet,
and other seismologists, but we should have materials for investigations
which would be entirely new.

     of Professor H. McLeod (Ghairman), Professor W. C. Roberts-

The collection and verification of titles of papers on spectroscopy have

been continaed during the past year, and it is expected that another
instalment will be ready for printing at the next meeting.

--Mathematical Functions. Report of the Committee, consisting

      of Lord Rayleigh {Chairman), Lord Kelvin, Professor Cayley,

      (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of calculating Tables of
      certain Mathematical Functions, and, if necessary, of taking

     steps to carry out the Calculations, and to publish the results in

The first Report of the CoQimittee was in 1889 (at Newcastle-on-Tyne),
when they published tables of I,,(a;) for integral values of n from to 11,

from a!=0 to 60, at intervals of 0-2 ; I,j(a;) being defined by

2(2^^"^"^=^"'''^"^'^^=2^{^ +  + 24(2. + 2)(2. + 4)+ ' ' -j'

x=0The present tables of Ii(ie) are from  to S'lOO, at intervals of "001,

and are given to nine decimal places, the last figure being approximate.

They have been calculated by means of Taylor's Theorem, the successive

derived functions being obtained by use of the formula

and of the formnlte derivable from this by successive differentiations.
The values of these derived functions were checked by double cal-

culation of the values of Ii(a;) halfway between those given in the 1889

+table; thus, for exnmple, Ti(2-3) was calculated as Ii(2'2 0"1) and also
--as Ii(2'4 O'l). This important check confirmed at the same time the

values of Ii(,^;) which were given in the 1889 table, so that certainly the

tables now given are free from any systematic error. When the present

tables were finished, accidental errors were discovered and corrected by
taking out first and second differences, and then, finally, the printed tables

were checked by continuous addition of the first diiferences on Edmond-

son's calculatiuif machine. It is confidently hoped, therefore, that the

tables are free from serious error.
     Tables of lo(.f) have also been calculated, and are in a forward state,

but are not quite ready for printing this year.

     It is proposed to have the tables republished in book form when com-

                                                                                                                   a2

plete, together with tables of J,,(^)j to six decimal places. It will be

noticed that the march of Ii(a;) in the present table is such that interpo-

lation by first differences only will give accnrate results to six decimal

places. It is proposed to preface the book of tables with a short account

of the History, Theory, and Applications of the Bessel Functions, drawn

up by Professor A. Gr. Greenhill.

   The Committee are adding to the present Report a short table of

x^O3o{x\/i). If desired, a table of J,,(.«\/i) from  to 6'0 at intervals of 0-2,

for integral values of n from to 11, could be published next year.

   The Committee have expended the grant of 15Z., and desire reappoint-

ment, with a further grant of 15/.

   The Secretary has some copies of the 1889 Report, and will have some

of the present Report, which he will be pleased to forward to anyone wish-

ing to make use of the tables before their republication in book form.

His address is, Englefield Green, Surrey.

   The Committee wish to point out an error in the 1889 Report. The

differential equation of which I,, is one solution has a wrong sign before

its third term ; it should be

                                    x^ --^\-x---{x^-\-n^)u=\j.

    The work of calculation has been much hindered by faults in the

Edmondson's calculating machine which was bought by the Committee.
It has been returned to the maker several times, and has never been
entirely satisfactory. Latterly the greater part of the work has been
done on Professor McLeod's machine, which he is always kindly ready to

lend.

--Meteorological Observations on Ben Kevis. Report of the Coon-

riiittee,  consisting of  Lord  McLaren   Chairman),  Professor  A.

                                         (

Crum Brown (Secretary), Dr. John Murray, Dr. Alexander

BucHAN, Hon. Ralph Abercrombie, and Professor E. Copeland.

[Draivn tip by Dr. Buchan.)

The Committee were appointed as in former years for the purpose of
co-operating with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making meteoro-
logical observations on Ben Nevis.

     The hourly eye-observations by night and by day have been made
during the past year at the Ben Nevis Observatory without a single

interruption by Mr. Omond and his assistants ; also the continuous
registrations and other observations have been carried on at the Low Level

Observatory at Fort William with the same fulness of detail as during
the previous two years.

     The Directors of the observatories tender their cordial thanks to
Messrs. R. C. Mossman, F.R.S.B., A. J. Herbertson, 0. Stewart, B.Sc,
J. I. Craig, and A. Shand for valuable assistance rendered as volunteer
observers during the winter and summer for periods varying from four

to ten weeks, thus affording much needed relief to the members of the

regular observing staff.

     For the year 1892 Table I. shows the monthly mean and extreme
pressures, temperatures, hours of sunshine, amounts of rainfall, number

of fair days or days of less than 01 inch of rain, at the observatories,

the mean pressures at the top of the Ben being reduced to 32° only,
while those at Fort William are reduced to 32° and sea-level (see

Table I.).

     The mean temperature of the whole year at Fort William was 45°'3,
being 1°'9 less than the mean of previous years, being nearly the deficiency
for 1892 of a large part of Scotland to the north and east of Fort
William. The mean temperature at the top of Ben Nevis was 29°"7,
which is 1°1 under the mean. Thus the mean temperature at the top,
as compared with the foot of the mountain, was 0°"8 relatively warmer,
and this relatively higher temperature was maintained at all strictly
island and sea-coast situations from Monach in the Outer Hebrides to
Corsewall Point, Wigtownshire, just as occurred in 1891. The difference
was occasioned chiefly by the temperatures of the spring months and

December.

     The lowest mean monthly temperature at Fort William was 35°'3 in
December, being 4°"6 under the mean but at the top of the Ben 20°'3

                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

in March, being 2°'3 under the mean. At the top the mean for December
was 24°'0, being only 0°"7 under the average ; whilst, as stated above,
the mean of Fort William was 4°"6 under the average. The difference of
the means of the two observatories was only ll°-3, instead of the normal

 15°'2. This remarkably higher relative temperature of the top in
December was altogether due to the prevalence of well-marked anti-

cyclones during the time, when the temperature at the top was frequently
much higher than at Fort William. It was during these periods, when

extraordinary dryness of the air also prevails, that Mr. Herbertson
succeeded in obtaining the most valuable of the hygrometric observations

in connection with the large inquiry he is now conducting at the two

282 EEPOKT 1893.

The maximnm was 130 hours in July, being the highest for July hitherto

recorded, and the minimum, 12, in January. At Fort William the number
for the year was 1,179 hours, or 377 in excess of the number registered
on the top ; a diSerence above the average. The greatest number was
 178 hours in April, and the least 19 hours in Decemljer.

      Since, at the top of Ben Nevis, the horizon is virtually clear all round,
the total possible hours of sunshine agree with the theoretic number for
the latitude. But at Fort William, owing to the surrounding hills, the
theoretic number differs widely from the actual number possible to be

observed. During the last three years Mr. Omoud has observed the actual

intervals between sunrise and sunset at the lower station with the

following result :

                Table II

pared the raiDfall at tie Fort William Observatory with the monthly
amounts collected with the old gauge at Mr. Liyingston's during the year
and a half tnding with December 1892, with the result that the rainfall at
the observatory is 4'6 per cent, less than at Mr. Livingston's. The largest
rainfall of any month at the top was 22'32 inches in January, and at Fort
William 14"42 inches in September, the smallest amounts being respectively
5'42 inches and 1'84 inch, both occurring in March. The heaviest fall on
any single day at the top was 5'76 inches on January 25, and at Fort
William 2-83 inches on November 28.

     The number of days on which the rainfall was nil, or less than one-
hundredth of an inch, was 116 at the top, and 152 at Fort William. At
the top the largest number of days was 16 in July, and the smallest, 5,
in January ; and at Fort William the numbers were 23 in March and
5 in January. At Fort William a fall of an inch of rain a day or more
occurred on 13 days during 1892, but at the top of Ben Nevis on 50 days,
or nearly four times as often. From one to nine such wet days were
recorded at the top each naonth, whereas at Fort William no such wet
days occurred in March, April, June, July, and September, and on four of
the other months only one day each.

     At Fort William the mean atmospheric pressure at 32° and sea-level
was 29"852 inches, and at the top 25'284 inches, thus giving a diflerence
of 4"568 inches. The lowest pressure at the top for the year was 24'147
inches at 2 p.m. of February 2, and the highest 25*960 inches at 7 p.m. of
March 22, the difference being ] "813 inch.

     Mr. A. J. Herbertson is carrying on at the two observatories the
research on the hygrometry of the atmosphere referred to in our report of
last year. During last autumn and early winter he spent upwards of
four mouths at the Ben Nevis Observatory, and there measured the-
aqueous vapour by direct weighing, obtaining a new and valuable series
of experiments at very low temperatures and humidities. Since July last
a similar set of experiments are being conducted by him and two skilled
assistants, involving measurements of the aqueous vapour simultaneously

at both high- and low-level observatories. Observations are made at the
same times with the dry and wet bulb, both in a Stevenson screen and
in an Assmann aspirator psychrometer ; with Reguault's hygrometer;
 and of the numbers of dust particles present, the general weather con-

ditions as to barometric pressure, sunshine, wind, &c. Mr. Herbertson
 has communicated a preliminary report on the results of last year's-
 observations and experiments to the Boyal Society of Edinburgh, in

which among other points of interest the very unsatisfactory character of
 the hygrometric tables now in use is clearly shown for low temperatures
and great dryness. The experiments at present in progress give the cor-
responding data for summer temperatures and humidities and, seeing they

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

 are conducted simultaneously both on the top of the Ben and at Fort

 William, the eflfect of large differences of pressure will be seen on the rela-
tions of the dry and wet bulb readings to the amounts of aqueous vapour

 actually present in the air at the time. The Dirpctors regard these

 experiments as of great importance, not only as furnishing data towards a
 better knowledge of the hygrometry of the atmosphere, but also as leading

 to much needed improvements in the methods of reducing the readings of

the dry and wet bulb theimometers.

thermometei' in the Stevenson screen, wliicli was published in the last

' Journal ' of the Scottish Meteorological Society. The results are interest-

ing and suggestive. He has prepared a paper on the height of the lower

edge of the cloud layer on Ben Nevis, based on observations taken at In-

verlochy during some months of the present summer ; and has also insti-

tuted a comparison of the temperature observations from August 1890 to

December 1891, made simultaneously by himself at the new observatory

and by Mr. Livingston at the old station with the instruments in use

there since 1883.

At last year's Meeting of the Association a grant of 501. was made to

aid in the payment of assistants to perform the strictly routine work of

Dr. Buchan and Mr. Omond, so that their time would be set free for the

discussion of the observations of the two observatories beginning with

August ] 890. This arrangement has been carried out, and the following

is a detailed statement of the work which has been completed or is still

in progress.

From the first eight years' observations of the rainfall at the top of

Ben Nevis the mean hourly variations for the twelve months of the year

have been calculated, and the hourly values reduced to percentages above or

below the monthly means. The results were then ' bloxamed ' in the usual

way, that is, the value for 1 a.m. of January equals         --"^ ; for

sent the values of the months December, January, February, &c., for

these years. In this way Table IV. has been constructed, which shows

the diurnal variation in the precipitation throughout the year. As was to

have been expected, the curves for the warmer months of the year are

best marked. These show a clearly defined double maximum and mini-

mum. The larger maximum occurs from 11 a.m. to 8 P.M., or during the

warmer hours of the day after the ascending current has set in. Then a
minimum occurs from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., or during the hours when tem-

perature falls most rapidly, and the evening maximum of pressure prevails.

For the next six hours precipitation is above the average, the greatest

increase being from 5 to 6 a.m. ; and finally from 7 to 11 a.m. the next

minimum occurs, or during the hours atmospheric pressure and tempera-

ture increase, and terminates with the formation of the ascending current,

which is so pronounced a feature in the meteorology of Ben Nevis. During

the colder months the curves are less distinctly marked, except a decided

maximum during the coldest hours of the day, and a minimum during the

hours of the morning barometric maximum, when temperature is rising.

The hourly variation of the rainfall is more clearly shown than at any

other observatory at which hourly observations have been made from

results extending over a comparatively short term of years.

The discussion of the hourly barometric and thermometric means at

the two observatories for the three years is nearly complete.

    An inquiry into the diurnal variation of the barometer and thermo-

meter on Ben Nevis during days of clear weather on the one hand, and days

of fog or mist throughout on the other, is completed for the three years

ending August 1893. The inquiry had not proceeded far when it was

apparent that the curves for clear weather and those for clouded weather

while fog or mist was absent were in all essential respects the same ; but
the curves were of quite a different character when fog or mist prevailed.

the formation of the fog being chiefly confiueil to the restricted area of
the mountain top, the increased pressure is not relieved by the formation
of an asoeudiug current, and hence pressure is increased at the top, being
the restricted area where the condensation takes place.

   --Appendix Account of Observations made with the Horizontal Pendulum.

                       Bij i>r. E. VON Eebeur-Paschwitz, p. 309.

The Committee were appointed to consider the advisability and desirability

of establishing in other parts of the country observations upon the pre-

valence of earth-tremors, similar to those now being made in Dui-ham in

connection with coal-mine explosions.

       In the present report descriptions are given of several instruments

which have been used in the study of earth-tilts and earth-pulsations.
The list is not a complete one, some having already been included in the
reports of the Committee on the Lunar Disturbance of Gravity for 1881
and 1882, drawn up by Messrs. G. H. and H. Darwin.' The first of

these valuable reports also contains an account of the pendulum with
double-suspension mirror, used in the well-known experiments in the
Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. The extraordinary sensitiveness of
this pendulum led Mr. Horace Darwin to design another form of the
instrument, smaller and simpler in construction, but capable of measuring
smaller angles than are required in these experiments. The method of

determining the angular value of the scale-divisions has also been altered.

The new pendulum was made some months ago by the Cambrido-e
Scientific Instrument Company, and Mr. Darwin, being unable at the
time to give much attention to it, has lent it to the Committee for trial.
The preliminaiy experiments have been made by the Secretary at
Birmingham, chiefly under Mr. Darwin's guidance, and the results are
described below. The Committee think it most desirable that the
observations should be continued in Birmingham, and also made in other

parts of the country.

     One of the most delicate instruments that have been used for the

observation of earth-tilts is the horizontal pendulum of Dr. E. von
Rebeur-Paschwitz, who has described the results obtained with it in
several valuable memoirs. The Committee considered that an account
of these observations in English would be of great use, and at their

request Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz kindly consented to write the very
luteresting and valuable summary which forms an appendix to this

report.

  --Nadirane of M. G. Wolf. The nadirane erected in 1863 by M.

d'Abbadie at Abbadia, near Hendaye, is described in the reports for
1881 and 1 882,- as well as some of the results which have been obtained

with it.

list of M. d'Abbadie's papers on this subject :
--288 REPORT 1893.

The nadirane now to be described was designed by M. Wolf for use

at tlie Pai-is Observatory.' It differs from that of M. d'Abbadie in two
important particulars: (1) The beam of light is made to traverse a

horizontal, instead of a vertical, layer of air, thereby avoiding the effects

of variations in temperature. (2) The relative fixity of the object-glass
and the observing microscope is rendered immaterial by employing

differential, instead of absolute, measures of the position of the image.

The bath of mercary rests on the limestone floor of the observatory

cellar, which, being at a depth of 27 metres, is free from surface vibra-

tions, and remains at a practically constant temperature. Above the

bath, and rigidly connected with it, is a hollow prism of cast iron, the

hypotenuse face of which carries a plane mirror of silvered glass inclined

to the horizon at an angle of 45°. The mercury-bath is closed by a

horizontal object-glass, 24 cm. in diameter, about 80 m. in focal length,

and cut so as to give the least aberration to yellow light. The closing

of the bath was found to be necessary in order to prevent the action of

Athe mercury vapour on the silvering of the mirror.  second plane

mirror of silvered glass, and 14 cm. in diameter, is fixed to the

torizontal surface of a support rigidly connected with the framework

of the mercmy bath. On the floor of the cellar and in a line at right

angles to the vertical face of the hollow prism is a metal plate, through a

bole in which a beam of monochromatic yellow light passes. This beam

is reflected by the inclined mirror, and again by the horizontal mirror and
mercury, and is then returned as a double beam by the inclined mirror to

near its origin, where the two images are observed with a microscope

of small magnifying power.

If the luminous point is rigidly connected with the optical centre of

the object-glass of the microscope the two images, M. Wolf shows, are

only displaced with respect to one another when the reflecting apparatus

is rotated about a horizontal axis. The luminous point and microscope

might indeed be held by the hand. The parts of the reflecting apparatus

must, however, be invariably fixed with respect to one another and their

support ; and, the temperature of the cellar being constant, it follows

that the only error can arise from rusting of the metallic pai'ts.

M. d'Abbadie's nadirane, one of 0"-03.

     M. Wolf informs me that the only result of his observations, which

have been carried on for several years, is that thei-e has been no permanent

--change of level in the floor of the observatory cellar.
     Tromometer of H. T. Bertelli. This instrument being now well known

a brief account will be sufficient here. In its original form it consists of

a mass of 3 kilogrammes suspended by a copper wire 1 mm. in diameter

and 3 m. long. In the ' normal tromometer,' which is the form generally

iidopted throughout Italj', a mass of 100 grammes is suspended by a
very fine copper-wire l^m. in length from a stout arm projecting from
the column which forms the stand of the instrument. From the centre
of the bob of the pendulum there projects downwards a short style, the

 point of which, after reflexion in the hypotenuse-face of a right-angled

])rism, is observed with a microscope. In some instruments the style
ends in a small disc, on which are ruled two fine lines at right angles to
one another. The mirror is provided with a glass micrometer-scale ruled

to tenths of a millimetre, and tenths of a division may be estimated by

the eye. It is therefore possible with this instrument to measure an
earth-tilt of about 1^". The scale can also be rotated so as to detemiine

the direction of the movement.

   --Tremor-recorder of Professor J. Milne. The pendulum consists of a

weight of 7 lb. suspended by a fine iron wire 3 feet 3;^ inches long. The
upper end of this wire is soldered into a small hole in a plate which forms
the top of a tripod-stand about 5 feet high. From the base of the bob a
spike projects downwards, and is kept by a spring in contact with the
end of a long light vertical pointer made of a strip of bamboo. The length
of the pointer is about 16^ inches, the short arm, which is in contact with
the spike of the pendulum, being about yLth of the length of the longer
arm. The instrument is made recording by discharging a spark every
five minutes from the end of the pointer, and thus perforating a band of

Apaper which is moved by clockwork beneath the end of the pointer.

second band of paper moves at right angles to the former, in order to
avoid the loss of a record in case the pointer should move parallel to
the first band. Though designed independently, this instrument, as
Professor Milne remarks, is similar to one previously made by M. Bouquet

de la Grye.'

     To avoid the friction arising from the movement of the pointer, M.
Chesneau suggests that the bob of the pendulum should be a lens, a point

of light close to it forming an image at a greater distance, which should
record on a strip of photographic paper the movements of the pendulum.*

    The tromometer now used by Professor Milne is described in the

'Report of the British Association' for 1892 as well as in the two last

  --Seismic Oscillations of the Oround-water Surface. Some interesting

observations have recently been made on this subject by Professor

Franklin H. King in vsrells in the "Wisconsin agricultural experiment

station farm.* The instrument employed consists of a copper float con-

nected with the end of the short arm of a lever. The longer arm is three

times as long as the other, and at the end carries a pen which traces the

magnified fluctuations of the water-level on a moving sheet of paper. The

recording apparatus is placed on a slab over the top of the well.

The well in which these observations were made is 40 feet deep, and

is tubed with 6-inch iron pipe down to the rock (sandstone), 37 feet below

the surface, the water having a mean depth of about 20 feet. At a

distance of 140 feet from the well there is a railway line.

When the records from this well were examined, numerous sharp,

short period curves were found, which were at first supposed to be due to

accidental disturbances of the apparatus. But the fact that they were

always dependent from the main curve, indicating a rise of water in the

well, led to their closer examination and to their association with the

movement of trains past the well. ' The strongest rises in the level of

the water are produced by the heavily- loaded trains which move rather

Aslowly.  single engine has never been observed to leave a record, and

the rapidly moving passenger trains produce only a slight movement, or

none at all, which is recorded by the instrument.' The curve is produced

by ' a rapid but gradual rise of the water, which is followed by only a

slightly less rapid fall again to the normal level, there being nothing

oscillatory in character indicated by any of the tracings nor observable

to the eye when watching the pen while in motion. The downward move-

ment of the pen usually begins when the engine has passed the well by

four or five lengths, and when the pen is watched it may be seen to start

and to descend quite gradually, occupying some seconds in the descent.*

The cause of these movements of the ground-water surface is not

quite clear. Possibly the earth, being depressed by the weight of the

train, and sinking into the ground-water, may displace it laterally, and

thus cause it to rise under the surrounding area; or the compression of

the zone of capillarily saturated soil lying just above the ground- water

surface, or its frequent recoils from the shock imparted by the moving

train, may force some of the capillaiy water out of the soil, and thus

raise the mean level of the ground- water.

                                                 Bifilar Pendulum designed by Mr. Horace Darwin.

The pendulum used by Messrs. G. H. and H. Darwin in their experi-

ments at Cambridge is fully described in the Report for 1881 (pp. 93-

112). The principle of this instrument was suggested to them by Lord

AKelvin, and may be briefly described as follows.                                                heavy weight is sus-

pended by two converging brass wires, which only allow the cylinder to

Amove in a direction at right angles to the plane they are in.                                                 fine silk

fibre is attached at one end to the bottom of the weight and at the other
to a fixed support, and passes through two thin wire loops on the edge of
a small circular mirror. The ends of the silk fibre are brought close
together, so that the two parts are inclined at a considerable angle.

Thus, a very small displacement of the pendulum at right angles to the
plane of the mirror will cause it, and a ray of light reflected by it, to turn
through considerable angles.

     Mr. Horace Darwin has designed the new bifilar pendulum on the

same principle (fig. 1). The mirror is circular and ^ inch in diameter,

and itself forms the bob of the pendulum. Two hooks about l inch

apart are fixed to its upper rim and are hooked on a

very fine silver wire which supports the mirror. The                                                           ^'

points to which the ends of this wire are fixed are some

distance apart in a vertical direction, one being very

nearly vertically above the other, and are attached to

supports in the frame of the instrument.

Any simple tilt of the ground may be resolved into

component rotations about a vertical line and two

horizontal lines, one perpendicular, and the other parallel,

to the face of the mirror. The first rotation produces

no appreciable efiect, the second changes the horizontal

distance between the two points of support, thus render-

ing the instrument more or less sensitive, according as

the distance is diminished or increased. By the third

rotation, the upper support is moved through a greater

distance than the lower, causing a deflection of the

mirror about a vertical axis. If, for instance, the mirror

be suspended in a north and south plane, facing a gas-
jet at some distance to the west of it, and if the north

part of the suspending wire be the longer, it is obvious

that the pendulum will only indicate those tilts which

take place in an east and west direction, or the east and

west component of tilts which take place in other direc-

tions                       and                  that  a   tilt  towards the  west will  cause the
                         ;

reflected beam to deviate towards the south.

The pendulum is at present placed in this position.                                                   The mirror

faces west, and it will be convenient in this description to                                         refer to the

sides as north or south, &c. The front or west view of the instrument

is given in fig. 2, on one-third the real scale. The base. A, is carried by

three levelling-screws, 6 inches apart, and is made in two pieces fixed

together ;                                       but   it  would  be  better for  the    future  to  have  it  cast  in

pended. Two ^-inch square brass bars, h and k, are firmly screwed

wheels, P and Q, with V-shaped grooves, which turn stiffly on their axles.

This part of the instrument will be referred to as the ' frame.' The thin

silver wire which supports the mirror passes partly round each of these

wheels, and is fastened by a small screw in their edges. The wire hangs

down in a loop just below the frame, and is stretched tight when the

mirror is hooked on. The north portion of the wire is attached to the

Aupper wheel, and the south portion to the lower.  convenient vertical

adjustment is given to the mirror by turning the pulleys and winding

some of the silver wire on to them ; the friction with which they turn

prevents them running back.

    When the mirror is suspended in this manner the frame and mirror

are inserted into the brass tube, the lower end of the frame resting on

the hollow conical surface, R, of the passage from the tube to the mirror-

Abox, so that the mirror hangs within the latter.  rectangular opening

in a circular brass plate, d (fig. 2), at the top of the tube admits the

frame and allows it to move without rotation in an east and west direc-

Ation.  thin rod, which passes through a hole in the south-east side

near the top of the cap of the tube, is kept pressing by a spiral spring

against the bar H (fig. 3), and this holds the frame against the north

side of the rectangular opening, and also against the end of the screw, e

(figs. 2 and 3), on the west side. Thus, all movement of the frame

inside the tube is prevented, except that in an east and west direction,

produced by turning the screw, e. Another and much stronger spring

outside the cylinder keeps the screw e pressed in one direction in order

to prevent any backlash in the screw.

Before the plate, d, and the cap are screwed on, the mirror-box and

tube are filled with paraffin oil, so that the pendulum and supports are

entirely immersed in it. The effect of this is to make the pendulum

absolutely dead-beat and capable of registering slow earth-tilts only. It

is therefore unaflTected by the rapid tremors such as would be produced

by the rattling of passing vehicles.

The two west or front levelling-screws being equidistant from the

east and west line through the centre of the instrument, it is evident

that the inclination of the pendulum along the latter line is not changed

if one of the screws be raised and the other depressed by equal amounts.

The sensitiveness of the pendulum can be increased or decreased by

turning the screws in this manner. At present this is done by hand,

but it might be desirable to put a slow motion for their adjustment

which could be worked from a distance. The inclination of the pen-

dulum in the east and west direction can be altered by the east or back

levelling-screw (called the 'back-leg' in the Report of 1881) without

affecting the sensitiveness, and a movement of the same kind but of far

greater delicacy can be given to the frame by the screw, E. This can be

done by hand, or a small turn of the screw can be made by the lever, f.

The distances between the levelling-screws being known, and also

the number of threads to the inch, it is evident that the tilt given to the

instrument by one turn, or fraction of a turn, of the back-leg could be

estimated. In the present form of the instrument the tilt is, however,

given to the frame by turning the screw, e, through a known angle. If

a be the distance between the bottom of the frame and the point at

which the screw acts, h the breadth of the frame, and a the semi-

vertical angle of the hollow cone, E, on which the frame rests, a move-

ment of the screw, E, through a distance, h, will tilt the frame through an.

                                         and the number of threads on

the screw is 100 to the inch. One complete turn of the screw will

Atherefore tilt the frame through an angle of 146-4 seconds.  fractional

turn of the screw may be made by the lever, f, which can be clamped to

it by a screw in front. The lever ends below in a rectangular plate with

ends projecting outwards ; and, by two screws working through these

ends, and abutting against the stops, G, the range of the lever's move-

ment can be regulated. The length of the lever is 335-5 mm., so that

with the range of movement of 144 mm. of the bottom of the lever the

tilt given to the frame is exactly one second.

now in use in Birmingham. It is erected in a cellar, the plan of which

scribed below. The line A B runs east and west. Ten feet west of the
pendulum a board, b, is placed on the floor of the cellar. This board,

which was used in the experiments at Cambridge, contains a pair of

rails on which a carriage with three legs slides, bearing a gas-jet. On

the east side of the carriage is a screen, pierced by a circular hole, one
inch in diameter, having on the west side a piece of ground glass, and

on the east side a fine wire. The image of this wire formed by reflexion,

first, in the pendulum-mirror, and then in a plane mirror, at c,' is ob-

Berved with a telescope, D, furnished with cross-wires and placed in the

Apassage just outside the cellar.  wooden bar, e, is attached at one end

to the side of the carriage, and at the other end is graduated to tenths

of an inch, the index-pointer being near the floor to the right of the

telescope. The carriage is also provided with a screw. motion, which

can be worked from the telescope-seat, but it was found unnecessary to

use this, as the image can be rapidly and accurately adjusted on the

vertical cross-wire of the telescope by gently tapping the end of the

graduated bar.

    When the instrument is in order, nearly all operations can be carried

on in the passage without entering the cellar. Strings attached to the

two sides of the lever are guided by hooks and brought round to either

side of the telescope, so that the angular value of the scale-divisions can

be determined without leaving the telescope. The gas-jet also can be

lighted from the same place. The only occasion for entering the cellar

is to readjust the pendulum when one end of the scale-divisions, which

occupy a length of about 9 inches on the graduated bar, approaches

the index-pointer. But this can be rapidly done by a slight turn of the

screw used for tilting the frame. In a few minutes the image becomes

steady, and if this be done about the time of day when the tilt is

changing in direction, the movement in so short a time will be so small
that it may be safely neglected.

The house in which the pendulam is installed lies on the west margin

of Birmingham. The rock is Bunter sandstone, but this is covered at

the surface by a thick bed of clayey sand, with occasional layers of

rounded pebbles. The nearest edge of the road in front of the house is

A11 yards from the pendulum.  single-line suburban railway runs in a

deep cutting at the bottom of the garden, about 80 yards from the

pendulum. But no disturbance has ever been noticed from either pass-

ing carts or trains, the short vibrations or tremors produced by them

being too rapid to affect the pendulum, and the local bendings of the

ground caused by their weight apparently having no effect.

Horace Darwin on April 20 and 21. Experiments were made to deter-
mine the angular value of the scale-divisions at various times between

May 1 and 25, and again between August 1 and 3. The first trials were

unsatisfactory, the image seldom returning to the same or nearly the
same position. Some of the causes of failure were easily remedied ; but
                                                                                                                      --

even in the latest attempts there is still some slight discrepancy between
the positions of the image after successive to-and-fro movements of tbe

lever.'

     If the bottom of the lever be moved to the left, it is evident that the

screw advances and that the frame is tilted to the east. When this is

done the movement of the image is at first rapid, but in two or three
minutes becomes nearly insensible, and after five minutes no displace-
ment of the image can be perceived. In all the later and more satis-
factory trials the lever was moved every ten minutes, and in the intervals
the gas was turned down. It should be added that in the evenings when
these experiments were made the pendulum always indicates a movement

to the west.

     The range of motion of the bottom of the lever was regulated so as to
give a tilt of two seconds to the frame, and the corresponding lengths of

the scale in inches, as determined on May 24, were as follows :

             + 7-02 -6-65 +7-20 -6-95 +6-66 -6-96

                 -f6-90 -6-85 -I-6-83 -6-97 +6-94 -6-65

A plus sign indicates a tilt to the west, and a minus sign a tilt to the

east. Thus the average of six tilts of two seconds to the west gives
6*92 ±'05 inches as the corresponding scale- value, and the average of six
similar tilts to the east gives 6-84±-04 inches. The difference between

these two values may no doubt be in part attributed to the westerly
tilting of the instrument. If, however, the mean of the scale-values of

successive pairs of tilts be taken, the effect of this westerly tilting will

be eliminated, if it may be supposed to be uniform throughout the

twenty minutes allowed for the to-and-fro movements of the lever and
for the subsequent readings. The average of these six means is 6-88±'03
inches. This value is probably the most accurate of the series, and a
tilt of one second will therefore be taken to correspond to 3 "44 inches of

the scale.

     The distance of the gas-jet from the pendulum being 10 feet, the
angle through which the mirror turns for an east or west tilt of one

second is therefore ^ tan~^ _ -^ , or 49 minutes.

Siuce the two parts of the silver wire which support the mirror

always lie in the vertical plane through their points of support, the angle

through which the mirror turns for a given east or west tilt is inde-

pendent of  the distance  between  the  mirror-hooks                                                              it  depends  only on
                                                                                                               ;

the horizontal and vertical distances between the two points of support

of the silver wire. If c be this horizontal distance, and d the angle

through which the mirror turns for an east or west tilt of one second, it

is evident that cd is constant. If x be the decrease in the value of c, due

to a given southerly tilt of the frame, and ? the corresponding increase in

the value of 0, then c=^xQjc. Hence, if the frame be tilted through one

second in a north and south line, the change in the value of is d^, and

the corresponding change in the scale- value above given is therefore ^^ih

of that value. It follows that, in order to make the error small, 6 should

be small ; that is, the scale should be a long way from the pendulum.
The original instrument used in the Cavendish Laboratory expei'iments

was free from this error. It would be possible to replace one of the fine

     ' It is hoped that this discrepancy will disappear with another arrangement of
the lever which Mr. Darwin has designed.

wires supporting one side of the mirror by two converging wires, and
thus to allow it to move only in an east and west direction, and so
eliminate this error. It would, however, have the drawback of compli-

cating the instrument.
     If d be the vertical distance between the points of support of the

silver wire, it is obvious that the circular measure of one second is cOjd,
and therefore c=:f?/2940. In the present instrument d is about 12 inches,
so that the horizontal distance between the points of support is only
0-004 inch.

    On the first three days of August, the scale-value for a tilt of two

seconds was redetermined in the manner described above. The average
scale- values of six pairs of east and west tilts on each evening were

                      6-39±03, 6-06±-06, and 6-14±-08 inches,

and the average of the eighteen pairs was 6-20±04 inches. Between
the end of May and the beginning of August, the scale- value for one second

changed from 3"44 to 3'10 inches, and there must, therefore, have been a.

--tilt towards the north of about seven seconds.
     Sensitiveness of the Pendulum. Except on two occasions, which will
be referred to below, the image has always been perfectly steady, and

chiefly to this is due the extreme delicacy of the pendulum. If the gas-

jet be displaced by y-^Yfths of an inch, the image and the vertical cross-

wire in the telescope are clearly separated, and a displacement of y^g^th

of an inch of the gas-jet can be easily detected. Thus the scale-value of

one second being 3'44 inches, it follows that we can observe a tilt of the

ground of  less than  y^th of  a  second '                                 and  since the  pendulum might
                                                                        ;

be rendered more sensitive, and the optical arrangements improved, it

would not be impossible to detect a tilt of tqVo^'^ ^^ * second, or even

--less than this if desired.
     Ohservations with the Pendulum. The principal objects of the experi-

ments being to test the working of the instrument, observations were

made when convenient, and not at regular intervals. They were made

frequently enough, however, to give some idea of the nature of the daily
motion. At first the movement indicated appeared to be always to the

west, and the observations, though not generally continued later than

10 P.M., showed no trace of a return movement to the east. This westerly

tilting, of at first about a second a day, appeared to be chiefly due to the

settling of the foundation, and by the end of June became nearly imper-

ceptible. Towards the end of May and the beginning of June, observa-

tions on the daily movement were made for about two weeks consecutively.
The direction of the movement changed from east to west at from 7 to
9 A.M., and from west to east at from 10 to 12 p.m., but these epochs were
altered when the continued westerly tilting ceased. During the middle
of August, the easterly movement lasted till noon or about 2 or 3 p.m.
Subsequent experiments, described below, seem to show that this daily
movement may be, in part at least, due to the action of convection currents

in the oil surrounding the mirror.

     The pendulum in the Cavendish Laboratory having been extremely
sensitive to slight changes of pressure on the floor of the room, it seemed
desirable to make some similar experiments with the present instrument.

I stood for one minute about a foot and a half west of the pendulum, and,

    ' An isosceles triangle with a base one inch long and each of the equal sides 1,000'

miles would have a vertical angle of about 3^th of a second.

returning quickly to the telescope, found there had been an apparent
tilting of about one-sixth of a second to the east. Standing for the same
time on the east side of the pendulum, there was an apparent tilting to

the west. At a distance from the pendulum these etfects were much less

marked. After sitting for a short time at the telescope-seat in the
passage outside the cellar a somewhat similar, but very slight, eflPect is
noticeable. For about a minute the image remains perfectly steady.
It then starts slowly, but rather suddenly, to the right, indicating a
movement to the east, the total deflection in eight minutes being about

^Lth of a second. I attributed these movements at first to my weight

bending the cellar floor, but some experiments made afterwards at Mr.
Darwin's suggestion showed that they were due rather to changes of

temperature, and that the deflections caused by my weight were in reality

almost imperceptible.
      Supposing the foundation to remain fixed, the effects of a change in

                                                                       Fig. fi.

--the distribution of temperature might be manifested in two ways either

 by the unequal expansion of diS"erent parts of the instrument or by con-
  vection curi'ents in the paraffin oil. Since the gas-jet stands west of
 the pendulum, the expansion due to its heat would produce an apparent

 tilting to the east. On the other hand, since the vertical axis about

  which the mirror turns lies to the south of its centre (see fig. 1) the
 ·eSect of convection currents on the oil would be to cause an apparent
  tilting to the west. Thus the initial deflection of the mirror in the pre-
  ceding experiments appears to be due to expansion.

       If, however, the heating be continued for some time a retrograde

  movement sets in. On August 20 the gas was kept alight for six hours,
ON EARTH TREMOR?.  301

from 9.12 a.m. to 3.12 p.m. ; it was then turned down, and readings were
continued for six hours longer. The results are illustrated by the curve
in fig. 6. The effect of expansion is shown by the movement to the east

for a short time after the gas is lighted, and that of contraction by an

inci-ease in the rate of westerly deflection immediately after the gas is

turned down. The most important movement is that of more than a
second to the west while the gas was up, and to the east when it was-
turned down. There can be little doubt that it is due to the action of

convection currents in the paraffin oil, in which the mirror and frame are

immersed.

    An attempt was next made to determine the part of the instrument

whose expansion produced the first deflection. For this purpose a card-

board box, 12 inches long, 5J inches broad, and 4 inches deep, was filled
with hay. It was first placed so as to shield the upper part of the
instrument, leaving the mirror-box and levelling-screws uncovered, with
the result of preventing the first easterly movement. The gas was kept
alight for two hours (11.30 a.m. to 1.30 P.M.) ; it was then turned low
down, and readings were taken at intervals during the next three hours.

After one minute the image was seen to the left of the vertical cross- wire,
indicating a deflection to the west ; and this westei-ly movement continued

at a very nearly uniform rate during the whole time the gas was alight,
and also for about half an hour afterwards. Its velocity then rapidly
diminished, and after a quarter of an hour an easterly movement set in,
whose velocity soon became uniform and equal to that of the westerly
movement. The total westerly deflection of the mirror in. tlie first 2^
hours was equivalent to a tilt of 1^ seconds.

     The box was then placed resting with its longer side on the wooden

cover of the drain-pipe. Strings were tied to each end and brought

round by hooks to the telescope-seat, so that the box could be moved
backwards and forwards in front of the mirror-box and levelling-screws.
These were shielded by the box from the gas-jet, which was kept alight

for two hours (12.40 to 2.40 p.m.). In order to take the readings, the
box was drawn to one side for a few seconds and then replaced.
Readings were also continued for several hours after the gas was turned
down. The resulting curve is similar to that in fig. 6. It follows, there-
fore, that the first easterly movement which takes place after the gas is
lighted is caused by the expansion of the brass-tube more than by that

of the levelling-screws.

     It is evident from these experiments that the natural movements of

the pendulum in its present foi-m and position may be sei'iously affected

by the slight changes of temperature which take place in ordinary cellars.
To guard against these, Mr. H. Darwin proposes to alter the mode of
suspension of the mirror. The two hooks by which it hangs on the silver

wire will be placed in a line at right angles to the plane of the mirror.

The instrument will also be protected by a case, and perhaps by immersion
in water. For photographic registration, it would be better to use a
glow electric lamp, or, better still, an induction-coil spark, instead of a

continuously burning gas-jet.

   A few experiments were made on the bending of the cellar-floor by

means of a heavy weight, but without much success. This was due
partly to the tilting so caused being nearly or quite masked in the daily
movement of the mirror, partly because to move the weight I was obliged

to enter the cellar, and frequently approach close to the instrument. The'

heavy mass employed is about 84 lb., and consists of a part of the

cast-iron pipe of which the foundation is made. When it was placed

at successive distances of a toot, from 2 to 9 feet, nearly west of the
pendulum, the tilting of the column was inappreciable ; and this was also
ihe case when it was placed alternately at distances of 2 and 9 feet.
If, however, it was put alternately nearly west and east of the pendulum,
and close to the wooden cover of the drain-pipe, the tilting, though very
slight, was perceptible, and apparently in the direction away from the
heavy mass. For the reasons above stated, however, the results were
not altogether concordant, so that these experiments prove little more
than the nearly complete isolation of the stand.

   --Earth Pulsations of June 3 and 6, 1893. At 5.4.3 p.m. on June 3 the

image was, as usual, perfectly still, and was adjusted to the cross-wire
without difficulty. At 6.29, when I went to take the next reading, it was
marching slowly and steadily from side to side of the field of view. At
first I timed each separate oscillation, and found their period to be nearly
regular, and between 15 and 17 seconds in length. At this time the
range of movement was greatest, but it was impossible to determine its
amount exactly, owing to the shifting of the mean position of the image
produced by the heat of the gas-jet. The movement continued to be
considerable for about five minutes, then it gradually diminished, and by
6.37 was decidedly less, perhaps half that at 6.30. Between 6h. .35m. 15s.
and 6h. 37m. 40s. the image crossed the wire fourteen times, the average

period of the seven complete oscillations being therefore 20" 7 seconds.

At 6.42 the image had become steady again. I then tried to measure the

range of the movement when it was greatest from my recollection of the

average limiting positions of the image, and found the scale-value to be
0'44 inch, and the corresponding angular value about ^th of a second.

     At 6.46 the oscillations began again, and continued from this time
until 8.13, with a few short intervals, when they either ceased or were
almost imperceptible; but throughout this time the range was always
very small, never, I believe, exceeding a^^th of a second. The oscillations
were also more constant in range and in their mean position, so that the
range could be determined by making the image in each limiting position
coincide with the cross-wire. Between 6h. 48m. 40s. and 6h. 53m. 40s.
there were sixteen complete oscillations, giving an average period for
-each of 18'8 seconds. At 6. 56 the range was about -,}^Ji\l of a second, and
at 7.8 about ^'oth of a second. After this the oscillations became smaller,
and it could just be seen that the image was in motion. This continued
until just before 7.19, when the movement became greater again and
more regular. Between 7h. 19m. Os. and 7h. 25m. 43s. there were twenty
complete oscillations, the average period being 20'2 seconds ; and the
range immediately after the latter time was about ^Tyth of a second. Then
the oscillations again decreased, and at 7.36 the image was nearly steady,
occasionally being just visible on one side or other of the cross-wire.
Between 7h. 42m. 58s. and 7h. 45m. 50s. there wei'e five complete oscilla-
tions, but the movement was so slight that one or two of them may have
been missed. At 7'54 I left the cellar, returning about ten minutes later.
About 8.8 the last series of oscillations began. Between 8h. 8m. 15s. and
8h. 11m. 20s. ten complete oscillations were counted, the average period
being 18*5 seconds, and the range immediately afterwards was found to
be about yio^^ o^ ^ second. After 8.13, though I watched almost con-
ON EARTH TREMORS.  303

tinuously for two hours and a half, no further oscillations were percep-
tible, and the usual steady movement was resumed.

     Another series of pulsations was observed on June 6 at 7.21 a.m., and
lasting nearly an hour, but I was unable at this time to watch them

carefully. From 7.0 to 7.8 the image was perfectly steady. At 7.21,
when I went down to the cellar again, and for about ten minutes after-

wards, it was performing oscillations even more extensive than on the
previous occasion, but it was again not possible to measure the exact
range owing to the variable limiting positions. Between 7h. 32m. 25s.
and 7h. 35m. 22s. there were nine complete oscillations, the average
length being 19" 7 seconds. At the end of this interval the range had

decidedly diminished. At 7.45, from my recollection of the limiting
positions of the image, I found the maximum range to be about
^ second ; and I do not think this estimate can be much in error. By

7.55 the range had diminished to about -^ second (measured). At 8.7
the movement was almost imperceptible, and ten minutes later the image

was steady again.
      It is probable that these earth-pulsations were the dying-out vibrations

from some distant and severe earthquakes, but I have not been able to

identify them with any particular shocks. On May 23 a violent earth-

quake was felt at Thebes, in Greece, laying a great part of the city in
ruins, and it is stated that shocks were felt daily for some time afterwai'ds.

Some of these may possibly have produced the earth-pulsations observed

on June 3 and 6.

               Horizontal Pendulum of Dr. JE. von Rebeur-PascJiwitz.

     Dr. von B,ebeur-Paschwitz's horizontal pendulum is a modified form
of Professor Zollner's, which is described in the Report for 1881, pp.
112-114. The principal difference consists in the method of suspension
of the pendulum, the two stretched springs of Professor Zollner's instru-
ment being replaced by steel points working in agate cups, which allow
a nearly frictionless motion. In the following pages the pendulum used
by Dr. von Rebeur-Paschwitz is first described, and this is followed by
an account of the improvements suggested to him by the experience of
several years' work with the instrument.*

     The heavy cast-iron tripod-stand of the pendulum consists of a low
cylindrical vessel, on which, at equal distances apart, are three projec-
tions for the reception of the foot- screws, the whole being cast in one
piece. The cylinder is open at the top, and, after the instrument is
adjusted, is covered with a closely-fitting bell-glass. The screws have a
pitch of 0"36 mm., and are provided with large heads, so that a very small
change may be given by them to the level of the stand. The distance

between each pair of screws is 435 mm. Exactly half-way between two

of the foot-screws and opposite the third is an opening in the cylinder,

which is closed by a plano-concave lens, 75 mm. in diameter, and about

4"6 m. in focal length, the optical axis of the lens being horizontal and
directed towards the centre of the tripod-stand.^

     ' The pendulum is described in Dr. E. von Kebeur-Paschwitz's valuable memoir.
Das Horizontalpendel, &c., pp. 17-41. The suggested improvements are contained
in pp. 213-216 of the 8ame memoir, and also in letters to members of this Com-

mittee.

     * The lens is used for photographic registration ; for direct vision it is replaced
by a plane glast.
--304
REPORT 1893.

     The support of the pendulum (fig. 7) is arranged symmetrically with
respect to the diameter of the tripod-stand, which passes throuo-h the

third foot-screw. It consists of a strong rectangular frame, A, the plane

of which is parallel to the lens above mentioned (whose position is
shown by the circle in the figure), and is screwed to the base of the
tripod-stand behind the lens. It carries two horizontal cylinders, B, h,
one lying vertically over the othei', which can be turned round their
axes with considerable friction. In the middle of the cylinders are very
fine steel points, c,c (shown projecting upwards in the figure). These
are screwed to the cylinders, so that they are perpendicular to their

axes, and project only a little way from their surfaces. The vertical
distance between the axes of the cylinders is 68 mm.

                                                                    Ftg. 7.

     The pendulum is made completely of brass in the form of an isosceles

triangle (fig. 8). D, E, F are thin tubes ; H, a small weight attached at

the vertex of the triangle. At p and Q are two small spherical agate

cups, 2-5 mm. in radius, their centres being 68 mm. apart. The steel

points against which the cups rest also project from the axes of the
cylinders by 2-5 mm., so that in every position the points are perpendi-

cular to the tangent-planes to the cups. The rod, K, which projects per-
pendicularly from the tube, f, has a perforation, l, in the direction p q
for the reception of a knife-edge, on which the pendulum can be sus-
pended in a vertical position. Ji is a mirror which projects through the
    ON EARTH TKEMORS.  305

frame of the support, and can be rotated about the axis of a rod, N,
pai-allel to P Q. The weight of the whole pendulum is 42 grammes, and
the distance of the centre of gravity, G, from the axis of rotation is

100 mm.

     Immediately beneath the mirror, m, and in the same plane with it, a
fixed mirror, m' (fig. 7), is attached to the tripod-stand, and can be
rotated about a horizontal and vertical axis from outside the instrument.

     To adjust the pendulum the mirror, m, is fixed on the rod, N, so that

its surface is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the ti'iangle.

The centre of gravity, G, of the whole pendulum is next brought into
that axis by supporting the pendulum at two points of the axis, near
L and H, and by displacing the small weight, i. The cylinders, b, b, are

then rotated until the steel points are directed towards the agate cups,
and are parallel respectively to the lines G p and Q G. This can be done
with sufficient accuracy by the eye by applying a cardboard triangle of

the form gpq. When the pendulum is suspended the arrangement is

therefore such that the pressure is dii-ected perpendicularly to the cups,

and there is consequently no tendency to slip.

                                                                    Fig. 8.

is mounted on a small iron stand, whose position can be adjusted both
vertically and horizontally, and the stand is cemented to a pillar.

    By the side of the lamp is placed the recording apparatus. The

photographic paper is wrapped round a horizontal roller, 20 cm. long
and 56 i cm. in circumference, which is turned round with considerable
friction on its axis once in fifty hours, the paper being held fast to the
roller by two bars. Parallel to the roller, and at the same height as its
axis, is a cylindrical lens, 20 cm. long and 5 cm. in focal length. After
reflexion at the pendulum-mirror, M, and a double passage through the
lens in front of it, the pencil of light sent out from the slit is focussed by
the cylindrical lens to a fine point on the surface of the photographic

paper. An image is also formed by reflexion from the fixed mirror, m',

and, by rotation of that mirror, can be brought into any desired position.
This fixed point of light records a straight line on the photographic
paper, and is also used for marking the time, the light being shut ofl" for
five minutes at the beginning of each hour by a small screen moved by
the clockwork. The recording apparatus is mounted on a heavy cast-
iron plate, through which pass the cords of the weight and the pendulum
of the driving-clock. It is covered by a wooden box, closed at the top
by a lid, and having in front a horizontal slit for the passage of the light.
The lamp is changed twice a day ; and, two being used, a fresh one can
be inserted in the case by a slide without appreciable loss of time. Thus,

when once well adjusted, the working of the instrument requires very

--little attention.
     Suggested Alterations. The sensitiveness of a given horizontal pen-
dulum increases with its period of oscillation, and this is greater the
smaller the inclination of the axis to the vertical.' The difficulty of

obtaining and preserving very fine steel points therefore imposes a limit
to the sensitiveness of the instrument. In order to preservre the form of
the points, it is desirable that the pendulum should be as light as possible.

It should therefore be made of aluminium, whose specific gravity is about
Y'oths that of bi'ass. This woald at the same time reduce still further
the little friction that exists. The distance between the steel points might

also be increased with advantage to double its present valae, or even to
20 cm., without altering the distance of the centre of gravity from the

axis of rotation.

     The two lateral foot-screws should be removed and their places taken
by screws for adjusting the position of the lower of the two steel points.
The third foot-screw, which regulates the sensitiveness of the pendulum,
should also be replaced by a screw for adjusting the position of the upper

steel point. In the original instrument, if the parts of the foot-screws

projecting downwards are of unequal lengths, a temperature-correction

must be introduced ; but with the removal of the foot-screws this may

be rendered unnecessary.

     The head of the screw which regulates the position of the upper
steel point should be provided with divisions and an index, so that the

axis of rotation may be tilted through a known angle. The period of
oscillation (To) of the pendulum in a horizontal position of the axis may

then be determined indirectly as follows. If Tj and Tg be the periods of

    ' IE T,, be the period of oscillation when the axis is horizontal, T that when the
axis is inclined ot an angle, t, to the vertical, T= = T,,^ cosec i.
--

oscillation when the axis is inclined at angles t, and i^ to the vertical,
we have the following equations :

                    tan i (t2 + i,)=tan i {i.-i,) ^'' + ^% ,

Thus, T,, T2, and 12-- i\ being known, we can find i^, i^, and con-

sequently Tfl.

    When the point of light leaves the photographic paper, the pen-

dalum has to be readjusted by turning the foot-acrews. This always

                                                                    Fig. 9.

produces a certain change of stress, which it is desirable to avoid, espe-
cially as in some places the movement is so great that such corrections are

necessary every few days. By the employment of a ' correcting-mirror,'

which can be turned by screws, the point of light ca'n be brought back to
the middle of the roller by the observer without touching or approaching
the instrument. The arrangement will be evident from fig. 9.

     It would be a great advantage if the length of the roller used for the
photographic records were increased, and an arrangement devised for
displacing the roller in the direction of its axis, so that the same paper
could be used during two consecutive rotations. The rapidity of rota-

representation of the recorded movements.

of arranging two pendulums in perpendicular planes is shown in fig. 9.

Ai and A2 are the pendulums in the planes of the meridian and prime

at B, and returns after reflection along the same course. Cj and C2 are

the correcting-mirrors of the two pendulums, D a fixed mirror at right

pendulums, Tj and T2 screws for the lateral correction of the upper steel

by the employment of a single pendulum and fixed mirror. This greater

accuracy of registration would be of great advantage in investigations on

small movements such as are produced by the influence of the moon.

          Account of Observations made with the Horizontal Pendulum,
                           By Dr. E. ton Rebeur-Paschwitz.

     In reply to the invitation of tlie Committee to furnish an account
-of the results obtained by myself with the horizontal pendulum, I have
the pleasure of submitting the following outlines.

      In 1887, during some preliminary experiments with a rather roughly
constructed instrument at Karlsruhe, I noticed that the motions of a

horizontal pendulum placed in the E. W. plane in one of the cellars of the

Technische Hochschule wei'e sufficiently regular to permit the applica-

tion of continuous photographic registration. With few exceptions, the
 pendulum, though entirely at liberty to swing, when observed through a

telescojie from a distance of 4-^m. always appeared to be at rest. When

 this was not the case, the oscillations performed were generally very
 small, and so regular that it was easy to observe the elongations, and thus
obtain a very accurate value of the mean position of the pendulum. The
vibrations of the ground caused by traffic, which were sometimes voiy
 noticeable owing to the situation of the cellar next to one of the greatest
"thoroughfares of the town, never appeared to have any other eSect than
310 EEPOET-- 1893.

to produce a slight vertical swing of tlie miiTor attached to the end of the
pendulum. The position of equilibrium received no alteration -whatever.
After having placed the pendulum in the plane of the meridian, a

successful attempt was made to photograph its movements, the instru-
mental arrangement being very similar to that which is generally

employed in registering the variations of the magnetic elements.
     During the above observations, which only extended over a short

interval of time, a daily oscillation was the most important part of the
motions of the pendulum. I therefore employed the name of ' zero-
point ' for the mean position of the day, not expecting that at other
places the irregular movements of the zero-point would far exceed those

due to the daily period. The application of the word ' zero-point ' may thus

not appear very appropriate. I have, however, retained it during all the
further investigations in order to avoid confusion, and because the
character of the changes of the zero-point would not be better represented
if one were to speak of ' irregular ' or ' secular ' changes.

    In 1888 a grant from the Prussian Academy of Sciences allowed me
to undertake observations on a more extended scale. Two horizontal

pendulums, which have been in use up to the present time, were carefully
constructed by Messrs. Repsold, of Hamburg, whilst the necessary photo-
graphic apparatus was furnished by Mr. Wanschaff, of Berlin. In 1891
both instruments received small alterations, reference to which will be
made later on.

  --Ohservations at Potsdam and Wilhehnshaven. In November 1888 a

column was erected in a circular cellar situated below the east tower
of the Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam. One of the pendulums
was placed in it with its plane in the meridian, and was at first observed
by the aid of a telescope from a distance of 4'7m. Different degrees of
sensitiveness were given to the instrument in oi'der to study the regularity
of the motions. It was found during these trials that the period of
oscillation of the pendulum is very dependent on the magnitude of the
amplitude, even when the latter is quite within the limits which in an
ordinary pendulum ensure the isochronism of the oscillations. Later experi-
ments at Strassburg, which Professor Becker was kind enough to make

for me by using a chronograph, showed that the formula

                                   T=To + C.«,

in which C is a constant, represents the observed values of T in a
satisfactory way. The correction Ca is rather large when the period of

oscillation is great, and has to be taken account of if one wishes to
obtain an accurate value of Tq, which is the constant required for

reducing the observations. As it is impossible to make good observa-
tions of T when a is very small, a ought always to be observed at the
same time in order to be able to compute C and Tg.

     Further experiments were made to try the effect of weights deposited
in the neighbourhood of the column. Its foundation was about 90 cm.
below the floor of the cellar, and a ditch was left free round it. Notwith-
standing these precautions, a considerable tilting of the column of about
0""7 was caused, when a weight of 100 kilogrammes was moved from one

side of the ditch to the other. This tilting did not take place suddenly,
but required a considerable time, just as the soil did to recover its former
state after the pressure had been removed.

    When a person walked slowly round the space contained between the
ON EAETH TfiEMORS.  311

double circular wall of the cellar, whicli is a circle of about 6 m. diameter,
the corresponding motion of the pendulum was still distinctly visible.
This effect of pressure formed a simple means of setting the pendulum

swinging, when it was necessary to determine the period of oscillation.
      It follows from these observations that the neighbourhood of the

column carrying a horizontal pendulum ought to be guarded against
receiving any additional weights during the course of observations.

     On the other hand, it was observed that the turning of the dome

which covers the east tower of the observatory had no disturbing
influence on the horizontal position of the pendulum, though the vibra-
tions of the soil could be distinctly felt by the observer.

    An experiment was also made to mitigate certain effects of micro-

seismic movements. In the first days of February 1889 a strong gale
was blowing, and the pendulum was found to be in a very disturbed state.

When trying to photograph the curve a broad and very irregular band

was obtained, which showed that the pendulum was not only constantly
swinging, but that it was subject to certain small changes of the vertical.

A point was fixed to the free end of the pendulum pointing downward

into a dish containing a mixture of water and glycerine. Although the

point only just touched the liquid, the pendulum was now unable to

swing, but the slow motions of its plane of equilibrium took pjace as
before. Photographs were taken for about a fortnight, and a very

remarkable case of earth pulsations, to which I will refer later, was
observed during this period. But, unfortunately, I was obliged to
abolish the glycerine, because it was evident that the position of the
pendulum was influenced by certain molecular effects.

     After these preliminary experiments, observations were taken between
April 1 and June 6, and again from June 18 until the end of September
1889. The column and pendulum were protected by a strong wooden
box nailed with tinfoil, which also covered the ditch and only contained a
small window, through which the light passed, and through which it was
possible to get at the foot-screws of the pendulum. The photographic
apparatus and lamp stood in a passage connecting the cellar with another
one lying to the north of the former, and were separated by a door, which
was also nailed with tinfoil and had two slits for the light to pass. This

door was only opened when it became necessary to bring the light point
back to the middle of the drum. On such occasions a thermometer
hanging near the column was read, and the same was done in the adjoin-
ing passage every other day when the paper was changed. During the
summer the temperature of the passage in which the lamp was burning
constantly was generally 1° or 2° C. higher than that of the cellar. The
door connecting the passage with the cellar to the north of it was only
opened twice every day, when the lamps or the paper had to be changed.

     At Wilhelmshaven the horizontal pendulum stood in a cellar of the
Imj)erial Naval Observatory, whilst the rest of the apparatus was placed
in an adjoining cellar lying to the south of the first. Openings were
made in the wall to let the light pass. All arrangements were very similar

to those described for Potsdam. Professor Boergen, the director of the
observatory, and his former assistant. Dr. Eschenhagen, very kindly
undertook to do all the work connected with the observations, and these

were carried on from March 7 until October 5. Amongst the several
difiiculties which at first presented themselves, and caused several inter-
ruptions of the observations, the most serious arose from the excessive
312 EEPORT-- 1893,

moisture of the air in these cellars. The slightest difference of tempera-

ture was sufficient to produce dew on the glasses, and for a long time

during the months of May and June, when the temperature of the air

was rising quickly, observations became quite impossible.

   --Observations at Puerto Orotava, Teneriffe. The third station where I

was able to try the horizontal pendulum was at Puerto Orotava, on the

island of Teneriffe. The Spanish houses in this country do not have any

underground cellars, but through the kindness of an English lady, Mrs.

C. Smith, the widow of a well-known resident of the Canary Islands,

a small chemical laboratory on her grounds, which had been empty

for many years, was placed at my disposal. The estate bears the name

' Sitio del Pardo,' and is well known to all English visitors of the place,

many of whom may have noticed the little laboratory, because it is

covei'ed with a most beautiful specimen of a white creeping rose. The

Sitio occupies the eastern flanks of an old lava stream, which runs from

the Montaueta de la Horca to the north towards the sea, and forms a

platform above the Puerto on which a large hotel is now built.

The nature of the volcanic soil did not allow a similar foundation for

the instrument as was offered by the cellars at Potsdam and Wilhelms-

haven. Instead of making a hole into the ground I preferred to erect it

on the cemented floor of the little laboratory, which is on the same level

with the outer grounds, with the exception of the east side, where the

ground is higher.

The little building, the direction of which very nearly agrees with the

magnetic meridian, is divided into two rooms, of which the one to the

south was used to place the hoi-izontal pendulum, whilst the one to the

Anorth was reserved for the photographic apparatus.                              door leading from

the former into the garden was closed by masonry work, and another

one connecting the two rooms received only the necessary openings for

the light to pass. Thus the pendulum was guarded as much as possible

against all disturbances. Observations were begun on December 26, 1890,

and continued without any interruption until April 27. Much trouble

arose from the bad quality of the petroleum. The lamps, which had

burned fourteen hours and more at the first two stations, had to be con-
stantly watched, and many hours of observation were lost. This, however,

was of no importance for the final reduction of the observations, because

the extreme regularity of the motions of the pendulum at this station

always permitted the gaps to be filled up by interpolation.

The following paper, ' Das Horizontalpendel und seine Anwendung

zur Beobachtung der absoluten und relativen Richtungsanderungen der

Lothlinie,' · contains all the readings taken from the photographic curves

by the aid of a glass scale.

                              Results.

A preliminary study of the fir.st two sets of observations shows that

the investigation might be divided as follows: I. The influence of the

moon                          II. The daily oscillation and its changes ;  III.  The motion of  the
                           ;

zero-point ; IV. Seismological phenomena and others of a more incidental

character.

  --I. The Influence of the Moon. Since Professor G. H. Darwin and his

brother, Mr. Horace Darwin, made their well-known experiments at the

                              ' Nova Acta der Mis. Leap. Carol. Acad. Is. Nr. 1.
--

ON EARTH TREMORS.  313

Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, no observer is likely to expect much
from a short series of observations, however complete it may be, for the

demonstration of gravitational or tidal efiFects of the moon. Holding this

view, I was much surprised to find, when first inspecting the photographs,
that in the curves obtained at Wilhelmshaven a lunar wave was distinctly

visible, which produced a decided change in the general aspect of the

curves in different phases of the moon. This led me to make a careful

reduction, with the object of finding a lunar wave in all the three sets of

observations. The final results of this investigation I have lately pub-
lished in No. 3169 of the ' Astronomische Nachrichten.' But as it re-
quired a good deal of calculation before the conclusions there given were
arrived at, it may be useful to say a few words about the way in which
the influence of the moon has been determined.

   We owe to Professor Darwin the evaluation of the principal effects

the moon may produce on the solid earth, apart from the well-known

deflections of the plumb-line due to the tidal forces of the moon. All
these different indirect and direct lunar influences form a complex pheno-

menon, the general forms of which have to be ascertained before one may

try to analyse it. The first object of our investigation, therefore, is to
find whether the observations require the assumption of a lunar wave,

what is its form and its position referred to the meridian passage of the
moon, and how the size of the wave varies with the declination of the

moon.
     The problem is apparently identical with the problem of the ocean

tides, if, instead of the heights of the water, the ordinates of the curves

are introduced. The same method might therefore be employed which
was indicated by Professor Darwin and Professor Boergen for the reduc-
tion of the ocean tides. But there is this difference between tidal obser-

vations and observations of the plumb-line, that in the former the principal
changes in the height of the water are due to the attraction of the sun

and moon, the mean level remaining very nearly constant, whilst in the
latter the changes due to solar and lunar influence are extremelij small
compared with the periodical changes which arise from thermal effects
and the very marked variations of the mean daily position of the plumb-
line. Thus the principal difficulty in reducing a set of observations with
the object of determining the lunar influence is to eliminate as much as

possible the zero-point and the daily period.
     The following is a very simple method for eliminating the zero-

point, which I constantly employed in determining the mean daily oscil-

lation of a group of days. It gives very satisfactory results provided
that care be taken to exclude such days on which the motion of the zero-
point is too irregular to admit the assumption of a simple mathematical

formula.

      If /o, /i, . . ./23 is a series of twenty-four equidistant values, which in
the present case would represent the means of a number of single readings
of the curves, it is always possible, when the readings form an uninterrupted

series, to add to those twenty-four values the following six: f_^, /_2,
J-\i · · fa, /26» /26. the meaning of which is clear from the sufiBxes

given. These thirty values may be represented with sufficient accuracy

by the following formula :

zero-point and P all periodical changes. The period being twenty -four

     If the lunar wave be of any importance the harmonic elements of

the daily period as deduced from observations in different phases of the

moon will show certain regular changes. But as the daily period is in

itself very variable, and depends on the radiation of the sun at the place of
observation, these latter changes must be entirely eliminated before the
changes produced by the superposition of the lunar wave can be distinctly

recognised.

    Judging from my own experiments, I believe that the variation of the

daily period, which is due to meteorological changes, forms the most serious
obstacle to this investigation. The gravitational deflections of the plumb-
line are large enough to be discovered by the horizontal pendulum But
it requires a very long set of observations to reduce the meteorological
effects sufiiciently in the mean results to make the former visible.

    In my investigation contained in No. 3169 of the ' Astr. Nachr.' I

have availed myself of the three sets of observations, containing 159,
161, and 123 days respectively, of twenty-four readings each.' For each

day the time of the upper meridian passage of the moon was taken from
the almanac, and groups were formed of those days for which C agrees

withni one hour. Thus, each set of observations was divided into twenty-

four groups. weIf distinguish these by the letters a, b, c, d, . . ., a, for
instance, contained all days with C between hours minutes and 1 hour

  minutes ; d, all days with C between 3 hours minutes and 4 hours

   minutes; and so on. I then proceeded to form other groups by taking

+the means ^ (a+h + c), ^ +(b c d), . . . &c. This was done because the

number of days contained in each set of observations was too small to
eliminate in a satisfactory manner the irregularities of the cui-ves.

     The twenty-four sets of twenty-four mean hourly values each were
now treated as described above, the values of /3 and y were calculated, and

the necessary corrections applied, so as to obtain the purely periodical part

Pp of the observations. From the resulting numbers, the harmonic con-

stants a, b were computed, supposing the daily oscillation to be repre-
sented by the expression

+ +«, cos t biSint + a^ cos 2t + 7/., cos 2t +a^ cos ^t + h.^ sin 3/ -I- rr , cos 4^ h^ sin it,

Ain which t is either Greenwich mean time or local time.  deflection of

the plumb-line to the east of its normal position is considered as positive.

In deducing the constants a, b account had to be taken of the process of

forming gi-oups, certain enlarging factors being applied, as is done in th©

rednotion of tides.

    When these results had been obtained it immediately appeared that

all the constants down to the smallest terms presented more or less con-
siderable periodic changes. The following table contains two examples,
one showing the coefficients of the first harmonic term for Potsdam *

+(a, cos ^ 61 sin i), the second those of the second term for Wilhelms-
+haven - (a2 cos 2^ 62 sin 2t).

motion is on an average very nearly proportional to either the quantity of

sunshine or the maximum oscillation of the temperature during the day.

Though one might expect that in a series of observations of more than
half a year's length, grouped in such a regular way as here, meteorological
effects would be sufficiently eliminated, this is really not the case. In
comparing the meteorological data with the results mentioned above, it
was found that the first class of periodical changes can be explained to a
great extent by meteorological changes.

     The best way to avoid these disturbing influences would be to place
the horizontal pendulum in the bottom of a mine, where the effects of
meteorological changes are reduced to a minimum whilst, as far as we
may judge, the lunar effects must remain the same as on the surface of

the earth.

     Since every periodical change in the coefficients a, h can be considered
as the combined effect of changes of the first and second kind, it is im-

possible to decide in the cases of the two stations at Potsdam and Puerto

Orotava, where the effects of temperature appear to be especially strong,

Wewhich part is due to the first, and which to the second, cause.  must

content ourselves with the following result : The comparison of the ob-

served temperatures with the harmonic constants of the daily oscillation
shows that the former play an important part in producing periodical

variations in the latter. But, on the other hand, there is some evidence

of the existence of a small lunar wave in both places, amounting to 0"'01,

or probably more. I do not hesitate to express the opinion that if it had
been possible to continue the observations through a longer interval of

time, and thus to eliminate the effects of temperature, a more positive

result would have been obtained.

In a former investigation,^ in which I employed the nsual method of

tide reduction without having regard to the motion of the zero-point and

the variation of the daily period, numerical values of a supposed semi-

diurnal wave caused by the moon have been computed. These values

agreed pretty well with the formula representing the ordinary gravita-

tional deflections of the plumb-line, for whilst we flnd the semi-diurnal
wave to be

    + 0"-0142 cos (2i-247°-5) and -l-0"-0128cos (2i-228°-5)

for Potsdam and Puerto Orotava respectively, the formula of deflection

are :

            + 0"-0099 cos (2^-270°) and +0"-0142 cos (2<-270°).

     Until further researches have been made, it seems advisable not to

place too much confidence in these numbers, though it is not impossible,
from the way in which they were computed, that they represent a near

approach to the real values.

     Whilst we now see that the observations obtained at Potsdam and at
Orotava were insufficient to demonstrate the effects of the moon on the

plumb-line, the third series of observations at Wilhelmshaven, as might be
expected after the preliminary investigation mentioned above, led to a
positive result of some interest. It will be shown later on that at Wil-
helmshaven, though the range of the daily oscillation is extremely

variable, there does not exist such a clear relation between it and the

            · See Bos Horizontal^endel, &c. pp. 87-104.

meteorological phenomena as in the two former cases. In consequence
the effect of variability of the daily period is much better eliminated, and
it makes little difference if, in computing the hmar terms, one takea

account of it or not.

     The following expression was deduced by a simple transformation
from the original valaes of a, b, after expressing each of the eight series
as an harmonic function of C. The form in which it is given is, of course,
entirely empirical. Thus the changes in the coefficients, which here
depend on C, in reality probably depend on the declination of the moon.
All uncertain terms I have suppressed, and only retain those the exist-
ence of which is demanded by the observations.

In comparing the above expression with the lunar term computed by the
fii'st simpler method, which is

                                  45-4 cos (2<-20-345°7),

it is seen that it contains a nearly identical term. Considering this alone,

we find that it represents a semi-diurnal deflection of the plumb-line, the

eastern excursion of which takes place on an average a little more than

half an hour before the meridian passage of the moon, or about 1^ hour

before high water. The observatory lies on the west side of the Fahde-

busen, at a distance of about 200 m. from high- water mark, whilst the

station for tidal observations is a good deal more to the south, at the

entrance of the harbour. Accordingly the semi-diurnal terna might be ex-

plained in a pretty satisfactory way by the pressure of the tides, which on

an average rise to a height of 3^ m. at Wilhelmshaven. This would certainly

be a very strong effect of tidal depression compared with the theoretical

results obtained by Professor Darwin in his researches ; bat as the soil is
of a marshy character, and apparently very elastic, such an effect would

not appear impossible.

The present results, however, seem to tell against such an explana-

tion                      for, if  it were  the  tides  that  produce  by their  pressure  the  lunar

terms, a close connection between these and the form of the tides ought

to be established, which is not the case. In fact, the very large term of

the first order, which is perhaps the best determined of all, and which is

all the more remarkable, because, according to our computation, it changes

the sign, reminds one of the corresponding lunar tide, which, though

playing an important part in many places in the world, is comparatively

small on the coasts of Germany.

It seems advisable to postpone a discussion of the above facts until

farther observations undertaken at some suitable place shall have placed

them beyond doubt. Perhaps few places in the world would offer a better

its enormous variations of the water-level.

     The following formula expresses, in the same unit as above, the ordi-
nary lunar deflection of the plumb-line ; and it will be remarked that the
latter is very small compared with the observed deflections :

     The pier of the meridian circle rises from a mass of sand, which
forms the subsoil of the marshy ground round Wilhelmshaven, down to
a depth of moi-e than 250 m. The walls of the observatory as well as the
column of the pendulum have their foundation in a layer of clay of
2 m. or 3 m. thickness, which is divided from the sand by a layer of
turf-like material, about 1 m. thick. Perhaps, if one does not prefer to
attach no importance to the indications of the water level when treating

of so small angular quantities, we may conclude from the above result

that only the upper layer of clay, which presses on the elastic turf, par-

--takes of the oscillation.
      III. The Motion of the Zero-point. l^ext to the daily oscillation a par-
ticular interest is attached to the motion of the zero-point, for by studying

it we may hope to learn something about the slow secular changes which
we know take place constantly all over the earth, though the number

of places is small where they are noticeable to the eye within a small in-
terval of time. For this purpose it is desirable to have an uninterrupted
series of observations, or at least, where interruptions are unavoidable,
as will probably always be the case with such a delicate instrument, to
determine by other means as well as possible the motion of the zero-point

during the interval.
     I have pointed out before that the present observations, with the

exception of those made at Puerto Orotava, are incomplete in this
respect, for they were interrupted once in June, and at Wilhelmshaven
many days were missed in May. Notwithstanding, some results of
interest have been gathered. The daily oscillation having been deter-
mined, two numbers were interpolated from the readings for every day,
corresponding to the moments when the periodical deflection is equal to
zero, and curves were drawn and compared with the curves of tempera-

ture and barometric pressure.'

     (1) At Wilhelmshaven a remarkably strong effect is produced by the

changes in the barometer. When the pressure increases the pendulum

moves towards the east, thus indicating a sinking of the soil in the same

direction, and a change of 1 mm. in the former corresponds with a change

of 0"-29 in the direction of the plumb-line. Apparently both changes
take place .simultaneously, or, if the changes in the position of the pen-
dulum lag behind those of barometric pressure, the difference must be

very small.

     Thus, the horizontal pendulum in this particular case acts as a most
delicate barometer, and might be used as such if it were not subject to
other influences. As the atmospheric pressure presents a daily oscilla-

tion, it is necessary in discussing the daily period of the plumb-line to

take the former into account.

     (2) The correspondence between the pendulum and the barometer is
most pronounced when the mean temperature remains pretty constant
during a number of days, but with sudden changes of temperature the
effect of the latter is seen to prevail over the former. From all the

' See the reproduction of a part of these curves in my paper, Bas Horizontal-

pendel, &c.

observations, it was concluded by a careful investigation that at Wilhelms-
haven a rise of temperature of only 1° C. produces exactly the double
effect which is caused by an increase of barometric pressure of 1 mm.,
viz., a motion of 0"-58 towards the east.

Thus it is seen that, when these two meteorological agents happen by

chance to act in the same sense, very considerable deflections of the

plunib-line are produced at "Wilhelmshaven, which, in case they should not

be limited to the upper layers of the ground, would not escape detec-

tion at an astronomical observatory where regular observations are

taken.

    A(8) similar investigation led to the following results for Potsdam.

Barometric pressure appears to have no effect whatever on the position
of the pendulum at this place. But a rise of temperature of 1° C. pro-

duces a deflection of 0"-16 towards the east. This latter constant is

again determined witli considerable accuracy, the result of thirty-eight

days in April and May being 0"-18, whilst fifty-seven days of the later

period give the value 0"'15.

(4) At Puerto Orotava the meteorological effects are small, but they

pi-esent a particular interest. They are not so easily noticed as in the two

former cases, where to see them 'it is sufficient to look at the diagrams.

Nevertheless they exist, and the following values could be deduced by

Aproperly grouping the observations.  change of -f-1 mm. in barometric

pressure causes a deflection of 0"-0309 of the plumb-line to the west, and

a change of -|-1° C. in temperature a deflection of 0"-0362 to the east.
     The effect of barometric pressure is especially interesting, because,

from the description of the locality given above, it may be gathered that

it could be accounted for by the counteraction of volcanic forces, which

undoubtedly are still active inside the Pico de Teyde. If it is allowable
to draw any conclusions from the intervals of time in which during the

latest centuries volcanic action has shown itself on the outskirts of this
famous mountain, the time would now have arrived when the inhabitants
might be prepared to see another of those outbursts. It is not improbable

that, before an eruption takes place, the whole mass might show an

inclination to yield to variations of external pressure. And this is really
the case, for Puerto Orotava is situated on theKKB. flank of the cone, at
a distance of about 18 kilometres; thus, when the external pressure

diminishes, the slope of the mountain is increased, and a horizontal
pendulum placed as it was at Orotava ought to move towards the east.

     (5) It is interesting to compare the effects of temperature, which we
have now found to exist, with each other as well as with the daily oscil-

lation. If we divide the mean values of the latter by the mean corre-

sponding values of the maximum oscillation of temperature, we obtain the

--following table, which corresponds throughout with a change of 1° C. :
                            --

         ON EARTH TREMORS.  323

to add that in the present investigation no account has been taken of a
purely local effect of temperature which is caused by a difference in th«
length of the two foot-screws east and west of the pendulum. If they
are not equally long, a change of temperature will produce a small tilt of
the instrument. This, however, would only be noticeable in the motion
of the zero-point, for the daily change of temperature in the cellars was
practically zero. But also in the former it would only account for a small
motion, such as, for instance, was found for Orotava. Considering the
dimensions of the instruments, I find that a difference of temperature of
1° C. produces a tilt of 0"'0164 multiplied by the difference in the length
of the screws expressed in millimetres. The surface of the column

which carries the pendulum ought therefore to be made as neai'ly hori-
zontal as possible, supposing the instrument to possess an entirely sym-

metrical form.

     (6) Besides those changes which we have until now considered, and

which by the nature of their causes can never surpass certain limits, the
zero-point is subject to others of particular interest, which are probably

due to geological causes, viz., the slow folding of the earth's crust. By

the aid of the diagrams drawn I have tried to fill out the gaps in the
observations, and to construct curves which represent approximately the
motion of the zero- point, corrected for temperature and barometric pres-
sure, during the whole period of observation. Starting from an arbitrary
zero, I have obtained the following values, in which an increase indicates
a motion towards the east, corresponding to a tilt in the same direction :

Potsdam
324 REPORT-- 1893.

    At Wilhelmshaven, where from other reasons one might have expected
a larger motion, the latter is really comparatively small. Two very dis-
tinct waves present themselves in the diagrams, both causing maximum
excursions to the east on April 30 and on August 14. But on the average
the mean position of the pendulum remained pretty constant. This fact
is of some importance, considering that the column at Wilhelmshaven
had also been constructed five months before the commencement of the
observations, and that the heavy moisture of the cellar would in that case
csrtainly retard the process of drying. Thus it is not likely that the
strong motion which took place at Potsdam during the first month ought

to be ascribed to this cause.

      This conclusion would, however, not be justified in the third case, for

when observing at Puerto Orotava circumstances did not permit me to
lose so much time. If the considerable inclination of the column towards
the west during the first month be ascribed to the drying process, the
general motion of the zero-point is of a very simple form, and may be

explained by a slow tilt towards the east.
     It is only natural to suppose that all modern geological changes in the

island of Tenerifie emanate from the Peak as a centre. If this is true, the

observed tilt might be the consequence of a slow elevation of the island,
which would gradually increase the slope of the lower jiarts of the
mountain, and would find an end when the internal forces should again

succeed in breaking themselves a way through one of the weaker parts of

its flanks.

    When considering the interest which is attached to the Canary Islands

and the Pico de Teyde, especially in the history of volcanic theories, the
foregoing remarks, though only founded on a short series of observations,
will suflBce to indicate the service which might be rendered to geological
science by observing two horizontal pendulums during a sufficiently long
interval of time on opposite sides of the mountain cone. Places like
Icod de los Vinos, on the north side of the island, and Guimar, on the
south side, are probably to be recommended most, for not only do they offer
the comfort which is desii-able for a longer sojourn, but the surrounding
country is so full of interest as to form a most magnificent object for

scientific study of the most varied kind.

   --IV. Seismological Phenomena and Others. Some time before writing

this account I drew up a paper containing all observations on seismo-
logical phenomena obtained by myself, and lately by Professor Kortazzi at

Nicolaiew, up to May 1893. This paper is not yet printed, but will soon

be published in ' Petermann's Mittheilungen.' ' As it is impossible to enter
much into details here, I must refer the reader to this paper. Respecting
the phenomena of earth pulsations and other remarkable movements of
the earth's surface I am in a similar position, for another paper on these,
which is illustrated by figures representing some of the most curious

portions of the photographs, is about to be published in the ' Astronomische

 Nachrichten.' ^ In order to avoid repetition I shall in the following re-

marks include all that may as yet be said about the later observations at

 Strassbnrar, as far as it refers to the obiect of this section.

      The horizontal pendulum, besides constantly indicating the position
of the plumb-line in relation to the surrounding objects on the earth's sur-
face, affords an excellent means of controlling the momentary state of the

soil. Tbis, like the surface of a lake, is sometimes at rest, and at other

times subject to undulations and vibrations, which have received the

general name of mioroseismic movements. The horizontal pendulum in

its present foi'm ofi'ers the same difficulty which is often felt by earth-

quake observers, viz., that it is often impossible to say whether the dis-

turbances visible on the curves have been produced by vibrations setting

the pendulum swinging, or by a repeated tilting. The latter, when ib

takes place slowly, and when the period of the tilt does not coincide with

that of  the  pendulum,  would  only produce  deflections                                                 but as all micro-
                                                                                                       ;

seismic movement appears to be very complicated and variable, probably

deflections and swinging of the pendulum generally act together. Thus

we may explain the great variety of figures which are seen on the photo-

graphs and sometimes extend over several hours, thereby indicating that

earthquake motion, when it travels over large distances, spreads out more

and more on account of the difference in the rate of propagation. It is

well to remember hereby that in a few cases in which the effect of distant

eartliquakes was observed by astronomers, when they were occupied with

the levels of their instruments, the motion was nearly always seen to be

of an undulatory character, whilst at the centre of an earthquake vibratory

horizontal motion generally prevails.

  --(1) Ohservations of Earthquakes. The comparison of the curves ob-

tained simultaneously first at Potsdam and Wilhelm shaven, and later at

Strassburg and Nicolaiew, has shown that a very large percentage of the

observed disturbances was common to both places. In fact, it is a com-

paratively rare occurrence that when an earthquake figure, however

small, appears on one of the photographs, it is not equally visible on the

other. It often happens that the curves are not sufficiently distinct,

owing to variations in the intensity and figure of the light-point and

faults in the paper, or when a general microseismic movement is more

pronounced at one of the stations than at the othex. In such cases

small disturbances may at first escape detection, but are often found

when notice is given from the other station.

The difference of time is well marked in many cases during the

observations in 1892-93, whilst in 1889 the distance was too small, con-

sidering the uncertainty connected with the readings. The distance

between Strassburg and Nicolaiew is nearly 2,000 kilometres, and yet

many of the observed disturbances appear to have lost none of their

Weintensity in passing over this distance.    are thus quite justified in

expecting that strong earthquakes will be observed by the horizontal

pendulum, wherever their centre may be on the earth. Of course it is

quite possible that the conditions for propagation are more favourable in

certain places than in others, and that, for instance, earth-waves travel

more easily across continents than when they have to pass over broad

oceanic tracts.

The publication of the entire list of nearly 200 disturbances will, I

hope, lead to establish a greater number of relations between some of

these and observed earthquakes than I have yet been able to find.

Nevertheless, amongst the latter there are some cases of great interest,

of which I mention the following : the Japanese earthquakes of Tokio,
April 17, 1889, and of Kumamoto, July 28, 1889; the earthquakes of
Wjernoje (Central Asia), July 12, 1889, and of Patras in Greece,
August 25, 1889; the earthquake of San Francisco, April 19, 1892;

several of the Zante earthquakes, and the great Levant earthquake

which took place in the town of Malatia on February 9, 1893.
326 REPORT-- 1893.

As it is impossible here to desci-ibe all these cases in detail I refer

to the above paper                                                                                                       only this may be mentioned, that in  the  case  of the
                                                                                                                      ;

great earthquake of Kumamoto two disturbances were observed, wliich

exactly agree with the supposition that the earthquake-wave travelled

round both sides of the globe with a velocity of 23 kilometres per

second.

     The time of a shock as obtained by this method is always rather un-
certain for two reasons. The first is tliat, owing to the slow rate of tbe

motion of the paper, which was 11 mm. per hour, the readings may be

2 or 3 minutes in error ; the second, that a shock very rarely begins
suddenly, but is generally preceded by smaller movements of the ground,

which make it impossible to decide wliich is the beginning of the eaith-

quake. In such cases, however, I have sometimes found the figures of
a disturbance to show remarkable coincidences. Thus, by comparing

the moments of sudden increase of motion at the two stations, which

occur in nearly every earthquake, several determinations of the difierence

of time may be obtained, the mean of which is affected by a smaller

probable error than a single determination.

     The velocities of propagation obtained from the above-mentioned
observations vary between 2 and 5 kilometres per second, which, how.
ever uncertain the single values may be, confirms the view that it is

impossible to speak of a constant of velocity in the distant propagation ot
earthquakes.

    If the first observations with the horizontal pendulum leave much to

be desired with respect to their application to the study of earthquakes,

they certainly show what might be done if only a small number ot

stations, well distributed all over the earth, were organised. It would
be a great satisfaction to the writer if this account should help to excite
an interest for the establishment of at least one such station in the far
West, say in the western part of the United States or Canada, and
another in the far East, in Japan, or rather in some other country

which is less subject to the eflFects of local earthquakes. "We may safely

predict that the comparison of horizontal pendulum curves obtained at
two such stations, with those at an intermediate European station, would
lead to most interesting results, not only from a seismological point of
view, but also with respect to the determination of the modulus of
elasticity of the upper strata of the earth. If, with this special object in

view, one should not lay any value on observing at the same time the

deflections of the plumb-line, the horizontal pendulum might be much

simplified, and perhaps an improved form of Milne's ' tromometer ' or

conical pendulum, when furnished with sufiiciently fine connections,
would be the cheapest and simplest instrument. The rate of the paper
ought to be much increased, and this could be done without raising the
expense, for it would not be necessary to employ a veiy high degree of
sensitiveness, the deflections of the pendulum would thus be reduced, and
a narrow strip of paper would be sufiicient where a broad sheet is now

required.

   --(2) Earth Fulsations. Earth pulsations, consisting of long, flat

waves, somewhat like the swell of the ocean, were for the first time
observed by myself at Potsdam on February 11, 1889. Owing to the

application of glycerine, as described above, the pendulum could not
swing, and a sharp black line was drawn by the light-point. The instru-
ment had been adjusted in the afternoon, but in consequence of some
ON EARTH TBEMORS.  327

after-effect the light-point Tvas slowly travelling across the paper. At
7 P.M. waves begin to be visible, which are beautifully distinct between
8.44 and 10.40. The mean period of a wave is about 9 minutes, and
the average range is 0"'l. The motion disappears gradually, and the

curve soon reassumes its ordinary appearance as a dark line of uniform

breadth.

     This is the only case in which earth pulsations were distinctly ob-
served during the experiments in 1889. The curves at Wilhelmshaven
certainly present very large irregularities, and systems of waves of all
sorts of periods, from a few minutes up to nearly one hour, appear ; but
all these disturbances bear a more irregular character. At Potsdam,
again, the light-jaoint was rather large, and consequently a broad line was

drawn, and it may be that this was the reason why no trace of earth
pulsations was ever noticed again, for, when the waves are small, the

light-point must not be beyond a certain size in order that the waves

may be visible. 1 may mention, however, that the curves which I ob-
tained when the glycerine arrangement was still in use showed traces
of pulsations on many days. The borders of the black line have the

appearance of a zigzag, like the teeth of a saw, a tooth on one side

corresponding with an interval between two teeth on the other. Thus,

it is quite possible that, for the sake of representing such motions as

earth pulsations, it would be useful to damp the swing of the pendulum

in order to avoid the effect of other microseismic movements, which cause
the pendulum to oscillate, and thereby help to increase the breadth of

the curves.

    On January 5, 1890, earth pulsations first appeared on a photograph
taken at Orotava. The period of the waves is much smaller than in the

case described above, and they are so close together that it requires a
magnifying glass to distinguish and to count them. Beginning at
6.37 A.M., 103 half- oscillations are distinctly seen, which are extremely

regular as far as the period is concerned, which is 45 seconds, or 1^
minute for a complete oscillation. The range of motion is variable, and
it is easily recognised that several systems of waves are superimposed on
each other. The total range of motion is about 0"'15 on an average.
Afterwards the waves are less distinct ; larger deflections interfere and

destroy the regularity.

     Soon after this observation 1 heard of some curious phenomena that
had been observed at Madeira. The sea had risen and fallen at short
intervals on the south coast, whilst on the Desertas Islands large land-
slips had occurred which caused the breakage of a cable in the neighbour-

hood. When examining more closely the times of observation, I found

that there was certainly no direct connection between these phenomena
and the disturbance observed at Orotava on Januarv 5.

     Later on it appeared that the latter was not at all extraordinary, for
on many days similar disturbances were observed, always at the same
time of the day, viz., the time in which the pendulum is in its western

elongation. On many days it was possible to count a few waves, but

with one exception they were too close together to allow such a detailed
investigation to be made as on January 5. This happened on April 7
when thirteen waves, with a period a little more than 7^ minutes each,
appeared on the photograph, nearly as distinct as in the case observed
at Potsdam. It is interesting to note that, on the system of these
 waves, which have a range of 0"'07, other smaller waves are visible,
328 EEPOKT-- 1893.

the period of which is nearly the same as the period of the waves on
January 5.

      Amongst the fifty-two days which show traces of this cuinous pheno-
menon during the time between 5 a.m. and noon, there are several on
which it appears developed into a large disturbance of the character of
an earthquake. Whether this is a chance coincidence, and earthquake
waves really happened to pass over Teneriffe so often during the same

time of the day, is a question which, of course, cannot be answered with

certainty. But it is much more probable to suppose that it was only

the intensity of the motion, in which these days differed from others,
like January 5 and April 7. Thus, if I bad possessed the means for ob-
serving real tilts, and not the swing of the pendulum on those days,
probably very large deflections would have been noted.

     It is very interesting to find that this phenomenon bears such a

decidedly local character at Orotava, for it never occurs at other times of

the day than in the early morning and forenoon. It generally begins
at a time when there is yet no trace of wind in the lower parts of the

island, though this circumstance may not appear of much importance,
because from many comparisons made it is nearly certain that the wind

exercises no influence whatever over the pendulum. The idea naturally
presents itself that the causes which produce the daily oscillation might
also be the reason why a certain period of the day is especially favourable

to the formation of earth pulsations. If the daily period be the effect of
a general motion of the ground, its condition of stress might vary, thus
affording the internal forces a better chance of producing such an effect
during one part of the day than during the other.

     I now turn to the description of some cases of earth pulsations lately

observed at Strassburg, but, as the observations are not yet finished,
I should like the following remarks to be considered as provisional only.

During the whole summer of 1892 photographs were taken, but never
did a trace of parth pulsations appear on them. The lines were not as
clear as I wished them to be, yet it was easily seen that in a general way
the pendulum was remarkably steady compared with what had been
noticed at the former stations. About the middle of October a slight
change was made in the lamp, which only produced a very insignificant

difference in the appearance of the curve.

    On October 19 earth pulsations suddenly appeared, such as had never

been seen before. The appearance of the curve is as follows vw^v^ and
is due to the imperfect figure of the light-point, which, instead of being

a small circle, has an oblong shape, with its axis a little inclined, thus

causing one branch of each wave to be more marked than the other.
This shows how important it is that the point of light should be as small
and as regular in shape as possible. During an interval of nearly ten

hours I counted about 200 successive waves, the duration of each being
nearly three minutes. At first the period of the waves was a little larger,
viz., 3 minutes 19 seconds, whilst towards the end it had gradually dimin-
ished to 2 minutes 43 seconds. The amplitude was a little less than tj'tt*!'
of a second, and remained constant throughout, thus giving the zigzag line
an extremely regular appearance.

    A very similar and yet more remarkable series of earth pulsations was

observed on December 22, when more than 300 waves were counted within
a period a little shorter than on October 19. Besides these two cases many
others occurred when the number of waves was smaller. The mean
                             ON EAETH TREMORS.                      329

period could always be accurately determined by counting the number of

the waves within the space of a lew hours, and a period of a little less than

three minutes was found in most cases. But it is evident that this is not

a constant, for occasionally waves with longer periods are observed, and

again in some parts of the curve the borders show traces of waves of very

short period, like a fine fringe.

The size of these waves is always about the same as above, and they

present no such variations as in Puerto Orotava. They generally are

visible during several succeeding hours, but often, too, a portion of the

curve, which is as undisturbed as a straight line, is broken by a short

series of waves.

     Towards the end of the winter these earth pulsations seem [to have

again entirely disappeared. No change of any kind was made in the

instrumental arrangements, and the curves are quite as distinct as before.

Perhaps a more careful inspection, which will be made when the observa-

tions have come to a close, will show traces where they have now been

overlooked ; but certainly nothing like the two cases mentioned above has

occurred during the last four or five months.

At Tokio Professor Milne has observed earth pulsations, which differ

from the above, because their period is only a few seconds. But in a

photograph which he has lately sent me I find a zigzag line of quite the

same form as described above ; thus it is certain that waves of longer

period occur in Japan also.

    The study of earth pulsations may prove to be of importance for
many branches of scientific research. For instance, they may explain

some curious discrepancies which are occasionally noticed in astrono-

mical observations. If it should be found by future observations that

waves representing an angular value of a few tenths of a second are a

frequent occurrence, astronomers will be forced to take them into account,

and will no longer be able to rely on the present method of determining

the level in all delicate researches.
--A(3) Earth Tremors.
                             third appearance of interest in the curves is

what is generally called earth tremors. Perhaps they are nothing else

than earth pulsations of short period, but I prefer to think that they are

principally due to the swinging of the pendulum, produced by small

vibrations and pulsations, which now increase and now again retard its

motion. Such tremors generally last many hours, and sometimes days,

and the curve, which is often like a dark black line drawn by a ruling pen,

takes the appearance of a succession of small earthquake figures. When

roughly comparing the results obtained at Potsdam and Wilhelmshaven, I

found that strong tremors were nearly always observed at both places

simultaneously, and that they bear a relation to the force of the wind. When

strong wind is blowing tremors may always be expected to occur, and

sometimes they appear to outrace the wind, for they are also noticed in

calm weather w^hen there is wind at a distance. The intensity of tremors

is not always proportional to the strength of the wind. No systematical

comparison, however, has yet been made, because of the many interrup-

tions at Wilhelmshaven and the short duration of the observations.

At Puerto Orotava tremors were quite insignificant ; in fact, there is

scarcely a trace of them, except during the hours when earth pulsations

occur. This is all the more remarkable because heavy winds are con-

stantly blowing against the high mountain chain in the island, but per-

haps they would have been more noticeable if observations had been
330 REPORT-- 1893.

taken in the east-west plane, and not in the plane of the meridian,

which is nearly at right angles with the mountains and the coast line.

For this reason, perhaps, no effect was either noticed of the heavy surf

which is for ever beating against the rocky coast.

At Strassbnrg tremors were also found to be considerably smaller than

at either of the first two stations. During the warmer season the light-

point appears to be much more steady than in winter, and altogether

Astrong tremors are a rare occuri'ence.                                       special investigation will be

made when the observations have come to an end.

For an investigation of the earth pulsations and tremors little only can

be done with the present arrangement of the apparatus, which only offers

a means of studying the statistics of these phenomena. It is necessary to

use quickly moving paper and plates and a highly sensitive pendulum in

order to make the details visible. As the soil is often perfectly steady

through long intervals of time, to avoid taking useless photographs a

telescope ought to be added, through which it is possible to see whether

the pendulum is at rest or not.

   --(4) Sudden Deflections of the Fendulum. I have already mentioned

that the curves at Wilhelmshaven are so full of irregularities that some

parts may be compared with declination photographs of magnetic storms.

But whilst these are seen more or less every day, the following disturbances

are amongst the rarest occurrences.

    On April 9, 1889, at 6.36 p.m., the light-point at Potsdam suddenly

travelled through 8^ mm., which is equal to a deflection of 0"'34

of the plumb-line towards the west, thus forming the following figure

It is evident that this deflection was not instantaneous.

for if it had been so, the curve would have appeared broken, the second
part beginning with swings, as is the case whenever a deflection of the
pendulum is caused artificiallj^ But here there is no trace of swinging,
and the dark appearance of the line joining the two parts of the curve is a
proof that the light-point moved sufiiciently slowly to leave an impression
on the paper.

    Many small deflections are seen on other days at Potsdam as well as
at Wilhelmshaven. Amongst those observed at the latter place the

most important took place at 11 a.m. on August 9, and at 6.30 p.m.
on September 24. They are similar to the case described above, but the
line which joins the two parts of the curve is not so well marked, and

the following figure is formed                                                .W-L · -^iiother remarkable case

was observed at Puerto Orotava on February 2, soon after 9 p.m., the

figure being as follows  ^^/^^^                                               The angular value of the deflec-

tion is 0""17, but in this case it lasted 1 hour 20 minutes before the light-

point had gained its new position, and the middle part of the figure is

just as dark as the rest.
      Whilst the above deflections were permanent, passing deflections

occurred at Wilhelmshaven, and were especially marked on July 12
at 7 a.m., and on September 12 at 6 p.m. In the latter case the

following figure  ' |/^ appears, and the deflection is equal to an

angle of not mnch less than one second in the direction of the plumb-line.

At Strassburg no strong deflections of a similar kind were noted

except during some earthquakes and when observations were made at

the transit circle, which is borne by the column to which the pendulum

is attached. These disturbances must be ascribed to vibrations of the

pillar, which are produced either by the earthquakes or by the observer

knocking against it, and which cause a slight change in the connection

between the pivots and agate cups of the pendulum. It remains, however,

to be explained why these displacements so often accompany earth-

quakes at Strassburg, whilst they were never noticed at any one of the

first three stations, although earth quake- motion of probably equal strength

was frequently observed there. Besides, it is remarkable that once when

a piece of iron was driven into the pillar on the side opposite to where th&

pendulum was placed, thus causing very considerable vibrations, the dis-

placement of the light-point was not larger than that which accompanied

one of the earthquakes.

   --Observations at Strassburg. When I returned from Tenerifle I wa»

anxious to continue the observations, but being myself unable to look

after the instrument I sent it to Professor Kortazzi, who wished to try it

at the Imperial Naval Observatory at Nicolaiew, and has been taking

observations in difierent positions of the pendulum since the spring ot

last year. At the same time I applied to Professor Becker, the Director
of the Strassburg Observatory, who very kindly oflered to take charge of

the other instrument which had remained at Wilhelmshaven and to place-

it in one of the cellars of the observatory.

Before this was done the pendulum passed through the hands of

Messrs. Eepsold. It received new pivots, and the plane mirrors, which I

had used before, were replaced by concave silvered glass nairrors of nearly

1 m. focal distance. In making this change I followed the advice of Dr.

Eschenhagen at Potsdam, who had obtained beautifully sharp curves with

Athese mirrors.   circular mirror was cut in two, and one half was

ground down as much as possible to reduce its weight. But through this

process the focal length was slightly changed, and when the two halves

were afterwards placed one over the other it was impossible to make the
two reflected points of light equally sharp. At first the silvered surface

was soon spoiled through the moisture, but when the mirrors had been

resilvered and the ordinary precautions were taken to dry the air inside
the pendulum box, this difficulty was removed, and the same mirrors have

been in use without interruption since last July. Though the curvea

obtained at Strassburg are certainly finer than the older ones, I am not

sure that the same result might not be obtained by using the ordinary

plane mirrors if these were silvered on the front side. Besides it must be-
remembered that the distance between the mirror and the photographia

paper had to be reduced to more than one-half of the former distance,
which alone ensures a sharper image, and that it is very difficult to make
two such mirrors with exactly the same focal length when the latter is

large.

In placing the instrument it was considered to be of special interest to

attach it to one of the large pillars of the observatory. The pillar of the

transit circle was selected and a stone table fixed into it on its east side^

because I wished to take observations in tbe east- west plane. The lamp

and photographic apparatus are mounted on wooden tables, and the dis-

tance between the pendulum mirror and the drum is a little less

than 2 m. The necessary preparations were made in November 1891,

but regular observations did not begin until April 1892. At first
many intei-ruptions occurred owing to the extraordinary motions of

the zero-point, which caused me to discontinue the observations for a few

Adays at the beginning of May.  second interruption occurred in June,

because it was necessary to have the mirrors resilvered ; but since July 18

last until now the instrument has been in good working order, and only

on two occasions the continuity of the observations is broken by sudden

motions, which caused the light- point to travel beyond the borders of the

paper before it could be noticed at the usual control. To finish the

account of the instrumental arrangement, I have to add that since

November paper from the manufactories of Dr. Stolze in Charlottenburg

has been used instead of Morgan and Kidd's paper, and that a great im-

provement has thus been obtained owing to its much greater sensitiveness.

For the details respecting the first part of the observations between

April 4 and September 18, 1892, I refer to the ' Astronomisclie

Nanhrichten,' No. 3147. The discussion of the later observations, to-

gether with a general investigation, has been deferred until later,

because it is intended to continue the series up to the beginning of

·September. For this reason I am unable here to give definite results,

and shall only mention what may be of use to other observers.

The daily period is much smaller than it was found when the pendu-

lum was placed in the meridian, but it is well pronounced, and, to judge

from the aspect of the curves alone, it decreases much in winter.

During the winter months it entirely disappears on some days. The

same fact has been communicated to me as observed at Nicclaiew by

Professor Kortazzi. The diagram representing the daily change is much

like the one which I found from one day's eye observations at Karlsruhe

in 1887, and forty-eight days' observations at Nicolaiew in 1892 give a

similar result. The following numbers I extract from the ' Astronomische

+Nachrichten,' denoting a deflection towards the north :

     The general form of the true oscillation of the plumb-line is probably
very nearly represented by an ellipse whose large axis lies between the
two directions E.W. and N.W.-S.E.

     The daily oscillation of the pendulum at Strassburg is quite insig-
nificant when compared with the enormous changes of the zero-point.

During the first fortnight, when a change of 1 mm. in the position of the

light-point was equivalent to a deflection of 0"'027 of the plumb-line, the
pendulum was moving towards the north. Between April 4 and 18 it
travelled through G"'4,' when it stopped, and a southward motion began,
which was very considerable during the whole of last summer, for the

followino: angles were described :

Between April 18 and May 5                 -- 143G (motion south)

                                           - 7-34

The same motion continued with a varying rate and occasional

stoppings during the rest of the year ]892 and the beginning of 1893.

The total angular displacement is probably very nearly 2 minutes when

the intervals are taken into account during which observations were

missed. Since the early months of this year a reaction seems to have

taken place, for a slow northerly motion has commenced, and now and

then the pendulum remains in very nearly the same position during

several days. I believe that the extraordinary motion of the pendulum,

which far exceeds anything one could have expected beforehand, con-

--sidering its favourable foundation, is due to two causes a very con-

siderable tilt of the column from the north to the south and a large

annual oscillation which augments the southerly motion during the later

part and retards it during the earlier part of the year.

If the tilting is due to a general motion of the ground it must afiect

the meridian circle, which is at a short distance to the east of the transit

Ainstrument.  comparison will be made as soon as the nadir observa-

tions are available. In November 1892 Professor Becker had a water

level attached to the other side of the pillar, which was read twice a day.

As it is a well-known fact that water-levels are not very reliable for this

sort of observations, it will not be surprising to hear that the readings

of the level, although they agree in a general way with the motion of the

pendulum, differ from it in many details.

The temperature of the cellar is read twice a day because it is subject

to considerable variations. Owing to the form of the building of the

meridian circle, in which the instruments are placed one storey high,,

the cellars below the observing rooms are not underground, and in

winter during the severe cold the temperature fell below zero (C),

An effect of temperature is certainly indicated, and will require a careful

examination.

It may be mentioned that the pillar which carries the transit instru-

ment, and to which the pendulum is attached, is not massive throughout.

A horizontal section through the middle of it presents the following

figure M-^. The cylindrical mantel stands on the same foundation as the

middle part, and is probably rigidly connected with it in its lower and

motion of a vertical pendulum is always meant.

upper parts. If one considers these circumstances it does not appear
improbable tliat the pendnlam might be affected by temperature in a

different way from the level on the other side.
     The large motion of the pendulum is felt as a great drawback when

it is necessary to give it a high degree of sensitiveness, because it re-

quires a constant watching of the light-point in order to make the
necessary corrections before it leaves the paper. But another difficulty
arises, because when a strong motion of the pillar takes place in the

N. S. direction it is only natural to suppose a similar motion to take

place in the E. W. direction, which must cause a perpetual change in the

scale value.

     During the observations at Strassburg the period of the pendulum

was observed every now and then, and as it had not varied much at
first, observations were taken at longer intervals afterwards. On
May 10, however, when a new determination was made by Professor

Becker with the chronograph, it was found that the period, which had
been 12*4 seconds (one-half swing) before, had risen to 17'4> seconds,
which indicates that either the pillar had been tilted considerably from
the west to the east, or that a sudden displacement of the pendulum must
have taken place, perhaps during one of the earthquake-shocks, the effects
of which were mentioned above.

     Should other observers try the horizontal pendulum they may gather

from the above that it is almost necessary to use a double pendulum for
observing both components of the deflections, and that arrangements
should be made to determine the period of oscillation at short intervals
whenever a strong motion of the zero-point is indicated.

    Dnring the winter a curious fact was communicated to me by Pro-

fessor Kortazzi. In trying to explain the motion of the zero-point he
had placed a hygrograph in the cellar with the pendulum, and found
that the pendulum was decidedly influenced by the relative moisture of

the air in the cellar, for the diagrams were much like each other. In a
letter to me he expressed the following opinion. The column which
carried the pendulum had been piled up of large loose stones without

mortar or cement in order to be able to begin the observations without
the loss of time caused by the drying process. The ground of the cellar
being perfectly dry, it appears that the stone behaved like a sponge,
drawing in the moisture contained in the air more or less, and thereby
causing a change in the inclination of the instrument. I have lately
heard from Professor Kortazzi that the effect of moisture disappeared

almost entirely when the openings through which the cellar communi-
cated with others were closed, and the pillar was covered with a water-

proof material.

It is evident that if this cause has a considerable effect at Nicolaiew,

it could only have been of secondary importance at the other stations.

At Wilhelmshaven, for instance, the relative moisture of the air was

probably always 100 per cent. It is necessary, however, to consider this

agent also, and to take the necessary precautions in order either to avoid

Aor to eliminate its effect as much as possible in the final results.  dry

and wet bulb thermometer have therefore been placed in the cellar at

Strassburg, and are read twice every day.'

    ' It may be useful to mention that observations with two horizontal pendulums,
exactly like the one used by myself, are now being made by Prof, Lewitzky at

Charkow.

ON THE ACTION OF MAGNETISM ON LIGHT.

 The Action of Magnetism on Light ; with a critical correlation of

     the varioxLS theories of Light-propagation. By Joseph Larmor,

      M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S., Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.

             [A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed
                                             among the Reports.]

                           Part I. Magnetic Action on Light.

                                     Discovery of Magnetic Rotation.

1. The redaction of light and heat, and of electrical phenomena, to a
common cause has been a cardinal subject of physical speculation from
the earliest times. More recently Oersted ' fully persuaded himself, on
somewhat wider knowledge of fact, ' that beat and light are the result of
the electric conflict,' and saw in his great discovery of the gyratory
action of an electric current on a magnet the explanation of the phenomena
classed under the name of polarisation of light. But it was reserved for
Faraday to make the first eifective entrance into this domain of know-

ledge.

     2. After failure in 1834 to discover any direct relation between light
and static electi'ification, and after repeated attempts in other directions,
he at length discovered" the fact that when plane polarised light is passed
through a transparent body along the direction of lines of magnetic force,
its plane of polarisation undergoes rotation by a specific amount character-

istic of the medium traversed. He thus succeeded ' in magnetising and

electrifying a ray of light, and in illuminating a magnetic line of force.'
After observing that when the ray is oblique to the lines of magnetic
force it is the component of the force in the direction of the ray which
appears to be effective in producing the rotation (a law which has since

been exactly verified by Verdet and more recently by Dn Bois), he proceeds
to inquire into the condition of the active medium with the following

results :

     ' 2171. I cannot as yet find that the heavy glass when in this state,
i.e., with magnetic lines of force passing through it, exhibits any increased

degree, or has any specific magneto-inductive action of the recognised
kind. I have placed it in large quantities, and in different positions,
between magnets and magnetic needles, having at the time very delicate
methods of appreciating any difierence between it and air, but can find

none.

     '2172. Using water, alcohol, mercury, and other fluids contained in
very large delicate thermometer-shaped vessels, I could not discover that
any difference in volume occurred when the magnetic curves passed
through them.'

     The rotation was in general right-handed with respect to the magnetic
force; and in the case of (2165) ' bodies which have a rotative power of
their own, as is the case with oil of turpentine, sugar, tartaric acid, tar-
trates, etc., the effect of the magnetic foi'ce is to add to, or subtract from,
their specific force, according as the natural rotation and that induced by

    ' Hans Christian Oersted, Exjjerimenta circa Effect urn cojiflictiis Electrioi inAcum

the magnetism is riglit or left handed.' (2187.) ' In all these cases tbe
superinduced magnetic rotation was according to the general law, and
without reference to the previous power of the body.'

      Further on, after describing the diversity of the effect in different

media, and its usually small amount in crystals, he adds :
     ' 2182. With some degree of curiosity and hope, I put gold-leaf into

the magnetic lines, but could perceive no effect. Considering the extremely
small dimensions of the length of the path of the polarised ray in it, any
positive result was hardly to be expected.'

     The powerful rotation discovered long after by Kundt, with films of

iron, will here be called to mind.
      Repeated trials with various transparent media gave no effect of lines of

electro-static force on a ray of polarised light, propagated either along

them or at right angles to them. An effect in this case has been detected

by Kerr long after, but presented itself as a change in the elasticity, pro-
ducing double refraction, and entirely devoid of rotational character.

     ' 2224. The magnetic forces do not act on the ray of light directly
and without the intervention of matter, but through the mediation of the
substance in which they and the ray have a simultaneous existence.'

     Any such changes of internal constitution of media must of necessity

(2226) ' belong also to opaque bodies : for as diamagnetics there is no
distinction between them and those which are transparent. The degree

of transparency can, at the utmost, in this respect only make a distinction

between the individuals of a class.'
      After pointing out (2230) that this is ' the first time that the molecular

condition of a body, required to produce the circular polarisation of
light, has been artificially given,' and is, on that account also, worthy of
minute study, Faraday proceeds to draw out in very clear and striking
contrast the distinction between the natural undirected rotatory property
of liquids like turpentine, and the magnetic property which is related to
the direction of the lines of force, as well as the distinction between the
latter and the axial but undirected rotatory power of quartz.

     This brief resume of the topics treated in Fai'aday's memoir will be of
interest as indicating how thoroughly he probed the problem, and how
much his ideas were on the lines of the subsequent development of the

subject.

                      Mathematical Representations of the Phenomena.

     3. The rotation of the plane of polarisation in quartz and other sub-
stances had already been explained by Fresnel as depending on the two
principles, (i) that the vibrations which can be propagated without change
of form as they proceed are for these substances circular (or it may be
elliptical), and (ii) that the velocity of propagation is different according
as the vibration runs along in the manner of a right-handed or a left-
handed screw-motion. It had also been shown by MacCullagh ' how
such properties might be deduced from equations of vibration modified
by the insertion of small terms involving (d/dzy, where z is the direction

of propagation.

      Soon after Faraday's discovery of magnetic rotation, Airy ^ pointed
out the different modifications of the equations of vibration that would
similarly account for the existence of the magnetic rotation.

    We may in fact develope a complete and compact account of the

matter, as follows. The equations for the displacements in a circular

transverse vibration, propagated along the axis of z, are

                  -- --u= A cos (nt ez), w^Asin (nt ez) ·

for a given value of z these equations represent a circular vibration in the

Weplane of xy, and this is propagated in spiral fashion as a wave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      may

very conveniently combine the two equations into one by use of the vector

&=H + tv to represent the displacement, thus obtaining the form

As this vibration is propagated without change, the equation of propaga-
tion must be linear in 3-, therefore of the form

The terms in P involve higher differential coefficients, and are necessary

in order that the two values of e corresponding to a given value of n
may not be equal except as to sign, in other words in order that right-

handed and left-handed waves of the same period may be propagated at
different speeds. To ensure this result, P must contain terms of odd

order  in  the  differential                                                                     coefficients                                                  if there were  only                                                                                                            terms  of even

order, it would still lead to an equation for the square of e, and so would

represent ordinary dispersion without the rotational property.

can tabulate possible rotational terms as follows 1

     4. The first direct dynamical investigation bearing on tbe subject is

by Lord Kelvin.' He points out that the elastic reaction of a homo-

geneously strained solid has a character essentially devoid of all helicoidal

and of all dipolar asymmetry. It therefore follows that the helicoidal

rotation of the plane of polarisation by quartz, turpentine, etc., must be

due to elastic reactions dependent on the heterogeneity of the strain

through the space of a wave.

Then with regard to the magnetic or unipolar rotation the well-

known paragraph occurs, quoted by Maxwell ('Treatise,' § 831) as 'an
exceedingly important remark,' of which his own theory of molecular

vortices, and also its outcome, the conception of the working model

which led to the electric theory of light, is an expansion. On reversing

the light the magnetic rotation is not reversed : therefore it depends on

some outside influence of a vector character, exerted on the system

which transmits the light. This influence makes the free period of a

circular motion differ, according as it rotates in one direction or the

opposite one. If the purely elastic forces maintaining the motion are

supposed similar in the two cases, it will follow that ' the laminiferous

circular motions are only components of the whole motion.' There

must be another dynamical system present, linked with the one which

transmits the light, and possessing motion of rotation round the lines of

magnetic force, or some other motion directed with respect to those

lines ; and the kinetic reaction between these two systems will account

for the magnetic rotation.

The influence which is exerted on the free periods of a vibrating

system by linking it on to another system which is in rotation may be

illustrated by some dynamical problems. If the angular velocity of the

rotating system is supposed to be maintained constant, such illustrations

Weadmit of comparatively simple analytical treatment.  can determine

the change produced by the rotation in the free period of the original
system. If that system is one member of a chain or solid continuum,

we can deduce the velocity of propagation of waves of given length from

a knowledge of this change of period ; for it is the velocity which would

Acarry the undulation over a wave-length in the free period.  typical

example of this kind, which is treated in the paper, is the motion of a

Blackburn's pendulum, suspended from a horizontal bar which is made

to spin round a vertical axis with angular velocity w. The equations of

motion are

     The rotation in such a case as this becomes dominant ; a plane oscil-
lation now subsists, but will rotate steadily round the axis with angular

--velocity ^(" p), which is the slower the greater the velocity w with

which the horizontal arm is carried round.

    These results may be extended to any rotating system with two

transverse principal periods. Thus for the case of a long stretched cord,
or a long rod, rotating round its own length with an angular velocity w
which is very great compared with either of its natural transverse fre-
quencies (2tt/1)~^ and {2Tr/m)~-, the period of vibration of a wave of
given type on the rotating cord will be changed to

                                                27r / 1 X" \-i

and the angle of rotation of its plane of polarisation, during propagation
through a wave-length, will be

                                                                                    ttX*

this rotation being in the same direction as the angular velocity u>.

    Again, this aeolotropic cord may have imposed on it such a (slight)
rate of twist that a very long plane wave, made helicoidal by the rota-

tion w, will just be straightened out again by this twist, as it progresses

along the cord, the natural period being still practically unaltered. From

this remark it follows that 'the effect of a twist amounting to one turn

in a length s, a small fraction of the wave-length, is to cause the plane

of vibration of a wave to turn round with the forward propagation of

                                                                                n*

direction as the imposed twist.

axial rotation of quartz                                                                                                                            while a medium filled with spiral arrangements,

like the second but devoid of special orientation, represents the rotation

of turpentine. The mode of passing directly in this illustration from

the efiect of spin to the effect of helical structure produced by twist

is noteworthy.

The subject of a vibrating chain loaded with gyrostats, having their

axes all along it, is considered by Lord Kelvin in a later paper : ' and the

general behaviour, as to propagation of waves, of a chain loaded with

gyrostats which are orientated in any orderly manner with respect to it,

has also been developed.^

     5. The use of the term of type k^ to explain magnetic rotation was

arrived at by Maxwell ' by the help of a provisional theory of molecular

vortices, in which it occurs as standing for the reaction of a vortical

motion of the medium representing its magnetisation, when that motion

is disturbed by the light- vibrations passing through it.

   A very full examination has been made by Verdet ^ of the manner in

which the constant of magnetic rotation (hence called Verdet's constant)

depends on the direction of the ray with regard to the magnetic force, on

the refractive power of the medium, on the dispersive power of the

medium, and in the same medium on the wave-length of the light. The

Durotation comes out, as has since been verified in detail by                                                            Bois, to be

proportional simply to the component of the magnetic force along the

ray. Media of great refractive power have in general high magnetic
rotatory power. For the same medium the product of the rotatory

power and the square of the wave-length is nearly constant, but always

increases slightly with the index of refraction ; media of great dispersive
power have in general also high rotatory dispersion.

     Verdet's most important piece of work is, however, a precise comparison

of his experimental numbers for different wave-lengths with the results of

a mathematical formula adapted to express both ordinary dispersion and

the magnetic rotation according to Maxwell's theory. He assumes

Cauchy's form of the ordinary dispersion terms, and so obtains equations

equivalent to

from which is derived (Maxwell, 'Treatise,' §§ 828-830) the formula

connecting 0, the rotation, with m, a specific constant for the medium
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

The comparison with experiment leads to agreement within the possible

errors of observation (Maxwell, loc. cit.) for the case of bisulphide of

carbon, but for the ordinary creosote of commerce the agreement is not
so good. The fact that creosote is a chemically complex substance, or

rather a mixture of diSerent substances, may be of influence here.

    A coefficient of the type k2 leads also to the general law of proportion-

ality to the inverse square of the wave-length, but does not correspond
nearly so well in detail as k, ; a coefficient of the type k-^ (C. Neumann's)

must be rejected altogether.
     It is to be borne in mind that it is only in substances with regular

dispersion that Cauchy's dispersive terms can be taken to represent the

facts ; whereas the />2 rotatory term is, as we have seen, related to a free

period of some kind in the system, and therefore to abnormal dispersion.

     6. The considerations just given bring together evidence of various
kinds, that for ordinary media the ^2 rotatory term is to be taken as very
subordinate to the k^ term. Using the k^ term alone, the equations of
propagation of a wave travelling along the lines of magnetic force (now
leaving out dispersion) will be of the form

                         dt^ dz"^ ^ dzHt'

                         ^d^~°' dz^ "'d^dt

Let us now attempt to deduce general equations of propagation along

any direction. These clearly must involve three constants k^, k^, k^ pre-

portional to the components of the magnetic field along the axes of co-

ordinates. For they must lead to the experimental law that the rotation

for any direction of the wave is proportional to the component in that

direction of the intensity of the magnetic field; in particular this law

must be satisfied for the directions of the axes of coordinates. Further,

the vibrations may be assumed to remain purely transverse, so that we

must  have  no  compression  of the  medium                                    and       therefore the        condition

other direction, which may be taken as the new axes of z, is proportional

to the component of the magnetic field in that direction, as they ought

to do.

     Not only so, but Verdet's law requires that the equations shall be
expressible in terms of invariants of the three vectors

independently of particular axes of coordinates. Hence P^., Pj,, P. must
be so expressible ; and they must be the components of a vector, of the
first degree in the first and third of the above vectors, of the second
degree in the remaining one. The invariants which can enter are simply
the geometrical relations of the figure formed by the above three vectors
drawn as rays from an origin. The only possible forms are the scalars

     This expression for P,. with the correlative ones for P,, and P^ is the
most general form which the magnetic terms can assume in an isotropic
medium, independently of any condition of exact transversality of the

Nvibrations: transversality requires in addition that L and shall be null.

     The equations of vibration of an elastic medium loaded with spinning

molecular gyrostats, whose axes follow the rotations of the elements
of the medium, have been formed, ' and it is of interest to observe that

Nthe rotatory terms come under this special type for which L, are null

as well as G. The reason is clear : the action of the gyrostats depends
solely on the rotations of the elements of the medium, while the terms

Ninvolving L and have no rotational character.

      7. Before application of these magneto-optic terms to problems of

reflexion at a magnet, the type of the unmodified equations of propagation
of light, to which they are to be added, must first be settled. The form
of these equations which gives most satisfactory results for reflexion at
the interface separating transparent media is (equivalent partially to Lord
Kelvin's labile fether theory) expressed most simply both as to bodily
equations and as to boundary conditions by the principles of the electro-
magnetic theory of light ; and it has been shown that the introduction of

electric conducting quality into these equations gives a tolerable account

of the phenomena of metallic reflexion.^ It is therefore natural to add on
these rotatory terms to the equations of the electro-magnetic theory, and to
try to explain the phenomena of magnetic reflexion by their aid, with the
boundary conditions appropriate to that theory. This is what has been
done in all attempts that have had any success ; though there is room for
diversity in the electrical basis which has to be supplied for the rotational

terms.

theory, the energy of this medium is made up of the kinetic or electro-
magnetic part T, and the static part W, where in Maxwell's notation, dr

being an element of volume,

                              T=i[(aa + 6/3 + cy)c?r,

          W=||(P/+Q^+R;Odr;

and there is also in our problem to be added on another small term,
Maxwell's hypothetical magneto-optic part T'.

    Now the dynamical equations of any medium or system are most

fundamentally expressed as the conditions that the characteristic function
of Lagrange and Hamilton

should be stationary for a given time of motion from any one definite
configuration to another, subject to whatever restraints the coordinates
have to obey. This form is the most fundamental, because the processes
of the Calculus of Variations are purely analytical, and quite independent

of whatever specifying quantities we may choose in order to represent the

+state of the system, the only condition being that the function T T'--

is to be expressed in terms of a sufficient number of measures of configura-
tion and their first diSerential coefficients with respect to the time, and

is to be of the second degree as regards these differential coefficients.

     In order to obtain such an expression Fitz Gerald proposes to treat

(a, /3, y) as velocities corresponding to coordinates (I, j/j C), so that

                           («,/3,y)=|(sS»/,0,

    Now from the bodily equations we deduce at once

                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

therefore X is mathematically the potential function of a mass-distribution
on the interlaces only, and so is continuous across them. It follows that

the only way of securing the required continuity at an interface is (i) to
postulate that r] and lif are continuous across it, owing to the continuous

structure of the svstem, and that therefore --- and --- are also continuous

else that \ is null all over it. The alternative taken in Maxwell's electro-
dynamics is that \ is null everywhere in the field, as in fact representing
no observed physical phenomenon ; then the boundary conditions are
four, that the tangential components of the magnetic force are continu-
ous, as also the tangential components of the electric force.

     Since (£, f), H) is the magnetic force, the displacement of the medium,
as represented by the vector (I, rj, Q, is in the plane of polarisation of
plane-polarised light : by representing it by some function of (£, t], ^),

e.g., its curl, we conld have it at right angles to this plane, as in Fresnel's

work.
      This quantity X is not introduced in FitzGerald's analysis of the pro-

blem of ordinary crystalline refraction. As the results of the discussion of
propagation and reflexion show, any motion propagated in a medium,
homogeneous or heterogeneous, whose dynamical properties are determined
by the above characteristic function, is effectively of a compressionless
character, and there is no necessity to introduce a restriction to that
type. But the case becomes different when magneto-optic terms are
added to the energy-function.

     9. FitzGerald goes on to assume, after Maxwell's theory of molecular
vortices, that the magneto-optic part of the energy is of the form

                              JUe dt de dt do dtj '

where --- denotes differentiation along the lines of imposed magnetic

force                          but on working out the variation of the characteristic function, he
                            ;

finds a difBculty about satisfying all the equations of condition at an

interface. This may, I think, be got over by introducing the undeter-

mined multiplier X of the above analysis into the variation, and so taking

into account a certain condensational tendency which is originated at

the interface, and propagated throughout the medium with very great

velocity. There also remains for settlement the question whether the

energy represented by T' is correctly localised by its formula, or whether

it involves superficial components, in addition to the bodily distribution

in Maxwell's vortex theory, from which it is taken, it has been transformed

by integration by parts. So long as this doubt remains we shall not be

in a position to demonstrate boundary conditions by this method.

    A chief interest, at the present date, of FitzGerald's paper, lies in the

application of the method of Least Action to deduce the equations of a
dielectric medium from the expression for its energy alone. This method

would not be available for a medium which is the seat of viscous forces ; ·
consequently the equations for a conducting medium would have to be

derived from those of a dielectric by the empirical introduction of appro-

priate terms to represent the viscosity. It is, in fact, clear that the scien-

tific method, in forming a dynamical theory, is to restrict it in the first

instance to systems in which the interaction of stress and motion has free

play, without the interference with its results that is produced by fric-

tional agencies. The subject of the reduction of the equations of electro-

dynamics into the domain of the general principle of Least Action has

recently been treated by von Helmholtz.

10. The second of the questions raised above will now be examined.

The magneto-optic energy must in reality be localised in space and not

on surfaces ; and it is of interest to inquire what is the most general

formula that can be given for it which will lead to terms of the accepted

type in the equations of motion. If we take a term in the variational

These expressions may combine into complete variations of terms of any

of the types            ^d^d4 ^

                                                                    d^

Now the term in the energy which comes from the linking of the optical

with the magnetic motion should be of the first degree as regards the

velocities of  each of  them                             and  it  may involve                                  linear   and  angular  dis-

Of these the first combines together the angular distortion of the medium,
the velocity representing the motion in the magnetic field, and the rate
of change of the velocity of the medium in the direction of that motion;
while the second combines the s^piv of the medium with the velocity in
the magnetic field. It would be difficult to assign a physical basis to the
former on either a dynamical or an electric theory ; and thus we are
confined on our premisses to Maxwell's form as giving correctly the

localisation of the magneto-optic part of the energy. This dynamical

     11. To discuss the first question it will be convenient to reproduce
the main lines of FitzGerald's analysis, with however the introduction
of the new terms involving X, the origin of which has been already
explained. The variational equation of the motion is

is a function of (a;, y, z), analogous to a hydrostatic pressure in a
dynamical theory, and to be determined afterwards as circumstances
dictate. The variation is conducted in the ordinary manner ; and of the

final result the term involving oE, is here explicitly set down, for the

special case of an isotropic medium for which

From them comes y2\= 0, showing that \ is mathematically the potential

function of a mass-distribution on the interfaces only, and so does not
appear at all in an infinite homogeneous medium.

     The interfacial conditions are most easily expressed by taking for the

instant the axis of z at right angles to the element of surface considered.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

The following expression must then be continuous across the interface in

order that the surface integral may be null :

               lK\dz dxj                                                                                                                                                                            dddt                  ^

     It appeai-s therefore that we have here a consistent scheme of equa-

tions of reflexion and refraction, without the necessity of condoning any

dynamical difficulties in the process, the result being in all respects

implicitly involved in the expression for the energy function of the

medium.

     The introduction of the circumstance of conduction, or absorption of
the energy of vibration, can hardly afiect the analytical form of the
boundary conditions as to displacement and traction across an interface.

If this be allowed, the problem of reflexion at a magnet will involve the
same equations of propagation in the magnet as the above, with the

exception that the velocity constant is complex, both the magneto-optic

terms and the boundary conditions being otherwise unaltered. How far

this theory can compete with others in giving a full explanation of our
experimental knowledge would take too long time at present to inquire

but the considerations to be explained in the latter part of this paper
will, I think, give it strong claims to being a correct formulation of the
phenomena.

' The difficulty has been raised that this procedure leaves 5f discontinuous, and
so apparently leads to rupture of the media at the interface. The reply to this point

would be that if the necessity of the continuity of S( is admitted, the very formula-

tion of the problem will involve innate inconsistency, as no other equation of condi-

tion can be introduced into the variational                                                                                                                                                               equation                                    while  on  the  other  hand  the

vanishing of the coefficient of S^, as above, shows that there is no resistance offered

to stretching along the normal of the layer of the medium at the interface, and

therefore the continuity of 5f will be actually adjusted by a stretching of the inter-

facial layer which involves no dynamical consequences. The part of S^ to be thus

adjusted  is very small, depending on C                                                                                                                                                             the   mode of                                     adjustment would  probably be

pressibility. Precisely the converse mode of adjustment is in fact required in Lord

Kelvin's labile aether. In any case we can hold to the axiom (§ 24) that the variation

of the Action introduces all the conditions that are really essential.

                                           Recent Electrical Theories.

    A12. recent very comprehensive memoir ' by Drude, on this subject,

^begins by alluding to the enormous rotatory power of magnetised bodies dis-
covered by Kundt, which places in strong light the direct magnetic origin
of the phenomenon of rotation, and to the observation of Kundt that a film
of non-magnetic metal deposited on a magnet destroys Kerr's phenomena,

so that they cannot be due to magnetic rotation in the air. He also re-

marks on the insufficiency of the notion that before reflexion the light
penetrates slightly into the magnet and so undergoes rotation in its sub-

stance ; this notion is in the first place not precise or quantitative at all,

and further it assigns to the surface layer of transition an influence in

reflexion which is much too great in view of other optical phenomena.
     He then takes up one type of the formal equations of propagation ia

an isotropic medium, viz. (v, v, iv) being a certain vector (the rotation in
an isotropic elastic medium)

                -- (u, V, iv)=EV^(u, V, w)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and he works out as follows the results of adding on to the right-hand

side terms of the various kinds originally suggested by Airy. On adding

terms of the form which represents the theory of C. Neumann, viz.

It may be observed that the analysis here given would apply equally if

the equations just written were substituted for the fundamental equations

from which it started.
     13. The electrical views by means of which Drude accounts for the

addition of terms of this kind to the electro-magnetic equations are as

follows. He starts with the two circuital relations to which the equations

of electrodynamics have been reduced by Heaviside, Hertz, and other

expositors, of the types

       - cZy d/3          _ da dR dQ

       dy dz              dt dy dz

in which as usual («, v, lu) is total electric current, (o, /3, y) is magnetic

force, {a, b, c) is magnetic induction, and (P, Q, R) is electric force. To
these equations we would, under ordinary circumstances, add relations
depending on the structure of the medium, in the form for isotropic

media,
                                 (a, &, c)=/x (a, /3, y),

                       Ot,^,t.)=(^^|^ + <T) (P,Q,R),

where K is specific indactive capacity and a is specific conductivity. To

introduce the magnetic rotatory property, Drude proposes to modify the
second set of circuital relations ' on Maxwell's analytical basis, that to
the kinetic energy of the medium which is expressed in simple form by
means of the components of the magnetic force certain subsidiary terms
are appended ; as according to Maxwell the magnetisation is to be con-

sidered as a kind of molecular vortex or concealed motion (verhorgene
Bewegung) .' The modification which he assumes on this ground is a re-
placement of the second circuital relation by one of type

keeping the other equations unaltered.

    On forming the expression for the transfer of energy per unit

volume of the medium, there is obtained (jieglecting, however, the magneto-
optic energy) the equation

+ ...  + . . .,

in which dr is an element of volume, and the three integrals at the end
are extended over the boundary of the medium, of which (Z, m, n) are the

direction cosines.

     For periodic vibrations there is thus no dissipation of energy except

that due to conduction. But at the interface between two media
the transmission of energy without accumulation on the surface requires
that, the axis of x being assumed normal to the interface for the moment,

in addition to the continuity of (/3, y) the tangential magnetic force, we
must have continuity in

     The tangential electrical force is therefore to be taken discontinuous ·

and the author enters into explanations to minimise the repugnance which

may be felt to such a hypothesis, their gist being that the part of the

electric force derived from the relations of the system itself must be con-
tinuous, but the part imposed from without need not be so.

     The weak point in this determination of the boundary conditions is

the fact that, as the extra terms are supposed to have their origin in a new

term in the energy, this term ought to have been included in the reckon-

ing befoi-e we can draw any conclusions from the flux of energy across

the interface.

and it is in the plane of polarisation.

    These equations may also be variously expressed in terms of other

vectors, e.g., of (P, Q, R) which is in the plane of the wave-front and

transverse to the plane of polarisation, or of

     The magnetic rotation is here to be explained by the single real

vector coefficient (b^, b.^, 63) ; and the same value of this coefficient is in
fact found to give a fairly good account of the various circumstances

attending the rotation of the plane of polarisation in magnetic reflexion
by iron and nickel, while it is also of the same order of magnitude as
would correspond to Kundt's measures of the rotation produced by
transmission through a thin film of iron.

in which the complex part of the coefficient, involving cr, represents the

effect of conductivity. This is now replaced by a wider relation : in the
general crystalline medium he proposes the form

dP 47r             ,,       du, ,                   dv                            dw

in which ^j, n^, ps are assumed to be complex.

    When the period r/27r is very great the last terms, involving

-- (w, V, iv), exert no appreciable effect, and so may be left out of account

at

the vector coefficient (X,, Xj, X3) which is left is the representative of the

WhenHall effe(;t.  the period r/27r is very small, as in the case of light-

waves, the rotational coefficient (/Xj, /k.,, /^s) is preponderant, and the other
Weone (X|, X9, Xg) may bo neglected.
                                      may also leave out of account the

slight double refraction represented by the coefficients ju^., fjy, fi., as these
are in nowise rotational. Thus, for an isotropic optical medium, the

structural relation which connects electric force with electric current

would reduce to the form

                   cZP 47r     ,      dv     dw

                   'dt'=K'''^f''dt-^'dt

                   dt=-K''"+^'Jt-^^dt''

in which Goldhammer takes (/ui, /xg, 1^3) to be complex (unless the medium

is transparent) and proportional to the intensity of the imposed magnetic
field. This structural relation between magnetic induction and magnetic
force is supposed to remain unmodifiable in form by magnetic or other
disturbance. But it is not easy to understand the manner in which the
relation is introduced into the equations of electro-dynamics, and the
analysis to be given pi-esently leads to a different result. The bodily equa-
tions are expressed in terms of Maxwell's vector-potential ; they are the
same in form as Drude's equations expressed in terras of magnetic force ;

tion, has been given in 1883 by Prof. Willard Gibbs,^ under the title of

' An Investigation of the Velocity of Plane Waves of Light, in which,

they are regarded as consisting of solenoidal electrical fluxes in an

indefinitely extended medium of uniform and very fine-grained structure.'

The principle on which his investigation is based is the very general

idea that the regular simple harmonic light- waves traversing the medium

excite secondary vibrations in its molecular electrical structure, which

is supposed very fine compared with the length of a wave. "When there

is absorption the phases of these excited vibrations will difi'er from that
of the exciting wave ; but even in this most general case the simple

harmonic electric flux with which we are alone concerned is at each

point completely specified by six quantities, the three components of the

flux itself, and the three components of its rate of change with the time.

In the same way, the electric force may be similarly specified by six co-

Nowordinates.  the electric elasticity of the medium, as regards its

power of transmitting waves, is specified by the relation connecting

average force and average flux, this average referring to a region large

compared with molecular structures, but small compared with a wave-

length. The most general relation of this kind that can result from the

elimination of the molecular vibrations must be of the form of six Unear

equations connecting the quantities specifying the flux with the quanti-

ties specifying the force, the coefficients being functions of the wave-

Ulength. If E denote the force and the displacement, ' we may there-

fore write in vector notation

^where $ and denote linear functions,

     ' The optical properties of the media are determined by the forms
of these functions. But all forms of linear functions would not be con-

sistent with the principle of the conservation of energy.
     ' In media which are more or less opaque, and which, therefore, absorb

energy, '"P must be of such a form that the function always makes an
acute angle (or none) with the independent variable. In perfectly
transparent media '^^ must vanish, unless the function is at right angles
to the independent variable. So far as is known, the last occurs only
when the medium is subject to magnetic influence. In perfectly trans-
parent media the principle of the conservation ef energy requires that

<P should be self-conjugate, i.e., that for three directions at right angles to
one another the function and independent variable should coincide in

direction.

     ' In all isotropic media not subject to magnetic influence it is probable

^that <I> and reduce to numerical coefiicients, as is certainly the case with

<l> for transparent isotropic media.' ^

     For the further examination of the content of this relation connecting^

the two electric vectors we may express it in the symbolical form

the wave-lengths would then be too small for such vibrations to have any

physical reality.

     17. The question occurs whether to secure complete generality a

corresponding rotational quality should be imparted to the linear relation
connecting the magnetic flux (i.e., magnetic induction) with the magnetic
force. It is, however, usual to assume, on various grounds, that the

vibrations of light are too rapid to allow of their being accompanied by
an oscillating magnetisation of the material medium. The phenomena of
magnetisation of iron leave possibly no room for doubt that the magnetic
movement is an afiair of loosely associated groups of molecules, not of

individual molecules themselves, the free periods corresponding to these

groups being much too slow to follow the light-vibrations. These groups
are broken up at the temperature of recalescence without the occurrence

of any very striking effisct : nor is there any striking difference in kind
between the behaviour of iron to light and the behaviour of non-magnetic

metals.

     The effect of strong magnetisation on light-waves would be on this
view a secondary effect due to a change of structure of the medium.
Soon after the experimental discovery of the Hall effect, and the attention
which was concentrated on it owing chiefly to the influence of Lord
Kelvin, it was pointed out by J. Hopkinson that the existence of an
«ffect of that character had been anticipated by Maxwell in his ' Treatise,'
vol. i. § 303, where in discussing the possibility of the occurrence of a
rotational term in the equations expressing the genei'al form of Ohm's
law of conduction, he remarks that such a coefficient ' we have reason to
believe does not exist in any known substance. It should be found if
anywhere in magnets, which have a polarisation in one direction, probably
 due to a rotational phenomenon in the substance.' The theory of such
 rotatory coefficients had also been worked out long before by Lord Kelvin,*

 in a thermo-electric connexion.

rotation can be got out of this relation by assuming the functions <P and

^ to have rotational quality ; though Gibbs himself later on in his

memoir qualifies its use by a statement that ' the equation would not hold

in case of molecular vibrations excited by magnetic force. Such vibra-

tions would constitute an oscillating magnetisation of the medium, which

has already been excluded from the discussion.'

If the rotational quality is simply due to a magnetic field, we may

take for brevity the direction of its lines of force to be along the axes of z,

and the equations will be

Though a rotational term of this latter type, entering into the rela-

tion between current and force, and conjoined with the ordinary equations
of electro-dynamics, leads, as we have just seen, to precisely the same

scheme as Drude's to explain magnetic reflexion of waves of any single

period yet in order to take into account Verdet's laws of magnetic dis-
                                   ;

persion (in transparent media) the coefficients \ and i' have to be taken

functions of the wave-lengths, whereas the coefficients in Drude's form of

theory remain constant for all wave-lengths. The relation of Gibbs is

competent to give an account of the laws of reflexion and of crystalline

propagation for any one wave-length, by altering so to speak the electric

inertia of the medium ; and it fails for dispersion simply because the only

method it possesses of rendering an account of dispersion is by accepting

the observed facts, and making the coefficients functions of the wave-

length. Thus we ought not to allow its faihire to agree with magnetic
dispersion to tell too much against the mode of explaining magnetic
reflexion now under discussion. Yet the fact remains that the scheme

embodied in Drude's equations has an advantage in comprehending a

wider group of phenomena, and to that extent corresponds more funda-

mentally with the mechanism of the action ; while on the other hand it
exhibits, especially with regard to the boundary conditions, a more

empirical character.

19. These equations we have named after Drude because his memoir

contains by far the most detailed comparison with observation that has

yet been made. The same equations, however, had been used by a number

of other writers. For transparent media they had beea obtained by

Rowland ' as equations of propagation, and they had been used by Fitz-

Gerald and by Basset ' to calculate tbe circumstances of magnetic re-

flexion, without, however, entering into tbe case of metallic media. While

recently J. J. Thomson ^ has employed them in an independent discussion

of the laws of magnetic reflexion, which corroborates the main conclu-

sions of Drude without going so much into detail. In dielectric media

Rowland and Basset proceed simply by assuming rotational terms in the

expression for the electric force on the analogy of the Hall eSect in

metals ; and FitzGerald, as we have seen, deduces his equations from a
new term in the energy which repi'esents the linking on of tlie magnetic

system. It is shown by J. J. Thomson, in his discussion of Kerr's results

on reflexion, that in metals as well as dielectrics it is the time-rate of

change of the induction or electric displacement, and not the total

electric current, that combines with the magnetic field in the formation

of this new term.

The boundary conditions are determined by FitzGerald and Basset

from the hypotheses that the tangential magnetic force shall be con-

tinuous, and there shall be no concentration of energy, or g^tasi- Peltier

effect, at the interface, subject however in the case of the latter to the

same objection as has been appUed above to Drude's use of this principle;

while J. J. Thomson arrives at the same boundary conditions by

postulating that the part of the electric force which is derived from the

system itself must be continuous tangentially, whatever may happen

to the part imposed from without.

20. There are thus two ways in which the magnetic field may aSect

the phenomena of light-propagation. The imposed magnetisation is an

independent kinetic system of a vortical character which is linked on to

the vibrational system which transmits the light- waves ; the kinetic

reaction between the two systems will add on new terms to the

electric force : these terms are naturally continuous so long as the

medium is continuous, but owing to their foreign origin they need not

be continuous at an interface where the magnetised medium suddenly

changes. At such an interface the other part of the electric force, which

is derived from the vibrating system itself, has been assumed to be con-

tinuous in the ordinary manner, viz., its tangential components con-

tinuous                                     the total induction  through the interface must of course  always
                                         ;

maintain continuity. This seems to be the type of theory developed

by Maxwell in his hypothesis of molecular vortices ('Treatise,' § 822),
and the conditions to which it leads have been applied to magnetic re-

flexion by the majority of writers on the subject, including Basset,

Drude, J. J. Thomson. But against this procedure there stands the

pure assumption as regards discontinuity of electric force at an inter-

face. The correct boundary conditions would be derived from the modi-

fication of FitzGerald's procedure, which has been explained above.

The other point of view is the purely formal one contemplated by

Lord Kelvin and Maxwell in their discussions of possible rotational co-

efficients introduced into tlie pi'operties of the medium by magnetisation.

The magnetisation is supposed to slightly alter the structure of the

medium which conveys the light- vibrations, but not to exert a direct

dynamical effect on these vibrations.

It would appear from the analysis of Drude. and more particulai'ly

equations may be expressed in the terms of the second method some-

what as follows. The electric current is in a dielectric the rate of change

of the electric displacement, which is of an elastic character ; in a con-

ducting medium part of the current is due to the continual damping of

electric displacement in frictional modes : it may thus fairly be argued

that the fundamental relation is primarily not between current and

electric force, but between current and displacement, while the current is

indirectly expressed in terms of electric force through the elastic relation

between displacement and force. The equations would then run as

follows, (^, rj, ^) being the electric displacement

       (.,.,z.)=(| + *--)(.S,,4),

where  ^=P-&3Q + 52R;

                               4=R-&2P + 6,Q.

    This would make the relation between electric displacement and
electric force of a rotational character, owing to the magnetisation. If the
medium were not magnetised. Lord Kelvin's argument might be employed

for the negation of such a rotational character, on the ground that a
sphere rotating in an electric field would generate a perpetual motion

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but as it is the rotation in the magnetic field would generate other

electric forces. The frictional breaking down of displacement, viz., con-
duction, is known to assume a slightly rotational character, as manifested

in the Hall effect.

       Part II. Correlation of General Optical Theories.

       MacGullagh's Dynamical Theory of Light.

     21. It has been remarked in this discussion of magneto-optic phe-
nomena that a perfectly straightforward mechanical theory of magneto-
optic reflexion would be obtained by adding on a uniaxial gyratory part
to the energy- function of Lord Kelvin's labile aether.^ The development
of such a theory as this, after the manner already indicated, from the
single basis of the principle of Least Action, would compare very favour-
ably, by the absence of subsequent adjustment and assumption, with any

of the foregoing explanations.

      It has possibly been observed that the energy-function of FitzGerald's
electro-dynamic analysis considered above is identical except as to

surface terms with the energy-function of the labile sether theory, when
(S, Tj, C) is taken to denote actual displacement of the medium. The difi'er-

ence that, for plane-polarised light, (^, r), C) is in the former case in the
plane of polarisation, while in the latter case it is at right angles to that

plane, is due, as we shall see, not to the fact that in the electric medium

supposed devoid of consistence to compression, but it is the result of
the neglected surface-terms on the energy-function. The correlation
between an electric theory and a mechanical theory which follows from

this comparison has already been alluded to by Willard Gibbs.' It will
be found below that there is a similar correlation between two mechanical

theories.

     The vector (i', »;, 4) of FitzGerald's equations is, as lie points out, exactly
the displacement in MacCullagh's - gMast'-mechanical theory of optical
phenomena ; and his analysis is for non-rotational media very much a
translation of MacCullagh's work into electric terminology. The method
followed in MacCullagh's extremely powerful investigation, which was
independent of and nearly contemporary with those of Green,^ and, I
think, of at least equal importance, was to discover some form of the
energy-function of the optical medium which shall lead by pure dynamical
analysis in Lagrange's manner, without further hypothesis, to the various

optical laws of Fresnel. In this he was completely successful, though

Stokes * gives reason to doubt whether he has obtained the most general
solution of his problem. His optical work has, howevei', to a great extent

failed to receive due recognition from various causes ; in particular th.e
objection has been emphasised by Stokes (loc. cit.), and generally ac-
cepted, that the vector (I, ?y, 4f) which represents the light-disturbance in

his analysis could not possibly be the displacement in a medium which
transmits vibrations by elasticity in the manner of an ordinary elastic
solid. ' Indeed MacCuUagh himself expressly disclaimed to have given

a mechanical theory of double refraction. (It would seem, however, that
he rather felt the want of a mechanical theory, from which to deduce the

form of the function Q or V, than doubted the correctness of that form

itself.) His methods have been characterised as a sort of mathematical
induction, and led him to the discovery of the mathematical laws of
certain highly important optical phenomena. The discovery of such
laws can hardly fail to be a great assistance towards the future establish-
ment of a complete dynamical theoiy.' ^

     Since the date of these remarks the mechanical theory sought for

has, I think, been supplied by Lord Kelvin's notion ^ of a medium domi-
nated by some form of molecular angular momentum such as may be
typified by spinning gyrostats imbedded in it. The gyrostatic part of
the energy of strain of such a medium can be a quadratic function of its
elementary twists or rotations, precisely after MacCullagh's form. The

conjugate tangential tractions on the faces of a rectangular element of
volume, instead of being equal and of the same sign as in the elasticity
of solid bodies, are equal and of ojiposite sign,^ just as Stokes pointed

out they would be on MacCullagh's theory. Conseqnently a framework

free of elasticity of its own, and carrying a system of such gyrostatic cells,
would be a mechanical representation of an aether which corresponds

with MacCullagh's expression for the energy-function, and so would

afford an explanation of optical phenomena on the lines of his analysis.
The axes of the gyrostats will, in crystalline media, be concentrated in

certain directions ; but in any one direction as many must point back-
wards as forwards. Any very slight violation of the latter condition

will introduce into the medium directed rotational property with
respect to the resultant axes of angular momentum ; such we may

imagine to be the effect of an imposed magnetic field. Non-directed

rotational property will be a structural effect, due to mode of aggrega-

tion. If the light-disturbance is represented by the displacement of the

medium, it will be in the plane of polarisation ; while if it is represented
by the rotation, it will be at right angles to that plane. According to

this theory of light, the density of the tether will be the same in all

22. The bodily equations of MacCuUagh, when formulated in con-

nexion with the boundary conditions appropriate to the theory of the

elasticity of solids, which it is, I think, fair to say that their author never

intended, and with which, in fact, Stokes pointed out that his whole

scheme is inconsistent, have been shown ' by various writers to lead to

a wholly untenable account of reflexion.

The investigation of MacCuUagh himself, based purely on dynamical

analysis, leads him to the boundary conditions which alone are consistent
with his scheme, much in the manner of FitzGerald's correlative electro-

dynamic theory sketched above. These conditions are quite different

from the ones appropriate for an elastic solid medium.

The energy of MacCullagh's medium depends only on rotation, and

not sensibly on compression. The compressional term can in general be

absent only because either (i) there is no resistance offered to pi'essure, so

that no work is done by it, or (ii) the medium is incompressible so that

pressure can do no work. The tangential tractions on either side of an

interface are expressed in terms of rotation, not of distortion as in the

elastic solid theory.

     The surface conditions are, however, theoretically too numerous, as
MacCuUagh knew but did not suffer from in the problem of crystalline

reflexion, and as FitzGerald found irremediably in the magneto-optic

problem. The way to remove this difliculty is to recognise, according

to which of the above views we adopt, either (i) a local play of com-

pression close to the intei'face which is not propagated away from it,
which involves no sensible energy, but which renders it unnecessary to

suppose the displacement normal to the interface to be continuous, or

(ii) a play of pressure which is propagated from the interface with

infinite velocity (i.e., attains instantly an equilibrium distribution

in this paper is dominated by simple rotators imbedded in its structure, and the
forcive is proportional to angular velocity. Lord Kelvin's new rotational medium is
dominated by complex gyrostatic cells, containing arrangements of Foucault gyro-
stats, of which only the outer cases are firmly imbedded in the medium ; and the
forcive is projDortional to the angular displacement.

tliroughout the medium), and which therefore necessitates the modifi-
cation of the equations of propagation as FitzGerald's equations are
modified {supra, § 11), \ in that analysis being clearly a hydrostatic
pressure when (^, ?;, 4) represents linear displacement of the medium.

    Any actual refracting system is of finite extent, so that the equi-

librium state contemplated by (ii) is easily established throughout it
it is only for the simplification of analysis that it is customary to take the
interface to be an unlimited plane.

     The discussion of crystalline reflexion which is given by MacCullagh
takes no account of this pressure X, but makes an argument in favour of

his theory out of the remarkable fact that although there are too many
surface conditions compared with the number of variables, yet in no case

is the introduction of such a pressure required by the analysis or the
optical phenomena, provided the densities of both media are assumed to
be the same ; while FitzGerald's further application to magneto-optic
reflexion simply leaves the continuity normal to the interface unsatisfied,
and so far tacitly adopts the first of the above alternatives, that the

--medium, considered as a mechanical one, offers no resistance to com-

pression a hypothesis which turns out to be untenable.

     23. If these considerations are sound, we have the following con-

clusions.

     The phenomena of light are explained on MacCullagh's mathe-
matical equations by a theory of pure rotational elasticity, without any
accompaniment of the character of the elasticity due to change of volume

or change of shape of an ordinary solid body, for linear vibrations the

direction of the displacement of the medium is in the plane of polarisation

of the light, while the axis of its rotation is at right angles to that

plane. There is, however, no occasion to take the medium devoid of
resistance to compression: it may transmit longitudinal waves with finite
velocity, and still no such wave will be produced by the refraction of a

transverse wave.

     The electric theory of light is formally the same as MacCullagh's
theory, magnetic force corresponding to velocity, provided his medium is

taken to be incompressible.

     The labile aether theory of Lord Kelvin is one that contemplates
elastic quality depending on compression and distortion, ?'.e.,the ordinary
elasticity of solid bodies, bat the resistance of the medium to laminar

compression is taken to be infinitesimal.

     The difference between MacCullagh's theory and the electric theory
does not, as has been just remarked, aff'ect the problem of pi'opagation in
crystalline media, nor does it enter into the question of reflexion at an
interface between either isotropic or crystalline media, the boundary
conditions being all satisfied without any condensational disturbance ; it

is not necessary to introduce either (i) interfacial compression or (ii)

hydrostatic pressure, according to the two cases above, to preserve the
continuity at the interface. But we have already seen that the diS"erence
between these hypotheses makes itself felt in the pi'oblem of magneto-

optic reflexion.

     The labile aether theory stands, according to the remark of Willard

Gibbs, already quoted, in a relation of precise duality to the electric

theory, and therefore also to the other limiting interpretation of
MacCullagh's theory, which postulates absence of volume elasticity ; the

linear displacement in the labile aether corresponds to the rotation in the
364 REPORT-- 1893.

rotational aether. And here there is a point which demands explanation.
The energy-function is the same in both the labile aether and this

rotational aether ; but the boundary conditions are difiFerent, being in the
one case those of the elasticity of solids and in the other those of pure
rotational elasticity. Yet, in the treatment of the subject proposed here,
emphasis is laid, after MacCullagh, on the fact that the energy-function
implicitly involves in itself the boundary conditions. This difficulty is
·elucidated by observing that the expression

ence on the validity of the proper application of MacCullagh's doctrine that
the energy-function of a medium, provided it is correctly localised, con-
tains implicitly in it the aggregate of the boundary conditions at an inter-
face between two different media; and that notwithstanding any apparent

discrepancy in continuity that may still be outstanding after the conditions

so obtained have been appHed to the problem. The same principle had
previously been formulated by Green,- in similar terms ; ' one of the
advantages of this method, of great importance, is, that we are neces-
sarily led by the mere process of the calculation, and with little care on
our part, to all the equations and conditions which are requisite and
sufficient for the complete solution of any problem to which it may be

applied.' On the practical application of this procedure some fresh

light may be thrown by the consideration of a quite similar difficulty

in the dynamics of actual elastic systems, which has recently occupied
the attention of several mathematicians. The vibrations of a curved
elastic plate, in fact of a bell supposed of small thickness, have been
worked out by Lord Rayleigh,' simply from the energy-function of the
plate. The plate being thin, it can easily be deformed by bending ; on
the other hand to stretch it sensibly would be very difficult. For this
reason the energy- function is formed by Lord Rayleigh on the assumption

that the plate is perfectly inextensible, so that terms depending on exten-

sion do not occur in its expression. Some years subsequently it was
pointed out by Love "^ that this treatment does not allow of all the elastic

conditions at the boundary of the plate being satisfied. Now on the

principles here expounded the adjustment of these terminal conditions
would be made by tensions in the plate, which, owing to the very rapid

velocity of propagation of extensional disturbances, practically obey at
each instant an equilibrium theoiy of their own, and at the same time
involve the play of only a negligible amount of energy owing to the
magnitude of their elastic modulus. If the plate were quite inextensible
these tensions would be absolutely in equilibrium at each instant, and

the energy-changes involved in them would be null. And this view is,
1 believe, in agreement with the mode of explanation now generally

accepted for that problem.^ The solution of the problem of vibration of
a bell may thus be derived, as regards all things essential, from the
energy-function of the bending alone, combined explicitly or implicitly

with the geometrical condition of absence of extension.

25. The principle implied in MacCullagh's analysis is claimed to be

identical, in its results if not in theory, with a hypothesis adopted by

Kirchhofi" in his discnssion of crystalline reflexion,'* which is commonly

quoted by German authors nnder the title of Kirchhoff's principle. Its

author employs it avowedly as a formal mathematical representation of

assumptions made explicitly by F. Neumann, and tacitly he says by

MacCullagh, in their theories, which it is the object of his memoir to

reproduce and amplify. He attempts no dynamical justification of its

thesis. At any rate it has been treated as a hypothesis by Kirchhoff's

followers in Germany, while its validity is suspected by some other

writers who have considered the subject. The explanation of Kirchhoff

himself in the introductory paragraph of his memoir, in comparing

Neumann's and MacCullagh's theories, is here reproduced in a free

translation. * Yet at the first glance the points of departure of the two

theories would appear to be ditferent, even diametrically opposed to each

other. For Neumann starts from the view that the a3ther in respect of

light-vibi'ations comports itself as an elastic solid, on whose elements no

forces act except sucli as are called forth by their relative displacements

while MacCnllagh takes for the potential of the forces in operation on

the elements of the sether an expression which does not agree with the

potential of the forces called into play by the relative displacements of

the parts of an elastic solid. Thus in the theory of MacCullagh, if we

are to treat the tether as an elastic solid, we must treat it as one which

is acted on by forces in addition to those called into play by its elasticity.
Yet of these other forces it may be pi^oved from the energy-function

adopted by MacCullagh that, taken throughoat a portion of the aether in

a homogeneous body, they reduce to tractions which operate on its surface.

"We can therefore assert, that the theory of MacCullagh rests on the

hypothesis that on the elements of the asther no forces act except such

as are derived from its elasticity ; but on the surfaces which form the

boundaries of heterogeneous media tractions are imposed which have

some other origin. And such tractions must also be contemplated by

Neumann's theory ; their function is that we are by their aid empowered

to leave the compi'essional wave out of consideration, just as happens in

the former theory : they must exist, in order that compressional waves

may not be set up in the reflexion and refraction of light- waves. The

two theories compai-ed can thus be seen to be in complete accord. I

propose to myself to lay before the Academy a treatment of the question

from the standpoint of these theories which, I think, is more general and

more comprehensive than those that have been given hitherto.' These

imposed interfacial forces are restricted merely to satisfy the condition

that they shall do no work on any element during the actual displace-

ments of  the media                                                         they are  considered  by KirchhofF  to  be ' tractions
                                                                         ;

from without (fremJen Druclchrufte) which act on an element of the

interface, tractions which, we are accustomed to assert, arise from the

forces which the ponderable parts of the two media sustain from

the aether.' ' The forces contemplated by KirchhofiP's principle, in

order to allow of the condition of incompi-essibility being satisfied, are

thus only interfacial tractions, which form an equilibrating system in so

far as they do no work in any displacement actually contemplated.

According to the elucidation and extension of MacCullagh's pi'inciple

which is here proposed, they should be taken to be a system of pressures

distributed throughout the media, which do no work for the displace-

ments actually contemplated, and which are in so far equilibrating.

These pressures will be discontinuous at an interface and will hence
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

modify the boundary conditions in the same manner as Kirchhoff's

extraneous forces.

26. In the account of Kirchhoff's principle given by Volkmann,'^ the

view is propounded that such a principle is necessary because the equa-

tions of an elastic solid medium, with the addition of a pressure intro-

duced in the manner indicated above (§ 11), will not lead to an account

of reflexion which is in accordance with experiment. Quoting from

WeKirchhoff's lectures on Optics (p. 143), '                                                      have to recognise that the

elasticity of the ajther is different in the various transparent media,

Wedifferent in glass, for example, from what it is in empty space.                                                  are

not in a position to form for ourselves a clear representation as to how

the alteration of the elasticity of the eether in glass is brought about ; but

ON THE ACTION OF MAGNETISM ON LIGHT.  367

still we can say that it is a consequence of forces which the elements of
the ponderable matter exert on the elements of the sether. As therefore
such forces are present they must exert a direct influence on the motion
of the elements of the tether at the boundary of the glass, though in the

interior of the glass they have only an indirect influence in altering the
elasticity of the fether. The relations of the direct action of these forces
at the surface and in the interior are similar to those which hold with
capillary forces, which also are only of influence at the surfaces of fluids,
and are not felt in the interior.' This quotation has been given at length,
as it puts the case precisely. The reply is that it is only a confession of
total ignorance as to the distribution of the energy throughout the mass
of the media which would permit us to prop up the boundary conditions
by extraneous forces in this manner. In the theory of capillarity the
surface-tractions are derived from the distribution of energy throughout
the mass of the liquid ; and if they could not be deduced rationally from
some possible volume distribution of energy, it would have to be held
that they were erroneous. So here, if KirchhofF's extraneous surface-
tractions cannot be deduced from some energy -function of the complex

medium (aether and matter) which is the seat of the undulations, there is

absolutely no basis left for them. It will not sufBce to say that at the
bou ndary there is interaction between the aether and the matter, and a
gradual transition in density caused by the equilibration of such, action
if the depth of this layer of transition is a small fraction of the wave-
length, the introduction of the energy-function appropriate to it would have
but a small influence on the variation of the total energy, and so would
not sensibly affect the results. In so far as the introduction of the pressure
arising mathematically from the condition of incompressibiiity will not

make an elastic theory work, that theory has simply not been sustained

in various theories above mentioned the introduction of the pressure is
eSicacious, and they are in so far verified and in a position to be further
tested by application to more complicated phenomena.

     Although it would seem that Kirchhoff's method cannot be main-
tained, yet, as he remarks, his formal equations come out the same as those
of the rotational theory represented by MacCullagh's equations so that

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

his detailed development of the problem of crystalline reflexion will be
in agreement with MacCullagh's, and holds good so far as it goes.

     27. In the theory of Neumann, which contains one of the first
attempts at a rational dynamical treatment of reflexion and refraction,
he starts with equations for the strain of an elastic crystalline medium,
of the imperfect type, however, which the then cnri-ent elastic

theory of Navier and Poisson supplied. By assumption of special rela-

tions between the constant coefficients of these equations, he obtained a
form which led approximately to Fresnel's laws of double refraction.'

He then applied this form to the problem of crystalline reflexion,^ but

found, I suppose, that the six conditions which he recognised as necessary
to ensure continuity of displacement and stress at the interface could not

all be satisfied. To satisfy them in a case of an ordinary compressible
medium would require the introduction of a wave of longitudinal dis-
placement in each medium, set up in the act of refraction ; Neumann's

medium being incompressible, lie did not take account of sucb waves, and

so was in difiBculty with bis boundary equations. He cut the knot by

assuming that the displacement is continuous across the interface, in

other words that there can be no rupture of material  continuity                                          and by
                                                                                                       ;

omitting altogether all conditions of continuity of stress, replacing them

by the principle that there is no loss of energy in the act of refraction and

reflexion. This, as Kirchhoff remarks, is equivalent to an admission that

the equilibrium (or vibrational motion) of an indefinitely thin layer,

including in it the interface, is maintained by the aid of forces introduced

somehow from outside the vibrating system ; but that, as the energy of
the incident light is accounted for exactly by that of the reflected and

refracted light, these forces must be subject to the condition that they do

no work on any element of this surface layer in the displacements to

which the medium is actually subjected during the motion. On this
basis Neumann obtains Fresnel's equations of reflexion, by aid of the

hypotheses that the displacement of a linear wave is in the plane of

polarisation, and that media differ optically in elasticity but not in density.

    As we have seen, Kirchhoff adopts and expounds the method initiated
by Neumann for getting over the boundary difficulty. But his main
argument is that if we do not assume surface forces from without we are

helpless, that such forces exist, as is inferred from molecular theory, but

that all we know about them is that in their play they cannot absorb any
of the energy of the light. His method of procedure would therefore be

to assume the most general possible type of such forces subject to this
one condition, and then try by special assumption to adjust them to the

final result he desires. There is clearly no dynamical validity in this, it

is purely empirical ; the surface forces may really be subject (as we shall
see, are subject) to other unknown laws as well, which will not, with the

assumed energy-function of the medium, allow of the desired solution.

The process would then only prove that the assumed energy^function is

untenable.

     28. The correct method is the one indicated above. The energy of
the medium is associated with the medium in bulk, is located in its

elements of volume. In Gauss' theory of capillarity it is true that inter-

facial energy is contemplated, but that is only the actual excess or defect

of the energy in the very thin layer of transition over what its amount
would be if the transition was supposed sharp and the density of the
energy in the elements of each medium near the surface were unaltered

by the neighbourhood of the other medium. It is this portion of the

energy that produces superficial effects such as surface-tension, though

owing to the thinness of the interfacial layer it forms only a very minute

fraction of the whole energy, the distribution of the other part being uni-

form. Now the propagation of vibrations across the interface is an affair

of the redistribution of the enei'gy of the medium en masse ; if we make

the ordinary optical hypothesis that the layer of transition is very thin

compared with the length of a wave, we may be certain that there is no

superficial term of sensible importance in the vibrational energy of the
system. The only superficial forces which can come in are, then, those

which enter logically in the dynamical analysis of the motion, on the basis

of a volume distribution of energy in the medium, the determination of

whose form is part of the problem. Until the possibilities of this state-
ment of the problem are exhausted, it would appear to be gratuitous and
unscientific to assume the existence of unknown surface-forces; and more-

over, as these forces could only arise from the existence of a finite layer

of transition, so not only would their assumption be purely empirical, but
the present method of investigation of the prohlem of reflexion would
actually no longer apply
                                                                                                                                                          :  if there is to be a finite layer of transition, the

postulation of material continuity of the media across it by means of a
single set of surface conditions would be meaningless.

   m29. In the light of these remarks it will be of interest to follow some-

what detail KirchhoflP's discussion of the general problem of crystalline
reflexion and refraction, to find out how far his imposed surface forces
satisfy the conditions that we here demand of them, namely of being
deducible from a bodily energy-function. Kirchhoff' restricts himself to

well-known form.'

He then neglects the first term involving the compression, in Green's
forniula, on the ground that in the transverse waves the density of the

medium remains unaltered,^ so that such a term can have no influence on
the equations. If he had definitely omitted this term from the energy,
the analysis, as carried out by him without an introduced pressure, would
have shown that the function so modified belongs to a medium in which
a compressional wave is propagated with null velocity, in fact a medium
which (hke Lord Kelvin's foam) opposes no resistance to laminar com-
pression, though it does resist uniform compression with a finite volume-
elasticity. Green was not able to do away in this manner with the terms
producing a normal wave, because he thought his medium would be un-
stable                          and
                             ;                          possibly the                                                                                         same  idea suggested  KirchhofE's  cautious   p^ro-

--370 REPORT 1893.

     If we take for an instant the plane of (xy) to be the interface, so that
(Z, m,n)^(0, 0, 1), this expression becomes

    Now on any form of interpretation of MacCullagh's theory, no ex-

traneous interfacial forces at all are required to satisfy the boundary

conditions ; if the present theory is to agree with it, we might expect that

there will be required only interfacial forces such that their activity will
for the actual motion just undo the variations of this surface-energy.

But the boundary conditions of MacCullagh are (§9)

                                          t, »?, 4, -5- and ---

                                                                                      ;

suffice to make this surface- energy constant, i.e., the time variations of
the above expression continuous across the interface. As already re-
marked, the theories of Kirchhoff and MacCullagh are formally identical
therefore there must be some discrepancy here. It is in fact the circum-

stance that this surface-integral part of the energy has lost its correct

location, and does not really belong to the place with which it is now

analytically associated.

     Again, KirchhofiF's actual procedure is to take the tractions (X, T, Z)
and (X', Y', Z') on the two sides of the interface that are derived in
Lagrange's manner from the energy-function, and to equate to nothing

their activity

(X-X')^-l- (Y-Y')'^^+(Z-Z')'?.

                  at at at

      If ^, rj, Z are quite independent this will give three boundary conditions
just as before, and will be no help. Bat in the motion to which he
restricts himself, I, i], ^ are the displacements in a plane-wave, and so are
functions of the same linear function of x, y, z and t ; he finds that the
introduction of this restriction reduces the conditions to two, and so

allows further progress.

     The reason which Kirchhoff assigns for the two theories of himself
and MacCullagh being analytically in agreement is that they can only
differ as to boundary conditions, that he gets to a definite theory by his
principle of extraneous forces, and that MacCullagh's definite theory also
satisfies this principle from the simple fact that there are no extraneous
forces. But then the energy-functions are not the same in the two
theories. The Fresnel laws of reflexion are obtained by JSTeumann really
by the hypothesis that for rays, i.e.. for simple wave-trains, no loss of
energy occurs in the reflexion. This is a much narrower principle than
its generalisation by Kirchhoff ; and, as we have seen, to make his
generalisation work, the latter has to return practically to Neumann's
form in which it is restricted to plane- waves.

      These considerations are set forth as showing the artificial character
of Kirchhoff's principle, and illustrating the various mistakes and mis-

conceptions which may arise in connexion with a subtle point of analytical

dynamics, of which the physical bearing has not, I think, been realised

by many of the writers on this subject.

In contrast with these explanations, the real reason why the theories

of MacCullagh and KirchhofF agree in their results will now be stated.

It is simply that, when £, jj, 'C are functions of a linear function of x, y, z
and t, and therefore are the displacements in a plane-wave of some form,

the unmodified expression for Kirchhoff's energy-function P reduces to

MacCullagh's energy-function U, the various Jacobian expressions

d(ri, ii)/d(y, z), &c., contained in it being all null. For a wave with a

spherical or other curved form of front, these terms would not thus dis-

appear                                  and  the  boundary conditions  could  not, I  think, be  reduced  to
                                     ;

the proper number by Kirchhoff's process. The conclusion to be drawn

from this would be as before mentioned, not that reflexion cannot be

explained, but that Green's expression for the energy, as employed by

KirchhofF, is untenable.

    We have seen that a labile aether gives results conjugate to, but

not the same as, those of the rotational sether corresponding to Mac-

Cullagh's equations. It is also known that Neumann's simple theory

which can be expressed by means of rays, without technical considera-

tions of elasticity, leads to the same results as MacCullagh's ; and we

now see that KirchhoflP's method would lead to the same result. Now

the elastic solid theory of Kirchhofi" is in its elements just the same as

the labile jsther elastic solid theory ; and yet Kirch hoff' gets a different

result out of it. This demonstrates still further the faultiness of his

procedure : he is not entitled to throw away the Jacobian terms in the

energy because they happen to be null for the plane- wave kind of motion

which he assumes to be the only one to which the reflexion will give

rise ; though he happens to be led to the correct result by equilibrating

them, as he can clearly do for this particular case, by extraneous surface

tractions of null activity. Further, it thus appears that, according to the

form he takes for his extraneous forces, he can arrive from the same

data at either of two conjugate theories of reflexion.

                                        Mechanical Illustrations of MacCullagh's Theory.

30. The conclusions here arrived at naturally tempt one to pursue

the invention of mechanical illustrations of the aether. Lord Kelvin

proposes to realise and illustrate his labile contractile tether by a homo-

geneous mass of foam free from air. Such a medium, when distorted, will

have its equilibrium disturbed, and will tend to recover itself ; when

uniformly compressed it will exhibit volume-elasticity. But when it is

compressed in one direction only in plane layers, there will be no

tendency to recover : its Young's modulus will he null, and so there will

exist a fixed ratio between its compressibility and its rigidity, an inter-

esting result which it would be rather difficult to investigate directly.

Longitudinal waves will thus not be propagated in the medium.

   We have also two types of Lord Kelvin's gyrostatic aethers, one of

them with pure rotational elasticity and no compressional or distortional

elasticity, the other incompressible but with no distortional elasticity                                  ;

Aeither of them will represent MacCullagh's equations.                                           mechanical

realisation of an aether of the second kind has been proposed by Fitz-

Gerald as consisting of a web of long vortex filaments, interlaced together

in homogeneous frictionless incompressible liquid, with any desired iso-

tropic or crystalline quality : but even if we could be assured that such

a system could subsist, and not be at once hopelessly entangled and

                                                                                                 B B 'i

destroyed owing to instability, as seems likely, its elasticity would appear

at first sight to depend on angular velocity and not on angular displace-
ment, so that it could not have the properties of MacCuUagh's aether.^

Lord Kelvin has recently occupied himself^ with the dynamics of media

composed of gyrostats mounted on framework having various degrees

of mechanical freedom. It is possible to imagine frames devoid of dis-

tortional elasticity and either incompressible or devoid of compressional

elasticity, one of the former class being simply composed of rectangular
parallelepipedal webs hinged together, each web consisting of three

systems of parallel rods freely jointed at their points of meeting.

But we ought not to lose sight of the fact that a gyrostatic isther

will be effective, whatever be its modulus of compressibility, provided it

has no purely distortional elasticity. Thus FitzGerald's fluid need not

be incompressible ; an oblique parallelepipedal frame on which to mount
the gyrostats will do equally as well as a rectangular frame ; and we may

also have more complicated forms.

The wide field of physical theory which is opened up by this

remark that in a rotational ^ther, however heterogeneous it maybe, com-

pressional waves are propagated in perfect independence of rotational

Awaves, must be reserved for future consideration.  generalisation of

Maxwell's electrodynamic equations has been already proposed and dis-

cussed by von Helmholtz, which introduces the possibility of compres-

sional disturbances ; but that theory is on quite a difl'erent footing from
the one here suggested, in that Helmholtz's compressional wave interacts

with the rotational one, getting mixed up with it at each refraction into a

different medium.

The only optical phenomena which the compression can affect, on

MacCuUagh's theory, appear to be magneto-optic reflexion and possibly

other such secondary disturbances, depending on the introduction of

terms of higher orders into the energy-function.

--The Action of Light upon Dyed Colours. Report of Committee^

     consisting of Professor T. E. Thorpe {Chairman), Professor J. J.

     Hummel {Secretary), Dr. W. H. Perkin, Professor W. J. Russell,
     Captain i^JBNEY, Professor W. Stroud, and Professor R. Meldola.
     {Drawn up by the Secretary.)

The object of the Committee appointed to study this matter has been to

·determine by experiment the relative fastness to light of the colours dyed

on textile fabrics with the various natural and artificial colouring matters.

     For this purpose patterns of silk, wool, and cotton have been dyed
with equal percentages (2 per cent.) of the various commercial artificial

colouring matters. With the natural colouring matters the patterns were
dyed to approximately the same depth of colour.

The patterns were exposed to light at Adel, a country district about

-five miles to the north of Leeds, in order to avoid the influence of town
smoke, sulphurous acid, &c., the prevailing winds being westerly. The

patterns were pinned on deal boards covered with white calico, fixed in a

vertical position in glazed wooden cases, so arranged as to permit free

circulation of the air and moisture after filtration through cotton wool to
exclude dust, &c.

     The exposing cases were set up in the grounds of Jas. A. Hirst, Esq.,

to whom the best thanks of the Committee are due for his kind permission

to do so.

     Each dyed pattern was divided into six pieces, one of which was
protected from the action of light, while the others were exposed for

different periods of time. The shortest period of exposure, or ' fading
period,' was about three weeks (May 24 to June 14, 1892), and a record
of the fading power of this period was kept by exposing along with

the patterns a special series of ' standards ' dyed with selected colouring

matters. These standards were removed from the action of the light along

with the first set of dyed patterns at the end of the first ' fading period '

(May 24 to June 14, 1892). The faded standards were then at once
replaced by a fresh unexposed series, and these were allowed to fade to
the same extent as the first, when, a second period of exposure equal in
fading power to the first having thus been marked off, a second set of the
dyed patterns were removed from the action of light along with the second

series of faded standards. The latter were again renewed as before to
mark off the next ' fading period.' The fourth and fifth sets of dyed

patterns were submitted to an exposure equivalent to two or three 'fading

periods                               in  order  that the fifth  set  might have an  exposure of  one year.
                                   '

The above method was adopted in order to be able to expose dyed

patterns to an equal amount of fading in different years, irrespective of

the time of the year or the conditions of light, moisture, temperature, &c.
It was rendered necessary indeed in consequence of the practical impos-

sibility of exposing simultaneously a complete set of dyed colours.
     During the year 1892-93 the red dyes on wool and silk have been

exposed. For want of sufficient exposing space, however, the Congo

colours and some others, as well as the reds dyed on cotton, had to
be omitted. During 1893-94 the orange and yellow dyes are being

exposed, and the remaining colours will be exposed in subsequent years

until all have been examined. There is no doabt but that the behaviour
of dyed colours towards light and other agencies depends upon several
factors, 6.17., the chemical constitution of the colouring matter itself, the

kind of fibre to which it is applied, the method of application, &c. With
so many variables a full and complete examination of the question of the
fastness of dyes proves to be one of extreme complexity and difficulty.
Even to determine effectually the nature of the relationship existing be-
tween the molecular constitution of colouring matters and their behaviour
towards light seems to necessitate the employment of chemically pure
dye-stuffs, and that the dyeing should be so arranged as to have an equal
number of molecules of colouring matter on a given weight of textile
material. Having regard, therefore, to the difficulties connected with the
purification of such a large number of colouring matters as are now in
use, their varying colouring power, the different degree to which they
exhaust the dye-bath, &c., it seemed better, for the present at least, to

confine our attention to a comparison of the relative fastness to light of
the various distinct commercial colours, the results of which might form
a basis for a further examination in the direction alluded to.

     The dyed and faded patterns have been entered in pattern-card books
in such a manner that they can be readily compared with each other.

     The following tables give the general result of the exposure experi-
ments made during the year 1892-93, the colours being divided, according
to their behaviour towards light, into the following five classes : Very
fugitive, fugitive, moderately fast, fast, very fast.

     The initial numbers refer to the order of the patterns in the pattern
books. The S. and J. numbers refer to Schultz and Julius' ' Tabellarische

Uebersicht der kiinstlichen organischen Fai-bstoffen.'

                   Class I. Very Fugitive Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class have faded so rapidly that at the end of
the first ' fading period ' (May 24 to June 14, 1892) only a very faint
colour remains, and at the end of the fifth period (one year) all traces
of the original colour have disappeared, the woollen cloth being quite

white or of a yellowish tint.

cyanosin B fades as rapidly as the rest during the first ' fading period,'

but the pale tint then left is remarkable for its fastness, since it remains

fading, but the safranines leave, at the end of the first ' fading period,' a

dull brownish-pink tint.

a pale grey remains. Acid magenta becomes duller but not bluer.

The rhodamines, pyronin G, and aoridine red become yellower.

QCloth red 3      extra and 8 B extra become distinctly yellower;

Cam-wood red is remarkable for becoming quite brown and appear-

soon fades, however, and leaves at the end of a year a pale drab tint.

                 Class III. Moderately Fast Colours. (Wool.)

     The colours of this class show distinct fading at the end of the
second period (June 14 to July 21, 1892), which becomes more

Apronounced at the end of the third period (July 21 to August 14, 1892).

    pale tint only remains at the end of the fourth period (August 14
to February 16, 1893), and at the end of a year's exposure the colour
has entirely faded, or, at most, mere traces of colour remain.

                                                  Silk Patterns.

     The foregoing colours were dyed on silk, employing 2 per cent,
·colouring matter, and the patterns were exposed to light, along with

those on wool, with the result that the relative fastness of the various
colours was practically the same as on wool.

                                          General Result.

     The experiments extend at present over too limited a number of
colouring matters to enable one to draw fixed general conclusions, but it

may be well already at this point to record the following observations.

     The most fugitive reds on wool and silk are the eosins and allied
colours. Curiously enough, the introduction of the methoxy group, as in

methyl-eosin, &c., increases the fastness, not of the colour as a whole, but
of the pale faded tint which results after the first few weeks' exposure.

As already stated, this tint remains practically unchanged even after a
whole year's exposure. This is specially noticeable on the silk patterns.

     With respect to the rosindulines, it is interesting to note that the

G Bshades are very fugitive, while the shades are moderately fast.

     All basic reds belong to the more or less fugitive class, including,
namely, the magentas, safranines, and rhodamines. The nature of the
acid with which the colour base is combined seems to have no influence
upon the fastness of the dyed colour.

      Comparatively few (about twenty) of the azo reds examined are
fugitive, and these belong chiefly to the simple monazo colours.

     The great bulk of the fast and moderately fast reds belong to the azo

colours, the so-called secondary disazo colours being generally faster than
the rest. It is evident, however, that the fastness of these azo colours
depends, not only upon the base which is azotised, but also upon the
character of the naphthol-sulphonic acid employed. This is especially
noticeable in the chromotropes, in which a particular dioxynaphthalene
disulphonic acid is employed, and all of which are remarkable for their

fastness. The particular azo compound and phenol united together is

also of importance.

     With respect to the milling and cloth reds, it does not appear that the
use of mordants with them increases their fastness to light.

     The number of very fast reds is extremely limited, but it includes both

--natural and artificial dyes namely, madder, cochineal, kermes, alizarin,

Rand the chromotropes 2 and 2 B. When it becomes possible to expose

the Congo reds, one or two others will no doubt have to be added to the
list of very fast artificial red dyes. In this connection it may be pointed
out that certain reds obtained from the natux'al dye-stuff's are fugitive,
namely, those obtained from Lima-wood, Cam- wood, and the allied woods.

      It is well to add that there are no sharp lines of division with respect to
ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT UPON DYED COLOUES.  381

fastness to light among the various reds, and each of the five classes into'

which they have been here arbitrarily divided includes colours which differ
from each other more or less in this respect.

--The Action of Light on the Hydracids of the Halogens in presence
     of Oxygen. Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. W. J.
    Russell, Captain W. de W. Abney, Professor W. N. Hartley,,
    Professor W. Eamsay, and Dr. A. Eichardson (Secretary).

Since the last report was presented the attention of the Committee
has been directed to a consideration of the conditions necessary to start
the decomposition of moist gaseous hydrogen chloride, and of aqueous
solutions of the acid when exposed to the combined influence of sunlight
and oxygen. It has been repeatedly noticed that, although decomposition
of the gaseous mixture, when once started, proceeds at a fairly uniform
rate in different samples, yet the time of exposure necessary to start
the decomposition varies within very wide limits, although the con-
ditions under which exposure is made appear to be the same in each
case. It was also noticed that there was more difficulty in starting de-
composition in hard than in soft glass tubes. This seems to indicate

that the nature of the glass itself materially affects the initial stage of

decomposition, which is dependent upon the length of time during
which the acid has been kept in contact with the glass, as is borne out
by such results as the following. Nine glass tubes having been filled
with aqueous solutions of the acid of varying strength were exposed to
sunlight. At the end of six months it was found that the most concen-
trated of these solutions had been decomposed, the others being un-
changed, while after twelve months the three strongest of the remaining
solutions showed by their yellow colour that they also had been decom-

posed.

     This is quite explicable on the ground that the stronger acid more
rapidly dissolves out the constituents of the glass, and suggested that the
presence of some metallic chloride is required to start the decomposition
of the acid. Following up this line a large number of experiments have
been made on the influence of metallic chlorides in promoting decom-
position, and, although the results are not sufficiently advanced to allow
of our giving full details at present, they appear fully to bear out the
above hypothesis. For instance, it was found that the addition of a
minute quantity of pure dry alumina to a tube containing moist hydrogen
chloride and oxygen brought about rapid decomposition of the acid on
exposure to light, while precisely similar samples to which no alumina
had been added remained stable for long periods.

lene, and to the numerous apparent departures from this law observed in

the formation of sulphonic acids. Most interesting examples of the for-

mation of << -derivatives are afforded by Cleve's recent invaluable obser-

vations on the behaviour of the chlorides of ten of the chloronaphtha-

lenesulphonic acids on nitration (' Ofversigt af Kongl. Vetenakaps-

Akademiens Forhandlingar,' 1892, No. 9 : presented November 9 ; 1893,

Nos. 2, 3, and 5 : presented February 8, March 14, May 9). His results

are displayed in a subsequent diagram, in which also the properties of

the various derivatives are indicated, as the Swedish publication in

which they are described is not generally available. The formula of

the chlorosulphochloride  is  given  in  the  first  column  of symbols                                                     that

of the resulting nitro-derivative or derivatives in the second ; and that

of the corresponding trichloronaphthalene obtained by the action of

phosphorus pentachloride in the third. In the table of /3-derivatives

the results obtained by Dr. Wynne and the writer on sulphonating

the /3-chlorosulphonic acids ' are included for comparison with those

obtained on nitra.ting their chlorides. It will be seen that in the case

of the a-chloro acids the nitro-group in every instance takes up the

' opposite ' ci-position ; only in two cases are /3-compouuds obtained. In

--the case of the /s-chloro acids the nitro-group assumes the a-position con-

tiguous to the /3-chlorine atom a most interesting and significant result.

The results obtained on nitration are strikingly different from those

attending sulphonation ; it can scarcely be doubted, however, that in the

case of sulphonic acids the formation of /3-acids is due to secondary

changes, but opinions differ as to the nature of these. It appears to be

commonly supposed that when sulphonation takes place at high tem-

peratures, and in presence of excess of acid, a-sulphonic groups become

split off, and that sulphonation then occurs in /3-positions ; Dr. Wynne

and the writer have been unable to discover any proof of direct sulpho-

nation of the /> position, and incline to the belief that the formation of

--/3-su1phonic derivatives is either the outcome of isomeric change or

and probably most frequently of polysulphonation followed bv hydro-

lysis. Thus, naphthalene-/3-sulphonic acid is not improbably the final

product of the following series of changes :

--of place to state that the work which was expressly reserved in 1890 the examina-

(first notice, Proc. Chem. Soc, 1890, p. 131), and of the correspondiug naphthyl-
aminemonosulphonic acids (first notice, Proc. Chem. Soc, 1890, p. 128)-- is nearly com-
pleted. As the object of the work is the determination of the positions assumed by
the entering sulphonic radicle in the two classes of derivatives, there is little to be
gained in publishing the results until the constitution of each disulphonic acid has
been ascertained beyond question. This has involved characterising the trichloro-
naphthalenes more definitely than V>y melting-point determinations, and, as in the
case of the dichloronaphthalenes (Proc. Chem. Soc, 1890, p. 77 ; Brit. Assoc Rep.,
1891), this is being carried out mainly by examining the acids obtained by sul-

phonating each of the fourteen isomeric trichloronaphthalenes (first notice, Proc.

Chem. Soc, 1890, p. 76).

ON ISOMERIC NAPHTHALENE DERIVATIVES.                 383

   We have iu a previous report directed attention to the fact that the

polysulphonic acids which can be obtained by sulphonation are of certain
types, and that there is, in fact, an invincible objection on the part of two

-- --SO3H groups under conditions thereby prevailing to remain in either

contiguous, or para-, or peri-positions. During the year we have been

able to examine three of the naphthalenedisulphonic acids which cannot

be obtained by direct sulphonation, i.e., the 1 : 2, 1 : 4, and 1 : 1' acids,

having prepared these, and the 2:3: 2'-naphthalenetrisulphonic acid by

an indirect method communicated to us by Dr. Duisberg.' With the aid
of these acids and of others prepared by the same method we hope to
further elucidate the phenomena of sulphonation.

   We have ascertained that of the three acids prepared by sulphonating

chloro-/3-naphthylamine hydrochloride, viz,

s            No. 2.                          No. 3.
No. 1.

Nos. 2 and 3 are of independent origin ; in other words, that, although
both can be obtained from No. 1, No. 2 is not convertible into No. 3
under the conditions which admit of the conversion of No. 1 into Nos. 2
and 3. It is noteworthy that, in the formation of the No. 2 and No. 3
acids, chloronaphthylaminedisulphonic acids always accompany the two
monosulphonic acids, and the investigation of these compounds, so far as
it has progressed, affords further evidence in favour of our view of the
complexity of the phenomena underlying the formation of /3-sulphonic

acids. 2

    Another case which may be referred to is that of the formation of 1 : 2

a-naphthylamine /3-sulphonic acid from naphthionic acid (1 : 4), which is
effected by heating the sodium salt of the latter at about 200°. It appears
probable to ns that the change involves the formation of a disulphonic
acid, which then undergoes hydrolysis, yielding the ortho-acid, thus :

          s            s

    The production of disulphonic acid may be the outcome either of

direct intei'action of two molecules of the monosulphonic acid or of the
action of acid sulphate formed by the agency of traces of water unavoidably

present in the salt. It has actually been observed that hj'drated potassium

1:2:4 a-naphtholdisulphonate yields the ortho-mono-sulphonate when

heated.^ The superior stability of the ortho- as compared with the para-
sulphonate thus brought into evidence in the case of both naphthol and
naphthylamine is highly remarkable, bearing in mind the extreme in-
stability of the corresponding benzene derivatives, and is evidence that the

mere contiguity of an amido- or hydroxyl-group does not condition insta-

bility. The special properties of the /3-sulphonic derivatives of naphthalene

are doubtless a consequence of a structural peculiarity of the cycloid. It is
especially from this last point of view that observations such as are here

alluded to are of particular interest, and it may be permitted to draw atten-
tion to them as illustrating the circumstance that facts which in themselves
are of no special value may become of more than usual interest when con-

sidered in connection with the larger problems underlying all investigations

of details.

     In the course of the further study of the action of bromine on

beta-naphthol derivatives interesting results have been obtained which

may be here mentioned. If an aqueous solution of potassium 2 : 2' beta-

naphthol-sulphonate be subjected to the action of even a large excess of

bromine, potassium bromohydroxynaphthaquinone sulphonate is pro-

duced, together with a very small proportion of dibromohydroxynaphtha-

quinone; but if an aqueous solution of this quinone sulphonate be

warmed with bi'omine it becomes oxidised to a brominated sulphophthalic

acid ; apparently, in the former case, the presence of hydrogen bromide
in excess prevents the bromine acting as an oxidising agent. It is easy
to obtain a monobromosulphonate and the quinone sulphonate by the

action of bromine on an aqueous solution of Schaeffer's salt, but the
preparation of the intermediate di- and tri-bromosulphonates is very

difficult. If, however, the salt be suspended in muriatic acid it is easy to
convert it wholly into tribromosulphonate and to avoid the production of

quinone sulphonate. Recently it has been ascertained that if 2 : 3' beta-

naphtholsulphonic acid be dissolved in muriatic acid it is wholly con-

verted into tetra-bromo-beta-naphthol by the mere addition of an excess

of  bromine                                          as  the  product   of  the  action  of an  excess  of  bromine  on
                                                  ;

beta-naphthol is a mixture of the tri- and tetra-bromo-derivative, which

are separated only with difficulty, this observation affords a welcome
method of preparing tetra-bromo-beta-naphthol. The readiness with which

bromine, in presence of muriatic acid, displaces the sulphonic radicle-

from the acid, but not from the salt, is calculated to excite surprise.

ON THE SILENT DISCHARGE OV ELECTRICITY ON OXYGEN, ETC. 439

--The Influence of the Silent Discharge of Electricity on Oxygen and
     other Gases. Report of a Committee, consisting of Professor
    H. McLeod (Chairman), JMr. W. A. Shenstone (Secretary),
     Professor W. Eamsay, and Mr. J. Tudor Cundall. (Drawn

     ivp by the Secretary.)

This Committee was first appointed in 1885 ; grants of money were made
in that and in the succeeding year. The expenditure of these grants

has already been duly reported. It therefore only remains to give an
account of the work that has been done. This has already been fully
described in the ' Journal of the Chemical Society ' and elsewhere, and

consequently it will be sufficient now to give an outline of the results

obtained, with references to the fuller descriptions.

                       I. The Preparation and Storage of Oxygen.^

     In this note a method of preparing oxygen from a mixture of the
chlorates of sodium and potassium was described. The process recom-
mended has been found to be very convenient, and has since been adopted
by other investigators. Its advantage lies in the ready fusibility of the
mixture, and the consequent reduced risk of breaking glass apparatus in
which the chlorate must be submitted to repeated fusion and solidification
in the course of generating oxygen from it.

II. Ozone from Pure Oxygen. Its Action on Mercury, with a Note on the

    Silent Discharge of Electricity.'^ By W. A. Shenstone and J. Tudor

     Cundall.

     The experiments described in this paper showed that a good yield of
ozone (7*5 per cent.) is readily obtained from carefully dried oxygen.

     It has lately been suggested by Professor Armstrong that, in spite of

the care taken, it is possible impurity may have been introduced into

the gas by the action of the discharge, which might conceivably detach
adherent moisture from the glass surfaces of the apparatus. Moreover,
when these experiments were made the only liquid that was available for
use in the manometers was oil of vitriol, and though this was screened
from the dried oxygen by phosphoric anhydride, its use introduced a fresh

element of uncertainty.

    On the other hand, the proportion of ozone obtained was, considering

the form of apparatus employed, sufficiently high to suggest that the con-
ditions of the experiment were very favourable to the production of a
high yield of ozone, and the mixture of ozone and oxygen obtained by the
discharge was apparently without chemical action on mercury, which is
inconsistent with the idea that moisture was present in it, whilst it is
stated by Brodie in his ' Classical Research ' that in order to obtain a
high yield of ozone dry oxygen must be employed.

     The later experiments described in section III. will make it possible
to investigate this point more severely than in 1885, and therefore this

important question will very shortly be re-examined.

                III. Studies on the Formation of Ozone from Oxygen.^

                    By W. A. Shenstone and Martin Priest.

     The introduction of improved methods of working with ozone have

enabled the authors of this paper to study the influence of various con-
ditions on the converting of oxygen into ozone with increased exactness

and facility.
     The results obtained show that
     1. Under constant conditions it is possible to obtain concordant results

in converting oxygen into ozone by the silent discharge.

     2. That the maximum yield of ozone is nearly independent of the

difierence of potential employed to produce the discharge (the range ot
potential difference employed was from 33 to 69 C.G.S. units), provided
that the path of the discharge be not too short.

     3. That if the path of the discharge be very short, then the maximum

yield of ozone has an inverse relation to the difference of potential
employed.^

     4. The rapidity with which the discharge converts oxygen into ozone
is greater when great potential differences are employed than for smaller

differences.

     5. That the maximum yield of ozone is less when the number of dis-
charges is very great in unit time than when it is smaller.^ But the yield

is not affected by moderate variations of rapidity of the discharge.
     6. The greatest yield of ozone was obtained by using an ozone gene-

rator made of the thinnest possible glass, and with closely fitting tubes.
In one case 17'15 per cent, of ozone was obtained at 0°.

     7. Under equal conditions less ozone was produced by the discharge
obtained by means of a Wimshurst's machine than when a large induc-
tion coil was employed.

     It has been suggested that this last phenomenon may be due to a

difference in the quantity of electricity acting in the two cases, but the
authors point out that under the conditions of their experiments * the
' quantity ' of the discharge inside the ozone generator depends on the
difference of potential of the inducing charge, and that as the ozonising
effect of the discharge is, under suitable conditions (see 2 and 3 above),
independent of the potential difference of the inducing charge, it would
seem that this suggestion does not afford a clue to the cause of the phe-
nomenon. Moreover, it was found in the experiments made with the
plate machine that when the quantity of the inducing charge was raised
or reduced, by means of condensers, the yield of ozone remained un-

affected.

     Although a good deal of progress has now been made, much of the
work undertaken remains to be done. As, however, no further grants are
likely to be asked for, and as it is probable that in the future the work
will be mainly in the hands of one member of the Committee, the
Committee now recommend that they be not reappointed.

      ^ This is attributed to the difficulty of maintaining a sufficiently regular tempera-

In science as in politics there are certain territories which, whilst unable

to fully assert their own independence, are yet so jealously watcbed by

their powerful neighbours that deliberate annexation by any one of these

is impossible. Such semi-independent states usually become successively

subject to the influence of their more powerful neighbours, each of which

is anxious to acquire an ascendency in their councils.

In science such a semi-independent state is bacteriology, of hardly

sufficient importance to stand by itself, but surrounded as it is by its

great neighbours Botany, Medicine, and Chemistry, to each of which in

part it owes its present prominent position, both in the scientific and

unscientific worlds.

Originally an offshoot of Botany, from which also in its early infancy

it received such powerful support through the memorable ministrations

·of Cohn, of Naegeli, and of Brefeld, but although thus under obligation

to the parent science, the greatest impulse given to the study of bacteria

will always be associated with Chemistry in the person of M. Pasteur,

whilst there can be no doubt that by far the greater part of oar more

recent knowledge concerning these micro-organisms has been acquired

through the indefatigable labours of medical men, so many of whom have

been fired by the brilliant discoveries of Koch, MetchnikofT, and Behring.

In these bacteriological investigations, however, the medical man has

been constantly brought more and more into the domain of Chemistry,

so that, starting with phenomena which he at first regarded from a

purely biological, i.e., a more or less superficial and empirical, point of

view, he has by more profound study in many cases reached the chemical,

physical, and mechanical foundations on which all biological phenomena

jnust of necessity rest.

As, therefore, the history and development of bacteriology are so

intimately connected with Chemistry, and as it is to chemical science that

we must ultimately look for the elucidation of innumerable bacterio-

logical phenomena, it is only natural that our President should have

desired to see this subject brought before this Section. It is, however, with

extreme diffidence and hesitation that I have undertaken at his request

to introduce this discussion to-day, as from the great breadth of the

subject, with its numerous ramifications into other sciences, the task is in

many respects peculiarly arduous and beset with extraordinary peril. I

will, however, at once state that I have no intention of burdening you

with a detailed survey of the present position of bacteriology, but that it

is only my purpose to refer to some matters which have recently been

attracting the attention of investigators, and which may possibly interest

--the members of the Chemical Section.

of bacteriological problems can be, and have been, solved by experimenting

with casual mixtures of microbes, progress in many directions was neces-

sarily barred until particular organisms could be obtained and maintained

in a state of purity for investigation.

That these methods have now reached a high state of perfection is

attested by the fact that, in spite of the great number of persons who are

constantly using them in all parts of the world, no changes of any great

Aimportance have been made during the jaast few years.  general under-

standing of these methods of bacteriology may now be said to constitute

almost an integral part of a liberal education, although, judging from the
flagrant inaccuracies which are to be found in the numerous references to
matters bacteriological in the daily press, it is evident that the news-

paper correspondents who undertake to inform the public on these topics

have not, as a rule, had the benefit of the liberal education in question.

Perhaps the circumstance most calculated to impress the British

public with the present importance of bacteriology is that pure cultiva-

tions of micro-organisms have now for some years past become actually

articles of commerce. Not only are pure yeasts, prepared according to

Hansen's methods, in circulation all over the world, but pure cultivations

of pathogenic and other bacteria can now be purchased at catalogue
prices, to the great convenience of the investigator, in much the same way

as we have been in the habit of procuring pure and inaccessible chemicals
from Kahlbaum's. Again, bacterial poisons have been employed in

various parts of the world for combating animal plagues, whilst domesti-
cated bacteria have been used for the preventive inoculation of cattle and

other animals.

     If, however, the general methods of bacteriological study have under-
gone but little change recently, the greatly increased attention which
has been given to the study of particular forms isolated by these methods
has led to some important developments in our views concerning bacteria

in general.

     Although the discovery of the existence of micro-organisms was neces-
sarily made with the microscope, and the earlier information concerning
them obtained almost exclusively by means of this instrument, the intro-
duction of the modern bacteriological methods soon relegated the micro-
scope to a secondary position for the purpose of their differentiation and

diagnosis. It was early found that bacteria which were perfectly
undistinguishable when viewed through the microscope might exhibit tbi^
most marked differences in their macroscopic appearances and in their

functions. Using the modern methods of bacteriological study, indeed,

the investigator generally becomes acquainted with such macroscopic
differences amongst micro-organisms before the microscope is brought
into requisition at all. It results from this that in examining any given
material the number of different bacteria discovered by cultivation

methods will generally greatly exceed that revealed by microscopic

examination alone. Upon the introduction of these cultivation methods
there rapidly followed, then, the discovery of a large number of different

kinds of bacteria obtained from the most varied sources, tissues healthy
and diseased, soil, water, air, &c. These different kinds of bacteria were

distinguished by more or less well-marked characters, e.g., the liquefaction
or non-liquefaction of gelatin, the appearances of the growths in various
culture media, the production of pigments, the pathogenic or non-
pathogenic properties on different animals, whilst in some cases the ability
                                       --

or inability to bring abont certain chemical reactions was relied on as a
means of diagnosis.

     The more careful and prolonged study of individual kinds of bacteria
by these methods has shown, however, that the differentiation between
bacteria is a matter of even still greater difficulty than was hitherto sup-
posed. Thus during recent years there are perhaps no two bacterial,
forms which have been so closely and carefully studied as Eberth-Gaffky's
typhoid bacillus and Koch's cholera spirillum. The result of this con-
centrated study has been to reveal an ever-increasing number of forms,
so closely allied to each that their differentiation becomes more and more
difficult, and is based on more and more refined and artificial distinc-

tions.

     The extraordinary difficulty with which this branch of bacteriological
practice is at present attended is well illustrated by the following remarks
of M. Metchnikoff · on Dr. Koch's last paper on the subject of the

diagnosis of the cholera bacillus :

     ' The characters which were formerly regarded as specific to the

comma bacillus, such as the form of the bacteria, their motility, the
manner of their growth in gelatin, suffice no more. M. Koch himself
describes a case of cholera in which the comma bacilli liquefied the gelatin
so slightly that the colonies had the form of shields (houcliers). On the
other hand, in the vibrio of Massowah (obtained in a cholera epidemic
there) we have an example of a comma bacillus which liquefies the
gelatin much more than the typical forms. On this account M. Koch
now abandons as useless the stab-cultures in gelatin. The examination

of drop-cultures becomes of similarly small importance, because it has

been shown that indisputable comma bacilli can be completely deprived

of motility, whilst other vibrios can be very motile.

     'The form of the vibrios is again veiy variable. Besides the vibrios
which are bent and thick, there are found forms which are slim and thin,

sometimes hardly bent at all.'
     But perhaps nothing shows the inadequacy of morphological methods

alone for purposes of diagnosis more conspicuously than the recent in-
vestigations which have been made by those newly perfected modes of
mordant staining devised by Loeffler, and by means of which some of

-- --the finest bacterial structures the cilia or flagella are rendered visible

with a degree of precision hitherto unequalled. The observers who have

hoped to establish a basis of differentiation on such minute microscopic
distinctions as these beautiful staining methods reveal have had their
hopes rudely shattered by the extraordinary variability which is exhibited
by one and the same form in this respect.

     This variability is most strikingly exhibited by the plates of Nicolle
and Morax ^ of the cilia found on the cholera bacillus and its allies, as well
as on the typhoid bacillus and bacillus coli communis : these plates show
that there are as great difi'erences in the number and arrangement of the
cilia on cholera spirilla obtained from different sources as amongst spirilla
generally acknowledged to be of different kinds. Thus practically all
morphological distinctions, both micro- and macro-scopic, have had to be
abandoned as a means of final diagnosis in the case of the cholera bacillus.

4M REPORT-- 1893.

To what ti'ibunal must the bewildered bacteriologist have recourse ? In
 Dr. Koch's last paper, ' Der augeDblickliche Stand der Choleradiagnose '

 (Zeitsch. f. Hygiene, xiv. [1893], p. 335), the final referees in this diagnosis

are (1) the so-called indol reaction and (2) the pathogenic effects of

inoculation into animals. Thus the morphological have had to give way

to chemical and physiological tests.

     An almost precise parallel is presented by the history of the diagnosis

 of the typhoid bacillus. In the first instance morphological tests for its

 identification were in vogue, more especially its great motility in broth
and its almost invisible growth on potatoes ; both of these criteria have
 had to be abandoned, inasmuch as they are possessed also by closely allied
 organisms, and the tests which at present serve at any rate for its ready
 distinction from the bacillus coli communis are (1) the absence of indol
 reaction, (2) the non-coagulation of milk, and (3) the non-fermentation
 of dextrose and meat extract.

     Thus, whilst morphological methods may serve to distinguish the
typhoid bacilli from a number of other forms, it is to chemical tests that
we must have recourse in order to differentiate it from its closest allies.

     I do not, however, for a moment wish to convey the impression that

--such chemical tests are altogether unassailable far from it, for I have

had abundant opportunities of observing their inconstancy and treacherous
 variation. It is, however, highly significant that in the diagnosis of the
· two micro-organisms, upon which almost more attention has been recently
showered than upon any others, the tests universally acknowledged to be
the most reliable are in both cases chemical ones. It is, moreover,
-obvious that these chemical differences will in the future have to be far
more closely and systematically studied than in the past, as they are
doubtless capable of very great extension for purposes of diagnosis.

      Thus, the only other chemical tests which have hitherto been in any

way extensively introduced are

      (1) The reduction of nitrates to nitrites.
      (2) The ammoniacal fermentation of urea.

      Of these the first is particularly available, as a comparatively large
 number of bacteria have the power of effecting this change, whilst
 hitherto, curiously, only one organism has been found possessing the

--power of bringing about the oxidation of nitrites to nitrates.
       Fermentations. These chemical tests to which, as I have pointed out,

 we are now so often obliged to resort in bacteriological diagnosis naturally

 lead us to a consideration of some of the more striking chemical changes
 induced by micro-organisms, and which we generally group together
 Tinder the name of Fermentations.

      Of these fermentations the most important, from a practical point of
-view, is still, of course, the alcoholic fermentation induced by yeast, and,
 as is so well known, the practical application of this fermentation has
 been put on a sound scientific basis through the researches of Chr. Hansen,
 whose pure yeasts have, however, hitherto found less favour in this
 country than elsewhere, although they have been employed on a large
 experimental scale by Mr. Horace Brown and Dr. Mon-is, whilst more
 recently, in a few English breweries, the pure yeasts have been adopted
 to some extent in actual practice. The principal diflBculty in the way of
 these pure yeasts being employed for English beers appears to be that,
 until recently, none of them was capable of bringing about that ' after-
            --

        ON BACTERIOLOGY IN ITS EELATIONS TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE. 445

fermentation ' which is so essential to the ' conditioning ' of the beer.
Quite recently, however, this difficulty is said to have been overcome by

Van Laer, who has succeeded in obtaining a yeast in a state of purity

which is endowed with this power.
     In this connection it is worthy of remark that, during the past year,

there has been established, at Burton-on-Trent, ' The British Pure Yeast

Company,' under the direction of Dr. Van Laer, from which it is hoped

that the British breweries will be gradually induced to adopt the employ-

ment of pure yeast fermentations.
     In his last publication Hansen (' Untersuchungen a. d. Praxis der

Garungsindustrie,' Munich and Leipzig, 1892) gives a list of the various-
breweries in which his method has been adopted, and of which the-
following table is a summary :

446  REPOET-- 1893.

decompositions which are induced by bacteria, for the discovery of so

many of which we are indebted to Pasteur and Fitz. The substances

which have already been shown to be capable of undergoing fermentative
change through the agency of bacterial life, although numerous, are
practically confined to the carbohydrates, polyhydric alcohols, and oxy-

 acids.

      Moreover, the products obtained in these numerous fermentations are,

if we except comparatively minute traces, still more limited in number.
The most common are

      Alcohols : Ethyl, butyl, amyl.

      Polyhydric Alcohols : Mannitol.

      Monobasic Acids : Formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, valerianic.

      Oxyacids : Lactic.

      Dibasic Acids : Succinic.
      Gases : Carbonic anhydride, hydrogen, marsh gas.

      In almost all cases the products formed in these fermentations are of
simpler molecular structure than those from which they have been
derived, the most conspicuous exception to this general rule being the
fermentative synthesis of butyric from lactic acid.

      In almost all cases, moreover, the fermentative decomposition includes
a process of oxidation and reduction, one part of the original molecule
being oxidised at the expense of the other. Thus, one of the commonest
forms of fermentation is that in which a fatty acid and an alcohol,
generally the one corresponding to the acid in question, are simultaneously

produced.

     Two questions naturally suggest themselves in connection with these

--bacterial decompositions: (1) Does the same substance yield different

products when fermented by different micro-organisms ? (2) Does the
same micro-organism produce the same products in the fermentation of

·different substances ?

     The first of these questions has been answered by the researches of
Fitz, who found that one and the same substance was capable of yielding

different fermentation products, according to the fermenting material

employed. Nor is this result in any way modified by the fact that we

have no guarantee that the ferments used by Fitz were pure cultivations

in fact, in many cases, they were admittedly mixtures.
     On the other hand, the answer to the second question can obviously

only be furnished by experiments made with pure cultures of fermenting

organisms.

     I have for some time past been conducting experiments on this

--subject, and, as far as these have yet proceeded ^for they are necessarily
--of the most laborious character they clearly show the most striking

tendency for the products elaborated by one and the same organism from
different fermentable substances to be the same. Thus I have shown
that one and the same bacillus, operating on such different substances as

dextrose, galactose, maltose, milk-sugar, mannitol, arabinose, glycerin,

and glyceric acid, yields qualitatively the same products--viz., ethyl
alcohol, acetic and formic acids (traces of succinic acid), carbonic

anhydride, and hydrogen.

     Similar results have more recently been obtained by Grimbert, who

has studied the fermentation induced in starch, inulin, dextrose, maltose,
<5ane-sugar, invert-sugar, milk-sugar, arabinose, mannitol, and glycerin.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I
                                                                           --

by the B. orthobutylicus, and has found that in all cases the products

--were qualitatively the same viz., acetic and butyric acids, normal

butylalcohol, carbonic anhydride, and hydrogen.

     I do not, however, for a moment suppose it likely that one and the

same organism will decompose all substances, so as to form the same
products ; but it is suiEciently remarkable that the same products should

be obtained from such comparatively different parent substances, a
phenomenon which is most probably explicable by the assumption that

the several substances are, in the first instance, broken down into
some intermediate substance which then undergoes further transforma-

tion.

Thus, probably the fermentability of bodies depends upon their being

Aable to yield such intermediate substances with facility.  substance

that doubtless plays an important part as an intermediary in such fer-

mentation decompositions is lactic acid, which is known, indeed, to be

capable of yielding a number of different products under bacterial action

e.g., valerianic, butyric, propionic, and acetic acids, besides butyl and ethyl

alcohols. In this connection it is worthy of note also that the only sugars

which are capable of undergoing fermentation by yeast are those which

contain three or some multiple of three atoms of carbon in the molecule
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

moreover, even towards the bacterial ferments, with their more catholic

tastes, the carbon compounds containing such a tri-carbon nucleus appear

to offer peculiar facilities for attack. That intermediate reactions of

various degrees of complexity take place in these fermentative decom-

positions again is shown by the several kinds of lactic fermentation, to

which I will refer presently.

In these fermentation phenomena formic acid appeal's to play a very

important part ; the presence of this substance among fermentation pro-

ducts has been observed by a number of investigators. It is frequently

mentioned as occurring, generally in small quantities, by Fitz, and simi-

larly by Grimbert, in the butyric fermentations, to which I have already

referred. In my experiments, however, I have found that the amount of

this formic acid may be very greatly increased by special conditions.

Thus in those fermentations conducted in flasks closed only with cotton-

wool plugs the proportion of formic acid was generally only very insignifi-

cant, whilst in the case of fermentations carried on in closed vessels

provided only with a delivery-tube dipping under mercury for collecting

the evolved gases the proportion of formic acid produced was invariably

very considerable ; and, further, in these closed fermentations in which

the gases were collected I have always found that the carbonic anhy-

dride and hydrogen were evolved in approximately the proportions in

--which they are present in formic acid viz., equal volumes. In these

closed fermentations it was, moreover, found that the fermentation was

less complete than in the flasks plugged with cotton-wool only. Now it

has been shown by Duclaux (' Annales de I'lnst. Pasteur,' vi. [1892], 598)

that free formic acid is a powerful antiseptic, and it is highly probable,

therefore, that the production of this formic acid in the closed fermentations

is the cause of their being prematurely arrested by this toxic product.

Whether the formic acid is not produced at all when the fermentation

takes place in the open flask, or whether the organism is capable of de-

composing it in the presence of air under these circumstances, I have not

yet determined. Duclaux (loc. cit.) has shown that moulds are capable

of destroying free formic acid in the presence of air j but the action of

moulds when growing superficially on organic liquids is, so far as we

know, entirely different from that of bacteria, inasmuch as the moulds

simply convert the organic elements into their ultimate products of oxida-

tion, and do not excite fermentations in the stricter sense of the word.

  --Becent Additions to Knowledge of Lactic Fermentation. The lactic

fermentation, which was one of the earliest-known fermentations, and

with the investigation of which the names of Pasteur and Lister are

associated, has recently formed the subject of some researches, which

appear to me to be of particular interest from a chemical point of view.

In the ordinary lactic fermentation, as is well known, the lactic acid

obtained is inactive, irrespectively of whether it is derived from starch,

milk-sugar, cane-sugar, dextrose, or mannitol. By employing different

lactic fermentation bacteria, however, both the active lactic acids have

been obtained by direct fermentation. Thus Nencki and Sieber ('Berlin.

Berichte,' xxii. c. 695) have discovered a lactic ferment which yields sarco-

lactic acid {i.e., dextro-rotary lactic acid) in the fermentation of dextrose
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

whilst Schardinger (' Chem. Soc. Journ.,' Abstr., 1891, p. QQQ) has de-

scribed the production of lasvo-rotary lactic acid in the fermentation of cane-

Howsugar.  are these three different lactic fermentations to be interpreted

by the light of our present knowledge of the constitution of the sugar

molecules, which is based on those researches of Emil Fischer, which

have excited such profound and widespread admiration ?

only are converted into COOH, the resulting lactic acid will Lave its

+asymmetric carbon atom, with the sign before it. It is unnecessary

to point out that all these signs may also be directly opposite to the

actually observed rotation, so that the speculation may be more correctly

and briefly summarised in the words, that wJiilst loth active lactic acids

are theoretically ohtainaUe hy the simplest decomposition of dextrose, only
one arid the same of the ttvo active isomers should he similarly obtainabte

from either Icevulose or mannitol.

On the other hand, it is equally obvious that in order to obtain inactive

lactic acid from any of the above molecules it is necessary either that

there should be an intermediate product formed in which the asymmetric

carbon atom of the ultimate lactic acid has lost its asymmetry, or that the
two active lactic acids should be formed in exactly equal molecular pro-

portions, and thus destroy the rotatory power. On the latter supposi-

tion, inactive lactic acid should only be readily obtainable from dextrose,

as neither the laBvulose nor the mannitol molecules are theoretically

capable of yielding, ly simple conversion, more than one of the isomeric

active lactic acids, but it is experimentally certain that inactive lactic

acid can be obtained by the fermentation of pure mannitol.

In these decompositions effected by micro-organisms a remarkable

feature is not unfrequently observed which must be of great significance,

both from a chemical and biological point of view--I refer to the pheno-
menon of selective or preference fermentation. This phenomenon was first

observed by Pasteur (' Jahresbericht d. Chem.,' 1860, p. 250 ; ' Comptes
Rendus,' xlvi.p. 615) in the case of tartaric acid,who found that both bacteria
and moulds attacked the dextro-rotary modification by preference ; simi-
larly, Lewkowitsch ('Berlin. Berichte,' 1883, pp.1568, 2722) found that in

the case of mandelic acid the Itevo-rotary isomer is first destroyed by the
mould Fenicillium glaucum. More recently I have shown that by the
fermentative action of the Bacillus ethaceticus on glyceric acid the Isevo-

rotary acid is first decomposed, obtaining in this manner a dextro-rotary

glyceric acid, which is of particular interest and value, inasmuch as it is
the simplest active acid which can be obtained in practically unlimited

quantity, and by means of which the laws regulating the rotatory power of

active bodies in general can be investigated in their simplest form. Of
this new substance no less than twenty active derivatives have already

been prepared in my laboratory, and have served to throw light on the

more recent speculations concerning the peculiarly fascinating subject of
the asymmetric carbon atom. Still more recently I have obtained by

this selective fermentation the dextro-rotary lactic or sarcolactic acid,

which, although long known, has hitherto been only obtainable with great

difficulty. I hope, however, by this means to render it as accessible as
the dextro-rotary glyceric acid, and the study of its derivatives, which are
as yet almost wholly unexplored, should also furnish important data for

stereo-chemical theory.

     The cause of this remarkable phenomenon of selective fermentation is

at present wholly wrapped in obscurity, but I would venture to suggest
that it is to be sought for in the differences which such optical isomers
only unfold when they are combined with other active bodies. Thus,
when the optically isomeric tartaric acids are combined with the optically

active base cinchonine, for instance, the resulting cinchonine dextro- and

laevo-tartrate exhibit marked differences of solubility from each other. Is
it not highly probable that optically active substances which are invariably

present in living cells may enter into combination with these optically

active fermentable isomers, and by thus establishing differences e.g., of

--solubility between them render one of them probably the more soluble
-- --one more accessible to the specific decomposing influence of the cell-

protoplasm ?

     Whether in such selective fermentations it is invariably the same

optical isomer or not that first disappears under the influence of vital de-
composition has not been with certainty ascertained. Pasteur, however,

found that it was the dextro-tartaric acid which was first destroyed,

irrespectively of whether a bacterial fermentation or a mould combustion

was employed. Similarly, in the case of lactic acid, it was the laevo-rotary

myacid which first disappeared in  bacterial fermentation, already referred

to, as well as in the mould combustion of lactic acid, studied by Linossier

('Berlin. Berichte,' xxiv. c. 6G0). On the other hand, Lewkowitsch (loc.

cit.) records the preferential decomposition of one optically isomeric man-

delic acid by the mould Penicillium glaucum, and of the opposite isomer by

a bacterial ferment. As this is, so far as I am aware, the only instance of

the kind, it is highly desirable that it should be reinvestigated, and either

confirmed or disproved.

     It must not be supposed that in this selective fermentation one of the
isomers is necessarily quite unfermentable, for, as far as this matter has

been carefully investigated, it would appear to be only that one of the
isomers is relatively less fermentable than the other. Thus in the
fermentation of lactic acid, which I have recently studied, I found that
if the fermentation was allowed to finish the whole of the lactic acid was

broken up into other products ; but if arrested at an intermediate stage
the lactic acid remaining undecomposed always contained sarcolactic
acid, showing that the laavo-rotary lactic acid had been decomposed by

preference.

     In the fermentation of glyceric acid the selective phenomena are
extremely remarkable. Thus when I first isolated the Bacillus ethaceticus

some years ago I found that its powers of fermenting glyceric acid in the
form of calcium glycerate were very feeble, and that even when the

fermentation was allowed to complete itself practically the whole of the
dextro-rotary glyceric acid remained untouched by the bacillus. But on

continuously cultivating this bacillus in solutions of calcium glycerate I

found that its power of decomposing this substance was becoming markedly

greater ; thus, not only did the fermentations last longer, but the propor-
tions of undecomposed dextro-rotary glyceric acid remaining at the end

of the fermentations became less and less. In order, therefore, to obtain

a satisfactory yield of the residual active glyceric acid, it now becomes

necessary to arrest the fermentation, and thus save the dextro-glyceric

Weacid from destruction.  can also still obtain a satisfactory yield of the

active glyceric acid by using for the fermentation ethacetic bacilli which

have hitherto  been strangers  to  solutions of  glyceric acid                                                            these  bacilli
                                                                                                                       ;

then only decompose the l^vo-glyceric acid, the dextro-glyceric acid

molecules being untouched by them. In fact, in this manner the

fermentative activity of this Bacillus ethaceticus can be regulated with

the greatest nicety and precision, and this forms a good example of the
profound modifications which can be eflected in micro-organisms by what

may be called educational culture.

  --Modifications effected in Micro-organisms by Educational Culture.

This subject of the modification of micro-organisms by artificial means is
         ON BACTERIOLOGY IN ITS RELATIONS TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE. 451

of such far-reaching importance that I must ask you to permit me to

devote a little further attention to it. There are an immense number of
isolated and incidental observations concerning such induced modifi-

cations distributed through bacteriological literature, but there are

comparatively few connected researches which have been made with the
object of deliberately ascertaining what are the limits within which such

modifications can be made.^

      That bacteria are peculiarly liable to present the most extraordinary
changes in form was demonstrated already twenty years ago by Professor

Ray Lankester's observations on the Beggiafoa roseo-persicina (' Quart.

Journ. Mic. Sci.,' xiii. 1873), whilst during recent years the examples of
variation, both in form and function, which have been observed are so
numerous that even a mere enumeration of them would involve more

time than I have at my disposal. It is not, however, perhaps out of

place to give those of you who are less familiar with this subject an

instance of the profound morphological change which can be impressed

on a micro-organism by artificial means. To my mind perhaps the most

striking instance of this kind is the artificial production by Chamberland
and Roux of a variety of anthrax bacilli, which are incapable of produc-

ing spores under any known conditions whatsoever. This fundamental

metamorphosis in the morphology and physiology of the organism is
eSected by cultivating the ordinary anthrax bacilli in broth, to which a
small proportion of potassium dichromate (g^^o), or phenol (about -nrl^K,)
has been added. This sporeless, or asporogene, anthrax is equally virulent,
and in all respects resembles the ordinary anthrax bacilli, excepting in
the particular of inability to form spores. This peculiarity is, moreover,
so permanently stamped upon it that it persists even after passing the
asporogene bacillus through the bodies of animals.

     I ought also to mention similarly profound and permanent morpho-
logical changes which Hansen has made in yeasts by prolonged culture

in aerated wort near the maximum temperature. In this manner yeast

varieties were obtained which had entirely lost their power of producing
spores under whatever conditions they might subsequently be cultivated
(Hansen, ' Centralbl. f. Bakteriol.,' vii. [1890], p. 795).

     Equally striking are the changes in the functions of bacteria which can
be artificially produced.

     Into the artificial and permanent diminution of the virulence of

pathogenic micro-organisms it is not necessary for me to enter, as tho

production of attenuated viruses or vaccines for the purposes of preventive

inoculation is already carried out on what may be called an industrial
scale. But the converse operation may also be eSected, that is to say, an
organism possessing only a low degree of virulence may by artificial

means have its virulence increased beyond that which it normally
exhibits in nature. This has been done by Malm, for the bacillus of
anthrax, by passing this organism through animals which, like the dog,
are naturally very refractory to this disease, or which have been rendered
artificially refractory by vaccination ('Ann. de I'lnst. Pasteur,' vii. [1890],
p. 532). Hitherto, however, such increased virulence has not been

    A' useful summary of the principal instances of recorded variations amongst

bacteria, more especially those of a pathogenic nature, was contributed to the
Pathological Section of the meeting of the British Medical Association, held at
Nottingham in July of last year, by Professor Adami (Medical Chronicle, September.

1892).

                                                                                                               aa 2

imparted to bacteria by more purely artificial means, e.g.,hj subjecting-
them to chemical treatment, nor has it yet been found possible to convert
a perfectly harmless micro-organism into a pathogenic one.

      Instances of artificially induced changes of bacterial function, other

than pathogeneity, are far more easy to study with accuracy and precision
as the complicating differences of animal organisation are eliminated.
Thus, whilst any two animals selected for experiment must necessarily
differ in more or less important respects, any number of test-tubes con-
taining a culture medium of precisely the same composition can be

--prepared.
     Changes of Function. Everyone who has cultivated bacteria over long

periods of time will probably have noticed more or less conspicuous

changes in some of their functional activities, e.g., that the power of

liqtiefying gelatin, possessed by some, has become diminished, or that

the power of producing pigments has become impaired, or perhaps has.

actually disappeared altogether. Or, again, it may frequently be observed

that an organism which had originally the power of fermenting some

particular substance has lost this power through prolonged culture, and,

indeed, even a single passage through gelatin may sometimes apparently

mydestroy the capacity to exercise this function. Thus, I have in

possession a bacillus which has the power of fermenting calcium citrate,

and this function it continues to exercise for years if grown in suitable

media. On submitting such a fermentins solution of calcium citrate to

plate cultivation, colonies make their  appearance  in  due course                                                   but  on
                                                                                                                  ;

transferring one of the colonies to a sterile solution of calcium citrate it

invariably fails to set up a fermentation, the bacillus having by mere

passage through the gelatin-medium lost its fermenting power. If,

however, a similar colony be put into broth containing calcium citrate

the latter is readily fermented ; on now inoculating from this to a weaker
broth containing calcium citrate this also is put into fermentation, and

by successively passing in this manner to weaker and weaker broths con-

taining calcium citrate we may ultimately set up fermentation in a
calcium citrate solution which was absolutely unfermentable when the

bacilli were taken directly from the gelatin plate (' Micro-organisms in

their Relation to Chemical Change,' Royal Institution, 1892).

A striking example of permanent loss of function is described by

Laurent (' Ann. de I'lnst. Pasteur,' iv. [1890], p. 465) in the case of the

Bacillus ruber of Kiel ; an organism which, as its name implies, pro-

duces a red pigment. Laurent found that if cultures of this bacillus were

exposed to bright sunlight for a period of three hours the subsequent

cultures were almost invariably colourless, and so permanent was this,

loss of pigment-producing power that thirty-two successive cultures,

carried on over a period of a year, failed to restore it.

If such numerous bacterial varieties can be artificially induced in the

laboratory, it is surely highly probable, in fact all but certain, that

similar modifications have been, and are still, continually arising amongst

the bacteria growing amidst natural surroundings This anticipation is

fully borne out by the direct examination of the bacterial forms occurring

in nature. It is a most striking and significant fact that in the case of
almost any micro-organism which has received special attention on

account of some particular property which it possesses, e.g., pathogenic

power, a careful examination of the natural habitat of such an organism

has almost invariably led to the discovery of one and often many other
ON BACTERIOLOGY IN ITS RELATIONS TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE. 453

bacteria resembling the particular one in question in almost every

--respect, but differing in one or more details certainly not more important

details than those which we have seen can be artificially produced in the
laboratory. Let me cite a few examples of such natural varieties, as we

may call them.
    The hacillus of anthrax we know under natural conditions may, and

frequently does, temporarily reside in the soil ; it would not be surprising,

'therefore, to find in the soil some organism presenting more or less

likeness to this bacillus. As a matter of fact, not only has an organism

indistinguishable from anthrax in all save its pathogenic properties been

discovered in the soil by Hueppe and Cartwrigbt Wood, but these investi-

gators further proved the excessively close relationship of this soil bacillus

to the anthrax bacillus by the observation that rabbits and even mice

inoculated with the soil bacillus were protected against subsequent

inoculation with virulent anthrax, as though they had been vaccinated

with an attenuated anthrax virus (' Lancet,' February, 1889 ; ' Berlin,

klin. Wochenschrift,' No. 16, 1889).

The dipJitheria bacillus of Loeffler ('Centralbl. f. Bakteriol.,' ii. [1887],

p. 105) was found by him in the false membranes of the throat associated
tvith another bacillus, almost indistinguishable from it, excepting that it

had no toxic effect on animals. Roux and Yersin ('Ann. de I'lnst. Pasteur,'

iv. [1890], p. 385) have, moreover, found that this Sacillus pseudo-
diphtheric'us, as it is called, is frequently present in the pharyngeal mucous

·membrane of healthy children.

The cholera hacillus of Koch, again, as we have already seen, is not

only subject to very considerable variations in form and functions accord-

ing to the particular place or epidemic from which it has been obtained,

-- --but its natural habitats -the human intestine and natural waters have

both been found to yield forms which are distinguishable from it only

with the greatest diflficulty.

The typhoid bacillus of Eberth-Gaffky, again, is distinguishable only

with the greatest difficulty from a number of pseudo-forms occurring in

--its natural habitats the human intestine and natural waters.

Closely connected with these phenomena are doubtless also aiirohic

and anaerobic growth. As is well known, bacteria may be divided into

--three classes, according to their relationship to oxygen :

(1) Compulsorily aerobic, or those organisms which will only grow

in the presence of free oxygen; (2) facultatively aerobic and anaerobic,

or those organisms which can grow either in the presence or absence of

free oxygen                                               (3)  compulsorily anaerobic, or  those  organisms  which will
                                                       ;

only grow in the absence of free oxygen. The phenomenon of aerobic

growth would appear, of course, to be the normal one ; but in many of

the decompositions brought about by bacteria such large quantities of

-- --gases especially carbonic anhydride and hydrogen are evolved that

all free oxygen is rapidly swept out of the medium in which the bacteria

are carrying on their operations. Under these circumstances, then, any

bacteria which are entirely dependent on oxygen would have their

vitality either destroyed or suspended, whilst those which can maintain

themselves either temporarily or permanently in the absence of oxygen

must be at a great advantage, inasmuch as they can continue their vital

processes in the oxygen-deprived medium which they have themselves

created. In this way we can imagine how originally aerobic organisms

endowed with the capacity of decomposing certain substances with the
                                                                                                        ;

--454
                            REPORT 1893.

evolution of gases (CO2, H, &c.) have gradually become modified so as

to endure for longer and longer periods of time the exclusion of oxygen

and finally some forms have become so far modified as to only find the
means of livelihood in the entire absence of oxygen, or, in other v/ords,

they have become obligatorily anaerobic.

     Thus, whilst Pasteur ascribes fermentation to the life of micro-organ-

isms in the absence of oxygen, it appears to me that the life of micro-

oi'ganisms in the absence of oxygen is necessitated by their power of

bringing about fermentative changes which banish oxygen from the
medium ; in fact, the fermentative capacity is probably antecedent to the

anaerobic capacity.

Direct experiments as to how far aei'obic micro-organisms can be

trained to thrive in the absence of oxygen, and vice versa, are urgently

wanted ; but there is already sufficient evidence that fermentative capacity

is not dependent on absence of oxygen. I have already referred to this sub-

ject in connection with yeast fermentation, but it is equally true of bacterial

fermentations also; thus my Bacilhis ethaceticus ferments most vigorously

in the presence of air, but it would, of course, not be a fermenting organ-

ism in the commonly accepted sense of the word if it could not also

ferment in the absence of air, because in ordinary fermentations, as there

is no provision made for the continuous supply of air, if the organism

were obligatorily aerobic, the fermentation would at once cease as soon

as the oxygen initially present was used up.

These views are moreover in entire harmony with the observations of

other investigators concerning fermentation bacteria. Thus amongst the

most obligatorily anaerobic organisms with which we are acquainted is
the common butyric ferment, the so-called Bacillus amylohacter, which

can only be cultivated in the entire absence of oxygen. It must not,^

however, be imagined that the butyric fermentation is dependent upon

the absence of oxygen, for Hueppe has isolated and described a bacillus

which, whilst bringing about the same butyric fermentations as the B.

amylobacter, is aerobic. Of the primitive bacteria possessing the power

of exciting butyric fermentation we must conclude, therefore, that the

ancestors of the B. amylobacter became so far modified by long-continued

residence amidst anaiirobic surroundings as to have apparently lost the

power of aerobic growth altogether, whilst the ancestors of Hueppe's

butyric bacillus, having undergone less specialisation, can still flourish

either in the presence or absence of air.

     These instances which I have selected are only a few out of a large
number of similar cases which are recorded in literature, but they are

sufficient surely for anyone whose mind is not burdened and biassed by

preconceived ideas concerning species to draw their conclusions as to the

mutability of bacteria, whilst they show the rare opportunities which are

afforded by these micro-organisms for experimentally studying some of

the phenomena of evolution.

  --Sanitary Aspects of Bacteriology. The advances in bacteriology which

impossible for me in the time which is available to present to you even

the merest outline sketch of the enormous amount of work which has

been done during recent years in this department. I will confine myself

to a few points which appear to me to be of more particular interest to
ON BACTERIOLOGY IN ITS RELATIONS TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE, 455

chemists. Thus the investigation of numerous hygienic questions, more

especially relating to water supply and sewage disposal, forms a very

important part of professional chemistry, and the bearing of recent
bacteriological research on these questions must of necessity, therefore,

be of peculiar interest to many chemists. When the bacteriological

examination of water first came into vogue some eight or nine years ago
there was a general impression amongst enthusiasts for the new science

that it would, in a very short time, entirely supersede the chemical ex-

amination owing to the inability of the latter to distinguish between dead

and living organic matter, and to reveal the presence of disease-producing
organisms. From the newly established bacteriological laboratories

on the Continent there emanated in rapid succession publications in
which standards of bacteriological purity for water were hastily set up

by men who, whilst doubtless very skilful bacteriologists, were quite

ignorant of the subject of water supply, with its numerous complicating

factors. It is quite unnecessary for me to enter into a discussion of these

standards of purity, because happily they have been banished from the

vocabulary of those who have had any considerable experience in these

matters.

    Many persons, again, have been, and are still, under the impression

that the main object of an examination of water is to ascertain whether

it contains materials capable of causing disease, and that the inability of

chemical analysis to answer this question proves its inutility. The

absurdity of this view is so manifest, and the misconception to which it

is due so obvious, that its wide prevalence is my only excuse for referring

Ato it.   water examination which only reveals the unsuitability of the

water when disease germs are actually present in it can surely be of

little value indeed, inasmuch as the mischief will in all probability have

been already done before the examination has been made or thought of.

The object of a water examination should obviously be to ascertain

whether a water is liable to be a source of danger, and not whether it

is actually dangerous at the moment of examination. Now I have no
hesitation in saying, and I have frequently expressed it as my opinion

during this controversy, that a proper chemical analysis is able to throw

more important light on this question than a bacteriological examination.

    On the other hand, I have from the very first turned to bacteriology

for an answer to some questions concerning the hygienic aspects of water,

which I am equally strongly of opinion cannot be answered by chemical

methods of examination at all. Already in 1885 I pointed out in a paper

to the Royal Society, ' On the Removal of Micro-organisms from Water,'
and elsewhere how the then recently introduced methods of bacterio-

logical research enabled us for the first time to ascertain the real hygienic

value of methods of water purification, both artificial and natural, such as

sand filtration, subsidence, precipitation as in Clark's process, natural

filtration through porous strata, &c.
     Thns I showed that the improvements effected in the quality of water

by sand filtration, by Clark's process, and by subsidence are quite insig-

-- --nificant from a chemical point of view as compared with their bacterio-

logical eflBciency. The bacteriological effect of these processes may be

illustrated by means of the following tables summarising some of my

results.

    Thus the first two tables show the remarkable efficiency of sand-

--filtration in removing micro-organisms from water:

     The above figures show the importance of storage as a means of
removing bacteria from surface waters.

     Another important matter, again, in connection with the hygiene of
water, on which bacteriology alone can throw light, is the fate of patho-

genic bacteria gaining access to water. This inquiry has been pursued

by a number of investigators, and has led to many interesting results.
Amongst the most important of these I may specially mention

     (1) That in some exceptional cases pathogenic bacteria are destroyed
with remarkable rapidity, in a few hours, when inti'oduced into ordinary

potable water.
                                ----

458 EEPORT-- 1893.

     (2) That in the majority of cases they can retain their vitality and

--virulence in potable vpaters for considerable periods of time days, weeks,
--and in the spore form for months or even years but that their longevity

is almost invariably, and often very greatly, cui'tailed by the common
bacteria present in all natural waters. They are thus generally far more
persistent when introduced into sterilised than into nnsterilised water.

     (3) "With few exceptions the pathogenic bacteria which have been
experimented with do not undergo any extensive multiplication in potable
waters, although such multiplication is frequent in the case of foul waters

like sewage.

    Bacteriological examination, again, has greatly fortified the now

generally accepted views as to the communication of typhoid fever and
Asiatic cholera through the medium of drinking water by the actual dis-
covery of the typhoid and cholera bacilli in waters which had been

suspected of distributing these diseases.
     It is precisely in this particular of bacteriological water examination

that great advances have been recently made. The searching for patho-
genic bacteria in a potable water must always be very much like looking
for a needle in a haystack, and it has been abundantly shown that the

ordinary process of plate-cultivation is, excepting in rare cases, quite

inadequate for this quest, owing to the crowding out of the few ])atho-
genic by the overwhelming majority of non-pathogenic forms. It has, in
fact, become more and more evident that, in order to discover any

--particular organism pathogenic or otherwise, for the matter of that

which is present in a very small minority, it is necessary to submit the
water or other material under examination to a preliminary treatment
before proceeding to plate-cultivation. This preliminary treatment must
be so conceived and executed as to foster the multiplication of the
particular organism of which we are in quest relatively to that of those
organisms which are of no interest, and thus secure a majority of the
former at the ensuing plate-cultivation, when no difficulty will arise in

detecting its presence. Such special methods of examination are now in

constant use for the detection of both the cholera and typhoid bacilli in

water.

     It will thus be seen that by combining chemical and bacteriological
methods of examination our knowledge of water hygiene has been very
greatly extended during recent years.

     In the matter of sewage treatment the most laborious investigations,
in which both chemical and bacteriological methods of examination were
simultaneously employed, have been made by the Massachusetts Board
of Health. The results of these investigations show, as would indeed be
expected, that intermittent filtration through soil, if properly carried out,
is the most efficient not only from a chemical but also from a bacterio-
logical point of view, and in the chemical precipitation of sewage there is,

in general, a much greater removal of micro-organisms than of organic

matter, or, in other words, the bacteriological efficiency of these precipita-

--tion processes is generally much greater than their chemical efficiency.
     Bactericidal Action of Light. Although I have not time to enter into

the subject of disinfection in its entirety i.e., the destruction of bacteria

--by chemicals and other agencies there is a section of this subject on

which I should not omit to say a few words, viz., the disinfecting or

bactericidal action of light.

     Very soon after bacteria had been introduced to the general pubRc
                                           --

        ON BACTERIOLOGY IN ITS RELATIONS TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE. 459

through the earlier researches of Pasteur, Lister, Burdon Sanderson, and
Tyndall, now about a quarter of a century ago, the important discovery
was made by Downes and Bhint that these minute organisms were
remarkably susceptible to direct sunshine.' Notwithstanding the
novelty of the subject and the peculiar difficulties which then attended
such researches, these two investigators worked out their discovery in

such a very complete manner that I am of opinion it should be regarded

as one of the most important additions made to the subject of bacteriology
prior to the introduction of the more modern methods of studying
bacteria. They clearly showed that this bactericidal action of sunlight is
independent of any rise in temperature ; that they are the rays at the blue
end of the spectrum which are the most effective, the red rays being

almost quite inert ; further, that the action is highly favoured if not
entirely dependent on the simultaneous presence ot oxygen. Again,
they showed that the action was quite independent of the presence of any
culture medium, for if bacteria which had been suspended in distilled
water were allowed to become air-dry on glass they were destroyed by
subsequent insolation. Again, they found that the culture media which
they employed (Pasteur solution) were not rendered anfit by insolation
for the subsequent cultivation of micro-organisms. Another highly
important point to which they drew attention was that the action of sun-

light is much less effective if the bacteria are suspended in water than if
they are present in culture solutions. They further showed that mould

and yeast forms were Jess susceptible to light than bacteria, and they
even extended their investigations to the soluble ferment invertase, the
activity of which they also found succumbed to insolation. These classical
investigations have been confirmed in practically every detail by the
subsequent researches made with pure c.'iltures of particular bacteria by
Duclaux,^ Arloing,'* Straus,'* Roux,'' Gaillard,^ Uffelraann,^ Panzini,"8
Laurent,^ Santorini,"* Janowski,'' Geisler,'^ Kotljar,'^ Buchner,'*
Moment,''' Marshall Ward, and myself."'

     Of special interest in connection with this subject are some recent
experiments by Richardson,'^ who shows that when urine is exposed to
direct sunshine peroxide of hydrogen is formed, the presence of which
prevents the development of growths. There are several very interesting
and important points arising out of this investigation :

     1. There can be no doubt that peroxide of hydrogen was formed in.

Richardson's culture medium (urine) during insolation, and that this

insolated urine possessed antiseptic properties. In this respect Richard-

son's experiments confirm certain previous observations made by Roux,

;but are in opposition to those of all other investigators who have devoted

tittention to this point. Thus Roux found that by the insolation of broth

in the presence of air it became unfit for the germination of anthrax

spores. Several other investigators, including Panzini and Janowski,

have repeated this experiment with different culture materials, but have

failed to confirm it. Roux's results were, however, so very definite that

it has always seemed to me impossible to doubt their accuracy, and I

have attributed the discrepancy between his results and those of others

to some difference in the conditions under which the experiments were

made. The definite proof which has now been furnished by Richardson

that peroxide of hydrogen is formed in some culture media by insolation,

and that the conditions necessary for the formation and preservation of

this antiseptic substance are by no means perfectly understood, cleai'ly

shows that Roux and his opponents may both be right, and that the

different results arrived at depend upon differences in the conditions under

which the experiments were carried out, the nature of which differences

is at present not understood. That Roux's insolated broth was rendered

unfit for the germination of anthrax spores by the presence of peroxide of

hydrogen is almost certain also from the fact that he found such insolated

broth to recover its original nutritive properties if it was kept in the dark

or in diffused daylight for a certain length of time.

2. The proof of the formation of peroxide of hydrogen during

insolation naturally suggests the question whether the whole bactericidal

effect of light is due to this material, or whether it only partially accounts

for the phenomenon. This important question is one which it is far from

easy to answer owing to the almost insuperable difficulty of securing

conditions under which the generation of peroxide of hydrogen is

Weimpossible.     will examine some of the expei-iments which bear on

this point :

(a) Downes and Blunt foand that germs which had been air-dried on

glass were destroyed by subsequent insolation.

    (b) Moment found that anthrax spores dried fw twelve hours by means

of a sulphuric acid vacuum subsequently withstood insolation for upwards

of 100 hours.

(c) Marshall Ward dried anthrax spores on glass at 70° C, and

found that they were subsequently rapidly destroyed by insolation.

In none of these three sets of experiments can the conditions be

regarded as precluding the possibility of the formation of peroxide of

hydrogen. Moisture must certainly have been present in Downes' and

Blunt's experiments, and in smaller quantity in Marshall Ward's. In

Moment's experiments the desiccation was doubtless the most complete,

and at first sight the long insolation endured by his desiccated spores is

very significant ; but I do not regard it as wholly conclusive owing to

the impossibility of comparing the deportment of spores of different

origin, and also to the fact that Moment used the more delicate method

-- --of detecting their vitality viz., subsequent cultivation in broth whilst

Marshall Ward used, I believe, agar or gelatin ; and Downes and Blunt,

--Pasteur solution culture media which are not as sensitive as broth.

There are other experiments, again, which bear upon the same subject.

Thus Richardson has shown that the formation of peroxide of hydrogen
            --

        ON BACTERIOLOGY IN ITS RELATIONS TO CHEMICAL SCIENCE. 461

is due to the presence of some ingredient or ingredients in the urine, and
that it is not formed by the insolation of water, or even of a solution of
urea. If, then, the bacteria are suspended in water during insolation,
there can be no generation of peroxide of hydrogen in the liquid. Now,

as I have already pointed out in connection with my own experiments, a

number of investigators are agreed that bacteria are much more resistant
to insolation when suspended in water than when suspended in culture

matea-ials. It is, however, equally certain that they are actually de-

stroyed, and sometimes even with great rapidity, when suspended in

water. Now this at first sight would appear to demonstrate that the

bactericidal effect of light, although accelei'ated by the generation of

peroxide of hydrogen, may also take place without it. But we have

already admitted the possibility of the generation of peroxide of hydrogen
within the cells of imperfectly dried bacteria and their spores, so that it
is surely still more easy to believe in the production of this material
within the cells suspended in water to which air has access.

     The evidence so far would appear to indicate, therefore, that, whilst
the genei'ation of peroxide of hydrogen is undoubtedly in many cases an

active factor in the bactericidal influence of light, it is still uncertain
whether it is indispensable for the process.

     The question obviously raises another and far more general question

--which has long been before the chemical world viz., as to how far

--oxidation can take place at all in the entire absence of water- va^iour and

the evidence on this larger question goes entirely to show that all

apparently direct low-temperature oxidations require the presence of
water vapour. And, inasmuch as the bactericidal action of light ia
unquestionably a case of low-temperature oxidation there is the strongest
presumptive evidence, as well as weighty experimental evidence, that

water vapour, which practically means peroxide of hydrogen or some

similar material, is essential for its manifestation.

     One of the most important circumstances, from a practical point of

view, connected with this bactericidal action of light is the greatly

increased resistance which is exhibited by bacteria when suspended in
water. On this subject I have for some time past been conducting some
experiments, and although these are not yet by any means concluded, I
may take this opportunity of referring to some of the results at which I
have arrived. In the first place, I would point out how fallacious must

be any comparison between the length of insolation withstood by even
one and the same micro-organism in the hands of different observers, as

so much depends upon their previous history and treatment. Thus I
have found that the spores of anthrax produced at the ordinary room
temperature (18-20° C.) are far more resistant than anthrax spores

which have been obtained in an incubator at 35-38° C. It is necessary,
therefore, in all such investigations, if comparisons are to be made,,
that the organisms should be taken from one and the same cultivation.
In endeavouring to ascertain the greater susceptibility of bacteria to light

when exposed in culture media I am proceeding by way of synthesis,
making various additions to distilled water, and then determining how

such additions affect the influence of insolation. In this manner I have-
already made some preliminary experiments with common salt and'
sodium sulphate.

     The results of one series of these experiments are recorded in the-

following table :

     2. The production of ptomaines and poisonous albuminoids.
     3. The phenomena of natural and artificial immunity, including the
much-vexed questions of phagocytosis and the bactericidal properties of
blood-serum and animal fluids.
     In all these branches of bacteriology there is not only much that is of

interest to chemists, but there is urgent need in the interests of science
that these subjects should receive the attention of chemists, for almost in
every direction in which bacteriology is advancing it is abutting on
problems which will require the most profound knowledge of chemistry

for their elucidation. In many respects, moreover, chemists are at a

great advantage in the investigation of bacteriological problems, inasmuch
as their thorough experimental training and manipulative skill afford the
very best preparation for the study of this subject, in which the inductive
method and a due appreciation of all the complicating factors which
surround an experimental inquiry are in continual requisition. It must
not, however, be supposed that a chemist can apply any bacteriological
method with the same readiness that he can carry out some new chemical
preparation from a published description. In the management of living
loacteria there are a number of points which have to be carefully borne in
mind which do not enter into one's consideration in dealing with inanimate
matter. But this step from the inanimate to the animate is not more
difficult for the chemist than for the vegetable or animal morphologist
indeed, it is perhaps not as difficult, for, whilst the morphologist is oc-
cupied only with statical considerations, in modern Chemistry our attention
is turned more and more to dynamical problems.

     In view of the vast fields of fruitful research which lie in this province

of Biological Chemistry, it appears to me that the curriculum of chemical

training should be more and more framed with a view to their successful

exploitation. It is desirable that chemical students should take zoology,

botany, and physiology as subsidiary subjects more frequently than they
do at present in order that the barrier which is often felt to exist between

Chemistry and Biology may be broken down and abolished.

    (Draivn up by C. E. De Range.)

The inception of this committee was due to Professor Hull, who was

appointed Chairman at Belfast in 1874, with your reporter as Secretary,
for the purpose of investigating the circulation of underground waters in
the permeable formations of England and Wales, and the quantity and
character of the waters supplied to various towns and districts from these
formations. It was felt last year that the labours of the Committee were
nearly completed, and that they could not terminate their labours at a

more appropriate place of meeting than Nottingham, supplied as it is by
a magnificent volume of underground water of absolute purity, and it is
of interest to note that the Chairman of the Committee, Professor Hull,
was consulted when these works were first initiated by the late Mr. M. D.

Tarbotton, C.B.

     It was last year resolved by the General Committee that your reporter
* be requested to draw up a final report embodying the whole of the facts
obtained in counties,' and ' that it is advisable that the report in question
should be issued as a separate publication.'

     In compliance with this resolution your reporter has commenced the
work of combining and systematising the previous eighteen reports, but
he regrets that through pressure of ofiicial and other duties it has been
impossible for him to complete the same, but he trusts to do so before
the meeting at Oxford in 1894, when your committee will complete the
twentieth year of their existence. The counties will be divided into five
groups, and the report into as many separate sections, which your Com-
mittee recommend be sold separately.

     Your reporter would in any case have ventured to suggest the con-
tinuance of the Committee for another year, in consequence of the excep-
tional season experienced, which has rendered it highly important to
endeavour to trace the effect of the drought on underground water
supply, and to institute a special inquiry as to the downward movement

of the vinderground water line throughout the porous rocks of the
country, and also as the rate of replacement of water by subsequent rains.

     From observations made by Mr. E. J. Lowe, F.R.S., at Shirenewton
Hall, Worcestershire, it appears that the entire rainfall of March and
April was only 0'6 in., that from March to August 17 only 9'7 in., that

48 rainy days occurred, and 122 days without any rain : this, combined
with an almost continuous high temperature, caused excessive evapora-
tion of such rainfall as took place, the shade temperature being above
eighty degrees seven days in April, one in May, six in June, five in
July, and eight in August up to the 17th. Before the thunderstorm
of June 15, on which I'Ol inch fell, the ground was dry to a depth of
fifteen inches, but the rain only penetrated two inches from the surface.

     The drought has made clearly apparent the weakness of gravitation

supplies, the qnality of the water in the best reservoirs steadily deterio-

rating as the quantity stored is reduced. The great value of underground
supplies is as strongly brought out by the present yield of the Gains-
borough Local Board well. It was sunk by Messrs. Timmins, Runcorn,
at the recommendation of your reporter. The boring is now 1,351 feet in
depth, and gives, in spite of the drought, the magnificent yield of 20,000
gallons per hour. The boring is artesian, the water rising from beneath

725 feet of Keuper Marls, being derived from the New Red Sandstone

several miles distant.

     Your Committee seek re-election, and reserve details received this
year for incorporation in their final report next year. The Committee
regret to have to note the death of their able Leicestershire member,
Mr. James Plant, F.G.S., whose work has been of great value to the
Committee and to the inquiry generally.

     I. The Phylloearida, from North Wales, referred to in the last report
(for 1892, p. 299) as having been lent by Mr. G. J. Williams, F.G.S., of
Blaenau-Ffestiniog, have been duly examined, and several described and
figured, together v^ith some other specimens, in the ' Geological Maga-
zine ' for May, 1893, pp. 198-203, plate 10, by T. R. Jones and H. Wood-
ward. These comprise Peltocaris Salteriana, sp. nov. (fig. 1), Diptero-
carts Etheridgei, J. and W., 1884 (fig. 3), Aptychopsis Williamsii, sp. nov.
(fig. 7), Ceratioearis insperata, Salter, 1866 (figs. 8 and 9) ; besides a
fragment? (fig. 6), an undetermined specimen (cut, p. 203), a Conularia
(fig. 2), and twoMytiloid shells (figs. 4 and 5).

     The other specimens were :

     Hymenocaris vertnicauda (Salter). Four pieces from the Middle Lin-

gula-flags at Borth, and (Middle ?) in the cutting near Wern ; and (not

rare) from the Upper- Tremadoc beds at Garth Hill ; all near Portmadoc.
     Saccocaris major (Salter). Small individual from the Upper Tremadoc

at Tuhwnt i'r Bwlch.
    Idnguloearis siliquiformis (Jones). From the Upper Tremadoc, at

Garth Hill.

     II. Several Estherice, from the Permian strata of Germany, submitted
for examination by Baron Albert von Reinach, of Frankforfc-on-the-Main,
prove to be

      1. Estheria striata (Miinster), var. Muensieriana, nov., Plate I.,

figs. 1, 2.

    Length, 3"66 mm. ; hinge-line, 2'46 mm. ; height, 2'0 mm.

Near to the var. Beinertiana, Jones ('Monograph Fossil Estherice,'

Paljeont. Soc, 1862, p. 25, pi. 1, figs. 11-14), but more angular and

sloping posteriorly, and not nearly so truncate on that border as in var.

Binneyana, Jones, loc. cit., fig. 9 ; nor rounded, as in var. Tateana, Jones,

loc. cit., figs. 15 and 18.

Like the before-mentioned varietal forms of Estheria striata, this has a

straighter back than shown in the figures given by Goldfuss and De Ko-

ninck, and a sharper postero-dorsal angle than seen in any of the published

Wefigures.  may mention that fig. 8, pi. 1, ' Monogr. Foss. Esther.,' is less

posteriorly; fig. 9 is more truly oblong; figs. 11 and 13 are more oblique,

sloping posteriorly ;  fig. 15 is oblique,   but  shorter  than figs.             11  and 13
                                                                                                                        ;

and fig. 18 is shorter and snbquadrate.

The indications of interstitial ornament are feebly evident in. some of

those mentioned above, and we cannot find any in these now under ex-

amination.

     Differing from the foregoing varieties it should be regarded, we think,
as another variety, which we wish to specialise as Estheria striata, var.
Muensteriana, thus naming it after Count l^Iiinster, who was one of the

earliest observers of these Palaeozoic Phyllopods and of other fossil

bivalve Entomostraca.

     In its postero-dorsal angle and long hinge-line this form much

resembles the recent Estheria Buhidgei, Baird (' Proceed. Zool. Soc.,' 1862,

pi. 15, fig. 3).

     Fig. 1 illustrates the two valves lying together on the matrix, and
in fig. 2 the left valve is seen without any perspective.

     It is in bluish-grey Lebach shale of the lower part of the Rothliegende
(Permian), at Altenstadt in the Wetterau, Grand Duchy Hessen, where
it was discovered by Baron A. von Reinach with other fossils, namely,
Xenacanthus Decheni, Goldfuss ; Acantliodes, sp. ; Branchiosaurus amhlyo-
stomus, Credner (Proiriton petrolei, Gaudry), and some of the leading

plants of the Permian series.
     In these Lower Lebach shales from Altenstadt, Wetterau, A. von

Reinach also found numerous small Ostracodes, which T. R. Jones and

J. W. Kirkby have determined ^ as

       Leperditia Okeni (Miinster), very common.

2. Estheria Beinachii, sp. nov., Plate L, fig. 3.

Length,     3'2 mm.                                         hinge-line,                           1'73 mm. ;    height,         1'86 mm.
                                                         ;

This suboval Estheria, represented by two united valves (concave and

one imperfect), is shorter and proportionally higher than fig. 2, and has

a much shorter hinge-line, which is straight, and not quite equal in

length to the height of the valve. The umbo is not so near to the

antero-dorsal angle as it is in figs. 1 and 2, and therefore the ridges or

lines  of growth    are                                     less  obliquely concentric                             with         the  umbo                               they are
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

separate it as a species, and we give it the name E. Beinachii, after

Albert von Reinach, who discovered it in the light-grey shale of the

Upper Lebach Beds in the Engelthal, near Alteustadt, in the Wetterau.

3. Estheria Oeinitzii, sp. nov., Plate I., fig. 4.

Length, 1'4 mm.; hinge-line, I'O mm. ; height, 1'05 mm.

This (left valve) is subquadrate, with the anterior and ventral more

iully rounded than the posterior border. The back is straight, and the

umbo is at its front end.

This somewhat approaches to the shorter and deep (high) forms of

Estheria minuta (' Monogr. Foss. Esther.,' pi. 2, figs. 1, 5), but is readily

distinguishable. It is still nearer in shape to a form of ^. Maagaliensis,

op. cit., pi. 2, figs. 20, 23, but the latter has not the postero-dorsal

Eangle sufficiently pronounced. . suhquadrata (' Geol. Mag.,' 1890, pi. 12,

fig. 2) has some resemblance to the form shown by fig. 4, but it is not

truncate anteriorly, and its postero-dorsal angle is weak.

The steep slope of the front edge, the full ventral curve, the contracted

posterior moiety, and the well-pronounced postero-dorsal angle distin-

Weguish this form from any yet published.                                                                          dedicate it to our old friend

Hofrath H. B. Geinitz, of Dresden, who has always been deeply inter-

·ested in fossil Entomostraca and in the strata from which those of the
Wetterau have been obtained.

This short form, deep (high) in its anterior moiety, is abundant

{gregarious) in a dark greenish-grey, nearly black shale, ferruginous on

one face, of the Lebach Beds, from the Boos Tunnel, on the Rhine-Nahe

Railway, and on the same geological horizon as at Altenstadt.

      4. Estheria Geinitzii, var. Grebeana, nov., Plate I., fig. 5.

    Length, 1-2 mm. ; hinge-line, 1'05 mm. ; height, 0'9 mm.

     Fig. 5 (right valve) is subtriangular and diSers from fig. 4, owing to
the great proportional length of the hinge-line and the less fully rounded

free margins. The front border is truncate, sloping downwards and in-
wards and the hinder margin slopes downwards at once and forwards,,

                                        ;

and not partly outwards as in fig. 4.
     These differences in outline do not seem to be due to bad preservation,

for the ridges are truly concentric with the margins, as far as they are

exposed; but they are varietal, if not sexual. Hence fig. 5 may be

distinguished as var. Qreheana, after Herr Grebe, of the Prussian Geo-

logical Service, who found it crowded together with I]. Geinitzii. in the-

hard, dark-coloured Lebach shale from the railway tunnel near Boos, a

village about a kilometre from Miinster-on-the-Nahe.

     III. In Katzer's ' Geologic von Bohmen,' III. Abtheilung, 1892, the-
following fossil Phyllopoda are mentioned :

P. WQ'd, Estheria cyanea, Fr., from Lubna ? (Lubno).

P. 1156      ,, ^eweMa (Jordan), from Nvirschan (Nyfany), 1 Post-Car-
P. 1156
             ,, sp., from Tfemosna,                                                       J boniferous.

Since that date our friend Dr. Anton Fritsch has shown us some

figures of Phyllopods which probably comprise those referred to above.

These figures are, 1, an Esthena, from the lowest horizon of the Permian

system of Bohemia, in the bituminous shale of Nyran, near Pilsen ; 2,

E. cyanea, sp. nov., Pritsch, from the Middle Permian, in bituminous

shale  from  Kaunova                                              3,  an Estheria,  from  Upper Permian  bituminous
                                                               ;

shale at Kastialov ; 4, an Estheria from the limestone with Palceonicus-

Vratislavensis of the Uppermost Permian at Braunau ; 5, an Estheria,.

also from the Uppermost Permian Limestone. These, with some Ostra-

codes, will be published in due course by Dr. A. Fritsch in his ' Fauna,

der Gaskohle,' some parts of which have been already issued.
     IV. S. S. Gorby, State Geologist, has issued some ' Advance Sheets

from the Eighteenth Report of the Geological Survey of Indiana,' 8vo,.

Indianapolis, September, 1892, in which the Paleontology is done by
S. A. Miller and S. A. Casseday (see p. 23). Some Phyllocaridce of
the family of Pinacaridce are treated of, and at p. 77, pi. 9, fig. 37,

the post-abdomen (trifid) of Mesothyra Gurleyi, n. sp., from the Kinder-

hook group, at Le Grand, Iowa, is described and illustrated ; and at

p. 78, pi. 9, figs. 43-46, Maerocaris Gorbyi, n, gen. et sp., from the

Keokuk group, at "West Point, Indiana. Of this latter form fig. 43

shows the interior of the carapace- valves and four abdominal segments.

Fig. 44 gives four and part of another abdominal segment, and the post-

abdomen slightly broken at the end. Fig. 45 is eight abdominal seg-

ments and the post-abdomen. Fig. 46 is a tooth, found in the same

rocks, that may possibly belong to the internal masticatory apparatus.

     V. In the ' Canadian Record of Science,' vol. v. No. 4, October,

1892, pp. 205-208, Mr. J. F. Whiteaves gives a ' Description of a new
Genus and Species of Phyllocarid Crustacea from the Middle Cambrian of
Mount Stephen.' The fossil is shown by a figure at p. 206, and named
Anomalocaris Canadensis, gen. et sp. nov. The diagram and description

do not make it appear to us to be a Phyllocarid.

     VI. Mr. Robert Etheridge, jun., in the ' Records of the Geological

Survey of New South Wales,' vol. iii. part 1, 1892, pp. 5-8, pi. 4,

describes and figures four specimens of the Hymenocaris Salteri, M'Coy,.

and states his belief that they belong to Lingulocaris ; and, as there is-

a L. Salteriana, he thinks that they should be called L. Maccoyii.
ON THE FOSSIL PlIYLLOPODA OF THE PALJiOZOIC ROCKS. 469

     One or more specimens of this Australian species had been seen by

Mr. J. W. Salter, and referred by him to Garyocaris with some doubt.

We have adopted Mr. Salter's conclusion, both in a former report (for

1883) and in the ' Monogr. Brit. Pateoz. Phyll.,' Pal. Soc, 1892, p. 93.
Comparing Mr. Etheridge's figures with those given of Garyocaris by

ourselves (op. cit., pi. 14, figs. 11-15), we find that one of ours is as

large as any of the former, and that the modified shape of the ends of

the valves does not necessarily remove them from Garyocaris.

VII. With respect to Aptychopsis coi-di/ormis, sp. nov., and PeUocaris

anatina, Salter, mentioned at page 299 of the report for 1892, Mr. J. E.

Marr informs us that the words ' Coll. Marr ' should not have been

attached to the former in our ' Monogr. Pal. Phyll.,' pai-t 2, 1892, p. 103,

pi. 15, fig. 2, for it was collected long ago, being the only Palieozoic

shield-shaped Phyllopod in the Cambridge Museum when Salter labelled

it Peltocaris anatina, overlooking its real generic character, and perhaps

regarding it as a distorted specimen. By this name the specimen has

been referred to in lists of fossils as from the ' Wenlock,' and the real

Feltocaris, which we have named P. anatina (' Monogr. Pal. PhvU.,'

p. 114, pi. 16, figs. 4-9), is a ' Llandovery ' fossil. It seems to be ex-

pedient to give the old name anatina; instead of cordiformis, to the

Aptychopsis (p. 103), as intimated by Mr. Marr in the ' Geol. Mag.' for

December,  1892, p.  536                      and to distinguish the Feltocaris (p.      114),
                                           ;

some specimens of which were collected by Mr. Marr, as P. Marrii.

graph and referred to at page 298 of the report for 1892.

--The Eurypterid-bearing Deposits of the Pentland Hills. Report of

     the GoTtimittee, consisting of Dr. R. H. Traquair (Chairman),.

     Professor T. Eupert Jones, and Mr. Malcolm Laurie {Secretary),
     {Drawn up by Mr. M. Laurie.)

In pursuance of the object for which the Committee were appointed Mr.
Laurie spent three weeks in the Pentland Hills superintending the ex-

cavations necessary to expose the fossiliferous beds. Three men were

employed on this work, and the grant was more than expended on wages
alone. Considerable difiBculty was experienced in clearing the beds
owing to the constant falling in of the superincumbent rocks, which are

much shattered. The fossiliferous beds were removed in as large masses

as their highly-jointed condition would allow ; and it seemed best to
convey the material to some place where it could be examined at leisure.
Part of the material (about one and a half ton) lies at present at Mr.
Laurie's home in Duddingston, and the rest is safely deposited at Carlops,
not far from the spot where it was procured.

     Owing to considerable delay and difiiculty in obtaining permission
from the proprietor to make the excavations in question, Mr. Laurie has
not had time to examine more than a very small quantity of the material

procured.

     The results, so far as they go, are promising, some half-dozen good

--specimens including a large Hurypterus ? sp., Stylonurus ornatus, Dre-

--panoptems Pentlandius, &c. having been found, together with a large

number of fragments of various forms.
     Tour Committee desire to be reappointed, and request that a further

sum of 101. be granted to provide assistance in developing the material

which has been procured from the excavations.
ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF VESUVIUS.  471

--The Volcanic Phenomena of Vesttvius and its Neighbourhood.

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. H. Bauerman,

    Mr. F. W. RuDLER, Mr. J. J. H. Teall, and Professor H. J.
    Johnston-Lavis. (Draivn up by Professor H. J. Johnston-
    Lavis.)

--Vesuvius. Daring the first week of June 1892 mucli dnst-bearing

vapour escaped from the crater, but on the seventh of the month incan-
descent lava- cakes were being ejected, and a greater flow of lava was
visible in the Atrio del Cavallo. The central crater increased in activity
during the 8th and 9th, but on the 10th much dusty smoke issued during
the day, but at night no reflection was visible. The following day less
vapour was emitted, which only occasionally was darkened by dust.
During the 12th, 13th. 14th, and 15th very little vapour was visible
about the crater ; a little more, sometimes white and sometimes dark
from dust, issued from the last date till the evening of the 22nd, when a
fresh gush of lava came forth in the Atrio del Cavallo, and a few incan-
descent cakes were ejected from the crater. On the 23rd more lava and
high jets of incandescent lava-cakes were thrown out from the crater.
The volcano was much quieter the next day, followed by marked repose

during the rest of the month.'

     During the next two months little of note occurred. The lava some-
times increased, and at other times it diminished, but it practically never
stopped flowing. The central crater also varied within narrow limits,
the vapour being occasionally charged with dust when a bit of crater

edge collapsed and partly choked the main vent.

     During September much the same state persisted. No reflection was

ever visible from the central crater, though the usual column of vapour
escaped freely, and was accompanied from time to time by dust and sand.

      The month of October was a most unfavourable one, as for more than
half of the month the cone was enveloped in cloud ; but neither during this
 month nor during November and December did any marked change occur
at the central crater. Occasionally a faint but uncertain glimmer was visible
on some evenings over the main vent. Lava, as usual, continued to pour

forth, flowing first to one side and then to the other of the Atrio, so that
the point of its exit described in the former report has been raised, and a
hill sloping away to the W., N., and B. continues to rise and to obliterate
 part of the space between the great cone of Vesuvius and the escarpment
of Monte Somma.

      During November the highest point of this boss, in the Atrio del

 Cavallo, piled up as it had been by the constant guttering forth of lava,
 was crusted over and surmounted by some ruined spiracles formed in
 June of the same year (1892). At certain points of this crust most
 beautiful sublimations of aphthitalite were deposited at a low red heat. In

 removing these deposits they were found to be of a dull red incandescence,
 but digging a few centimetres deeper amongst the scoria, of a bright red

     ' For much of the daily record I am indebted to Signer Aw. Bartolo Longo, pro-

 prietor of the observatory of the Valle di Pompei, and to Signers C. M. Tosti and

 Professor V. Capaccio, the observers. Unfortunately the record is not continuous,

 but what I have been able to obtain has been carefully checked and much extended

 by my closer observations on the volcano.

heat ; a little hfematite was visible, and that qaite close to the aphthitalite

near the cooling surface.

The aphthitalite occurred in thin plate-like crystals, very much resem-

bling those of specular iron. They were simple hexagonal plates or com-

pound featbers                                                                    only in the smaller crystals were the rhombohedral faces
                                                                               ;

developed along the edges of the plate. Some were white with a faint

opalescent tinge, but that variety was rare. Others were more opalescent

and some quite milky. These latter shaded into examples of the most

beautiful cerulean blue, and thence through varying tints of bird's-egg

green to light chrome green and greenish yellow. The blue was due to

copper impurities, and the green to iron and copper sulphates combined.

The crystallisation was best developed in the whiter or more translucent

specimens. Crystals of different tints were often blotched with a reddish

coppery lustre, due to the contemporaneous deposition of fine transparent

laminte of htematite.

In some fissures of the hot lava were moss-like deposits of the

mineral euchlorine (called by Scacchi encloruia), of bright emerald green

colour. The deposit of this, however, was very limited. Several rifts
in the new lavas have been most beautifully coated with very delicate

feathery deposits of mixed sodium and potassium chlorides. Some had

grown to such dimensions and solidity that they could be removed. This

form of sublimate, although one of the commonest, is extremely rare in

collections, for it is so fine and light that the slightest current of air

I'educes it to a fine powder.

At other spots thick saline crusts were deposited, but these proved to

be very composite in nature, consisting of mixed sulphates and chlorides

of the alkalies and alkaline earths, with much iron and a little copper.

If we carefully examine the history of eruptions at Vesuvius in which

a record of the time and place of sublimates is made, and if we make

constant observations of the vapour components, one fact becomes evident.

The vapour that first escapes from boiling lava when it reaches the

surface of the earth consists in great part of sulphurous acid and

probably alkaline sulphites. Later, and more slowly, the hydrochloric

acid and chlorides volatilise. Thus, when much new lava is issuing

sulphurous acid is very obvious at the central crater, and around this

incrustations of sulphur and sulphites prevail over chlorides, which are

only deposited or produced by the escape of hydrochloric acid gas at

more distant fumaroles. At the point of exit of the lava sulphites are

deposited, but after the lava has flowed some distance chlorides are more

abundant.

In May of this year when visiting the Atrio at the point of exit of the

lava a phenomenon, of which I have never seen or heard of the like,

could be studied. One of the curious conical spiracles, similar to those I

described in the report of this committee for 1891, was puffing away with

violent intermittent but not i-hythmic blasts, and with the occasional

escape of small fragments of lava. Watching this action, the cause of

which has always appeared to me obscure, I noticed a large ball of

incandescent pasty lava appear at the mouth of the spiracle at intervals,

and as soon as the high pressure vapour found exit by its side it again

fell back, and for a moment or two almost completely stopped any vapour

escaping. It seemed to have nearly blocked the lower opening from

which at times it was blown up by the vapour when the pressure in-

creased. In fact it was somewhat like a ball valve. After watching this
ON XIIE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF VESUVIUS.  473

lively display for nearly an hoar we were at last rewarded by the spiracle
clearing its throat of this obstruction, and its puffing became much more
regular, softer, and more constant. I secured this expectorated ball which
the spiracle had been so long in ejecting, and after allowing an hour for

it to cool brought it home as an addition to my collection. I found

round this spiracle several other such balls some 15 to 20 cm. in diameter,
showing that the process had been repeated several times. The balls
might be well taken for the so-called bombs, and is an explanation of a
new though unimportant source of some of the structures included under
the indefinite term of volcanic bomb.

     It is deeply to be regretted that the numbering of the dykes in the

Atrio del Cavallo, which cost so much labour and even money, is rapidly

disappearing.

   --Campi Phlegraei. The tunnel for the upper sewer in Naples has

traversed the trachyte and entei-ed a series of tuffs ; but I propose to

treat of these, as well as the peculiar piperno-like deposit of the Corroglio

sewer, in another report or elsewhere, as the work is not yet quite
complete. Here the peculiar piperno-like deposit has been traversed and

a yellow tuff" reached.

    Few facts of importance, either of a local or general vulcanological

interest, have during the year come to light; but while in Naples I
continue to keep a sharp look-out, and record any facts of interest.

     The reporter has to state that most of his available time during last
winter was occupied in working out the eozoonal-like structures of the
altered limestones of Monte Somma, a memoir on which subject has

been presented to the Royal Dublin Society by Dr. J. W. Gregory and

himself, in which they hope to have proved that these structures are all
the result of metamorphism.

YouK Committee have the honour to append to this their fourth report

a. list of geological photographs added to the collection during the past
year. The number shows an increase as compared with the previous

year, and probably indicates the average number now to be expected

within a similar period, if the operations of the Committee be continued.
For the greater part, the photographs included in the present list are
recent, having been taken during 1892-93, while those inserted in previous
lists included a number which were photographed some years ago. It

may be concluded that, among photographs of older date, the most

important are already registered in the collection, and that future addi-

tions will consist chiefly of new photographs. The Committee will, of

course, gladlj'^ receive copies of older views showing features of geological
interest, whenever such can be obtained, as these are frequently valuable
for purposes of comparison with more recent pictures.

     The Committee are again pleased to report a higher scientific quality
of the views sent in, showing that the object of the Committee in securing

illustrations of natural features of geological importance is becoming

better appreciated.

     The number of photographs received and registered from the date of
the last report (June 1892) to the end of July 1893 is 140, bringing
the total contents of the collection to 840. The new additions illustrate

    No contributions have been received from Ireland since the last report.

A further series of views is, however, being prej^ared for the Committee
by Miss M. K. Andrews, of Belfast, and by Mr. Wm. Gray, Belfast.

     The completion of photographic records of the various counties will
be a woi'k of time. Local societies are now giving greater attention to
the subject, and when these eS'orts are systematically conducted the

result will doubtless be satisfactory. The Committee are indebted to the

delegates of the corresponding societies for their aid in bringing the
ON PHOTOaRAPHS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.  475

matter so prominently before their membera. It is hoped tliat by next
year contributions from several localities not hithei'to represented in the

collection will be received as the result of the special efforts now being
made with this object.

     Tour Committee held a meeting at Edinburgh on August 5, 1892^

and discussed plans for the furtherance of the work. Among other

matters it was decided to obtain an expression of opinion from members
who are practical photographers as to the best form of camera for use in.

the field. In geological expeditions it is necessary to consider the weight

of impedimenta when the distance traversed is long or arduous. Several

--members advocated a small ^-plate camera or 'Kodak,' from the negatives

of which enlargements can be made a plan successfully adopted in several
instances. Mr. J. Hopkinson finds this form of instrument less successful
with Tertiary sections, and writes : ' They require monochromatic or
orthochromatic plates.' The best photograph for the Committee's purpose
is that which shows the details of rock-structure most clearly, irrespective
of size of plate. The Committee will be glad to hear the further opinions
of members as to suitable instruments for field photography.

      Several applications have been received for the loan of photographs
from the collection for the purpose of being exhibited at soirees and
meetings of local societies. In view of the risk of loss and deterioration

of photographs so transmitted and for other obvious reasons, the Com-
mittee, while appreciating the general interest shown in their scheme^
regret their inability to sanction the loan of any part of the collection.
In order, however, to meet the wishes of societies who may desire to show
their members examples of the photographs collected by the Committee,
it has been decided to form an album containing duplicates of selected
views, which will be available for the use of societies who may apply for
the same for purposes of exhibition. Donations of duplicate prints will
be welcomed for this purpose. Applications for the loan of an album of

duplicate views should be addressed to the Secretary. Up to the present,

only some half-dozen duplicates have been received ; but it is hoped that
this number will be considerably augmented. It is proposed to include

in the ' duplicate ' series about fifty photographs. These will be useful
in spreading information in various quarters as to the requirements
of the Committee and the progress of their scheme for the collection of
geological photographs, and will doubtless lead to an extended interest
being taken in the subject.

    It may be mentioned that the Secretary was enabled during last

winter to deliver several lectures on the work of the Geological Photo-
graphs Committee in Liverpool, Chester, Manchester, Birkenhead,
Rochdale (on the invitation of the Rochdale Literary and Scientific
Society), and elsewhere. The lectures were illustrated by lantern slides
taken from photographs in the collection and from other sources.

     At the Edinburgh meeting a large selection from the collection was
exhibited in a room placed at their disposal by the Committee of
Section C. The series was augmented by special exhibits of enlarge-

ments by Dr. Tempest Anderson and Mr. W. Lamont Howie, to whom

the Committee beg to tender their thanks. In this I'oom were also

exhibited a series of photographs taken under the superintendence of the
Geological Survey of Scotland.

     The number of photographs now brought together precludes the

possibility of the whole being arranged for exhibition at every meeting of
476 REPORT-- 1893.

the Association, but, so far as local arrangements permit, it is proposed
to continue the exhibition of a selection of the views, including the
photographs presented since the previous meeting.

   ^ The system of mounting, in order to preserve the photographs from
injury (alluded to in the last report), has proved to be satisfactory ; and
the mounting and arrangement of the entire collection are now being pro-
ceeded with. The mounts adopted are of standard size, 151x12 inches,
provided with perforated edges to facilitate proper arrangement. These
will be supplied to donoi's of photographs who are willing to mount their
own views.

     Reference has been made in former reports to a proposed publication

consisting of reproductions of selected typical geological photographs.

Having fully considered the proposal, the Committee have come to the
conclusion, having strict regard to the objects for which they were ap-
pointed, that this matter lies beyond their province ; they will be glad,
however, to afibi-d assistance to any publisher or other person who wishes
to undertake the suggested publication, so desirable from an educational

point of view.

    It is with much regret that the Committee have to record the decease
of another of their members. In Mr. J. W. Davis, F.G.S., of Halifax,

they had an esteemed colleague and an active member. The fine series of
photographic illustrations issued by the Yorkshire Geological and Poly-
technic Society was presented through Mr. Davis, whose influence was
always exerted towards the furtherance of the work of the Committee.

     Owing to the illness of the Secretary the completion of the task of
arranging the mounted photographs in portfolios has had to be deferred.

     The Committee request reappointment and renewal of the grant
(vvhich was not drawn this year) in order that further progress may be
made with the collection, with a view to its being rendered as complete
and as widely representative as possible.

     Several photographs were received during the year without any par-
ticulars of locality or even of photographer. These could not be included
in the following list. It will greatly aid the work of the Committee if

photographs presented are accompanied by as many details as may be
possible. When not mounted on the standard mounts, prints should be

forwarded ,/?a/; (not rolled). Copies of foi-ms for the insertion of descrip-
tive details, and of the circular of instructions (the purpose of which is
to secure uniformity of action), will be supplied on application to any

member of the Committee.

      FOURTH LIST OF GEOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHS.

                                                   (to JULY 1893.)

   --Note. This list contains the subjects of geological photographs,

copies of which have been received by the Secretary of the Committee
since the publication of the last report. Photographers are asked to
afiBx the registered numbers, as given below, to their negatives for
convenience of future reference.

      Copies of photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
either from the photographer direct or from the ofBcers of the local
society under whose auspices the views were taken.
ON PHOTOGBAPHS OF GEOLOGICAL INTEREST.                        477

    The price at which copies may be obtained depends npon the size of

the print and local circumstances, over which the Committee have no

control.

     The Committee find it necessary to reiterate the fact that they do not
assume the copyright of any photographs included in this list. Inquiries
respecting them, and applications for permission to reproduce photographs,
should not be addressed to the Committee, but to the photographer

direct.

The Committee have to report that tlie number of lists received is still

insufficient to attempt the tabulation of results. During the present

year the Manchester Museum has published a list of its type specimens

of fossils,  prepared by Mr. H. Bolton                                                                                                                              and  the   Rev.  P. B. Brodie has

furnished a MS. list of the large number of types and figured specimens

Ain his private collection.  short supplementary list has also been pub-

lished by the Woodwardian Museum, Cambridge (H. Woods, 'Geol. Mag.,'

Dec. 3, vol. X. 1893, pp. 111-118). Notwithstanding the slow progress,

the Committee feel that their existence has an important influence in

obtaining the registration of specimens which might be overlooked, and

they desire to be reappointed.

     The investigation of the character of the high-level shell-bearing
deposits at Clava, Chapelhall, and other localities has been undertaken
with the view of re-examining the evidence bearing on the submergence
of Scotland during the Glacial period. Recent contributions to the
literature of glacial geology in this and other countries have raised doubts

regarding the extent of this submergence. Selecting the shelly clay at

Clava as a typical example of the Scottish high-level shell beds, the Com-
mittee have meanwhile confined their operations to this locality. The

grant from the British Association having proved insufficient for the
work, the investigations at Clava have been completed by a grant obtained
through the courtesy of Sir Archibald Geikie from the Council of the
Royal Society of London, and by private subscriptions raised by the
Secretary of the Committee.

                                       II. Geographical Position; "

I The shell-bearing deposit at Clava occurs on the east side of the

   valley of the Nairn, and six miles due east of the town of Inverness.
   Situated on the south bank of the Cassie Burn, a tributary of AUt Ruadh
   (the Red Burn), the latter being an affluent of the river Nairn, the shelly
    clay is about half a mile distant from the Nairn, about 200 feet above the
   level of that river at Clava, and about 500 feet above the sea-level (see
    map, p. 499).

          III. Previous Observations regarding the Shellt Clat.

     The first description of this deposit was given by Mr. James
Fraser, C.E., Inverness,' who made a careful examination of the section

    A(c) list of the organic remains (comprising several Arctic shells),

determined by Mr. David Robertson and Mr. T. F. Jamieson, was pub-

lished.

     (d) From the character of the deposit and the condition of the organic

remains, as described by the foregoing authorities, Mr. Fraser inferred
that the shelly clay was in situ, and indicated a depression of the land to

the extent of over 500 feet prior to the deposition of the overlying

boulder clay.

    In 1886 Dr. H. W. Crosskey made an examination of the shelly clay

and glacial deposits in the Nairn Valley ; his conclusions confirmed those
previously published by Mr. Fraser.'

      Recently several objections have been raised ^ against the acceptance
of these conclusions, so that further investigation became desirable.

IV. Detailed Examination of the Shelly Clay and Associated
                              Deposits by the Committee.

The shelly clay is found at or under the base of a prominent broad-

topped ridge of drift on the south bank of the Cassie Burn, which there

flows along the foot of a bluff cliff of glacial deposits (see photo- engravings.

Plates II. and III.). This conspicuous ridge is traceable for upwards of

two miles in a north-easterly dii-ection, parallel with the river Nairn, and

for about 1,200 yards in a south-westerly direction. About200 yards nearer

the river, and nearly 100 feet lower, occurs a narrower ridge, along the top

of which runs the Craggie and Cawdor road for more than a mile. These

parallel ridges of drift are flanked on the south-east sides by marshy or

alluvial  hollows                                      indeed, at the  point where  the  shelly  clay  occurs  the
                                                    ;

Cassie Burn flows for some distance along the hollow separating the two-

ridges. Both ridges have an irregular fall of about 50 feet per mile

towards the north-east ; the upper ridge being nearly uniform, and the

lower one irregular in its fall.

                                A. Excavation of 'Main Tit.''

     The Committee began their examination of the shelly clay by
excavating a large pit or trench at the base of the cliff on the south bank
of the Cassie Burn. The site of the pit was 430 yards distant from the
junction of the Cassie Burn with AUt Buadh. At the outset the length
of the trench was 25 feet and the breadth 15 feet at the surface, but a&

the work proceeded it had to be made longer and wider, owing to slips of
clay and saud from the face of the cliff. Though the work was seriously
impeded by unfavourable weather, the excavation was eventually sue-
cessful in showing an admirable section of the shelly clay and underlying

gravel, without reaching the solid rock.

     The section thus revealed by the exposed surface of the cliff and the
trench was as follows :

4. Coarse yellowish-brown gravel                           10

Throughout this report this excavation is referred to as the ' main pit *

or ' main section ' of shelly clay.

   A careful examination of these various deposits was made on the

--ground by most of the members of Committee, with the following

results :

  --1. Boulder Clay, overlying the sand and shelly clay. As this deposit is

extensively developed in the neighbourhood of Clava, the Committee

selected a typical section for examination, where there is a splendid

exposure of the included blocks. The section occurs on the south bank

of the Cassie Burn, from 130 to 160 yards south-west of the ' main pit,'

where the boulder clay also overlies the shelly clay, and where the deposit

resembles in every particular that above the ' main pit.'

The deposit is of a light brown colour, and the matrix consists mainly

·of fine sand ; the stones are more or less well-rounded, varying in size

from fine gravel up to 2 feet in diameter. Many of the blocks of

sandstone are finely striated along the longer axis. The deposit is more

sandy and gravelly than the typical ground moraine or till of Scotland.

But though the proportion of clay among the materials is small, it is

usually sufficient to bind them into a compact mass.

The largest proportion of the included blocks has been derived from

the adjacent Lower Old Red Sandstone strata. Of these many have
m"been obtained from the micaceous flagstones occurring
                                                           situ, in the

Easter Daltullich Burn, the river Nairn, and other localities to the west

and south-west of Clava. On referring to the table of percentages of

stones, which has been prepared to show the variation in the character

of the included blocks in the shelly clay and associated deposits, it will

be seen that while the percentage of Old Red Sandstone blocks in the

overlying boulder clay varies from 56 to 76 per cent., in the shelly clay it

amounts to only 17 per cent. No organic remains have been found in this

deposit,

  --2. Fine Sand. The sand underlying the boulder clay in the 'main

pit ' is of a yellowish brown colour and fine-grained. At first sight it

seems to be free from stones, but on closer examination a few may be

detected under a quarter of an inch in size. The lowest 4 feet of sand

overlying the shelly clay is very compact, harder even than the latter

deposit. The line df junction between the sand and shelly clay is nearly

horizontal, and clearly defined by a difference in the colour and texture of

the materials. The boundary line between the sand and overlying boulder

clay is less distinct. After a heavy rainfall or the frosts of winter, lines
--486

of stratification are visible. No organic remains have been found in thia

--deposit.
     3. The Shelly Clay. The highest part of the shelly clay near the
soibth.east end of the ' main pit ' is 503^ feet above sea-level. From the
levels taken in 1882, when a small excavation was made by Mr. Fraser,
the height of the shelly clay at the front of the west end of the
present ' main pit ' was 501 feet. The top of this deposit where visible

rises slightly towards the east or south-east to the extent perhaps of

1 foot in 20 or 25 feet.

      The shelly clay as exposed in the ' main pit ' varied from 14 to 16 feet
in thickness. It is a tenacious clay or silt of a blue dark grey colour,
save the lowest 2 feet, where the tint is brownish grey. At this lower
level there is an admixture of fine gravel. The boundary line between
the shelly clay and underlying gravel is clearly defined. There is no
intermingling of the two deposits.

      There are slight traces of stratification in the blue clay. At a depth
of 3^ feet a horizontal line was observed in the deposit after exposure for
several days to heavy rain, but scarcely any part of this line could be
traced when a fresh surface was revealed. At a depth of 6^ or 7 feet,

horizontal streaks or thin layers of sand or fine gravel occur, but not in

 continuous layers.
      It is also important to note, as throwing light on the origin of the

 deposit, that the silt was traversed at certain levels by annelid burrows,
 more or less vertical, the tracks being darker in colour than the sui'-
 rounding silt. The burrows in most cases were laterally compressed.

      Of special interest also is the occurrence of a series of nearly vertical

 cracks or fissures traversing the clay in a uniform direction, viz., north-
 west and south-east, the tops of the fissures being bent towards the

 north-east. An attempt was made to photograph these fissures or cracks,

 which formed a conspicuous feature in the deposit.
      The upper 12 feet of blue clay is almost free from stones ; those

 which do occur within these limits vary from the size of peas ta
 1^ inch in diameter as a rule. But they become more numerous and
 slightly larger at a depth of about 6 feet. In this upper portion they
 are nearly all well-rounded and of the harder varieties. The lowest
 3 or 4 feet of the deposit (especially the lowest 18 inches) contains a
 larger proportion of stones, varying in size from peas to 2 inches across,

 and almost all well-rounded.
      At a lower depth than 6 feet a few stones of a larger size than the

 foregoing dimensions were found, the largest varying from 3 to 6 inches
 across, some being well-rounded and some subangular. The largest
 stone met with in the blue clay, measuring 9 inches by 7 inches by
 4i- inches, consists of dark micaceous gneiss : it is partially rounded,
 ice-grooved on one side, and with the mark where a balanus had been

 attached on one end of the grooving. Two small stones with several

 nearly entire balani were found at the very bottom of the shelly clay at

  the south-west end of the pit.
       During a subsequent inspection of the ' main pit ' two small striated

  stones of fine-grained sandstone were observed in the lowest 6 feet of the
 deposit ; and about the same level, two rounded stones (4 inches by

  3 inches) with fresh ialanus marks.
       Only three striated stones were met with in the shelly clay, the

 general well-rounded chai'acter of the stones and the absence of st na-

  tions being a striking feature of the deposit.
          --

ON THE SIIELL-BEAEING DEPOSITS AT CLAVA, AND OTHEE PLaCE.S. 487

A careful examination of the included blocks showed the following

interesting results : 59 per cent, consist of micaceous gneiss, about 10 per

cent, of granite, about 12 per cent, of quartz-schist and mica-schist, &c.,

or in all 81 per cent, of the older crystalline rocks, and only about 17 per
cent, of Old Red Sandstone.

     One small block of Jurassic grit was detected in the shelly clay which
was sent to Mr. Horace Woodward, of the Geological Survey of England,
now engaged in mapping the Secondary rocks in Scotland, who has

--kindly furnished the Chairman of the Committee with the following note

on the specimen : ' There are gritty beds at the base of the Lias, in the
Lower Oolites, and in the Middle Oolites of the Brora country that closely
resemble your specimens. The nearest approach to it is in specimens of

Lower Oolite from Skye and Raasay. This particular bed is part of the

basement beds of the Inferior Oolite at the base of the so-called " Great

--Estuarine Series." Curiously enough, we get no exposure of these beds

in the Sutherland region only the upper parts of the Lower Oolite (with

the Bi'ora coal). Hence my opinion is that your specimen most nearly

approaches in character to laeds of Inferior Oolite (basement portion).'

      Notwithstanding the strong resemblance of this block of Jurassic grit
to strata in Skye and Raasay, the Committee are of opinion that it has
been dei'ived from some area of Secondary rocks in the North-east

Highlands. The nearest point to Clava where Jurassic rocks occur in
situ is about 12 miles due north of the shelly clay, on the shore of the
Black Isle, at Ethie, near the Sutors of Cromarty. The occurrence of

this solitary block of Jurassic grit is of considerable importance, as will

be readily admitted when we summarise the evidence bearing on the
direction of the ice-flow in the neighbourhood of Inverness (see map

for relative positions of Clava and Ethie, p. 499).
     Shells are found throughout the whole of the blue clay or at least

from within 5 or 6 inches of the top to the bottom of the deposit. They
are most abundant at a depth of 2 or 3 feet from the top. Many of the

shells are quite whole at all depths, others are partially crushed, others

are in a tender or decaying condition. In the lowest part of the clay

the shells are of a darker colour, and many of them are so decayed that
they will scarcely bear handling. At all depths fragments of Mytilus

are rather numerous, but so decayed that a whole specimen cannot be

obtained. The prevalent shell is Littorina littorea.
    In the case of many of the shells the epidermis is in perfect preserva-

tion, and no indications of ice-markings or abrasion coiild be detected
on any of them. The absence of ice-markings on the shells is a remark-
able feature, which serves to distinguish the Clava shelly clay in one
particular from the shelly boulder clay of Caithness and Orkney. In

the latter many of the shells are striated like the stones in the deposit.'

     It is important to observe, however, that some of the bivalves, such

as Astarte, with both valves attached, showing no signs of abrasion and
otherwise complete, were found with both valves crushed together.

     During the examination of the 'main pit' on October 15, 1892, the
following observations were made regarding the position of some of the

shells :

              Astarte, single valve at 6 feet depth, concave side up.

              Natica,             ,, ,, mouth up.
              Littorina (large),  ,, ,, mouth down.
              Natica,             ,, ,, mouth down.

              Natica,             at 7 feet dei:)tb, mouth down.

488 EEroRT-- 1893.

The terminal joints of the great claws of the velvet swimming crab

(Portunus puber) and the spider crab {Hyas araneus) were also observed.

Collections of shells, made by some of the members of the Committee

and by the workmen, were submitted to Mr. David Robertson, of Millport,

for examination, together with samples of the clay in boxes. His thorough

knowledge of the organic remains found in the Scottish shelly clays has

been of invaluable service to the Committee, and at their request he has

prepared a separate report on the materials which passed through his

Lauds. All geologists interested in these researches will cordially appre-

ciate the value of his special contributions to this report.

With the sanction of Sir Archibald Geikie, the Director-General, Mr.

James Bennie, of the Geological Survey of Scotland, made a collection of

organic remains from the uppermost 6 feet of the shelly clay, the list of

shells being determined by Mr. Sharman, palfeontologist to the Geological

--Survey of England, and revised by Mr. Robertson.
     4. Gravel underlying shelly clay. This deposit, which was pierced to

a depth of 10 feet in the ' main pit,' is of a yellowish brown colour, and of

a coarse, unequal quality. The sand in this gravel is coarse-grained, dif-

fering from the fine sand above the blue clay and from the sandy matrix

of the overlying boulder clay. The deposit is in some parts roughly

stratified. The stones vary in size from fine gravel to blocks 6 or 7

inches across, while a few measure 14 inches in diameter. The largest

block, composed of Old Red Sandstone, measuring 21 inches by 20 inches

by 8 inches, occurred from 2 to 3 feet below the bottom of the shelly

clay. It was flat-shaped, subangular, and in the pit dipped to the south-

west at an angle of about 40° or 45°.

    On referring lo the table of percentage of stones it will be seen that

there is a wide difference in the proportion of the blocks of Old Red Sand-

stone found in the underlying gravel from that met with in the shelly

clay. Indeed the percentage of Old Red blocks in the underlying gravel

approaches very nearly to that found in the overlying sandy boulder clay.

The blocks of Old Red Sandstone in the gravel were wholly of local

origin                               a few wei"e  striated,  most  of them  were  rough  and angular  on
                                  ;

the edges, and several of the flagstone type were highly decomposed. In

like manner the blocks of granite and micaceous gneiss closely resemble

similar rocks in situ in the neighbourhood.

Before closing the ' main pit ' two successful photographs of the section

were taken by Mr. Whyte, of Inverness, at the request of the Committee,

one at a distance of 40 yards and the other near the edge of the pit (see

Plates II. and III.).

            B. Small Excavation 160 yards S.W. of the 'Main Pit.'

     The Committee made a small excavation on the south bank of the
Cassie Burn, 160 yards south-west of the ' main pit,' at the base and west
end of the great section of boulder clay already described, which revealed

a thin layer of shelly blue clay at a height of 512 feet above the sea-
level. The deposit there exposed was only 15 inches thick : it yielded
some of the shells found in the ' main pit,' including Astarte, Natica
Groenlandica, J.eda pernula, &c., and Foraminifera.

     Here the shelly clay was underlain by 10 inches of hard brown clay, the
latter resembling the deposit found on the bank of the Cassie Burn, 233

yards south-west of the ' main pit,' to which we may now briefly refer.

     At this latter locality (233 yards S.W. of the ' main pit ') a mass of
fine bard brown clay is exposed at the foot of the cliff, rising to a height
of 8 or 9 feet above the stream, and 523^ feet above sea-level. For a depth
of 6 or 7 feet it is entirely free from stones, but at the level of the burn a
few occur, though very small. Though no organic remains have been
found in this deposit, and though it diSers in colour from the typical
shelly clay of the ' main pit,' some of the Committee are inclined to regard
it as belonging to the same formation. The chemical analysis of the

material is interesting. It was found by Mr. W. Ivison Macadam, Edin-

burgh, to contain 31 per cent, of ferric oxide, and slightly over 1 per
cent, of aluminic oxide. ' It is not a clay, strictly speaking, but a sand
bound together by iron.' '

  --Dear Sir, I have finislied the examination of the clays from the

bores at Clava taken at different depths. Very few animal remains
were noticed. I have given the proportions of the mud, sand, and
gravel that each parcel contained, and the relative proportion of
the animal remains, and their names. To save repetition in the follow-

ing list, I may state that the proportion of mud is that which passed

through a sieve of ninetj-six meshes to the inch, the sand that which
passed through a sieve of twenty-four meshes to the inch, and the gravel
that which was retained in the same sieve of twenty-four meshes to the
inch. I have kept all the materials of each parcel separately, except the

muds which passed away in the washing. I have put samples of the

sand into small bottles, so that each parcel can be compared with the
others. The gravels are parcelled up for the same purpose, so that the
different rocks of each can be compared.

     The gravels are mostly water-worn, particularly the larger pieces.

No striations were noticed on any of the stones, large or small.

     The term ' floats ' means what is gathered on the surface of the
water when the dry clay is put in it and stirred up. In taking the

--proportions, fractions were omitted or lumped. Yours very truly,

     In this the proportion of gravel and coarse sand is very great, yet
the three largest stones weighed only one ounce.

     The ' floats ' contained two Foraminifera, Nonionina orbicularis, Brady,
and, as usual, a little vegetable matter and mica scales.

     There is no certainty that the two Foraminifera belonged to the clay

in which they were found, when we consider that we occasionally find in
the ' floats ' bits of recent plants, some still green, and there are so many
ways that such coald be carried, on workmen's tools, for example, or on

their feet walking over shelly clay.

--496 REPORT 1893.

                        General Eesults of Boring Operations.

     In considering the results obtained by the boring operations we must
bear in mind that this method of examination is not so rigidly accurate
as excavations from the surface. Even with the most careful manipula-

tion of the tubes it is almost impossible to prevent minute organisms

such as Foraminifera being carried down to lower levels from overlying
deposits. Again, shells might occur in a bed of clay, and yet tbe sample
of the material brought up by the boring-tube might not yield any traces
of such organisms. A remarkable instance of the latter experience may
here be adduced. In the case of bore No. 1, which was put down at the
edge of the ' main pit,' upwards of 7 feet of the dark blue clay was
pierced, and yet not a single shell fragment was found in the sample of
this clay sent to Mr. Robertson nor by members of the Committee on the
spot, though from direct observation in the 'main pit' we know that shells
are met with in this part of the deposit.

      Important results were obtained from bore No. 1, which was put
down within 5 feet of the edge of the 'main pit.' The solid rock, con-

sisting of coarse pebbly grit of Old Red Sandstone age, was reached at a
depth of 45^ feet. Though crushed by the borer's tools the rock was

readily recognised as identical with the coarse grit or fine conglomerate
found at the foot of the cliff near Allt Ruadh, about 330 yards north-east

of bore No. ] . No less interesting is the result that the rough gravel

and sandy clay underlying the shelly clay in the ' main pit ' was
found to rest on 21^ feet of ' brown clay and stones.' The only
organisms obtained by Mr. Robertson from the sample of this latter
deposit are Foraminifera. From the evidence at their disposal the
Committee do not feel justified in forming a definite opinion regarding

this deposit.

      In bore No. 2, 44 yards south-west of bore No. 1, the blue shelly clay
was reached at a depth of 16 feet, or 495i feet above sea-level. The
sample yielded fragments of the following shells : Lacuna divaricata and
Littorina ohh(sata, with Ostracoda and Foraminifera.

      In bore No, 3, 92 yards south-west of bore No. 1, dark blue sandy clay
was pierced at a depth of 2ci^ feet, which was recognised in the field as
bearing a close resemblance to the typical blue grey clay of the ' main
pit.' Curiously enough, no organic remains seem to have been recorded
from the sample examined by Mr. Robertson.

     The blue clay was not found in bore No. 4 at a depth of 25 feet.

Had funds permitted the Committee were anxious to try a deeper bore

on the cliff further south.
     At a distance of 61 yards, north-east of bore No. 1, a trial bore.

No. 5 did not encounter the blue clay. Bore No. 6 was sunk 14 feet
further up the face of the cliff, and though again the typical blue clay
was not met with, interesting results were obtained. In the hard-bound
sand, at a depth of 21 to 24 feet, spines of Echinus and Spatangus were
met with, while in the hard brown clay and stones (depth 27 feet) one
crustacean was found.

     The final bore, No. 7, was sunk 30 yards north-east of bore No. 1 : it
pierced the blue clay at a depth of 11^ feet from the surface, the thickness
of the deposit amounting to 2^ feet. It yielded Ostracoda and Foramini-
fera, while similar organisms were met with in the overlying ' hard-
bound sand ' at a depth of from 8 to 9 feet.

  --Extent of Shelly Clay. From the excavations and trial bores it

would appear that the shelly clay is continuous for a distance of 190

--yards along the south-east bank of the Cassie Burn viz., from bore

No. 7, situated 30 yards north-east of bore No. 1, to the small excavation
160 yards south-west of the 'main pit.'

     The Committee regret that, owing to the cost of these trial bores,
they were unable to determine the thickness of the blue shelly clay in each

bore. Had funds permitted they would have traced the extension of the

deposit in the area north of the Cassie Burn and other directions.

    By tabulating the results (1) of the excavation at the ' main pit,*^

    V. Direction of Ice-flow in the Neighbourhood of Inverness.

     The direction of the ice-flow in the neighbourhood of Inverness is

obviously of great importance in relation to the question referred to the

Committee. They have drawn up a list of striaa based on observations

made partly by Mr. Home in the course of his survey of the district,

which are here given with the sanction of the Director- General of the
Geological Survey, and partly by Mr. James Fraser. One instance west

of Ethie has been noted by Mr. Hugh Miller. With the view of present-
ing these observations in a clearer form they have prepared a strise map

of the district extending from Cromarty in the north to Croachy in
Strathnairn in the south (fig. 3).

Creag-a-Chlachain, about | mile north of the outlet of Loch Duntel-

     From the foregoing evidence it will be seen that on the high grounds-
between Moy Hall and Faillie in Upper Strathnairn the striae point on

an average due north ; a fact ascribable to the ice moving seawards from
the elevated range between the Nairn and the Findhorn ; while further
to the south-west, near Inverarnie and Loch Duntelchaig, the direction

is N. 20° W. Near the river course from Croachy to Craggie the trend

of the ice-markings is more or less parallel with the course of the valley,.
or on an average N. 32° E. In the neighbourhood of Essich, near Loch
Ness, the trend varies from E. 13°-32° N. In the tract between Loch
Ness and Cawdor Castle strias are not easily found owing to the more or
                                                                                      "

less continuous covering of superficial deposits ; but in Hillhead Quarry,

near Dalcross station, the direction is N.B. ; and further on, at Kin-
steary, south of Nairn, from E. 5° N". to B. 17° S. (see list of striae).

      Proceeding northwards to the Black Isle the striated surfaces between

Beauly Firth and MunJochy Bay clearly prove that the trend of the ice-
flow varied from E. 12°-30° N. Near Avoch the direction of the ice-

markings is E. 3° N. ; while near Ethie, about three miles south of
<]romarty, it is E. 25° N.

     So far as the striae are concerned the evidence points to the conclusion

that the land ice that passed over Clava did not previously traverse the

Beauly or Moray Firths. It would appear that the ice which glaciated
that portion of the Nairn Valley came from the Great Glen, and from the

mountains to the S.E. of the loch towards the sources of the Findhorn,

and at some stage of the Ice-age may have traversed part of the bed of

Loch Ness in its onward march.

   --Transport of Boulders. In the reports of the Boulder Committee of

the Royal Society, Edinburgh, it is stated that boulders of the well-

known foliated granite of Dirriemore, west of Ben Wyvis, are ' scattered
abundantly all over the Black Isle.' They 'have been carried across,
not only the ridge of the Black Isle, but what is now the Moray Firth,
to beyond Elgin, and they may be seen on the coast between Burghead
.and Lossiemouth.' ^ They have been found near the Enzie post-oflBce,
but none so large as those dug out during the excavations for the Buckie
JHarbour.2 The fine-grained pinkish granite of Abriachan on the west
side of Loch Ness occurs in the gravel of Tomnahurich near the town

of Inverness, ' and eastwards of this point, on beyond Nairn and Forres,
it is found less in large boulders, though it occurs in considerable masses,
than as forming part of the gravel deposits which are so marked a
feature on the south shores of the Moray Firth.' ^ It is further stated
that boulders of the ' liver-coloured conglomerate,' which occurs in siht
between Inverfarigaig and Loch Duntelchaig, are distributed ' over the
country between Loch Ness and Lossiemouth.' Cumberland's Stone on
-Culloden Moor, the boulders named Tomriach on the bank of the Nairn,
near Cantraydoun, and Clach.na-Cailliche, near the top of the Hill
of Urchany, south of Nairn, are stated to have been derived from this
area, the general distribution of these conglomerate boulders being to
the N.E. of Caisteal-an-Duin-Riabhaich, near the junction of the Strath-
errick and Dores roads, onwards to Elgin."* The grey granite of
Stratherrick ' is found in blocks of different sizes, some of them large,
all over the country east towards Elgin, intermingled with the con-
glomerate just mentioned.' ' It is also found in blocks scattered on the
very top of the ridge of conglomerate between Loch Ceo-Glas and Loch

Ness.'* It is further recorded that boulders of the gneiss of Stratherrick

and the Monadhliath Mountains are found in Strathnairn, near the
Free Church of Farr, Farr House, near Flichity, and again further

down the valley below Daviot, not far from the mansion of Nairnside.®
     From the foregoing evidence it is inferred ' that the general direction

of movement of these blocks has been eastwards, but chiefly from S.W.
to N.E., parallel to the trend of the coast of the Moray Firth at this part.'

VI. Report by Mr. David Robertson, F.G.S., F.L.S., Mem. Imp. Boy.

                                       Zool. Botan. Soc, Vienna.

The portion of shelly clay from Clava entrusted to me for exami-

nation was, with the exception of a small bagful, chiefly in one piece,

taken at 2| feet from the top of the ' main section,' and in a box of broken

pieces of stony clay from the bottom of the same section. I had also

packages of clay, sand, and gravel from other parts of the deposit, as

hereinafter mentioned.

1. The clay in the above-mentioned bag, being taken from different

parts of the section, was considered to be a fair sample of the shelly clay.

It consisted of

                 90 per cent, mud
                                                                                                  ;

                 7,,    sand, mostly angular (grey)
                                                                                                                                                             ;

                 3,,    stones.

--None of
           the stones   was noticed                                                                  to  be  striated                                      some  chiefly sand-
                                                                                                                                                        ;
--stones were angular ; the others were mostly water- worn and well

polished. None was much larger than a gooseberry. There may have

been a little more sand in this instance, as some of the finer portion may

have passed off with the mud. Mica scales were plentiful.

The clay seemed to indicate deposition in still water, showing no

traces of strong currents, and containing few stones, and those mostly

small in size.

2. The shelly clay, 160 yards south-west of the ' main section,' con-

    The stones were water-worn. No striation was detected.

     3. The sand in a tin box, taken from 2^ to 3 feet above the shelly
clay of the ' main section,' was in lumps requiring some force to break,
and was still harder when dry. It consisted of-

                 34 per cent, mud

                 64 ,,  light-coloured fine sand

                 2 ,, per cent, stones.

None of the stones exceeded the size of a pea.

    The sand is very fine, mixed with a few small stones. No marine
organisms were detected in it. On the whole, it had much the character
of blown sand. It was much lighter in colour than the saud washed out

of the shelly clay, and contained little or none of the dark mica prevalent

in the latter.

4. The stony clay, being bottom part of the shelly clay, near west

end of ' main section,' consisted of

                 48 per cent, mud

                 24 ,,  sand, with many red grains
                 28 ,,                                                                                                                    ;

                        stones.

    These stones were water- worn. No striation was noticed.

     In this stony clay six Foraminifera and one Ostracod were obtained.
Independently of the finding of Microzoa, I was doubtful whether this
was part of the shelly clay, or had got mixed with it, or whether an
error had occurred in some other way. To make sure of this point
another portion was prepared, and here Foraminifera were still more

numerous, and a few Osfcracoda were also found, leaving no doubt that

they belonged to the deposit.

5. The gravel (in second tin box) taken from 2 feet below the shelly

clay, at east end of the ' main section,' was prepared in the usual way, and
lost little by washing. The stones were all well water-worn, with the

exception of the sandstones, most of which appeared to have been sub-

Ajected to little or no rolling.  few rootlets and two Foraminifera were

obtained. Although every precaution had been taken to prevent admix-

ture of the materials, still there are many ways in which this might occur,

either in the field or during examination.

The sand from this part of the section is of a light yellowish colour,

and consists chiefly of small well-rounded particles of quartz with

some light grains of mica, derived apparently from the adjacent Old Red

Sandstone. In these respects it closely resembles the sand which overlies

the shelly clay, and differs in a marked degree from that contained in the

shelly clay itself, which, as already mentioned, is dark or dark-grey in

colour, and contains much black mica, apparently derived from the dis-

integration of gneissose rocks.

                                  BiemarTts.

The deposit in all its aspects, taken in connection with its high level,

is very puzzling. Although its Arctic character is well established, it

differs much from any of the post-Tertiary clays that have come under

my notice, particularly in respect of the small variety of fossil organic

remains found in it, there being very few remains of echini, star-fishes,

worm-tubes, crab-claws, or polyzoa, which are common in the post-

Tertiary clays, both on the east and west coasts of Scotland.

The shells, with the exception of those that are young and friable,

are fairly well preserved, and show no marks of rubbing or polishing, so

far as I could discover. They are chiefly of shallow- water species ; some

may have lived in from fifteen to twenty fathoms, but nearer the shore

as well ; and the great majority are undoubtedly of littoral species.

     With regard to the physical characteristics of the deposit, the follow-

--ing points seem worthy of notice : (1) The fineness of the sand over-
            shelly clay, and its freedom from
lying  the                                     stones  or  gravel                                                                                            (2)  the
                                                                                              ;

generally rounded and water-worn appearance of the stones in the clay,

and    the  small  proportion of sand  accompanying them                                                                                                and  (3)  the
                                                                                                                                                     ;

difference in appearance and composition between the sand in the shelly

clay and that occurring both beneath and above it, and the fact of the

--different parts of the deposit clay, sand, and overlying boulder clay

being so sharply defined from each other.

     The question comes to be, Have the shells lived and died where they

are found ? After considering all the evidence that has come under my

own observation I am strongly inclined to believe that they did live and die

where they are found . If we suppose that a transportation of the deposit

has been effected by ice action, it is difficult to see how the stones could be

so free from striation, or the sand overlying the shelly clay so fine and so free

from stones (those found in it being not much larger than a pea), or how

the different strata of the shelly clay, the sand, and overlying boulder

clay could be laid down so sharply defined, the one over the other, if

crushed up to their present position by ice in any form.

ON THE SHELL-BEARING DEPOSITS AT CLAVA, AND OTHER PLACES. 509

Supplementary Note hy Mr. Robertson on the Different Parcels of Clay and

                                                        their Contents.

One thing to be borne in mind in examining several parcels of clay

from the same deposit is that the contents of any two will scarcely ever

be alike.

myFor example, in  first list (a) there are several species of Mollusca

not in Mr. Eraser's Ust, viz.

                                                Astarte sulcata.

                                         Axinus flexuosus.
                                           Lepton nitidum.

                                                Tellina calcarea.

                                         Fusus antiqvMS.
                                             Trochus helicinus.

                                                      ,, Groenlandicus.

    On the other hand, in Mr. Eraser's list there are eight species not in

     State of Preservation. Many of the delicate shells are whole; yet

there are fewer perfect shells, or with the valves together, in Clava than

we usually find in the post-Tertiary clays of the Firth of Clyde.
     The number of species, also, is notably poorer in the Clava deposit than

in those of the Firth of Clyde. For example, Bissoa striata and its variety^
B. parva, are abundant all through the Clyde beds ; but, so far as I have*^
seen, they are absent from Clava.

     Of course, we have to take into account that the post- Tertiary fauna
of the clays on the east coast differ in several respects from those on the
west coast. This holds good to some extent also with regard to the fauna

of the present seas.

both as to latitude and depth, some being found in all seas, and from
brackish pools to the deepest soundings. It is worthy of note
however, that some of the genera found at Clava, and a few other
Scottish clays, are more restricted in range, being not only ' essentially

shallow-water species,' but (as seems more remarkable) to be found
chiefly in 'temperate and sub- tropical seas.' The Botalia, for example,

genns is represented by one or other of its species in every part of the

tropical and temperate zones.' ' Oypsina globulus, again, is chiefly found

* in the coral reefs of warm latitudes,' though ' small examples are

occasionally met with on the northern and western shores of the British

Islands.' ^ The varieties of Truncatulina variabilis also, though ' not

entirely confined to shallow water, are commonest at the shallow margins

of sub-tropical and temperate seas.' ^

These species are comparatively rare in our Scottish clays, and it

seems interesting to note their occurrence at Clava, where the list, as a

whole, is of moderate dimensions.

It may also be pointed out that there are five species of Foraminifera

SW.in the list from section 160 yards      which were not met with in the

main section ; but this is of little consequence, as, if two parcels of clay
'he taken from the same bed, only a few feet apart, they will seldom be

found in all their details exactly alike.

    A separate examination of the ' main pit ' was made by Mr.

T. F. Jamieson, LL.D., of Ellon, who has furnished the Chairman with

the following observations as the result of his visit:

     ' The extreme thickness of the dark blue clay is about 16 feet. The
lowest, 4 or 5 feet, is studded with small pebbles, many of which seem

--water-worn. The shells are by no means numerous more scanty than I

--expected and seem to be most frequent perhaps at a depth of about

2 feet from the top. At least the Littorina littorea appeared to be got

oftenest there, and, being a stout shell, it is generally in better preserva-

tion tlian the others, most of which are very decayed and tender, so that
they will hardly bear touching. The epidermis, however, is quite visible
on most of them, so that there is nothing to countenance the notion that
the shells have been ice-borne to then- present location. The uppermost
10 or 12 feet of the blue clay is almost quite free from stones, and is a

pure silty clay or mud such as might be expected to form on the .sea-
bottom. It is not at all of the nature of the boulder clay such as we see

in Caithness, and I think the probability is that it has been formed where

it lies. Had it been transported in a mass from some great distance by

the glacier, it would have been more dislocated, and would not occupy

such a regular horizontal position beneath the boulder clay, for it is
traceable along the base of the bank to a distance of 160 yards south-

westwards at about the sfime level.
      ' I think, however, that the pressure of the deep mass of boulder clay

above, with that of the superincumbent moving glacier, must have
occasioned some change in the texture of the clay by consolidating it,
and probably causing some degree of movement in its mass. This would
account for the crushing of some of the shells and the obliteration of the
lamination of the clay and want of any distinct stratification.

    My' idea is that after the deposition of the blue clay there had been a

subsequent development of land-ice on a great scale.'

 ON THE SHELL-BEARING DEPOSITS AT CLAVA, AND OTHER PLACES. 511

   A Note has also been received from Mr. P. F. Kendall, who was

unfortunately prevented from visiting the excavation, but who examined
a sample of the shelly clay from the ' main pit.*

     ' I have examined a portion of the silty clay sent, and so far have
found a large number (relatively) of fry of Nucula or Leda, several small
(almost to be called fry) Littorinas, probably L. littorea, and several
Foraminifera and Ostracoda. The condition of the specimens is perfect,

--and, judging from that alone, I should be disposed to say that the silt is

though not necessarily in situ a portion of a sea-bottom. I do not give

any positive opinion, but that is my impression.'

     ' I say not necessarily in situ, and without an opportunity of seeing

the section, I am indisposed to pronounce a more decided opinion.

Apart, however, from the character of the matrix and contents, the
general facts connected with the locality, the uniqueness of the deposit,

and its limited extent are, in my judgment, strongly against the suppo-

sition of its being in place ; and masses of sea-bottom, with perfectly

preserved shells and microzoa, are known to have been carried by land-ice

to considerable distances.'

                                                                                            P. F. K.

VII. Summary of the Evidence and General Conclusions.

     1. The highest part of the shelly clay in the ' main pit ' is 503^ feet
above sea-level. The deposit is 16 feet thick in that section, and appears
to be continuous for a distance of at least 190 yards in a well-nigh hori-

zontal position.

     2. It contains a small proportion of stones, usually well-rounded, and
chiefly near the base, varying considerably in relative proportion from
those in the overlying boulder clay and underlying gravel. Amongst
them is a small block of Jurassic grit ; the nearest point where such
rocks occur in situ is about twelve miles due north of Clava, near the
Sutors of Cromarty.

3. The shells are chiefly shallow-water species                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    some might have
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

lived at depths varying from 15 to 20 fathoms or in shallower water

nearer the shore, but the majority are littoral forms. Though the fauna

is not intensely Arctic, it implies colder conditions than the present,

there being a considerable number of Arctic species common in the

Glacial beds in the west of Scotland. The variety of shells is limited,

and there is an absence of certain maiine organisms, often plentiful in

those beds.

    4. The shells on the whole are remarkably well preserved, many

retaining their epidermis. They are neither rubbed nor striated, differing

in this last particular from those found in the shelly boulder clay of
Caithness and Orkney.

    5. From the assemblage of organic remains and their mode of occur-

rence, it would appear that the deposit is a true marine silt, or, in other
words, a portion of an ancient sea-bottom. If the deposit is not in situ,

then we can only suppose it must have been transported in mass to its

present position.

     6. The direction of the ice-flow in the surrounding district, as proved
by the striae and transport of boulders, seems to point to the conclusion

that the laud-ice which passed over Clava did not previously cross any
                          --

512 EEPORT-- 1893.

part of the existing sea-floor. If we suppose that the deposit was trans-
ported from Loch Ness, then, so far as we can see, we should postulate

a limited submergence in Glacial time to permit of the accumulation of
marine beds in that basin.

     7. The pressure of the ice that formed the overlying 45 feet of
boulder clay would be sufficient to account for the crushing of certain
shells, the compression of the annelid tubes, and the production of the
system of cracks in the clay referred to in the report.

      8. Notwithstanding certain obvious difficulties, the majority of the
Committee are strongly inclined to infer, from the assemblage of organic

remains and their mode of occurrence, the proved extension of the bed
and its apparently undisturbed character, that the shelly clay is in situ,

Aindicating a submergence of the land to the extent of over 500 feet.

minority of the Committee, however, do not consider the evidence
sufficient to establish this conclusion, or at all points in harmony with it.

A note embodying their views is appended.

     9. The Committee suggest that they should continue their investi-
gations with regard to the shelly clays at Chapelhall, near Airdrie, and
Tangy Glen, near Campbeltown, both occurring underneath boulder clay,
and adduced as evidence of submergence in Glacial time.

                              Note by a Minority of the Committee.

     While we have no wish to emphasise any diSerence of opinion among
the members of Committee, we gladly avail ourselves of the oppor-

tunity of stating our views afforded us by the courtesy of our esteemed
Chairman, whose desire to deal fairly with all sides of the question has
been conspicuous throughout this investigation.

     As Mr. Robertson has remarked in his valuable report, this Clava

deposit ' is in all its aspects a very puzzling one.' Any theory regarding
its origin or mode of formation seems to be beset with difficulties. On
the one hand, if we conclude that it is really in place as part of an

ancient sea-bottom, and so indicates a submergence of over 500 feet,
then it is hard to account for the absence, not only of shell-beds, but of
all other traces of the sea over the country generally at a similar level,
and at hundreds of intermediate levels down to that of existing tides.
If this be a clear case of a former sea-bed, it seems strange that it should

be the only one known or visible at a similar elevation in Scotland, if
we exclude that at Chapelhall, near Airdrie, which is now generally

believed to be not in situ ; while the shelly sands and gravels in the
north-east of Aberdeenshire (at 200 to 350 feet or thereby) are also'

admitted to be quite inconclusive as evidences of submergence. The
sea leaves many and various tokens of its presence where it has actually
been. It seems difficult to believe that a ' second glaciation,' or any
other assignable cause, could remove all such traces from hundreds of

--localities all over the country from sheltered bays, and glens, and
--inland curves of land, which would then be occupied by the sea and

yet leave those that are found (at Clava and Chapelhall, if these are
true instances) in the very tract, as can be shown, of the most powerful

ice-sheets.
ON THE SHELL-BEAEING DEPOSITS AT CLAVA, AND OTHEU PLACES. 513

It is difficult also to see how the ' upper boulder clay,' said to have

been formed by the ' second,' or post-submergence, glaciation could fail

to be thickly charged, in almost every locality, with remains of marine

organisms dez-ived from the miles upon miles of former sea-bed over

which the ice must have passed.

    From what we know of the configuration of the district and of its
glaciation we are convinced that, owing to the immense pressure of ice
from the mountains to the west, and the blocked condition of the Moray

Firth and the North Sea during-the Glacial period, ice on a great scale,

issuing from Loch Ness, was deflected eastwards along the base of the

Monadhliath mountains; that this deflection began at a considerable

distance south of the present mouth of the loch; and that such ice

passed over Clava. This conclusion is supported by the strise and the

distribution of boulders throughout the Nairn valley, and on towards

Forres a,nd Elgin. The stri^ on some higher parts of the Monadhliath

hills pointing north, north-west, &c., we view as belonging to an earlier

stage of the glaciation, before the congestion in the Moray Firth took

place.                                    Unless the different stages and changes of direction of the
                          ·

ice-sheets as they reached their maximum be kept in mind, we submit
that a ' map of striae ' of almost any district is unintelligible.

The ice-transport theory, therefore (whatever difficulties may attach

to it), has at least this point in its favour, that the deposit is quite in

the track of ice which would almost certainly pass over part of a former

sea-bed in its progress. ^ It has also this other point, that the shelly

clay consists almost wholly of materials derived from some distance,

differing from those in the immediate neighbourhood, and from the

boulder clay and gravel both above and below it. Further, though the

clay itself suggests deposition in deep and comparatively still water, the

shells and other organisms it contains are almost entirely of littoral

species                                   and  though  the  stones  in  it are in general rounded and water-
                                       ;

worn, some distinctly striated are associated with them, and all occur

promiscuously imbedded in this fine unstratified clay without, as a rule,

even a streak of accompanying sand or gravel.

     Mere 'submergence' seems inadequate to account for these facts.

And we venture to say that to assume, first, a submergence of over

500 feet, then a re-elevation to about the old level, with a return of

glacial conditions, much the same as before, is to hang an immense

series of changes upon the (as regards interpretation) more or less

doubtful evidence before us.

Our observations have convinced us, generally, that no such sub-

mergence, nor any at all approaching to it, took place in any part of

the British Isles during the Glacial epoch.

On the other hand, we freely admit that the extent of the shelly clay

in this instance and the perfectness of many of the contained shells do

weigh against the supposition that the deposit, as a whole, owes its

transport, or at least its present form, to land-ice. The objection from

the comparatively perfect condition of the shells is perhaps the most

important. Whether, in view of the known instances in which even

' These strise may partly belong also to a later time after the congestion had

given way, but for various reasons we are disposed to assign them mainly to the

earlier stage.

    - A submergence of only 60 feet would make Loch Ness an arm of the sea, with

a long, comparatively shallow bay at its seaward end.

delicate shells have been transported uninjured by ice, this objection be

insuperable must be left to the judgment of others. Our own feeling is

that if the case depends mainly on this point it is impossible to pronounce
upon it with confidence.

    On the whole, our opinion, with all deference, is that we have not yet

reached a solution of the difficulties connected with the Clava deposit.

The Committee were appointed, as in former years, for the purpose of re-

cording the position, height above the sea, lithological characters, size,

and origin of the erratic blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland, report-

ing other matters of interest connected with the same, and taking measures

for their preservation.

The Committee have again to acknowledge the valuable assistance

rendered by the Yorkshire Boulder Committee and the Glacialists'

Association, as well as by independent observers. The work of organisa-

tion has been prosecuted and several districts are being investigated in a
manner that promises to yield results of the highest value. The Corre-

sponding Societies have been invited to co-operate, and a hope is enter-

tained that information will soon be forthcoming from counties regarding

which no reports have as yet been presented to this committee. The

President of the British Association, Sir Archibald Geikie, LL.D.,

F.R.S., has, in his capacity as Director- General of H.M. Geological

Survey, granted permission to the officers of his staff to report to the

ACommittee erratics observed during the course of their field-work.

this arrangement. The report records every boulder at present visible

an analysis of their list for publication.

    The comparison of the lists of Messrs. Dambrill-Davies, Piatt, and De

Eance on the one hand with those of Mr. Maw by. Captain Dwerryhouse,

and Miss Shipton on the other brings out very clearly the much greater

relative abundance of Lake District rocks than of those from Scotland,

on the eastern side of the plain of Lancashire and Cheshire as compared

with the western side of that area. In harmony with this result is the

fact that the remarkable list of erratics from the gravels of the Yorkshire

Calder contains not a single Scottish rock.

digest of their very voluminous report, but arrangements are in progress

Report on the Boulders lying on the East Shore of the Estuary of the River
     Dee, between Burton Bocks on the South and West Kirhy on the North,,

     loith a comparison with those on the corresponding shore of the Mersey
    from Herculaneum Dock, Liverpool, to Mersey View Road, Ditton, near

    Widnes. By Miss Laura J. Shipton and Capt. Arthur R. Dwerry-

     HOUSE, of Liverpool (per Glacialists' Association).

     The boulders for the most part lie on the beach between high and
low water marks, and are in some cases partially buried in sand and silt.
They have been derived from the washing away of the boulder clay cliffs.

     The boulder clay extends under the more recent river deposits, and in.

places crops out through these.
      Occasionally boulders are found in situ in these outcrops of clay.

Their dimensions in inches and their situation together with the direc-
tion of the axes and strias are given below :

     The diabase, which is so plentiful in this district, is very scarce
amongst the Mersey boulders, and, according to Mr. D. Mackintosh, who
speaks of them as Scottish greenstones, they are not common in the neigh-

bourhood of Chester (' Q. J. G. S.,' vol. xxxv. 1879, pp. 434-438).
     Speaking of Delamere Forest, the same author says : ' Scottish green-

stone (with a few exceptions) is absent.'

   We have not had an opportunity of comparing the rock with speci-

mens from Scotland, so have not included them amongst the Scotch
rocks in the analysis. Considering them as Scotch, the proportions
would stand as follows : Lake District, 46"61 per cent. ; Scotch, 35-71

per cent. ; alia, 17" 68 per cent.

     This would show a considerable excess of Scotch rocks on the Dee
shore as compared with that of the Mersey.

The Committee were appointed to report on the present state of our

Crovernment. They have continued to act in concert with the Royal Society
Committee, the two having together maintained Mr. R. C. L. Perkins
in the islands during the whole of the twelve months since the last report.
They have now the pleasure of stating that that gentleman has obtained
valuable results in several departments of zoology, and more espe-
cially in entomology. The Committee have received from him several
consignments, being the result of his first year's work. These are
roughly estimated at nearly 150 bird-skins, 3,000 insects, 1,000 shells,
a collection of spiders in spirit, together with some crustaceans, worms,
and myriapods. These specimens confirm the importance of the investi-
gation your Committee are carrying on, while the information received
from Mr. Perkins and other quarters strengthens their belief that the
work should be done at once, and that it is not probable that it will be
satisfactorily done except by some such body as your Committee.

     The Committee therefore request that they may be reappointed, with
the same powers as before, and that the sum of 200L be placed at their

·disposal.

The Committee have to report that steady progress has been made with

the systematic tabulation of the statistics, and a series of schedules
framed for the final report. The nature of the work is such that it
necessitates a great expenditure of time, as each item contained in the
vast mass of schedules accumulated has to be separately dealt with and
entered in the sheets. The Committee trust that the Association will re-

number Mr. W. Eagle Clarke may be duly carried out and brought to

a conclusion.

 This Committee was appointed in 1887, and it has been reappointed each
jear until the present time.

      During the past year the eff'orts of the Committee have been directed
^mainly to the working out of the great series of specimens secured from
the West Indian region by means of its collectors, and the collector em-
 ployed by Mr. Godman.

    The list of birds collected in Anguilla by Mr. W. R. Elliott has been

published by Dr. Sclater in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society.'
Mr. R. I. Pocock has completed his account of the Myriapods, Scorpions,
Pedipalpi, and Peripatus, and his exhaustive papers on these subjects,
which have been communicated to the Linnean Society, are in course of

publication. Professors Riley, Ashmead, and Howard have finished the
parasitic Hymenoptera of St. Vincent, and their paper, which containa
descriptions of about 300 new species, has also been presented to the

Linnean Society. These authors have been entrusted with the insects
of the same group from Grenada, and a report on them will be duly forth-
coming. In last year's report the publication was announced of Herr
Hofrath Brunner v. Wattenwyl's ' Orthoptera of St. Vincent.' His paper

on the Orthoptera of Grenada has now been received, and is being pub-

lished by the Zoological Society. It describes fifty-five species, eight of
which are new, and thirteen were not met with in St. Vincent. The
report on the Hemiptera of St. Vincent, by Dr. Uhler, and a very import-
ant memoir on the Ants, by Professor Forel, have also been received, and
will be published without delay.

     The Rev. Mr. Matthews has undertaken to examine and report upon
the Trichopterygidse and Corylophidse, and the specimens are now in his

hands.

    Additional collections of cellular Cryptogams from Dominica, made

last autumn by Mr. W. R. Elliott, have been received and distributed to-

those workers who have undertaken the groups of these plants. In

addition to those mentioned in last year's report Mr. R. Spruce ofiered to
work out the Hepaticae of Dominica, and he has completed his examina-
tion. About thirty species are new, but for the rest Mr. Spruce finds
great resemblance with the Hepatic flora of the adjacent French Antilles.

The novelties obtained by Mr. Elliott were mainly from the peaks of the
Diablotin and Les Trois Pitons. Mr. William West, of Bradford, is at
present engaged on an examination of the difficult and obscure forms of
hot-spring Algae from the SouflTriere of Dominica, and Professor Wainio
has undertaken the Lichenes. All the groups of cellular Cryptogams
have thus either been completed or are in course of examination.

     The Committee regard with satisfaction this rapid working out of
the vast series of specimens obtained by its efibrts, and have considered
and approved of a proposal to examine the island of Margarita, the
natural history of which is wholly unexplored.

     The Committee recommend their reappointment with the following

--members : Dr. Sclater (Chairman), Mr. George Murray (Secretary),^

Mr. Carruthers, Professor Newton, Mr. Godman, Dr. Giinther, and Dr.
Sharp. They also recommend that a grant of 200?. be placed at their
disposal to enable them to continue their work, and to adequately provide

for the exploration of Margarita.

--The Marine Zoology of the Irish Sea. Report of the Committee,

      consisting of Mr. George Brook, Professor A. C. Haddon,

     Mr. W. E. HoYLE, Mr. I. C. Thompson {Secretary), Mr. A. 0.
     Walker, and Professor W. A. Herdman {Chairman).

                                               [PLATE IV.]

 Circumstances have prevented Mr. Brook,' Professor Haddon, and

 Mr. Hoyle from taking much practical part in the work ; but the other
 three members of the Committee have all been present on nearly all the
 expeditions, and they have received much assistance from their colleagues

 of the Liverpool Marine Biology Committee and from some of the other

 naturalists who have been working at the Port Erin Biological Station
 during this year. The present report is drawn up by the Chairman,
 with contributions from Mr. Thompson and Mr. Walker, and from other

 naturalists, in regard to the groups of animals they have severally under-

taken to investigate.

      The area which this Committee was appointed to explore is that

region of the Irish Sea which lies around the Isle of Man (see chart,

 Plate IV.), and which is classic ground to the marine biologist as being the
scene of the first pioneer work of Professor Edward Forbes more than

sixty years ago. Some few parts of the area were also investigated more
minutely later on by Forbes in conjunction with Mr. R. McAndrew, a
Li-\'-erpool merchant well known in science from the extensive dredging

 operations he conducted from his yacht along the north-west coasts of

Europe from the Mediterranean to the north of Norway. The greater
part of our area, however, has never been thoroughly explored, and some
parts are still unknown ground to the naturalist. It is an interesting
region from the considerable diversity of shore, of depth, and of bottom
which it presents, and, as your Committee hope to show, it possesses an
abundant fauna, including a number of rare and novel forms.

    A continuation of the deep-water depression runs down from the

Clyde sea area on the western side of the Isle of Man (see chart and

section, Plate IV.), and gives depths of 70 to 80 fathoms within 12
miles of land. The bottom of this depression is occupied by a stiff
blue-grey clay-mud, in which we find the annelids Panthalis Oerstedi
and Lipobranchius Jeffreysii, the crustacean Calocaris Macanclrece, the

echinoderms Bnssopsis lyrifera and AmpMura Chiajii, the pennatulid

Virgularia mirahilis, and the mollusc Isocardia cor.
     In moderate depths on the sides of the depression we come upon

varied bottoms of sand and sandy mud, gravel, dead shells, &c., on
which is a rich fauna representing all the usual invertebrate groups. It
is from this region that the greater number of our additions to the

British fauna have come. On April 30, from a depth of 46 fathoms,
we obtained two specimens of Cydostrema millepuiidatum, Friele, a
species only previously known from a depth of 649 fathoms near the
Lofoten Islands in the north of Norway. From depths of 25 to 30
fathoms, to the west of Port Erin, we have obtained in considerable

quantity the interesting ascidian Forhesella tessellata, which unites, in a

manner which though satisfactory to the evolutionist is aggravating to

The Isle of Man is connected with Lancashire by a broad plateau

under 20 fathoms in depth (see chart and section, Plate IV.), to the north

and south of which prolongations of the western deeper water extend

Ainwards to the east.           considerable portion of our work has been done

in the broad southern extension which lies between Liverpool and the

Calf of Man (fig. 1), and gives depths of from 20 to 40 fathoms.

In the shallower water around the coasts there is, of course, very

great difference in the physical conditions and in the fauna of different

regions ; for example, the sandbanks and flat expanses of mud off the

Lancashire coast are very different in every way from the more varied

ground off the rocky southern shore of the Isle of Man. But even the

seemingly uninteresting sandy wastes of Lancashire present many curious

Wefacts and problems to the marine biologist.                                                                        find that on the estuarine

flats round Hilbre Island, as Lindstrom suspected to be the case on the

coast of Gothland some years ago, the very abundant Hydroiia ulvce lays

its eggs upon its neighbours' shells, probably as being the largest and

most stable objects among the shifting sand-grains around it. And it

may also be remarked that this supposed barren region is of immense

economic importance as a nursery for young food-fishes.

Liverpool was naturally the headquarters of the Committee, but we

took advantage of the presence of the biological station at Port Erin, on

the south-west corner of the Isle of Man, to start our dredging expedi-

    ' For the use of the figures illustrating this report we are indebted to the Liver-

pool Marine Biology Committee.

tions Prom that point, as it is the nearest land to the most interesting-

and tbe least explored ground, and we made use of the laboratory of the
station for the first rough sorting-out of our material. As one active
member of the Committee, Mr. Walker, lives at Colwyn Bay, on the

coast of North Wales, he has been able to supply some information in

regard to that end of the district.

The Committee were appointed on August 10. On account of the

absence  of  members  nothing  could be done during the  first  month                                  but
                                                                                                    ;

they commenced work with a dredging expedition in the hired steam-

trawler ' Lady Loch ' on September 24, and other expeditions took place

on the following dates : November 12, January 29, March 11 to 13,

March 29 to April 4, April 28 to May 1, May 19 to 22, and June 17 to 19.

It will be noticed that the Committee have carried on their work at sea

during the winter months as well as in summer ; and although the entire

grant of 30Z., and a good deal more, has been already spent on these ex-

peditions, they are still continuing the dredgings whenever two or three

of the party can be got together, and they hope to undertake a good deal
of farther exploration during August and September. Notwithstanding
the considerable measure of success they have had during the past ten
months, the Committee realise vividly that their work is far from com-

plete, and they feel that they are justified, by the results they have

already obtained and by the fact that a considerable part of the area,

including the deep water lying between the south of the Isle of Man

and the north of Anglesey (see chart, Plate IV.), is still unexplored, in
asking to be reappointed, with a grant sufficient to enable them to carry

on the work for another year.

     The following is a short account of the various expeditions :

    I. On September 24 an attempt was made to reach the deep water

lying off Port Erin, but the wind was so strong and the sea so heavy that
it was found impossible to do any work off" the southern and western
sides of the island, so the ' Lady Loch ' steamed up the east side, and the
rest of the day was spent in dredging in the neighbourhood of Laxey at

the following localities :
     1. Off Clay Head, 17 fathoms: Several hauls, varied bottoms.

Amongst the species obtained were Polymastia rohusta, Stiberites

domuncula, AmpJiilectus incrustans, Spongelia fragilis (large specimens),

and a desmacidonid sponge (the Halichondria expansa of Bowerbank),
which is new to the district, and probably belongs to the genus Amphi-

lectus, ten species of hydroids and fourteen species of polyzoa Ascidia
mentula (containing Pinnotheres veterum), Lima Mans, and L. Loscomhii^

Psammohia telUnella, Pecten varius, Trochus magus, Modiolaria marmorata,

and M. discors.
     2. Off Garwick Bay, 4-12 fathoms : ' Melobesia ' bottom, several

hauls. Here were obtained Pjudendrium capillare, Aglaoplienia plutnUy

and seven other species of hydroids, several polyzoa, Ebalia Cranchn,

--Hoplonyx similis, Megamphopics cornutus, and Podocerus Herdmani a new

species of amphipod named by Mr. A. O. Walker, who has given the

following provisional diagnosis :

' Podocerus Herdmani, n. sp.

     ' Allied to P. falcatus and P. minutus, G. O. Sars, but differing in the
" hand " of the second gnathopod of the male, as shown in the annexed

figures (fig. 2, p. 629).

     ' The large tooth which in these species springs from the base of th&

hind margin in this species is much shorter, and rises from nearly the

centre. There is also a prominent tooth near the centre of the hind
margin of the " finger," which is very characteristic. The female re-
sembles P. minutus. Length, 3 mm.'

     3. Laxey Bay, 8 fathoms, on the ' Zostera ' bed : Here were Gam-

               --FiG. 2. Second Gnathopod of Male Amphipods.

             Podocerus minutus (after Sars).  P. Herdmani, n. sp.

cellina gracilis, and various other hydroids and polyzoa, some compound

ascidians, Cerapus difformis, and a considerable number of very large

living Pectunculus glycimeris.

The ascidians dredged in this expedition yielded a number of parasitic

copepoda, amongst which were Botachus cylindratus, Notopterophorus

papilio, Doropygus pulex and D. poricauda, Notodelphys Allmani, and

Ascidicola rosea.

    II. On November 12 the dredging was, on account of the weather,

confined to the immediate neighbourhood of Port Erin. Along with

many common things we found the schizopod Gastrosaccus sanchis, not
previously known nearer our seas than Jersey.

III. On January 29, 1898, the Committee had the use of the Lanca-

shire sea-fisheries steamer ' John Fell.' Several hauls were taken about

7 miles to the west of Fleshwick (Isle of Man), then some further to the

south between Port Erin and the Calf. Amongst other species obtained

were Gliona celata (fine, in various conditions), Sertularia tenella, and a
number of hydroids and polyzoa, Sarcodictyon catenata, Porania

pulvillus and Palmipes membranaceus, Inachus dorsettensis, Ascidia venosa

and A. virginea, Gapulus hungaricus, Venus casina, and Pectunculus

glycimeris.

    TV. On March 11--13 the woi'k was again done from the steamer
'John Fell.' On the 11th the steamer left Douglas to examine the shoal
lying to the north-east and south of the Bahama light (see chart, Plate

IV.). Here, along with various food-fish and some commoner inverte-

brates, some very large specimens of Tritonia Hombergi were trawled ; also
the ascidians Ascidia virginea, Didemnum gelatinosu'm and Polycyclus

Savignyi (very large specimens), Gorystes Gassivelaunus, Scaphander

lignarius, Aglaophenia tubulifera, A. myriophyllum, Galycella fastigiata,

and Sertularella Gayi, which is a new record to the district ; Eudendrium

rameum, Thuiaria articulata, Gonothyrcea gracilis and other zoophytes, and

various common polyzoa (very abundant and luxuriant).
    On the 13th, after trying again the same shoal as on the 11th, the

steamer went to * the top end of the Hole,' 26 miles east of St. Ann's

Head, 30 fathoms. Here there are sand to the north and mud to the

south, and some hauls were taken along the line of junction. Amongst

other things the following nudibranchs were obtained : Tritonia

Hombe7'C/i, Dendronotus arhorescens (up to 5 inches in length), Eolis Druvi-

viondi, Eolis rufihranchialis, and Eolis Farrani ; also Virgularia mirabilis
and no less than twenty-five species of hydroid zoophytes and twenty-

three species of polyzoa.

V. From March 29 to April 4 the Committee were working from

Port Erin, and had the s.s. ' Lady Loch ' hired for two of these days.
One day was spent in dredging on the rocky bottom round the Calf and

near the Chicken lighthouse, and in exploring the caves about Spanish

Head and the Stack Rock. These can only be entered in a boat in calm

weather at low tide. Their sides and roof are so closely covered with

masses of bright red ascidians {Fohjcarpa glomerata), black and white

sponges (Pachymatisma Johnstoni and Stelleita GolUiigsi), and tufts of

Tuhularia indivisa that scarcely any rock is visible. Amongst the more

noteworthy animals dredged round the Calf and obtained on the neigh-

bouring shores were the rare calcareous sponge Ute glabra, Corynadis

viridis, Hyalinoecia sp., Depastrum cyathiforme, Lineus gesserensis, Dinophilus

tmniatus (breeding at Easter), fifteen species of hydroids, including

Aglaophenia tubulifera, Halecium tenelluni, Lafoea dumosa form robvMa, L.

fruticosa, Cuspidella costata and G. humilis ; the brachiopod Crania anomala ;
the Crustacea Xantitu hydrophilus var. tuberculatus, Ebalia tuberosa and E.

tnmefacta, Oalathea dispersa {one with, a parasitic Bopyrian), Spirontocaris

spinus (one with a parasitic Bopyrian), Janira maculosa, Tritceta gibhosa,

AmphitJioe rubricata, Aora gracilis, Conilera cylindracea, Mcera Othonis,

perspicua, Circe minima and Thracia disiorta, the two last being new

records to the district ; the tunicata Molgula citrina, Styela grossularia,
Ascidia venosa, A. virginea, and A. pilebeia, Botrylhis Schlosseri, B. violaceus,

B. smaragdus, Distomum rubriim, Amaroucium proliferiim, A. argus,

droscium dilatattim, Smittia trispinosa,, Biastopora suborbicularis, ^tea

recta, and Alcyonidium mamillatum, which is new to the district.
    YI. April 28 to May 1. During two of these days the Committee

had the use of the Lancashire sea-fisheries steamer ' John Fell.' On

one day dredging was carried on in shallow water along the shore about

Fleshwick Bay, to the north of Port Erin ; while on the other day
advantage was taken of the fine weather to run out to the deep water

halfway to Ireland and work inwards. Hauls were taken at the

following localities :

    1. Fourteen miles north-west of Port Erin, 70 fathoms, mud : Found

Calocaris Macandrea, Lipobranchius Jeffreysii, Bissoa abyssicola, Nucula

sulcata, &c.

    2. Ten miles north-west of Port Erin, 50 fathoms, mud : Found Briss-

opsis lyrifera, &c.

     3. Nine miles west of Contrary Head, 46 fathoms : Found Cyclostrema
millepunctatum, Bissoa soluta and B. cancellata, Eulima bilineata, &c.

                                                                                                                  J

pinaster, Eudendrium rameuni, Scalpelhtm vulgare, Pecten maximus and

P. opercularis in great abundance.

    Pecten maximus yielded to Mr. Thompson the new copepod Lichomolgus

maximus                                           while  in  P.  opercularis were  found  the  amphipods Leucothoe
                                               ;

in enormous profusion and other common species.

   7. One mile off Bradda Head, 15 fathoms : Found Amphidotusflavescens,

Ute glabra, Sertularella rugosa, Goppinia arcta.

   A good deal of shallow water and shore collecting was also done on

this occasion, and all the compound ascidians noted under V. were got

near Port St. Mary, with the addition of Glossophorum sabulosum and G.

sp. (? n. sp.), both of them new to British seas, the genus only being

Aknown up to now from the French coast.                                                   yellow variety of Giard's

Astellium spongiforme was also obtained.

   VII. May 19-22. On one of these days the Committee again had

the use of the sea-fisheries steamer ' John Fell.' The weather was
rough, and it was only possible to work near the coast to the north of

Port Erin, where hauls were taken at the following localities :

     1. South side of Fleshwick Bay, 18 fathoms : Adamsia palliata and
Eupagurus Prideauxii, Pleurobranchus plutnula, Ascidia virginea.

   2. Opposite Fleshwick beach, 12 fathoms : Palmipes membranaceus,

were found (1) var. with abortive cells having ovicells, (2) var. with
avicularia on the top of blunt umbones, (3) var. approaching erueifera,
but with a spine on the ovicell.

     VIII. June 17-19. The Committee hired the steam trawler 'Lady
Loch ' for June 18, and having favourable weather were able to work

out to the depression between the Isle of Man and Ireland (see chart,
PI. IV., and section). Two or three hauls were taken at each of the

followingo' :

    1. Six miles N.W. of Port Erin, 83 fathoms, sandy mud : Found,

Brissopsis lyrifera, Alcyonidium gelatinosum, Porania pulvillus, Adamsia

grossularia, Bowerhankia caudata, Eurynome aspera, Terebella nehulosa,

Thyone raphanus.

On all these expeditions, in addition to the animals picked out and

preserved at the time, surface and deeper gatherings with the tow-net

were taken by Mr. I. C. Thompson ; and samples of the bottom and of the

' dredge debris ' were kept, and these were afterwards carefully examined

by Mr. I. C. Thompson for copepoda, by Mr. A. O. Walker for amphi-

poda and isopoda, by Mr. A. Leicester for small moUusca, and by Dr.

Chaster for foraminifera. The sponges collected have been identified

by Dr. R. Hanitsch, and several other workers at the Port Erin Bio-

logical Station have assisted the Committee with particular sets of

animals. The additions to our knowledge of the fauna during the year

will now be given, taking the groups in zoological order.

Dr. Gr. W. Chaster reports that amongst the Foeaminipeea he has

examined two are new to science, and one is a form which seems to

require a new genus.

Amongst the Sponges examined by Dr. R. Hanitsch the following are

specially worthy of note : Ute glabra, obtained near Port St. Mary (this

is practically new to British seas, as it had only been found before at

Guernsey) ; Esperiopsis (Desmacidon) fruticosa, dredged off Calf of Man,

40 to 50 fathoms ; HaUchondria {Amphilectus ?) expansa, off Garwick

Head (previously known from Skye); Suberites sp. (?), some very large
masses, dredged halfway between Isle of Man and Lancashire, 20

fathoms; Raspailia s^). (new to the district), dredged off the Calf, 15

fathoms ;  Stelletta Collingsi, from the caves at  Spanish Head, Port Erin
                                                                                                                                                                         ;

Beniera rosea, at Fleshwick and Perwick Bay (recorded by Bowerbank

from Tenby and Sark only).

   We have found in the pools at Port Erin amongst other Htdroida

the Lafoea pygmoea of Alder, and have been able to prove that it is

really a Galycella ; and Sertularella Oayi has been added as a new

record to the district. In all fifty-seven species of zoophytes have been

recorded.

     Mr. J. H. Vanstone, curator at the Port Erin Biological Station, has
drawn up the following list of the Nemertida collected and identified

during the past year, partly by himself and partly by Mr. W. I. Beau-
mont, Emmanuel College, Cambridge, who was working for some time

at the station :

PrOTONEMERTINI : Carinella annulata.

Mesonemertini : Gephalothrix hioculata.
Metanemertini : Amphiporus lactifloreus, A. pulcher, Tetrastemma dor-

     Heteeonemektini : Lineus loiigissimus (=L. marimis), L. obscurus

(=2/. gesserensis), several varieties ; Cerehratulus (^angulatus ?^.

    In regard to Turbellaria, Mr. F. W. Gramble while working at tlie

Port Erin Biological Station last summer drew up a list of the species

found in the neighbourhood. This has been published in full in ' Trans.

Liverpool Biol. Soc.,' vol. vii. pp. 148-174. The list contains records of
twenty-eight species, representing twenty-three genera. Of these the
following live species are new to British seas : Promesostoma ovoideum,

P. lenticulatum, Byrsophlebs intermedia, Plagiostoma sulpliureum, Oligo-

cladus sangninolentus.

     The PoLTZOA collected on the various expeditions have been examined
by Miss L. R. Thornely, who reports that amongst the many forms col-
lected, amounting to about eighty-one species, three at least are new

records to the district, viz., Aleyonidium mamillatum, Palmicellaria Skenei,
and Lepralia edax.

    The COPEPODA obtained both by surface nets and also from the mud

and other material from the dredge have yielded Mr. Thompson in all
136 species, of which eighteen are new records to British seas and eleven
are new to science. These last are : Ameu-a attenuata, Cletodes monensis,

Herdviania stylifera, Cyclops marimis, Hersilioides Puffini, Jonesiella
kycsnce, Laophonte spinosa, Lichomolgus maximus, Monstrilla longicornis,

Stenhelia denticulata and 8. hirsuta. These new species are all described
in full, and figured, in Mr. Thompson's ' Revised Report upon

the Copepoda of Liverpool Bay,' just published (August 1893) in
' Trans. Liverpool Biol. Soc.,' vol. vii., so it will perhaps be sufficient

for the purposes of this report to state the localities at which the new
species and those new to British seas were obtained, as follows :

      Labidocera acutum, Dana, off Puffin Island, 10 fathoms, dredo-ed.
     EucluBta marina, Prest., in ascidian, Garwick Bay.
     Herdmania stylifera, LC.T., 12 miles west of Port Erin, 39 fathoms,
in mud.

      Cyclops marinus, I.C.T., 20 miles off Southport, 20 fathoms, dredged.
      Oiardella Callianassce, Canu, Liverpool Bay, surface.

       Hersilioides Puffini, I.C.T., off Puffin Island, surface.

     Stenhelia denticulata, LC.T., in Port Erin, 5 fathoms, mud.
     Stenhelia hirsuta, LC.T., 12 miles west of Port Erin, 39 fathoms, mud.
     Ameira attenuata, LC.T., in Port Erin, 7 fathoms, mud.
     Jonesiella hymnce, LC.T., in Port Erin, 5 fathoms, mud.
     Laophonte spinosa, LC.T., in Port Erin, 7 fathoms, mud.
      Cletodes monensis, LC.T., 12 miles west of Port Erin, 39 fathoms,
mud.

     Monstrilla Dana, Clap., off Puffin Island and off Port Erin, surface.

      Monstrilla longicornis, LC.T., off Puffin Island, surface.

      Monstrilla rigida, LC.T., off Puffin Island, surface.
      Lichomolgus maximus, LC.T., in Pecten, off Port Erin, 20 fathoms.
      Sabelliphilus Sarsii, Clap., on Sahella, Beaumaris and Puffin Island.
      Artotrogus orbicularis, Boeck, Puffin Island, shore.

     It will be noticed that one of the above new species has required the
formation of a new genus, which Thompson has named Herdmania.^

    In regard to the new species, AmphilocMis melanops, Mr. Walker

states :

     ' This species is interesting from being very closely allied to A. Marionis,

Stebb., from Marion Island, from which it differs chiefly in its larger

eyes, and in having the palm and hind margin of both gnathopods less

convex. From A. oculatus (Hansen), from the west coast of Greenland,

which it resembles in the eye, it differs in having no spiniform process to

the  anterior  margin  of the  hand  of  the  second  gnathopod                                                    and  from
                                                                                                                ;

A. tenuimanus (Boeck) it differs in the eye, which is described by Sars as

being small, impei'fectly developed, and light red ; in the telson, which is

much shorter, and in the armature of the outer plates of the maxilhpedes,

which are terminated by a single spine, exactly as in 4. Marionis, instead

of two spines, as drawn by Sars. The mandibles have the molar tubercle

intermediate in character between Amphilochus and Oitanopsis (Sars), to

whose Gitanopsis inermis this species also has a great resemblance, but

differs in the above character and in the length of the telson, which

closely resembles that of A. Marionis. The length of a female with ova

is 2 mm.

   We have also taken the two brachiopods Crania anoviala and Tere-

hratula ca/put-serpentis, and the rare cephalopod Sepiola scandica (new

record), as well as the more common 8. atlantica.

In regard to fishes, although most of the hauls on the expeditions,

having been taken with the naturalists' dredge, were not suitable for the

capture of fish, still the Committee, chiefly through the exertions of

Mr. P. F. J. Corbin, of the Fisheries Laboratory, University College,

Liverpool, have collected records of 114 species of fish found in the district,

and have added the following species, previously unknown : Solea varie-

gata, Gohius quadrimaculatus, and Argentina Kplnjrcena.

In conclusion it may be stated that the Committee have conducted

eight expeditions between September and June, and have explored a

considerable amount of the Irish Sea around the Isle of Man, and

especially to the south and west. They have collected and identified

about a thousand species of marine animals, of which thirty-eight are new

records to the British fauna, 224 are new to the particular district (this

part of the Irish Sea), and seventeen are new to science.

The Committee give with this report a chart (Plate IV.) showing the

area under investigation, with the zones of depths indicated, and a section

from Ireland to Lancashire, through the Isle of Man, showing the marked

difference in depth between the sea to the east and that to the west.

They are also preparing a larger and more detailed chart of the sea to

the west and south of the Isle of Man, where most of their dredging has

been carried on, in which the nature of the bottom and other particulars

will be given ; but they wish to make this chart more complete by the

incorporation of further observations before publishing. As the Com-
mittee are now applying to be reappointed, with a further grant to enable

them to carry on the work for at least another year, they hope that the

more detailed chart will appear in illustration of a second report at the

next meeting of the Association.

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. P. L. Sclater, Professor

     E. Rat Lankestek, Professor J. Cossab Ewaet, Professor M. Fostee,
    Mr. A. SsDawiCK, Professor A. M. Maeshall, and Mr. Peecy

II. Oil the Function and Correlation of the PalUal Organs of the Ojjistho-

       branchiata. By John D. F. Gilchrist.

The table at the Ifaples Zoological Station hired by the British Associa-

tion has been occupied during the past year, under the sanction of your

Committee, by Mr. Cecil C. Duncan and Mr. John D. F. Gilchrist. The

object of Mr. Duncan's research was to investigate the action of coloured

light on assimilation in marine algse, and that of Mr. Gilchrist's the

function and correlation of the pallial organs of the Opisthobranchiata.

The reports furnished by both these gentlemen are appended, and give
evidence of much patient work satisfactorily carried out.

The Committee have received two applications for permission to use

the table during the ensuing year. The first is from Mr. B. S. Moore,
who proposes to investigate the origin of the reproductive elements in

various  types  of   fishes, as  well  as  in  other  marine  organisms                                                  and the
                                                                                                                      ;

second is from Mr. Edgar J. Allen, who wishes to continue his researches

on the development of the decapod Crustacea. Each of these applica-

tions is for a period of six months, the first to commence at the end of

September and the second in April. The occupation of the table for

the entire year is thus provided for. Both these gentlemen have already

made valuable contributions to our knowledge of the subjects upon which

they are engaged, and important results are likely to be obtained from

the investigations they propose to carry on at Naples.

Tour Committee trust that the Association will sanction the payment

of the grant of lOOZ., as in previous years, for the hire of the table in the

Zoological Station at Naples.

Notwithstanding the number of marine zoological stations which

have sprung into existence in diflferent parts of the world during the past

decade, the Naples Zoological Station steadily continues to extend both

in scope and in popularity, and each year shows an increase in the number

of naturalists who study in its laboratories : 747 workers have occupied

tables from the opening of the Station up to the end of June 1898, 71

names being enumerated on the list for last year.

The Physiological Laboratory, which was built in 1890-91, and forms

a handsome addition to the original building, is now thoroughly equipped,

Aand is in full working order.             number of important investigations

have been conducted in this department of the Station during the past

year, and doubtless many workers in the wide field of physiology will
now be attracted to Naples to avail themselves of the exceptional facilities

there ofiered for carrying out such researches.

The Chemical Laboratory is also a distinct and much appreciated gain

to the institution.

The Library, which has always been felt to be an adjunct of incal-

culable importance to the study and convenience of all who have worked

at the Station, is increasing so rapidly that new and more commodious
                        ----

rooms are now being prepared, capable of accommodating double or treble
the present number of books. Tbe Director is unrelenting in bis exertions
to make the Library as complete as possible, and it is his aim that it

should one day rank as the most complete Zoological Library in

existence.

     The progress of the various publications undertaken by the Station is
summarised as follows :

     1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel ' the monograph
by Dr. Giesbrecbt on ' Pelagic Copepoda ' (831 pp., 54 plates) has been
published and two other equally large monographs by Professor Delia

                                                      ;

Valle on ' Gammarini ' (about 950 pp. and 60 plates) and by Professor
Spengel ou ' Balanoglossus ' (about 800 pp. and 30 plates) will appear

before the end of the year. Monographs by Dr. W. Miiller on ' Ostracoda'

and by Dr. Jatta on ' Cephalopoda ' are ready, and the printing of the
former has been commenced. Monographs are being prepared by Dr.
Biirger on 'Nemertinea,' by Professor Apathy on ' Hirudinea,' by Professor

Ludwig on ' Echinodermata,' and by Dr. Scheviakoff ou ' Foraminifera '
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and a botanical monograph by Professor Falkenbei-g on ' Rhodomelese ' is

nearly ready.

2. Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel,'

vol. X., parts iii. and iv., with 18 plates, have been published ; and vol.
xi., parts i. and ii., with 13 plates, are in the press.

     3. Of the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' the whole ' Bericht ' for 1892

has been published.

The details extracted from the general report of the Zoological Station,

which have been courteously furnished by the officers, will be found at

the end of this report. They embrace lists (1) of the naturalists who

have  occupied  tables  since  the  last  report                                (2) of the  works published

     The algse to be experimented upon were kept in a large tank, with a
good stream of water running through, until they had the appearance of
being quite healthy. The determination of the composition of the
gas given oflf from the different coloured algse, when subjected to the

--action of different coloured light, was then proceeded with. The coloured

solutions, &c., are as follows : Diffused daylight ; red glass which passed

only rays from about B of the solar spectrum to midway between C and D
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

yellow light from a saturated solution of bichromate of potash which

Dpassed rays from B to about midway between Eand ; violet glass

passing all the blue and violet and a little red and yellow light ; violet

light from a strong solution of ammonio-cupric sulphate which absorbed
all light up to B, and finally a dilute alcoholic solution of chlorophyll from
grass. The gas analyses were made in the gas-room attached to the

chemical laboratory, according to Bunsen's method, the CO2 being deter-

mined by absorption with NaOH and the O2 by explosion with hydrogen.

The N2 was determined by difference. The same portion of the plant
was experimented on with the coloured solutions, &c., mentioned above.
Diffused daylight produced the maximum quantity of O2, and only in

four out of seventeen cases did coloured light produce more, viz.

experiments, Sebdenia, Codium, and also Haliseris giving results very

similar to those in the first series of experiments.

    On examining the absorption spectrum of the seventeen species of

algae, one is struck by the constant absorption of the extreme red almost

up to B, and the strong absorption between B and C which is so charac-
teristic of green chlorophyll. The rays absorbed between B and C are

stated by several observers to be the rays most necessary for aiding
assimilation. Alcoholic solutions of green and olive alg« had a red
fluorescence similar to that exhibited by solutions of green chlorophyll,
and if the spectrum from a small spectroscope is projected on to the
surface of the solutions of the colouring matter of olive or green algse,

the liquid fluoresces of a dark red colour from about B to some distance

in the violet, the red fluorescence being brightest where the greatest

absorption takes place in the original alcoholic solution. No fluorescence

could be detected in the living plant.' A. few preliminary experiments
were made in order to determine the quality of the light penetrating into
the sea, but nothing worth mentioning was observed. I hope to continue

these experiments with proiserly made apparatus.

     To the stafi" of the Station my sincere thanks are due for the great

kindness and assistance I have received at their hands.

                            II. Report on the Occupation of the Table.

                              By Mr. John D. F. Gilchrist.

    I beg to submit a report of the work done during my occupation of

 the table of the British Association at the Zoological Station in Naples.

      I had for six months been working in the Laboratory of Professor
 Arnold Lang, on the subject of the pallial organs of the Opistho-
branchiata. In order to understand the function and correlation of these
 difierent organs, as well as to make use of recent methods of silver and
 methylen-blue staining and of dissociation, it was necessary to have the
 animals in the living condition. Accordingly I gladly availed myself of
 the permission of the British Association to occupy the table at Naples,
 where alone I could get the necessary abundance and variety of material
 for such a comparative study. I applied for three months, to begin on
 April 10 ; but finding such abundance of material and opportunities for
 work, I applied for another month, and this was granted.

     With the material procured I am fully satisfied. Not only were such

 forms as Aplysia, Bulla, and Pleurobranchoia to be had in more than
 abundance, but others, such as Notarchus, Aeera, &c., were plentiful, and

 other forms which were not procured during my stay, such as Pleuro-
 phyllidea and Lobiger, were kindly given me from the stock of preserved

 material. These, along with the many Nudibranchiata which turned up,

 put at my disposal abundance of material for a comparative study.
     My first endeavour was to thoroughly understand the functional

 mechanism of the pallial complex, which presents such a variety of

     ' The band present between C and D in an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll was

  only to be found in a species of Phylloplwra. The very faint band at the junction
  of the yellow and green in an alcoholic solution of chlorophyll was found in six out
  of seventeen species, viz., Sebdenia, Tidalia, Peyssonelia,Plocamium, and Ceram'mm,

 and very dark in Halymenia. A broad dark absorption band is very constant

 between & and F, and in only seven species could the violet be said to be absorbed

  strongly.

interesting modifications in the Opistliobranchiata. This I did by obser-

vations on the living animal. Thus, for instance, the mantle of Ai^lysico

was found sometimes to exhibit a motion the effect of which was to keep

the water in circulation ronnd the gills. Again, a remarkable process of

flaccid skin at the front end of the mantle was found to play an important

part in conjugation. I found it also very instructive to ascertain the

strength and direction of the current of water in the pallial cavity and

elsewhere. Thus in Aplysia depilans and A. punctata the current was much

feebler than might have been expected, and in Aplysia limacina it was

even more so, while in other forms there was none at all. These and

--similar facts were noted throughout a variety of forms, and enabled me

to deduce some general conclusions for instance, that the development

of the osphradium is in intimate relation with the presence and strength

of the current of water, e.g., that in Aplysia depilans, where there is a

distinct current, the osphradium is more highly developed than in Aplysia

limacina, where the current is markedly less, and that where, as in

Pleurobranchoia or Umbrella, there is no current of water passing over

the gills, but is drawn directly into them, there is no sign of an osphra-

dium. Again, where, as in Pleurohranchus, the current first passes over

the rhinophora, there is no osphradium. This is more markedly the case

in the Nudibranchiata, where the place most exposed to the influence of

water was found to be the rhinophora. By facts of this nature, and also

by a comparison with the Proso branch lata, as far as my time would allow,
I was confirmed in my belief that there exists a relation of direct pro-

portion between the current of water and the development of the osphra-

dium, there exists a relation of indirect proportion between Osphradium

and Rhinophora, and that the Osphradium, whose function has hitherto

been regarded as obscure, is to be explained as an ordinary olfactory

organ in the same sense as the rhinophora are olfactory organs. To

further confirm this I made a series of experiments, but although these

seemed to be confirmatory they were not decisive. This difiicult

physiological work has still to be much further developed.
    By direct observation of the living animal I was able to note the

details of the contraction of the gills by which the blood is propelled
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

also to find some renal openings difiicult to discover in preserved material.

I found also in the remarkable gland before the gills in Pleurohranchcea

that there existed a current of water passing over the orifice and down

under the  gills                      also that there  was no excretion of mucus on  irritation.
                                   ;

I was thereby enabled to draw some conclusions as to its function. I

found these and similar facts as instructive as the anatomical details I

had previously ascertained.

With Golgi's methods I had no more success than others who have

tried them on the same animals.

With the methylen-blue method of staining living nerve fibres I at

first had also little success, but ultimately succeeded in getting a good

colouring by laying the nervous system bare and leaving it for about

twelve hours in a weak solution (ooVo P^^' cent.). Among other things I

was enabled by this means to convince myself that no direct connection

by means of nerve fibres exists between osphradium and cerebral ganglia,

as has been found to be the case in lamellibranchs, though sections cut

and coloured in the usual way present an appearance which might be

mistaken for this.

I had considerable trouble in finding a suitable fluid for dissociation,
--542

but at last found tbat picric acid ammoniac controlled by picrocarmine
was very suitable for the tissue. The picrocarmine having a slightly

fixing effect could be used in larger or smaller proportions, according to
the nature of the tissue. It at the same time afforded a good muscular
stain. For cilia I found tbat a few minutes' exposure to vapour of osmic

acid before dissociation gave good results. By these means I was able to

isolate cells of neural epithelium gills and glands, &c.

    Though some of the results of my work here have been negative rather

than positive I have reason to be satisfied, more especially with the
physiological facts ascertained. The material I have collected will be

used for the working out of further anatomical details, and the wbole will

form the subject of a future publication.

    Not among the least of the advantages which my stay at the Station

has afforded me was the opportunity of making the personal acquaintance

of other naturalists working in the same territory. I found our inter-

change of ideas and criticism invaluable.

    I have to express my gratitude to the Bi-itish Association for the
opportunity, which I could not otherwise have had, of completing my

work and making it more than a mere collection of anatomical details.

My thanks are also due to the authorities at the Station for their unex-

ceptionable kindness.

The object specially mentioned by the terms of the grant of 30Z.

placed at the disposal of the Committee for the present year has been
attained by reappointing Mr. Gamble to the use of a table to enable him
to extend his observations on British Turbellaria. Mr. Allen has been
reappointed to allow him to continue his researches on the development
of Decapod Crustacea ; and Miss F. Buchanan, whose observations made
in 1891 as the result of a previous appointment by the Committee are re-
 corded in the Report for 1892 (p. 356), has been reappointed with the
 intention of studying the development of Magelona.

      The Committee have thus appointed

            Mr. F. W. Gamble B.Sc, Owens College, Manchester, for one

                      month, from August 8, 1893.
               Mr. Edgar J. Allen, B.Sc, University College, London, for two

                       months, from June 1, 1893.
                Miss F. Buchanan, B.Sc, University College, London, for one

                       month, from September 1, 1893.

      The Committee have thus expended 15^. (taking into account the
 month which belongs to the Association free of charge), leaving an un-
 expended balance of 151., which they trust will be placed at their disposal
 to allow them to carry oq their work next year.

      They are naturally unable to furnish any account of results arrived at
 during the present year, but they are happy to be in a position to pre-
 sent the following reports on the work of the preceding year. These
 reports, taken in conjunction with the others which have been published
 in previous years, will serve to show that important results have been
 arrived at with the assistance of the grants made to this Committee.

      The Turhellaria of Plymouth Sound. By Mr. F. W. Gamble, B.Sc.

       Daring August and September of 1892 I occupied the Association's
  table, and was thus enabled to investigate the Turbellaria of Plymouth
  Sound and of its neighbourhood. Since, in contrast to the amount of
  research devoted to many of the other groups of animals composing our
  fauna, little attention has been hitherto bestowed on the Turbellaria, the

 results of my work show a marked increase in the number of species of

  this group occurring at Plymouth as compared with former records.
  More interesting than the numerical increase of the fauna are the re-
  lations of these newly-added forms to those inhabiting the Mediterranean
  and Adriatic seas on the one hand and the Scandinavian on the other.

II. Report on the Occupation of the Table. By Mr. Edgar J. Allen, B.Sc.

     Commencing work at the Plymouth Laboratory on June 3, 1892,

I occupied the table of the British Association for six weeks, my

stay being prolonged for another month through the kindness of Mr. Robert

Bayly, who furnished me with an additional nomination.

     Daring this period I was engaged on the study of certain points in the
anatomy of larvaa of Decapod Crustacea, more especially of Palcemonetes
varians. The principal results of the work are published in detail iu two-
papers, which have appeared during the course of the year :

               (1) Preliminary Account of the Nephridia and Body-cavity of
                         the Larva of Palcemonetes varians, 'Proc. Roy. Soc.,' 1892,

                            ' Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci.,' xxxiv., 1893.

     The following is an outline of the conclusions arrived at. The green
gland commences to develop a lumen about the time of hatching of the
larva. The gland then consists of an end-sac and of a short tube which
opens externally. The distal portion of this tube subsequently enlarges
to form the bladder of the gland, the bladders of the two sides finally
uniting in the middle dorsal line, thereby forming the unpaired nephro-

peritoneal sac.

     In late embryos and in young larvae a shell-gland is present, consist-
ing of an end-sac and tube, and opening at the base of the second

maxilla.

    A dorsal sac, completely enclosed by epithelium, is found in both

larvae and adults. This sac, which does not contain blood, lies dorsal
to the nephro-peritoneal sac, and extends backwards over the front end
of the genital glands. The cephalic aorta lies within this sac.

     The dorsal sac is formed as a hollowing out in masses of meso-

derm cells, which lie upon either side of the aorta. Two lateral

cavities are thus formed, which increase in size and unite below the

aorta. From this mode of development it appears probable that the

dorsal sac is homologous with the dorsal portions of the mesoblastic
somites of Peripatus, and hence must be regarded as a true ccelom. The
general body-cavity also seems to be homologous with that of PeripatuSy
and to be haemocoelic in nature.

Notes on How Fish find Food. By Gregg Wilson, M.A., B.Sc, Edin,

    For a month from August 1.5 of last year I occupied the table at the
Plymouth Marine Station provided for me by the British Association,

and during that time I devoted myself chiefly to the study of the feeding
habits of fish. In connection with some work that I had done earlier in

the year on the Aberdeenshire coast my attention had been called to the

practical importance of Bateson's distinction between sight-feeders and

smell-feeders,' and I desired to repeat and test his experiments, and, if

possible, extend his results. I find that his main conclusion is a sound

one :  there are sight-feeders and there  are smell-feeders  among the fish
                                                                                                                                             ;

but the distinction is not absolute, and my observations do not in all

cases correspond with Bateson's. In a few notes I will summarise my

--conclusions.
     I. Sight-feeders. I found no fish that did not use its smelling powers
more or less in the search for food. Bateson's instance of the pollack
(Gadus pollachiiis), that usually hunts and feeds, relying entirely oil

appearances, but which, when its hunger has been appeased, noses its food

before eating, is an illustration of, perhaps, the minimum use of smell

observed by me. Many other habitual sight-feeders make, or can make,

lauch more extensive use of the nose. The well-known fact that stale

bait appeals to few of our food-fishes points to this, and my experiments

bear it out.

So far as I could determine, fish that are not very hungry habitually

smell food before taking it. The pollack seems usually to be ready for a

naeal, and on almost all occasions when anything eatable is thrown into

the tank in which it is swimming it rushes towards it, and bolts it. It

does not hesitate to take stale food or food that has been steeped in

strong smelling fluids ; and time after time I have been amused to see
its too-late repentance after it had swallowed clams that had been

saturated with alcohol, chloroform, turpentine, &c. It is only when it is

satiated with frssh food or disgusted with what is nauseous that it takes

the precaution to smell before eating. On the other hand, various fish

that are equally keen-sighted, and habitually recognise their food by

the use of their eyes, are more prudent. The whiting {Gadus mer-
langus), for instance, appears to pay much more attention to smell, and,

as a rule, turns about and withdraws on approaching within a few inches

of high-smelling objects that the pollack would take without hesitation.

Even whiting, however, cease to be delicate if they are very hungry, and

if other fish are present to compete for the food that is thrown to them.

In such circumstances bait that is very distasteful may be taken by even

the most cautious of sight-feeders ; and likewise in such circumstances a

quite smell-less artificial bait may be successfully employed. Where large
shoals of fish are, there are likely to be many that are very hungry, and

the consequent keen competition will lead to hasty feeding by sight alone
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and hence it is, probably, that lead-baits are successfully employed in cod-
fishing in the Moray Firth and ofi" the Northern Islands, while they are
of no avail among the scanty fish further south.

    It may be said that in these cases the fish actually search for their food

by sight alone, and merely test the quality of what they have found by
smelling it ; and Bateson quite recognised this. But more is possible :

habitual sight-feeders can he induced to hunt by smell alone. The pollack,
which is such a pronounced sight-feeder that it will take a hook baited
with a white feather or a little bit of flannel and trolled along the sur-
face, is yet able, when blinded, to get its food with great ease. Several

blind specimens in the Plymouth tanks were carefully watched by me
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

and I had no difliculty in deciding that it was by smell alone that

they found their food. Their conduct was exactly such as was seen in

the smell-feeders, to which I shall presently refer.

     Again, the cod (Gadus morrhua), which Bateson puts among the sight

-- --feeders, is generally believed and with good reason, I think to feed

more by night than  by day                                   which  suggests  that  it,  too, not  only                                                         tests
                                                          ;

its food, but actually hunts by smell.

Lastly, in this connection I would state the results of my experiments.

--I worked with a number of fish,                            and always  with the        same success                                                           but I
                                                                                                                                                             ;

shall here only refer to one case that of the dabs (Pleuronectes limanda).

That they were sight-feeders was evidenced by their behaviour when I

lowered a closed tube full of water, and with a worm in the middle of it,

into their tank : time after time they bumped their noses against the

glass at the very spot where the worm was situated. That they could
550 EEPOET-- 1893.

also recognise tlie smell of food, apart from seeing it, was demonstrated

in various ways. First, if instead of a closed tube, as in the last-men-

tioned experiment, one open at the bottom was used, after a short interval

the nosing at the part where the worm was seen ceased, and the lower

end of the tube, from which, doubtless, worm-juice was diffusing, was
vigorously nosed. If, again, instead of putting worms into a tube I placed

a number of them in a closed wooden box with minute apertures to let

water pass in and out, there was a similar excitement produced, and the

dabs hunted eagerly in eveiy direction. When water in which many

worms had lain for some time was simply poured into the tank through
a tube that had been in position for several days, and by a person who

was out of sight of the dabs, the results were most marked. In a few

seconds hunting began, and in their excitement the dabs frequently leapt

out of the water, apparently at air-bubbles, ard on one occasion one

even cleared the side of the tank, which was about two inches above the

water, and fell on to the floor of the aquarium. Yet there was nothing

visible to stimulate this quest.

  --II. Smell-feeders. In the case of the smell-feeders I was also led to

doubt the exclusive dedication of the one sense to the task of food-

finding. Congers {Conger vulgaris) certainly do all that Bateson's paper

says of them : they hunt by night ; they do not go at once or direct to

food that is near them, but after it has been in their neighbourhood for a

short time grope around for it, till they gradually approach so near that

they touch it ; and then they snap at it greedily. They cannot find food

that  has  been washed  in  ordinary salt-water so as to remove                                        the  smell
                                                                                                                                 ;

they hunt when good-smelling fluids are poured into their tank ; and they

swallow corks or even stones that are suitably flavoured. But I came to

--the conclusion that the congers in Plymouth Aquarium and I have no

--reason for supposing them to be different from other congers were

'practically hlind. I have seen two when hunting come into direct colli-

sion with  such violence  as  to  produce  a  loud thud                                                and once I saw one
                                                                                                    ;

start back in alarm on coming in contact with a crab that was in its

way. I have seen one lose its prey, and then hunt for it again in the same
indirect way as at first, though it certainly had discovered that the fish
was a thing good to eat. Often, too, a conger when close to its food

makes a snap in the wrong direction : it is when it touches that it snaps

successfully. So the sense of sight cannot be very good ! There is,
however, at least a perception of the difference between light and

darkness ; and a conger will retreat from a lighted match even by day,
and at night will seek shelter when a lantern is exposed.

Unfortunately, though there were plenty of congers in the tanks

while I was at Plymouth, other smell-feeders were not well represented.

The rockling and sole, however, were available, and I repeatedly made

experiments with them. The rockling (Motella tricirratd) seems to be a.

true smell- feeder : it ' hunts ' by night ; it becomes highly excited when

an extract of any of its favourite foods is poured into the water in which

it is. Unlike the conger, however, it sees very well, as Bateson himself

pointed out. And, more than that, it can find its food by sight, though for

-- --some reason perhaps because of the timidity of the fish this is difficult

to observe. Several times I saw appearances that almost demonstrated

the fact, and on one occasion the behaviour of a rockling left no room

for further doubt. For ten days it had had almost no food, and when, at

the end of that time, worms were thrown into its tank, it quite plainly
                                     --

saw them, and recognised them as food ; for it rushed at them and took

them while they were still falling through the water. When a number
of worms were subsequently put in at once, the rockling swam two or

three times rapidly round the tank, taking all that were within reach.

As I wrote in my note-book at the time, this is ' clear proof of use of

sight.'

    As regards soles (Solea vulgaris) I got evidence more easily. They
see well, and will come forward from far back in a tank when a hand-
kerchief is waved before the glass. I have seen them gather at once
from all parts of a large tank to feed on worms that were thrown to
them ; I have seen them rise to take worms that were falling through
the water, or to seize without groping or hesita,tion prawns that were
swimming about the tank. So 1 have no difficulty in deciding that they,

too, use sight as well as smell in seeking their food. I confess I cannot

understand why Bateson's soles should have failed to find worms that were

suspended a little above the bottom. Perhaps they were more nervous

than those I had to deal with ; or mine may have been educated by the

experience of the intervening years !

     The Committee desire to conclude their report by expressing the hope

that the Association will place in their hands, for use during the ensuing

year, the unexpended balance of 151. They believe that competent
workers have been materially assisted by being appointed to the free use
of a table at the Plymouth Laboratory, while they feel that the latter

institution deserves the further support of the British Association.

The Physiological Action of the Inhalation of Oxygen in Asphyxia,

  --more especially in Goal Mines. Report of the Committee^

     consisting of Professor J. Gr. McKendrick, F.R.S. (Chairman),

    Dr. J. T. BoTTOMLEY, F.R.S. , and Mr. W. Ernest F. Thomson,

    M.A., M.D. {Secretary). {Brawn up by the Secretary.)

This Committee was appointed, at the Meeting in Edinburgh, 1892, of

the British Association, in order to ascertain, primarily, whether oxygen

gas is of any service as a restorative in carbonic-acid poisoning, such as

occurs in the form of choke=damp asphyxia in mines. Secondarily, it

was considered advisable by the Committee to inquire somewhat into the

action of oxygen                                                                                   first on persons  in health, and secondly on those
                                                                                                ;

suffering from disease giving rise to retention of carbonic acid in the

blood. The Committee, however, do not attach very great importance

to their observations of the latter class.

     The Committee consisted of Professor McKendrick, Chairman ; Dr.

J. T. Bottomley, and Dr. W. Ernest P. Thomson, Secretary, by whom the

work was carried out, and who has prepared the report

The general conclusions at which the Committee have arrived are

based upon a considerable number of experiments on animals, and some

observations on human beings.

The following are the general conclusions :

I. In the case of rabbits asphyxiated slowly or ra>pidly, oxygen is of
552 REPORT-- 1893.

no greater service than air, whether the recovery be brought about in an

atmosphere contaminated by carbonic acid or completely free of carbonic

acid, and whether artificial respiration be resorted to in addition or not.

    II. Pure oxygen, when inhaled by a healthy man for five minutes,

produces no appreciable efiect either on the respiratory rate and volume

or on the pulse rate and volume.

     III. Oxygen, whether pure or somewhat diluted, produced no efiect

on one particular patient, who sufiered from cardiac dyspnoea of modei'ately

severe type, in the direction of amelioration of the dyspnoea ; and com-

pared with air inhaled under the same conditions produced no appreciable

effect, either on the respiratory rate and volume or on the pulse rate and

volume.

IV. An animal may be placed in a chamber, the general cavity of

which contains about 50 per cent, of carbonic acid, and retained there

for a long time without supervention of muscular collapse, provided a

gentle stream of a respirable gas-air or oxygen indifferently be allowed

to play upon the nostrils and agitate the surrounding atmosphere.

  --The points which are not proved are 1st. Whether oxygen produces

marked effects, toxic or otherwise, when inhaled for a long time 2nd.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

Whether oxygen is of service in cases of cyanosis due to diminished

respiratory  surface,  e.g., in  pneumonia                                                     3rd.  Whether oxygen is capable
                                                                                            ;

of bringing about the cure of many diseases in which it has received the

credit of being a remedial agent.

Finally, since this investigation was primarily undertaken in the

interests of the mining community, the Committee are strongly inclined to

urge that advantage be taken of the fact, now ascertained, that oxygen is

of no greater service than pure air in cases of asphyxia, and that the

experiment be made of keeping a few cylinders of air, with nose and

mouth pieces, ready for use in those parts of the workings where men

might be most easily imprisoned. The expense of the compressed air

would be much less than that of oxygen, and the effect would be equally

good. It seems quite reasonable to suppose that when a suffocated

person has to be dragged through a long passage, itself more or less

contaminated as regards its atmosphere, the chances of ultimate recovery

will be greater if the effects of this poisonous atmosphere be neutralised

at the commencement and during the progress of the work of rescue

than if no such attempt be made until fresh air be reached in the

ordinary way.

--The Legislative Protection of Wild Birds' Eggs. Report of the

     Committee, consisting of Mr. Thomas Henry Thomas, R.G.A.

      (Chairman), Rev. Canon Tristram, B.D., LL.D., F.R.S., Pro-
     fessor Alfred Newton, F.R.S., Professor Adolph Leipner, F.Z.S.,

     Professor Newton Parker, Ph.D., F.Z.S., and Dr. Charles Tan-
     field Vachell (Secretary). (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

Tour Committee beg leave to report that early in the present session

A* Bill to Amend the Wild Birds Protection Act, 1880,' was brought

into the House of Commons by Sir Henry Maxwell, M.P., and others,

and that on April 13 it was ordered by the House to be printed.
Thereupon your Committee gave this Bill their careful attention, and
ON THE PROTECTION OF WILD BIRDS' EGGS.  553

found that its main clause contained a provision for the protection of
·wild birds' eggs. In the opinion of your Committee, however, this pro-
vision was framed on a principle that appears to them to be mistaken,
in that it sought to effect the desired object by empowering local autho-
rities to name the species the eggs of which were to be protected, thus

requiring in every case of prosecution proof of identity, which in the
majority of cases would be difficult, if not impossible, to supply. Never-

theless, the Bill met with favourable acceptance in the House of Commons,
and with some very trifling alterations only, and without any discussion
·of its principle, passed the third reading, and was seat up to the House

of Lords on May 2. In the House of Lords the chief objection to the
Bill, which had already been observed by your Committee, was, among

others, prominently brought forward by several speeches in a debate on
the second reading, June 14, and accordingly a series of amendments
were introduced and carried when the Bill was in committee, on June 16.
In almost every point these amendments, and especially one which pro-
vided that protection should be giver to birds which most required it
hj empowering local authorities to name areas in which for a given time
the taking of eggs should be wholly prohibited, accorded with the
opinion at which your Committee had previously arrived. Subsequently,
the Bill was further amended by the Standing Committee of the House
of Lords, and, having been read a third time, was sent back to the House

of Commons for its approval of their Lordships' amendments.

     These your Committee, after duly considering them, had hoped

would be at once accepted by the House of Commons ; but, on August 21,
on the motion of Sir H. Maxwell, it was moved that consideration of
them should be adjourned for three months, and therefore the fate of the

Bill remains doubtful.

     In view of the uncertainty thus existing your Committee would
recommend their reappointment on the same terms as before.

--Index Generum et Specierum Animalium. Report of the Covi-

     mittee, consisting of Sir W. H. Flower, Dr. P. L. Sclater,
     Dr. H. Woodward, and Mr. G-. Brook (Secretary), for super-

      vising its compilation by INIr. C. Davies Sherborn.

This index, commenced in 1890, was continued by the compiler un-
assisted until 1892, when the British Association made a grant of 201. in
aid of the work. The compilation continues to progress satisfactorily,
about 200 volumes having been searched through, and over 10,000
species having been indexed during the past year. The work is extremely
laborious, chiefly by reason of the difficulty in many cases of determining
the exact date of publication of the book under examination ; bat the

results of the solution of difficult problems of this kind are invariably

made public so soon aa their accuracy has been satisfactorily proved. Of
these results the publication of the dates of Schreber's ' Saugthiere ' by the
Zoological Society of London in their ' Proceedings ' for ] 891 may be
cited. Of the books examined this year the accurate determination of
the dates of the ' Encyclopedic Methodique ' is, perhaps, the most important

result attained. These dates will also be published in the Zoological
Society's ' Proceedings.'

     The plan of work adopted by the compiler has been favourably com-
mented upon, among foreign specialists, by Professor J. Victor Carus,
Professor Sven Loven, and Mr. S. H. Scudq|ii. The Committee ask for
their reappointment, with a grant of 30?. in aid of the continuance of
this most useful compilation.

--Scottish Place-names. Report of the Committee, consisting of

    Sir C. W. Wilson, F.R.S. (Chairman), Dr. J. Burgess (Secre-

    tary), and Mr. Coutts Trotter. (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

The Committee have to report that at their suggestion a Place-namea
Committee of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society was appointed to

consider the orthography of the Place-names on the survey maps of
Scotland, and specially to revise the spellings in the Gaelic-speaking

districts of the country.

     This committee, which had power to add to their number, con-
sisted of Professor James Geikie, LL.D., F.R.S. , Sherifif^neas Mackay^
LL.D., Professor Julias Eggeling, Ph.D., Mr. A. Silva White, Secretary,

R.  Scot.  Geog.  Soc.                     and James  Burgess,  LL.D.,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Chairman.  It met on
                                        ;

November 20, 1891, and arranged the forms to be used in collecting

information, agreed to appoint local committees in each parish, and to

make additions to the committee of gentlemen specially qualified to aid

in the work.

  --After correspondence there were subsequently added to the Committee

the following gentlemen: Rev. Dr. Masson, M.D., Ex-Sheriff Alex,

Nicolson, LL.D., W. J. N. Liddall, Esq., Advocate, Sheriff D. Mac-
kechnie, Dr. D. Christison, Professor Blackburn, Hew Morrison, Esq.,
J. M. Rusk, S.S.C, W. C. Smith, Esq., Advocate, Dr. Bannerman.

     The Committee were of opinion that, whilst names referred to them
by the Ordnance Survey from Lowland districts might be satisfactorily
dealt with by correspondence, personal knowledge, and references to-
records, it would be desirable to proceed otherwise with the great mass
of Gaelic names in Highland districts, and for these it was decided that
it would be necessary to prepare lists of all the names in each parish, and

to submit them, in the first place, to local or parish committees appointed

for the purpose of pointing out and correcting all supposed errors in
spelling. The local aiTangement of names in the survey books greatly

facilitated the identification of the spots intended                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               and the Chairman wa»

committees. The islands of Islay and Jura were then undertaken, and

the following instructions were issued to the local committees :

                                                         DIRECTIONS.

     * (1) The Place-names to be revised are written out under Column I.
Against those correctly spelt a x should be affixed in Column II. Cor-
respondents will distinguish names of Norse or English origin by adding

Nthe initial letter or E to the X under Column II.

                                                                                                                      ON SCOTTISH PLACE-NAMES.                                                                                    555

     ' (2) Those names which are incorrectly spelt should be rewritten,
in a clear legible hand, on the same line under Column III. Such

corrections should be attested by at least three local authorities in

Column IV.

     ' (3) In those instances where thei'e are alternative forms of spelling
the same name, the alternative form or forms should be given under

Column III., and attested in the usual way in Column IV.

    '(4) Names of Norwegian origin are prevalent, more especially in

Ari'an, Jura, Islay, Morvern, Skye, the Outer Hebrides, &c. The utmost

care should be taken to discriminate all such names, and to give under

Column III. their proper spellings, with or without the Gaelic spellings

that may be in use for the same-- to be attested in Column IV. Names

of Norse and English origin have the generic element after the specific,

as  in  Oak-field, Helins-dale,                                                                                       Lidi-strom                                                                          whereas  Gaelic  names  almost
                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

always have the generic yirsi, as Auchindarrock, Glen-shee, Inch-keith.

    ' (5) Special information by correspondents can be communicated

on separate sheets of paper.'

    The first lists were for Kilchoman parish, containing about 970 names,,

and were undertaken by a local committee, consisting of Rev. J. Barnet,,

Mr. Wm. Campbell, Mr. Donald McGilp, Mr. John Campbell, Uev. James

Macmillan, Mr. Neil Orr,                                                                                              Portnahaven                                                                         and Mr. John Brown.
                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

    These gentlemen did their work with much care and attention, and

returned the revised list by June, 1892. The Committee then held,

frequent meetings in examination of the revised names, and approved of

the great majority of the changes proposed.

    Meanwhile, the lists for Killarow and Kilmeny, Kildalton and Oa, and.

for Jura, had been issued. The Killarow and Kilmeny list contained

about 940 Place-names, and was undertaken by a local committee,

consisting of Rev. John McLachlan, Kilmeny ; Rev. Peter Stewart,.

Killarow ; Mr. W. McFadyen, Ballygrant ; Mr. P. Macintyre ; Rev. P.

Mclver, Bowmore ; Mr. Murdoch McTaggart, sohcitor ; and Mr. D. Mac-
bean, Public School, Bowmore.

    The returns from this parish were discussed by the Committee at

meetings held in November and December, 1892.

     The list for Jura has not yet been returned. That for Kildalton and

Oa contained over 1,200 names, and the local committee were Rev. Wm.

Campbell, Mr. Colin Hay, Mr. Lachlan McCuaig, Rev. D. McMaster,..

Mrs. Ramsay, and Mr. Colin Campbell. This list occupied the Com-

mittee at a series of meetings, and was disposed of during the early half

of the present year.

    From the ofiicers of the Ordnance Survey were also submitted, from

time to time, for the opinion of the Committee, local Place-names, such

as Auchendinny or Auchindinny ; Glencorse or Glencross ; Roslin^

Roslyn, or Roslyne ; Machars or M.achers ; Rinns or Rhynns ; Garwald

and Bara or Garwald                                                                                                   St. Monance or St. Monans.
                                                                                                                   ;

    In deciding on the spellings of these and such names the Committee

were guided largely (1) by what has been the prevalent spelling in deeds
and records of every kind up till a recent date, when names have fre-

quently been altered in spelling in an unaccountable way, possibly

through the influence of non-residents, railway and post-office officials,

newspaper writers, &c. For postal and other common purposes, it may

be quite sufficient to indicate a parish by the single name of ' Garwald ' ;

but the Ordnance map may be regarded and used as legal evidence, and
556 REPORT-- 1893.

in united parishes the inhabitants of the portions which formerly were

-- --separate parishes may each have burial and other rights of which the

double name Garwald and Bara is prima facie evidence, and for this

and for historical reasons the Committee considered that the full name

ought in all such cases to be preserved.

     (2) Where more spellings of a name than one have been long preva-
lent, and about equally so, it may be allowed, especially where local

feeling is in favour of it, to adopt that one which is nearer the older or

original form. If the people in Wigtownshire prefer ' Machars ' to

' Machers,' the Committee could only approve of such a spelling.

    (3) On the other hand, they could not attempt to enforce in a case

like that of ' Newbattle ' (which is well known to be a misnomer) a

reversion to a better form unless it were to be acceptable to the

proprietor.

(4) The Committee, however, would strongly object to all new and

fanciful spellings having no authority in the records of the last three

centuries. Some such have crept into our best maps, and have been

copied into popular gazetteers, almanacs, and the like : these have seldom

any authority, and misrepresent the historical Place-names.

In Gaelic names the Committee had to deal with different circum-

Astances.    large class of these had never appeared in any record they;

were so distinctly descriptive of the places that a person understanding

Gaelic could make no mistake about their meaning, and the only question

was the correct writing down of the name. Gaelic spelling, as well as

pronunciation, differs in districts lying apart : the enunciation and spell-

ing of a Ross-shire man will often differ from those of a native of Argyll

or Arran. There are also refinements of spelling that good scholars do

not consider necessary in Place-names. It has, therefore, been the aim of

the Committee not to give prominence to such refinements, but to deal

with the names on broad principles. This course the late Sheriff Nicolson,

who attended the Committee's meetings very regularly, and with the

weight of his extensive scholarship and local knowledge, was ever ready

to support. His death during the early part of this year has been a

serious loss to the Committee.

In such of the Highland names as occur in valuation rolls and other

records there appear to be fully a larger proportion of variants than in

the same class of names in Lowland districts, and there was consequently

more scope for choice, but also more frequent calls for deliberation and

investigation. This made the work more arduous and troublesome, and

--The Committee have received the following report from Mr. Bent :

     The four months which I was able to pass in Abyssinia at the beginning

Weof this year have been very productive in ethnographical research.

were able to visit the sites of rains at a spot called Yeba and at Aksum,
the ancient capital of this part of Ethiopia, and when there to take a
large number of photographs and impressions of inscriptions which throw
a flood of light on the origin of the Ethiopian race and language, and leave
no shadow of a doubt that both are derived in the first instance from
an ancient Arabian stock, namely, early Sabsean traders, who built them-
selves fortresses and temples in the Abyssinian mountains, and left there
traces of their writing and their art as far back as the eighth century B.C.

     About five hours' ride from Adoua, in a north-easterly direction, we
visited the village of Teha, where is a very ancient temple preserved
to us by the fact that it has been a religious centre in Abyssinia, and has
thus been protected from the depredations of marauders. The building

is a very fine specimen of ancient art, built with large ' drafted ' stones,

and crowning a knoll which commands the surrounding village and plain,
hemmed in on all sides by stupendous mountains. Here, too, we found
nine Himyaritic inscriptions, which Professor D. H. Miiller, of Vienna,
has deciphered, and which date back to the eighth century B.C. One

--of these gives the name of the place as Ava, and besides this we have

two references to this place Ava one given us by Nonnosus, who went as

ambassador from Justinian to the king of Abyssinia in 540 a.d., and
another from the Adulitan inscription, pi'obably about the first century

of our era. Both these agree in placing this town of Ava on the ancient
trade route between Adulis and Aksum, and consequently there is no
doubt whatsoever that the ruins of Yeha originally formed the town of

Ava, and that it was a Sabsean colony from Arabia which settled here for
the purposes of trade at a very remote period.

    Professor Miiller connects this temple of Ava with the worship of Baal
Ava, common at that period in Southern Arabia; and the nature of the

building, the monoliths adjoining it, the altar, and other facts too
numerous here to mention obviously connect this ruin with early Sabaean.
sun-worship ; and from its strength, decoration, and position we can clearly
see what a strong foothold the merchants of Arabia had gained in Abyssinia

many centuries before the commencement of our era. The neighbourhood
of Yeha is very fertile, and this fertility was accounted for by the in-

habitants from the fact that in the mountains behind they possess

caves in which they can store their goods out of the way of marauders,
and hence the valley of Teha is one of the most prosperous and fertile in
Abyssinia. It is a curious fact that Ava was probably the capital of this
district, known to the earliest geographers as Ethiopia Troglodytica, or

 that part of Ethiopia where the inhabitants dwelt in caves; it is just
:558              REPORT-- 1893.

possible that these very caves above Teha may have been the origin of

the term.

    Aksum is about forty miles inland from Yeha, and after the destruction
of Ava was for many centuries the capital of the Aksumite kings, and
subsequently of the emperors of Abyssinia. In subsequent years Aksum

-was abandoned as the political centre of the country, and gave place to

Gondar, and now to Ankoba in Shoa ; but it has always remained as the

religious capital of Abyssinia, the sacred city of the Ethiopians. Owing

to the disturbed state of the country we were only able to spend ten days
there, instead of two months, as we had originally intended; but in those

ten days we were able to amass a large quantity of valuable archfeological

material ; to take squeezes of the various early Ethiopian inscriptions,

some of which had only been indifferently copied before, and others are

new to science ;  to take photographs of the  various ruins  still standing
                                                                                                                                    ;

and to make a few excursions in the neighbourhood.

I can only give here the actual results of our work, and say what the

objects we found definitely prove : First, the long line of monoliths

Weform an excessively interesting study in rude stone monuments.

Tiave at Aksum the monolith in all its several stages of development, from

the rudest unhewn stone stuck in the ground like those at Yeha ; then

we have one with notches on it, another divided into storeys with beams

carved thereon ; and finally the highly finished monolith, with an altar at
its base, a door carved above this, and nine storeys represented on the

stone with imitation windows, and divided from one another by beams

which are pIso cut in the stone : these nine storeys culminate in a repre-

sentation of the heavenly luminary, and point to what the worship wa3

which originated them, namely, the  old  Sabaean sun-worship                                                                                              and these
                                                                                                                                                       ;

decorated monoliths represent the Bethel, or house of God, in its most

finished conception. The altars below are of very finished work, and

were made to fit tightly on to the monolith : one is surrounded with a well-
inown Himyaritic pattern, and has holes in the centre for the reception

of the blood of the slaughtered victims ; another has steps in it and
receptacles for the blood, carved in the representation of Greek vases,

with channels cut for the blood to run down each of the steps on to the
ground. There is no doubt about it that at Aksum existed a form of

Mithraic worship which came from Southern Arabia, and was introduced

"by the Himyarite merchants, who traded with the interior for ivory, gold,

and other rare produce valued in the ancient market.

     There are about seventy of these monoliths in and around Aksum,

some elaborately worked, others mere unhewn stones. Two of the largest,

decorated like the one above described, with an imitation door and

storeys, are fallen and broken into colossal fragments : they are both con-

siderably larger than the standing one, and must have been very imposing

objects when erect. Another monolith, 27 feet high, and presumably of

later date, shows a curious Greco- Egyptian influence in its decoration :
it had a representation of a Greek tomb or temple in antis at the top,
supported by an Ionic column made in the form of a lotus, with the two

little ivy leaves on either side so characteristic of Greek art in the first

centuries before and after Chi-ist. This Greek influence at Aksum is
especially remarkable, and may be easily accounted for by the Greek

influence and enterprise which were felt in the Red Sea after the conquests

of the Ptolemies and the opening out of commerce. Adnlis was the

port of this commerce, and Aksum seems to have been the capital of the
ON ANCIENT REMAINS IN ABYSSINIA.  559

district to whicli the tribes from the interior brought their commodities.

Greek architecture and art are therefore easily accounted for at Aksum.
It is a thoroughly Greek idea to decorate the unsightly unhewn rude
stone monuments, and, curiously enough, the realistic idea of carving doors,

windows, beams, and storeys is traceable to Greek art in Lycia, Caria,

and the southern provinces of Asia Minor. Then we have the altars with

Greek vases carved thereon ; tombs with the ciromos and chambers for

sarcophagi constructed of huge stones just like those found in Greece.

Rock-cut steps cover the hills behind Aksum, just as they do iu Greek
cities ; rock-cut tombs and fragments of architecture recall at many points
remains in an old Greek site. Early geographers tell us of this influence,

and that the kings of Aksum spoke and studied Greek ; and then finally
we have the bilingual inscription in which King Aizanes of Aksum

records his victories on one side in Greek and on the other in early

^Ethiopian in the fourth century of our era. One can thus readily under-
stand how the way was thus opened in Ethiopia for the Christian
missionaries from Alexandria, and that Ethiopia was one of the first

affiliated branches of the early Christian Church.

     The inscriptions which we brought from Aksum are of a later date

than those of Yeha, but show at the same time the Himyaritic script

generally developing into early Ethiopian, and form a very valuable

series from this point of view, incontestably proving the origin of Ethi-
opian, and that it is a survival to us of the early form of speech and
writing which was found in the early Sabaean and Himyaritic empire in
Southern Arabia.

     Professor D. H. Miiller has been hard at work for some weeks past

on these inscriptions and has developed much material of value. Two of
the inscriptions are quite new to science, and the others are read cor-

rectly for the first time, having previously been copied by travellers

ignorant of the complicated script ; but our impressions have now enabled
Professor Miiller to produce a correct rendering of them as they stand.

     Some of the principal points of value which have resulted from this

 study are, first, definite proof of the origin of the Ethiopian language,

and that it is a development or rather a dialect of Himyaritic. Secondly,
that the Ethiopians were pagans at least down to the fourth century
after Christ, worshipping the same gods as the early Arabians, and thus
the Ethiopian legend that they belonged to the Jewish religion from the
time of Menelek, the supposed son of Solomon by the Queen of Sheba,
is absolutely without foundation, and is probably a fantastic story in-
vented by the early Christians of Ethiopia, which, whilst it acknowledges
 their Arabian origrin, at the same time identifies them with the chosen
people of God. The grounds for this story, which have had weight even
with observers of modern times, are the existence of certain forms and
ceremonies akin to Judaism amongst the Ethiopians, which they owe
doubtless to their common Semitic origin. Another point made clear
 by the inscriptions is the origin of certain curious pedestals, which appa-
rently in former years carried metal statues, and of which there are
between twenty and thirty at Aksum. It appears from the inscriptions

that the kings of Aksum after a victory set up a throne in honour of it,

which they placed under the protection of their three gods, Astar, Medr,
and Barrats. Some were decorated with statues, others were plain, and
near them was stuck up the dedicatory stone ; and lastly Professor Miiller
proves that the Ethiopians called their country Habaset long before the
560 BEPORT-- 1893.

modem Arabians called it Habesh, which was supposed to be given it

owing to the mixture of the race. Hence the derivation of the name
Abyssinia is thus : Sab^an name Habaset, Arabian Habesh, which the
Portuguese gave to the world as Abessini when speaking of the in-
habitants, which we finally have made into Abyssinia.

    After visiting Aksum we went to the site of another set of ruins on
a lofty isolated plateau, now known by the Italians as the Altapiana
di Kohaito ; here we found the remains of a very extensive town with a

curious lake in the centre of it, the waters of which were preserved in

an artificial reservoir by a wall or dam built of huge stones without

cement, and obviously of a very ancient date. This well was 219 feet
across, and the centre part, 99 feet long, was built very strongly with

' throughs ' and steps to withstand the force of the water. On either
side of this stronger portion of the dam were two sluice gates, 5 feet
wide, and the construction of this wall corresponds in many ways to the
wall or dam at Mareb, the ancient Mariaba, or capital of the Sabaean

kingdom in Southern Arabia. This is the chief feature of interest
amongst the ruins. Around the lake are the scattered remains of many
buildings, temples, houses, and so forth ; the columns and capitals of the

temples are interesting as connecting the style of architecture exactly

with that in use at Adulis, the port of this part of Ethiopia. The
columns are square with a groove cut at each angle, and the capitals are

also square in three tiers.
      This ancient town, long since abandoned, is easily to be identified with

the Koloe of the early geographers ; in fact, the locality as placed by the

Periplus of the Red Sea, namely, three days from Adulis and five from
Aksum, is exactly where it should be, and probably it was a summer

resort of the rich merchants of Adulis : it is situated at an elevation of
7,000 feet above the sea, and enjoys a most salubrious climate. The
plateau is curiously isolated from the surrounding mountains, and the

approaches to it are now exceedingly difficult ; but there are ample traces

of ancient roadways and sustaining walls long ago ruined. Immediately
in the valley below, just on the ancient trade road between Adulis and
Aksum, there are the ruins of another village with a few columns of a
temple still standing of precisely the same form of architecture as that
at Koloe and Adulis, and this village would appear to have been a
halting place for the caravans on their way into the interior at the foot
of the hill on which Koloe was built.

     These are amongst the most prominent points of the archfeological

discoveries we made in Abyssinia, which I hope shortly to develop at

greater length with the collaboration of Professor D. H. Miiller.
     "With regard to the anthropology of the Abyssinians of to-day our

results were naturally considerably hampered by not knowing the
language, and having to obtain our information second hand from an
interpreter. However, I think we have been able to arrive at several
points of interest, more especially in connection with the quaint and
interesting form of Christianity which is the national religion of the

country.
     In the first place the Christianity of Abyssinia is obviously one

grafted on a form of paganism closely akin to sun-worship. As we find
in Greece innumerable instances of the way the early divines grafted
Christianity on to the existing paganism of Greece and Rome, blending
the saints and customs of Christianity with the gods and rites of the old
                ON ANCIENT KEMAINS IN ABYSSINIA.                                                                                                                                        561

pagan religion, so we find in Abyssinia obvious traces of sun-worship

as the peculiar form of religion which had to give way to Christianity.

In the first place all the churches are round, with four doors oriented

to the four points of the compass. They are all surrounded by an outer

enclosure, which is thickly planted with trees, and corresponds to the

sacred groves so associated in our minds with Baal- worship.

During the Lenten fasts the services are always conducted at night,

and cease immediately at sunrise ; the peculiar ritual of dancing without

--which no service in Abyssinia is complete dancing to the tune of

--an instrument exactly corresponding to the sisfrum of ancient Egyptian

days is a trace of the dancing which formed an integral part of Baal-

worship.

The great Abyssinian Church ceremony of Mascal, or the raising of

the Cross, which takes place in September, is accompanied by the lighting

of bonfires at night on all the neighbouring heights and the sacrifice of oxen
and other animals. The second great Church ceremony is the blessing

of the waters at Epiphany and the baptizing of the Cross, thus honouring

water as the next great element after the sun in the process of natural

generation. As a curious side proof of this theory may be mentioned an

illustration given in an Ethiopian catechism as an illustration of the

mystery of the Trinity. ' The Godhead is like the sun, consisting of

three parts joined in one and indivisible, namely, rotundity, light, and

heat.'

The points in the Abyssinian ritual which have favoured the suppo-

sition that they belonged to Judaism before Christianity was preached

amongst them are these : The construction of their churches with an

outer circle, corresponding to the court of the Gentiles ; an inner circle, to

the court of the Levites                                                                                                           and the Holy  of Holies,                             where the Ark and the
                                                                                                                                ;

tables of the law are supposed to be kept, with its veil hanging before it.

Secondly, the abstention from eating the same unclean animals which
the Jews abstain from. Thirdly, the practice of circumcision . Fourthly,
their calendars and feasts curiously correspond. I take it that the first

and last are purely accidental, and that the third and fourth are common

to all Semitic races ; and certainly the inscriptions from Aksum exclude

all possibility of Judaism having existed in the country as the national

religion prior to Christianity.

Another feature which we noticed particularly with regard to the

Abyssinian Church is its strict adherence to the orthodox or Greek ritual,
and the antagonism which reigns still, and always has reigned, against

the tenets of Rome and Western Christianity. As in Greece, the priest-

hood is divided into monastic priests and working or village priests.
The dignities of the Church are reserved for the foi-mer: they never
marry, and live their useless lives on the top of isolated mountains. The

village priest, who performs the services of the Church, may marry before

-- --he is ordained, and not after ^just like the Greek priests and he never

can aspire to any of the more lucrative positions in the Church. The

pictures of the Abyssinian Church are distinctly Byzantine in character,

exceedingly grotesque, but off'ering points of comparison to the work done
on Mount Athos. Their legends, superstitions, and quaint beliefs all

correspond  to  those  of the                                                                                                      Eastern  Church                                      and naturally this is to  be
                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

expected, as the Abyssinian Church is an afl&liated Church of the Alex-

andrian patriarchate, and is governed by an abouna sent out from the
Coptic Church of Cairo. But it shows in a remarkable manner the

1893.
562 BEPORT-- 1893.

tenacity with whicli the customs and ritual of early Christianity have
been maintained, and the absolute failure of the Portuguese Jesuits to
bring Abyssinia under the dominion of the Pope is aptly parallelled by the

absolute failure of the Roman Catholics to obtain a foothold in Greece,

and bring about a union of the Eastern and Western Churches.
     Nearly everything one comes across in Abyssinia has an interesting

pedigree from the old world. The shamma, or cloak, they wear is neither

more nor less than the old Roman toga : it is worn in precisely the ancient

manner, with the right hand buried in the folds and the end thrown
over the shoulder. The musical instruments they play are similar. The
long trumpet played at games and festivals was well known in the ancient
world as the tuba. The sistrum, or rattle, I have already alluded to.
The Abyssinian harp is exactly like its old classical prototype, the lyra.

We still find the rounded sounding-board, made in the form of a tortoise-

shell, the ancient testudo of the lyre : out of this come the two cornua,
and the strings are not touched with the fingers, but with plectra. The
fly-flap used by the priests is exactly like the fly-flaps depicted on the
Egyptian tombs. Children up to the age of puberty wear bullce, just as

Roman children did. Every Abyssinian has his thorn-extractor, made of
pliable metal, like the volsellce of Roman times. The popular Abyssinian

game, played on a sort of board with holes, something akin to draughts,
is commonly found wherever Arabian influence has been felt all over the
coast line of the East, in Asia and Africa alike. The umbrella, and the
dignity attached thereto, is distinctly old world. The sacred arcana are

always carried under gorgeously decorated umbrellas ; only a prince may

wear a red one, grandees wear white ones, and peasants go to market
with umbrellas made of straw. There is hardly anything in Abyssinia
which is not a well-authenticated relic of a bygone civilisation, as the few

instances which I have given here will show.

    We took the measurement of some fifty Abyssinians, according to the

rules and regulations set down by the Anthropological Institute. These
measurements have been placed in the hands of Dr. Garson, who has
undertaken to work them out.

      T hope in the ensuing winter to visit Southern Arabia, with a view
to following up the same line of study, both archaeological and anthropo-
logical. I feel confident that if Southern Arabia be submitted to a careful

examination we shall there find traces of an exceedingly primitive civili-
sation ; traces of an empire which existed many centuries before our era,
which spread down the east coast of Africa south of the Zambesi, and
constructed the ruined buildings visited by us last year in Mashonaland,
and which, as Professor Miiller shows, are built on exactly the same
principle as those of Mareb and Sirwah in Southern Arabia, and were
probably used for the same form of religion.

     This year we have found traces of an Arabian occupation of Arabia as

far back as the eighth century before our era in the mountains of

Abyssinia. As discovery follows discovery I am sure we shall be able to

reconstruct the history of a once mighty commercial race, which was
contemporaneous with the best days of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, and
which provided the ancient world with most of its most valued luxuries.

On the Morphological Characters of the Ahijssinians. By J. G. Gaeson,

      M.B., V.P., Anthrop. hist., Gorresp. Memb. Anthrop. Soc. Paris and

        Berlin.

     The data for this paper are a series of observations made by Mr. J.

Theodore Bent during his expedition to Abyssinia on 46 male natives

between the ages of twenty and forty years, 22 of whom belong to the

Tigre tribe, 12 to the Amhara tribe, 4 to the Hamasan tribe, 1 to the
Bogos tribe, 6 to the Galla tribe, and 1 to the Barea tribe. The first
four tribes are members of the Himyaritic group of Semites, the Gallas

are Hamites, and the Barea are one of the unclassified tribes.

     The colour of the skin of the Himyaritic tribes is generally a rich

chocolate, but sometimes cases of a dark yellow-brown or dark-olive hue

occur. The Gallas are generally darker, being usually of a sooty-biack

colour ; the Barea is also sooty-black. The eyes are dark, and a vestige
of afraenum occurs in many cases at the inner angle of the eye. The hair
is black and curly. The profile of the nose is uniformly straight. Pro-
gnathism of the mouth is generally very slight or entirely absent, except

in the Gallas, where it is more marked than in the others. The lips
are of medium thickness, but are somewhat thicker in the Gallas than

in the other tribes. Platyprosopism, or flatness of face, predominates

throughont all the tribes, but is slightly more marked in the Amhara

than in the others.

     The cephalic index varies from 64 to 88, but chiefly centres between

76 and 79, the mean index of the series being 78-5, which places them in
the mesaticephalic group. In the Amhara tribe it averages 81 '4, in the
Tigre 78'2, in the Grallas 79. The module of the head averages 168, as

obtained from the length, breadth, and height of the calvara added

     Although the tribes examined are all members of the Caucasian

family, the Gallas and the Barea are more negroid in their characters than

Semites the Amhara are more negroid than the Tigre, while the latter
retain more of the characters probably typical of the inhabitants of South
Arabia, the country which their language indicates as the original home
from which they have migrated.

--The Exploration of the Glacial Region of the Karakoram Moun-
      taiTis. Report of the GomTnittee, consisting of Colonel GrODWiN-
     AvSTE^ (Chairman), Professor T. Gr. Bonney (Secretary), and
      Colonel H. C. B. Tanner.

The Committee were appointed for the purpose of assisting in the
exploration of the Karakoram Mountains, physically, geologically, and

hiologically, by Mr. W. M. Conway and companions.

     Previous to the expedition of Mr. Conway's party to the Karakoram
Mountains the whole of the Gilgit territory had been surveyed and
mapped by parties of the Survey of India. Colonel Godwin-Austen,
when making his survey of Baltistan in 1860 or 1861, had surveyed up
to the Gilgit and Hunza-Nagyr frontier, while Captain Brownlow, R.E.,
and other assistants of the Kashmir Survey had roughly sketched from
very distant points the Gilgit valley. Subsequently Colonel Tanner and
two sub-surveyors had made a detailed survey of Gilgit and surrounding
valleys. The latter work was published some twelve years back, on the

=scale of 2 miles 1 inch, under the title of 'New Map of Astor and

 Gilgit.' The Bagrot valley and all the southern waterways from the
Rakapushi chain were entered on this map, and the spurs of Rakapushi,

extending W. and N.W. down to the Gilgit River, were also laid down

with fair accuracy. Mr. Conway's exploration this side includes country
already well known and surveyed, though his examination of the Bagrot

glacier should be considered new and more detailed work. In the new
map of Asijor and Gilgit the glaciers were coloured green by hand, but
 not drawn hard with pen and ink on the original map, copied by photo-

graphy and photozincoed.
      Colonel Tanner's work was a continuation to the westward of Colonel

 Godwin-Austen's survey, and was picked up (with a small hiatus) from

that officer's most northerly and westerly stations of observation. On

 the publication those features not laid down from actual and accurate
 survey were entered in dots as a guide to any surveyor who might follow

 Colonel Tanner's party.

      The exploring pai-ty in the Karakoram Mountains in 1892 consisted

of Mr. W. M. Conway, Lieutenant the Hon. C. G. Bruce, Mr. A. D.

 M'Cormick, Mattias Znrbriggen (an Alpine guide), and four Gurkha
 sepoys. For part of the time they were accompanied by Messrs. Roude-
bush and Eckenstein, also by Colonel Lloyd Dicken.

      The party reached Gilgit, on a tributary of the Indus, and made
 their first exploring expedition up the Bagrot valley, since the highest
 ranges were as yet (May) inaccessible owing to the amount of snow still
unmelted. Working on a larger scale, the features of the higher ground,
particularly the glacier, were much improved in detail, and the names of

all the tributary glaciers recorded. An attempt to cross from it into
          ON THE GLACIAL REGION OF THE KARAKORAM MOUNTAINS. 565

 Nagyr over tte main ridge was defeated, so the party returned to Gilgit.

 Some interesting observations were made on the mud avalanches in this

 region. These are vast masses of mud, thickly mingled with huge
 blocks of rock, which are swept down the gorges in the steep mountain
 flanks on to the more level parts of the valley, and become important

 fiictors in modifying this part of the earth.
      Departing again from Gilgit, the travellers visited the rock-bound

 valley of Hunza-Nagyr. The weather was unpropitious, but another
attempt (not completely successful) was made to reach the Bagrot pass
from this northern side, and an expedition was undertaken to the Barpu
glacier. One branch of this was explored and mapped, and a peak
 which rises at its head was ascended. The ridge separating this
tributary (Barpu) valley from the main Hispar valley was traversed by
a pass about 16,000 feet above sea-level. From the latter valley the
most important glacier expedition was undertaken, for the Hispar pass
 (17,600 feet) was crossed to Askoli, which was reached on July 26,
nearly a fortnight having been spent on or by the side of the two great
glaciers, which stream from the summit (gained on July 18). Their
combined length is about sixty-seven miles, and they both terminate at
some 10,000 feet above the sea-level.

     Askoli was left on July 31 for an expedition to the great Baltoro
glacier, and a good view was obtained of Kj (or Mount Godwin- Austen)
{28,278 feet), which rises grandly from the upper part of this ice-region.
Pioneer Peak (22,600 feet), a minor summit of the Golden Throne at
the head of the Baltoro glacier, was climbed, as well as a lower (Crystal)

peak.

     The party returned to Askoli on September 5, and crossed southwards
from that place by the Skoro pass (about 17,000 feet) to Askoro, in the
Shigar valley, whence they reached Skardo on the Indus. From it they
visited Leh, and regained Abbotabad (whence they had begun their

journey to Gilgit) after an absence of seven months.

     Mr. Conway has added some 600 square miles of quite new topo-
graphy east of Hunza-Nagyr and north of the Rakapushi range up to
near the longitude of the Nushik La. Hence his route-map up the
Hispar glacier, down the Biafo, and on again to the Baltoro is based
on and kept in proper position by the topographical work of the Indian

Survey on the 4-miles-to-the-inch scale, executed in 1860-61 (previously

alluded to), very much enlarged, showing consequently a great deal of

close detail either sketched in on the spot or taken from photographs.
The portion near the Hispar pass, never before crossed by any European

travellers, has thus been very accurately laid down. He has also cor-

rected the topography of the tributary glaciers at the head of the Baltoro,

which Lieut.-Colonel Godwin-Austen when making his survey of it was

only able to plane-table roughly from a distance of fifteen to twenty

miles.

     This detail work of Mr. Conway covers about 1,200 square miles, and

is an instructive piece of Alpine topography, because the scale is large
enough to show the extent and proportions of the ice and snow-covered
surface, and the size and position of the lateral and median moraines, &c.

    Many photographs were taken, and a number of sketches were painted

from the baggage on the journey down from the mountains. Some

account of the details of the journey has been given by Mr. Conway to

the Royal Geographical Society, and has appeared in their journal for

November 1892 and for February and July 1893, and a fuller narrative

will be published in a volume in the course of a few months.

--The Teaching of Science in Elementary Schools. Report of the

     Committee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Gladstone (Chairman),
     Professor H. E. Armstrong {Secretary), Mr. S. Bourne, Dr.
     Crosskey, Mr. G. Gladstone, Mr. J. Heywood, Sir John
     Lubbock, Sir Philip Magnus, Professor N. Story Maskelyne,
     Sir H. E. Koscoe, Sir E. Temple, and Professor S. P.
     Thompson.

Your Committee have the satisfaction of reporting this year two important
circumstances which show the increased value set upon the teaching of
science in elementary schools. The one has reference to the rapid

advance in the adoption of ' Elementary Science ' as a class subject ; the

other is the great provision made for it in the new Code for evening

continuation schools.

     The report of last year showed the commencement of the movement

for the substitution of scientific teaching in the place of the so-called

' English ' as a class subject, a movement which has now become much
more pronounced. It will be seen by the following tables that, while the

teaching of ' English ' steadily rose with the gradual increase in the

number of schools, that of geography and elementary science slightly
decreased during the years 1882 to 1890 ; and that when the obligation
to take ' English ' had been removed these two scientific subjects took a
start at once, which has been more than maintained in 1891-92.

     The number of departments of schools in which these class subjects
have been examined by H.M. Inspector during the eight years 1882 to
1890 has been as follows :

     The returns of the Education Department given above refer to the
whole of England and Wales, and are for the school-years ending with
August 31. The statistics of the London School Board are brought
up to the year ending with Lady Day, 1893. They show still more
strikingly the advance that has been made in the teaching of elementary
science as a class subject, and they give the number of children as well
as the number of departments.

Years        Departments  Children

1890-91 11 2,293
1891-92 113 20,674
1892-93 156 40,208

     The only alterations in the Code of this year which directly affect the
instruction of the children in elementary schools, and which come within
the scope of this Committee's inquiries, are the addition of dairy work
and housewifery as recognised subjects of instruction for girls. These

are capable of being so taught as to be scientific in character, the first

named being necessarily experimental, and no grant being receivable
unless special and appropriate provision has been made for its practical
teaching. No grant is given as yet for housewifery.

     With respect to the Queen's Scholarship Examination, which is now
the final examination of pupil teachers, it is provided that marks will be
given for a pass in certain specified science subjects at the May examina-

tion of the Science and Art Department, instead of for a first class as
heretofore. Hygiene and physics are added to the list of subjects for

which marks may be given, thus allowing a greater range of choice,

though only one science subject will count for this purpose. There is,
however, a footnote added to the effect that ' after the present year marks
will not be given at any examination for a pass at any examination held
more than a year previously.' Now, as the Science and Art Department's
Examinations are held in the month of May, and those for the Queen's
 Scholarship at the end of June or beginning of July, it is evident that, in
order to gain the marks offered, the pupil teachers must take the two
examinations in the same year, and that within two months of each other.
This will be injurious to both, and cause an unnecessary pressure upon

the candidates, who have hitherto been able to take their qualifying

certificates under the Science and Art Department in the earlier years of
their pupil-teachership. Your Committee have pointed out in previous
reports that there is no obligation upon pupil teachers to learn any

science during apprenticeship, although they may actually be required to

teach object-lessons or elementary science in school. These marks are
           ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 569

the only incentive offered by the Government, and the new regulation
·will tend to diminish tbe study of science at all. Your Committee also
lay much stress upon the continuous training of the mind by scientific
study during the whole period of apprenticeship, instead of cramming up
simply for a pass at the close. Marks will also be given now ' to candi-
dates who shall present University Extension certificates awarded by the

University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the Victoria Univer-
sity, and the Universities Joint Board of the London Society for the
Extension of University Teaching, provided that the certificates shall have
been awarded (after examination) during the year preceding the Queen's
Scholarship Examination on a course of study including not less than
twenty-four lectures and classes (of which the candidates must have
attended not less than twenty) in one of the following subjects,' amongst
which are specified ' geology, astronomy, meteorology.' It appears, how-
ever, to be a hardship that some subjects in which Extension lecture
certificates can be gained should be excluded, e.g., that a pupil teacher

attending lectures and doing practical work in chemistry cannot make

use of the certificate so obtained in passing the Queen's Scholarship
examination.

     In the preceding report of your Committee it was pointed out that
evening schools had made great progress, in consequence of greater

--liberty having been given in the choice of subjects a matter which your

Committee had strongly advocated in former years. This development
has since assumed still larger proportions, as will be seen by the following
table. It should be borne in mind, however, that the Government returns

do not show how many of these passes are made in scientific subjects.

   A choice is given from about forty different subjects of instruction,

some of these being for women only. About one half of these are either
directly or indirectly of a scientific nature, and each scholar may take not

less than two or more than five of these subjects. They include

together with domestic economy, cookery, laundry work, dairy work,
housewifery, and manual or technical instruction. There is the restric-

tion that no scholar may take more than two of the science subjects for a
grant. This the Committee take to mean the subjects specified in cate-

gory (e), so that two of those might be taken 2^1^$ the three mathematical

subjects (d) or three of the miscellaneons subjects, domestic economy,

cookery, &c. As most of these latter may, and indeed ought to, be
taught upon scientific principles, the limitation may not in effect be of

any serious consequence ; while the last of all, ' Technical Instruction,'

may be made to include the practical application of the several physical

sciences included in category (e).

     The various schemes suggested in the Appendix are much too detailed
to admit of being introduced into this report, but it may be mentioned

that while those for most of the subjects of instruction follow pretty
closely on the lines of those in the day schools Code, though not appor-
tioned to particular stages or as work for separate years, there are detailed
schemes given for some of the subjects which are far in advance of any-
thing that has hitherto been supplied by the Education Department. Of

these the courses of instruction prescribed for elementary physiography,

elementary physics and chemistry, agriculture, and domestic economy
are given in great detail. To that for elementary physics and chemistry,
which is described as an elementary course in practical science, a memo-

--randum is appended to the following effect : ' The second title is given

to this scheme to indicate that it is not a mere outline of a set of lectures,
but is rather a systematic course of practical instruction for the scholars
themselves. The complete set of experiments should be carried out by

the class {i.e., the scholars) as a whole. The whole course may reasonably

extend over two or even three years.'
     Your Committee are glad to recognise in this the adoption of the

principles which were laid down in their report read at the Cardiff meet-

ing in 1891, and hope that the improved methods of instruction suggested

in the continuation school Code maybe largely adopted in the elementarv

day schools.

      ON THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 571

Reference was made in the report of this Committee in 1891 to the

appointment of additional science demonstrators by the School Board for

London, and to the fact that these demonstrators were endeavouring to

initiate practical work by the scholars in a number of schools under their

charge. Two years' experience has shown, not only, as was to be expected,

that the children take the greatest interest in such lessons, in which they

are led to gain information through their own observations and experi-

ments, and to draw conclusions therefrom, but that it is possible, even

under the present admittedly unfavourable conditions, to accomplish

much valuable work of this chai-acter ; and, in fact, the scheme which

has been introduced into the Evening Continuation School Code is largely

based on the experience thus gained in the London School Board.

Moreover, experience has shown that the ordinary teachers are capable

of carrying such a scheme as that put forward in the Evening Code into

execution, after receiving the necessary special instruction, provided that

they  are  thoroughly  supervised  and  aided  by  constant  inspection                                                 and
                                                                                                                     ;

such a method of instruction and supervision of the teachers has been

recognised in the Code of 1893 (Section I. 5*, p. 2). It is to be hoped

that County Councils may be led to give help in these matters, as their

work would be much forwarded by such instruction in scientific method

being given to those whom subsequently they specially wish to reach.

rinally, your Committee urge that no time should be lost in extending

instruction in measurement, &c., such as is indicated in the Evening Code,

to girls' schools, as the habits which can be acquired through such in-

struction are precisely those which are of importance in carrying on

household work.

    W. Cunningham (Chairman), Professor E. C. K. Gonner
     {Secretary), Professor F. Y. Edgeworth, Professor H. S. Fox-
    well, Dr. J. N. Keynes, and Mr. H. Higgs.

Your Committee have succeeded in obtaining a quantity of interesting
information from French, German, Italian, Austrian, Spanish, Belgian,
Dutch, Russian, and Scandinavian universities, as well as from the
United States and Canada, but much of it has been so delayed that it has

not been possible to draft a complete report for the present meeting.
     While deferring, therefore, the presentation of its detailed report

until next year, your Committee wish to express their conviction of
the unsatisfactory conditions attending economic instruction in this

country.

     As compared with the better equipped among the foreign countries

with which comparison would naturally be challenged, the inferior

organisation of teaching in the United Kingdom is very striking. For
this there seem to be two main causes :

     (1) The omission of many teachers to adequately recognise methods

of empirical study.

Economics from the curricula and examinations preliminary to those

suitable. The importance of applied Economics has not been sufficiently
recognised either in university or in Government examinations.

     Before presenting a fuller account of the inquiries undertaken on their
behalf, and of the methods whereby in their opinion desirable changes
might be effected, your Committee desire further time for consideration.
For this purpose they ask for reappointment.

Owing to various circumstances the Committee are not in a position to
report at this meeting. The subject is one of some importance, and
some new methods of testing the dryness of steam have lately been pro-

--The Development of Graphic Methods in Mechanical Science.

        Third Report by Professor H. S. Hele Shaw, M.lnst.G.E.

                               Graphical Solution of Problems.

The first and preliminary report on thia subject was presented in 1889.
The second report was presented last year, and was divided into four

parts.

          1. General geometrical considerations.

        2. The representation of results graphically.

          3. Graphical solution of problems.

      A4. tabulated list of reference to graphic methods to be found in

                  the scientific literature of this country.

     Only a brief treatment of the third division was possible. This in-
cluded quotations from various authors concerning the development of
the subject and a summary of graphical problems, though a more com-
plete account was given of two of these branches, viz., slide rules and

naechanical integrators.

     The present Committee was appointed to prepare a third report on

the subject, dealing as completely as possible with the unfinished portion

of the report, viz., ' The Solution of Problems.'
     The study of the second report, particularly of the classified list of

references, conclusively shows that graphical solutions have in this
country at any rate proceeded almost entirely on two lines.

           1. Interpolation of plotted results.

         2. Use of reciprocal diagrams in structures.

      The former, although arriving at results which would be difficult, if
 not impossible, to obtain in any other way, is itself a remarkably simple
operation, the chief part of the work really consisting in the preparation
 of the diagrams in which the interpolation is made. This matter was
treated very fully in the second report, both for plotted curves and
 instrumental methods for obtaining them.

      The latter, viz., use of reciprocal diagrams, is largely employed,
 chiefly because of its simplicity. It forms, however, only one branch of
 what is now known as ' Graphical Statics,' which in turn only includes
 one class, although the most important class of graphical problems.
 Moreover, the cases treated by its means are nearly always the simplest,
 and do not involve the use of more complete solutions which have been
 given by various writers for cases of more difficult problems in struc-
 tures. There has been, however, a large amount of research in connection
 with the subject, of which little practical use is at present made, and
 while, on the one hand, many writers strongly advocate the application

 in practice of graphical statics (vide ' Quotations,' pp. 420-426, second

 report), on the other hand there is a large amount of scepticism as to

 the use which may be derived from the study of the subject.
     What is apparently needed is a definite statement of the general

 nature of graphical operations followed by a concise account of the

solutions of the various engineering problems at present scattered over
various books and papers in English and foreign literature. This should
convey a clear idea of the problems which can be dealt with, so that

their practical use can be estimated. The bare statement of the problems

would, however, be scarcely sufficient for this purpose, since not only

must the problems be such as are required, but the solution must not be
too difficult, or the ideas too abstruse for practical engineers. Some

application to practical results would, therefore, be advisable, leaving,
however, as a general rule, the proofs and explanation to be derived from,

the works which are quoted. This important work cannot be attempted
so as to do justice to it in the present report, which merely gives a

classified outline of the problems.

     It is not to be expected that the graphical methods will come into
general use unless special training and education on the subject can be
obtained at technical colleges and schools. As a good deal has been said
and written on this subject (vide second report), this report has been
supplemented with an account of the teaching of graphical methods in
engineering schools at home and abroad as explained on p. 608.

     The following is an outline of the scheme of the present report :

     --Division I. Graphical Operations in General.
     --Division II. Summaiy of Problems which have graphical solu-

               -- tions.

          Division III. The Teaching of Graphical Methods.

                   Division I. Gkaphical Operations in General.

     As already noted, graphical operations are distinguished from mere
geometrical operations by the fact that definite portions of lines repre-
sent quantities, and only such geometrical operations are of interest as

enable definite numerical results to be obtained.

     It is true that a very common graphical operation is that of finding

the direction of the line in which the resultant of various given forces act

but direction itself, though it may not always be numerically expressed,

is capable of being so expressed if required. Indeed, it is this particular

power of being able to deal directly with the directions in which forces
act, or motion takes place, and with positions in space, instead of first
translating these measurable quantities into mathematical symbols and
calculating the results by means of trigonometry or algebra, and finally
effecting their reconversion into some geometrical mode of representation,
that constitutes the great value of graphical methods. It is this that
has led to the discovery of the solution of such a large number of
engineering problems and its growing popularity amongst scientific men.

   We may treat graphically many problems in which direction or

position is not either of them the factors which actually occur, but in
which they simply become a part of the process of performing mathe-
matical operations ; thus treatises on graphic statics frequently com-
mence by stating the means by which multiplication, extraction of roots,
solution of equations, &c., may be graphically performed. It is tolerably

clear that the reason why the operation of these numerical calculations by

graphic methods has never been put to any practical use is because such
work is most easily performed arithmetically.

     The problems which arise in engineering are, however, to a large
                                           ;

extent connected with the action of force and the motion of bodies in
space, in which cases direction and position are direct factors in the

problem. In the great majority of cases the action of such forces may be

practically taken as in space of two dimensions, and therefore capable of

direct representation upon a plane surface ; but it is satisfactory to know

that the resources of graphic methods are equally capable of dealing with
cases in which three dimensions of space must be considered, and that,

by the aid of descriptive geometry, drawings on a plane surface may be
made to completely represent the conditions of such problems. Indeed,

the fundamental property which underlies the whole of graphical opera-
tions employed for the solution of problems, viz., ' reciprocity,' has very
similar interpretation, at any rate in mechanics, both in two dimensions of
space and in three. In any case, however, it is a plane surface which is
operated upon, and the question as to what can be done with a plane
surface as regards quantities represented or dealt with upon it must be

considered.

    Upon a plane surface we can represent the position of a point, and,
supposing the point to move, we can further represent its path by a line

or assemblage of points, any given portion of which has a definite

numerical length. In every position that the point takes along the line
it has a definite direction, and the direction of the motion of the point,

or, as it is commonly called, the ' direction ' of the line, for that position

of the point can also be stated as a definite numerical quantity. These
properties of direction and length, as already noted (vide second report),
are equivalent to a knowledge of the position of points on a surface. It
is these numerical properties which give the means of graphical operation,
because without such properties being introduced the operation would

be purely geometrical. Sometimes we may require as the solution of a

problem only one of these, as, for instance, length, in a mere problem of

graphical calculation. Sometimes another property may be required, e.g.,

direction, as in the case of the line of pressure in an arch, or the slope
at any point of a bent girder ; but in all cases we employ two at least of

these properties in the graphical solution of a problem.

    It may scarcely be remarked that although we may actually operate
with straight lines we obtain by their intersections assemblages of

points giving curves of various orders, or, what amounts in the Umit to
the same thing, envelops, the straight lines being then tangents to the
curve. The distinction between these two ways of regarding curves,
although important in geometry, does not present itself very prominently

in graphical problems.

    The direction of a line at any point may be always supposed to be
about some centre, real or imaginary, to which it may be referred, no
matter what curve the line may take. In practice, however, the lines
nsed for graphical operations are chiefly limited to the case when the
centre is at infinity, that is, to straight lines. The reasons for this are

obvious, for straight lines of limited length or ' segments ' are readily
measured, and have a constant direction, which is easily expressed. Arcs
of circles in some cases might be employed, for the curvature is constant
but no curve offers the same advantages for the general purposes of
graphical manipulation as a straight line. There is another and deeper
reason for the use of straight lines or rows of points, viz., the fact that

forces act, and bodies tend to move in straight lines, and hence the
        ----

--576 REPORT 1893.

problems in connection -with the most important physical phenomena are
necessarily performed by operations with straight lines.

     Operations with straight lines or segments have been classified nnder

heads and collected into books. One of the earliest writers to do this
was Culmann, and the first chapter of his work, ' Die graphische Statik,'
published in 1866, has the title, * Operations with Lines,' and contains

the following headings :

         1. Addition and subtraction.
         2. Multiplication and division of lines with ratios.
         3. Powers and roots.
         4. Multiplication of lines with lines.

     Other writers ' practically adopt the same classification, and it will be

well, in order to save repetition, to take his statements for consideration.
      This classification practically divides the subject into

          1. Addition.
           2. Multiplication.

    Now there exists between these two processes, as set forth by the

writers in question, a radical distinction which does not exist between
the ordinary arithmetical processes under the same names.

    ATo illustrate the latter let the segment Aj (fig. 1) be taken, and

let us add to it any number of segments. This operation is shown in the

Afigure, the sum or result being A, A2 Ag . . . A,,.

performing of mnltiplication, the graphical analogue of which is as

follows:

   AAt any arbitrary angle to the given segment A, (fig. 3) set off a
A Asegment, B,, of unit length and produce it to B,,, so that B,,=n

units of length. Join Aj B,, and through B,, draw B,, A,, parallel to

    Then

       Fig. 3.

This process, it will be noted, necessitates the employment of the two

dimensions of a plane surface, but only gives results involving one dimen-

sion, as the direction is quite an arbitrary matter.

Culmann and other writers, however, do not limit the idea of addition

to parallel segments, but extend it as follows

ALet it be required to add the segments               Ai, Ai Aj, . . . fig. 4,

Anow no longer parallel. The process of doing this is shown, and Ag is

said to be the graphical sum or result of the operation. This idea is

extended to three dimensions of space ; thus Culmann says : ' The lines

may have any direction whatever in space, and the figure can then he

looked upon as a projection upon the paper. If such a combination of

lines should really be made, two such projections would be necessary to

determine the position and length of the resultant, and the lines would

have to be projected according to the rules of descriptive geometry.'

    Now the foregoing operation on a plane surface really involves the

addition of two independent variables, viz., length and direction, being

equivalent to taking the actual position in space of two dimensions of

each successive point, instead of in space of one dimension, as in the first

case. The result, which gives the final position of a point in the plane,

also involves two measurements, which may be expressed as the length of

a segment, and its direction relatively to a line. If three dimensions of

space be used, then the operation involves three independent variables,

and the results may be also expressed as such in terms of either three

distances from three fixed points, or as one distance and two directions

with fixed planes.

    We look in vain for any analogous operation given in books under

the heading of graphical multiplication. The above process, although

extended so as to meet the various requirements for which it is employed,

suggest a corresponding process by which a segment A A, having length

and direction may have both these magnitudes multiplied ten times, and

The nature of the operation evidently gives only the total length and total
angle made by the segments. The length and direction of the ' I'esultant
segment, AA,o, have no meaning.

    This case makes it clear that the true sum in the case of addition, and
the product in the case of multiplication, must be taken for length along
or parallel to the line itself, whilst the resultant angle must be con-

sidered to be that turned through by a line passing through A, which
occupies positions successively parallel to the various segments. Now,

in the so-called graphical addition we get neither one nor the other of
these quantities, but a certain measure of each. Concerning this Culmann
says : ' As resultant or sum of this addition we must naturally consider
the final point of one such line. Hence in the case when all the lines

have the same direction, the distance of the final point will be equal to

the sum or difference of all the lines,' but the sentence goes on to say :
' Just as it is impossible to take from the sum of several magnitudes the
value of a separate magnitude, we cannot here obtain from the position

of the final point alone those of the separate segments,' which looks
strongly as if the writer felt there was some radical difi'erence, which,
however, he does not define. The difference between the two things is,
however, really the key to the whole subject, the process of graphical
addition being really of two separate kinds which are mixed up together,
one involving only one kind of thing, and corresponds to simple arithmetic,
and the other involving the use of two dimensions of space and two kinds
of quantities, and leading to the most important graphical results. It

seems not advisable to consider the latter as a simjile matter of graphical
addition. In this report, therefore, the words 'graphical addition'
will be limited to what appears to be really its legitimate use, and the
expression ' graphical combination ' will be employed to express the idea

of combining non-parallel segments, the word ' sum ' being employed to
signify the result in the former case, and the ' resultant,' as usually em-

ployed, retained solely for the latter. In the case of multiplication,
where two dimensions of space are already used to perform the multipli-
cation, only the simple arithmetical idea is involved.

    A recognition of this difference leads to a clear view of the actual

nature of problems in which the same figures and construction may be

used to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant segment, and
also at the same time to perform the multiplication of the given segments

by quantities which may depend upon their relative positions. It is

therefore necessary, before proceeding further, to consider the question

of multiplication. In Culmann's work (second edition), page 7, a state-
ment is made under the heading ' Multiplication and Division of Lines

by Ratios.'

    We' distinguish two cases in the multiplication and division.

      ' The multiplication or division of lines by ratios. In this case the
degree is not altered, and the result is a line.

      ' The multiplication of lines by lines, which gives surfaces, and of
surfaces by lines, which gives volumes, &c., and inversely the division of
 volumes by lines, which produces surfaces, and so on. In this case there
is a change in the degree.'

      The first of these, viz., the operation of multiplying by a ratio of the
value n, is the same as taking the segment n times in the way already
explained. It is true that Culmann says :

     ' In many cases one considers the case where the ratio is given by a

                                                                                                                           pp2

number, and if one gives for a multiplier the length 1, 2, 3, ... «,

one carries it 1, 2, 3, . . . n times upon a line. This method, although

very simple, does not entirely harmonise with the methods of graphic

statics. Graphical construction can only give lines and not numbers,

and, more, one can only carry out graphical construction by means of

lines. To carry n times the same length upon a line is equivalent to

translating the given number into a line, exactly as the measuring off

and plotting of the last line correspond to the translating of the closing

Weline into the result.  will therefore always suppose that the ratio of

mthe factor is expressed by means of two lines, and n.'

This really means that, as already seen, the actual method of obtaining

graphically the product of a line must be by means of a graphical operation,

which operation has been shown to be by the use of similar triangles, in

which the multiplier figures as a ratio which from our point of view

n·

    With regard to the second division this is studied in two separate
chapters under the respective titles of ' The Transformation of the Reduc-
tion of Areas ' and ' The Transformation of Volumes.' The first edition
of the above work had as a heading of one division, ' Multiplication of
Lines by Lines,' the contents of which practically amounted to the re-

duction of areas to lineal representation, although another chapter relates

to the surfaces and volumes. Now the statement that the multiplication

of lines by lines gives surfaces cannot be admitted without some qualifi-

cation. It may perhaps be convenient to use such an expression, but
geometrically this is not really true, and may prove very misleading in
graphic statics. From any point of view multiplication simply consists

in a process of addition, and no addition of lines can possibly give an area.

What the idea arises from is of course evident, for an area may be
regarded as the mean length of a figure multiplied by the mean breadth,
simply because unit of area is a surface which may be regarded as of

unit dimension in each of the above directions, and therefore any other
area contains the number of units of area represented by the product of

mean length and breadth. Lines may represent these two quantities,
and in this sense alone may be regarded as being multiplied together.

      Thus an indicator diagram, in which length and breadth respectively

represent volume and pressure, may be said to show the product as

foot-pounds of woi'k, but this is only because a unit of area on the diagram
represents to scale a unit of work, or 1 foot-pound. The total area is given

by the product of the two quantities representing mean pressure and
mean volume.

     The foregoing considerations may thus be summed up as indicating
the manner in which the remainder of this section will be treated.

      (1) Segments are the means by which graphical operations are chiefly

 performed, the result being either the final length or direction of a

 segment. Therefore quantities must be reduced to segments before they
 can be dealt with. Hence area and volume must be represented by
 straight lines, and the means of doing this will be considered first.

       (2) Addition is confined to segments in one direction, i.e., to continuous
 straight lines, or parallel segments.

       (3) Multiplication is the operation of adding graphically a given

 number of equal segments, but requires the use of two dimensions of
 space to be practically useful in the solution of problems. Thus multipli-

cation is limited to finding length, althoagli it might be applied to
multiplying an angle if practically useful, both operations, however, not
being performed simultaneously.

Representation of Areas and Volumes by Means of Segments.

    It may be assumed that any concrete quantity to be dealt with by a
graphic operation is given in terms of a numerical quantity, and may be

at once represented to some scale by a ' segment,' ' understanding by this

word, unless qualified (as, for instance, segment of a circle), some definite
distance between two points ; that is, the length of a straight line.

   A geometrical quantity, however, in the form of a curved line, or of

an area or volume, has frequently to be dealt with, and this must first be
represented by a segment. There are means of calculating such areas or
volumes, and in the second report a section was devoted to the mechanical
means of doing this. It is, however, necessary to have methods of doing
this graphically, and such methods are generally treated, not only in

books on graphic statics, but in treatises on descriptive geometry.

     Areas may be divided into polygons and figures bounded by curves.
The former may be always reduced to a single triangle by the well-known
method of drawing successive parallels. The area of any triangle may in

its turn be represented by a segment equal to the altitude of another
triangle, of the same area as the former, but with a base equal to twice
the unit of length. The polygon need not, however, be reduced to a
triangle, and there are various methods which avoid doing this, although

the principle of the operation is the same in all cases.

      If the boundary be curved the figure can be split into a polygon

bounded by the curved figures, which may be supposed to be segments
of parabolas. Now, the segment of a parabola is § the area of a triangle,

upon the same base and of the same altitude, and therefore by making
triangles upon each parabolic sector, having their altitudes respectively f
that of the parabola's segment, and adding them all to the original

polygon, the operation of reducing the area of the figure becomes merely

that of reducing the new formed polygon.

    A special case is that in which the bounding curve is an arc of a

circle, the area of which is occasionally required ; as, for instance, in the

case of an arch, the extrados and intrados of which may have different

centres. In this case the first step involves finding a segment equal in
length to an arc, or, as it is called, the ' rectification ' of the arc, which

is also occasionally required in other graphical problems. Rankine
suggests two methods, in one of which a tangent is drawn at one ex-
tremity to meet a radial line through a point on the arc a quarter of its

length from that extremity. The sum of the distances from the two

extremities to the above point differs from the length of the arc by a
distance (r being the radius).

This construction requires the centre of curvature of an arc.

     The other method does not require the centre of the curvature, but

     ' Some American writers use the term ' sect,' and this term, though open to ob-
jection, is perhaps even less so than ' segment,' which has generally been used for a

consists in producing the chord of the arc to a point, half its own length
distant, and with this point as centre, and with a radius equal to J of
the chord, drawing an arc to meet the tangent at that extremity of the arc
which is nearer the centre. The length of the tangent so intercepted
differs from the actual length of the arc by a distance.

     Culmanu states that ' the only practical method of setting off an arc
along a tangent is to plot a chord the same number of times both along
the arc and along the tangent, and to add the final remainder ' (this

question as to how great an arc must be chosen in order that the error
should not be greater than d when an arc a is measured by the plotting

Hence it follows in practice that wj-otli of an inch (say ^]^ in.) will be
suflBciently accurate, and if this value be substituted for d we get

where I is in inches; then if the ar-c to be measured is 4 in. long, a

must be taken -in. ; but if it be 25 in. long, then must

                                                                     r.

     Culmann recommends that a should never be chosen smaller than
is required by these formulas ; for by plotting off the chord too many times
the accuracy due to the smaller difference between the arc and chord

is again lost.

    He remarks that this method is much more exact than attempting to
divide the arc into a certain number of equal parts. He also mentions

the method published by Herr Hanacek in the ' Zeitschrift des Oester-
reichischen Ingenieur und Architecten Vereins,' 1871, which is really the
construction of a length from the following formula :

   =when chord of ^ arc \/l^+f^, and o7 is the segment of the base of a

   right-angled triangle whose height is / (i.e., the height of the arc), the

   other segment being Bl, where 21 is the chord of the arc.
        Culmann remarks about the method : ' It is more practical and more

   correct to take the length a, by means of which we measure an arc so

   small that it should not require any correction, which is better than to
   measure half the length of the arc, having to correct this measure before-

   hand.' He also shows that the above formula when expanded gives

          '=2i(l+|''-^<H-i<'-                                                                                                                                        ·).

   and by means of an example proves that for a semicircle the error is

   inadmissible.

        Cremona, however, remarks about Culmann's method (' Graphical
   Calculus,' English translation, page 114) : ' The method given by Cul-

   Amann for developing the circular arc B along the tangent at one of its

   points is much too long. The length of the circular arc may be found
   graphically in a much simpler fashion by having recourse to auxiliary

   curves, which drawn once for all can be employed in every example,' and
   proceeds to give the methods suggested by Professor A. Sayno, of Milan,

for two of which the spiral of Archimedes is employed, and in the third
the hyperbohc spiral.

     Lastly, there is a method of rectifying the semicircle given by
Kochanski, about 1685 (see Cremona), in which an angle at 30° laid
off at the extremity of a vertical diameter meets the tangent to the latter
from the point of intersection ; along the tangent a distance equal to three
times that of the radius is taken, giving a point whose distance from the

extremity of the vertical diameter is

                                      Z=rN/'4+(3-tan30°)2

                                          =3-14153r.

Using one of the foregoing methods for finding geometrically the length

of an arc, the area of the sector of a circle can now be found by drawing

a tangent to the arc equal to it in length and joining the extremities of
the segment with the centre. The area of the triangle so found is equal

to the area of the sector.

     Cnlmann has compared the difference of area resulting from the as-

sumption of a parabolic arc or of a circular arc as the approximate form

of the bounding curve of an area.

In the reduction of volumes to segments the same principles and con-

structions are employed as in the reductions of areas.

Thus, if

                V=volume=area x I

where h, h, and I are respectively the breadth, height, and length,
by taking two of these equal to a certain unit base, then for the third a
value can be obtained in terms of which volume can be measured, and

the volume represented by a segment. Many special problems occur

in connection with canals and earthwork which admit of graphical

solution by means of the foregoing principles.

                         Addition of Segments.

Concerning addition of segments, in the sense which it is suggested

that this operation should be regarded, only a few remarks need be made.
The chief points to be observed is that if a movement of a point in one

direction along a straight line is considered positive, movement in the

opposite direction is considered negative. Also, that if A, B, C, D, &c.,

are collinear points, that is, points lying on a straight line, then

         AB + BC + CD +      + MN + NA = ;

which is the same as saying  + MN - AN" = 0.

           AB + BC + CD +

     This rule of signs can be extended to curved lines and surfaces, and

English readers will find the subject treated at length in the first chapter
of Cremona's ' Graphical Calculus.'

                         Combination of Segments.

In the preceding paragraphs the direction of the segment has not

been taken into account as a measurable quantity, although the properties

of direction form the basis of certain constructions which have been

mentioned. It has been shown that the process of combination by drawing

equipollent (equal and parallel) segments is simple, and it need scarcely

be said that the order in which the segments are taken is a matter of

indifference, the resultant being the same in every case ; since no matter
in what order a series of movements are made the final change of position

must be the same, though this is generally stated and proved formally as

a soi't of proposition. Cremona further gives and quotes various other

propositions relating to the combination of segments which, though in-

teresting, have little bearing upon the subject matter of the present

report.

One well-known property, however, of general application requires

notice.

   A B DLet B, C, C D, E, , . . fig. 7, be segments, the notation denot-
Aing the direction in which they are measured. At any point O, in B

draw two segments, O^a, Oib, of such length that, in the equipollent

diagram OA'B', A'B' becomes the resultant found by combining 0,a and

Ojt. Proceed in the same way with a point O2 in B C, which is found by

Cproducing O1& to meet BC, the triangle O B' being the equipollent

diagram. It is clear that the order of procedure might have been re-

versed, and any point being first chosen the rays OA', OB', . . . might

have been drawn, and the polygon Oi O2 O3 . . . then found.
     These two diagrams have the well-known relation, that for every

point from which lines radiate in one there exists a corresponding closed

figure in the other.

Thus to Oi corresponds the triangle O A' B'

    If the end lines O^a and 046 be produced to meet at O5, then to O

corresponds the polygon O, O2 O3 O4 O5.

    When the correspondence exists in two figures they are said to be

reciprocal to each other, but the case given is only a special one of a more
general theorem, hereafter considered. The diagram mai-ked I. is alluded

                                                                    Fig.

--diagram ' terms which might with advantage be respectively substituted

for the present ones of ' force ' polygon and ' cord,' ' rope,' or ' funicular '
polygon, since the figures are themselves perfectly general in their appli-

cations.'

     If the segments to be combined do not all lie in one plane, the projections
on two planes must be obtained and combined in each, just as for the
case of given segments in a plane ; but the points from which the first
lines and the derived polygon are drawn must be the projection of the
same points in space. The two resultants so obtained are the projections
of the true resultant of the given segments.^ The method of projection
on planes enables the properties of segments in space to be dealt with

in the same way as with segments in planes. The figures so obtained

are reciprocal, but they are the projection of soUd bodies, the bounding
planes of which intersect in the given segments, and the solids themselves
are also said to be reciprocal.

    In fig. 7 the point O would be the vertex of a pyramid, but cases in

which there are polyhedra of other forms of eveiy possible kind also fall
under the same laws relating to reciprocal figures.

   A large number of theorems have been discovered as a result of

combining segments in this way. Thus, suppose two segments are to be
combined, the magnitudes of which are constant, but which take every
possible direction, the inclination of both making the same angles on
opposite sides of the vertical. The locus of the resultant, having the
fixed point for its centre, is an ellipse, the major and minor axes of

+ --which are respectively a b, and a b, a and b being the respective

segments. If this theorem is extended to three dimensions of space the
locus of the surface described by the extremity of the resultant is an
ellipsoid. Rankine's ellipse and ellipsoid of stress, also the ellipse and
ellipsoid of strain, follow from this proposition. Again, if the two seg-
ments are always in the same direction, and, though not constant in

resultant (the other extremity being at a fixed point) is an hypei'bola.

                                     Multiplication of Segments.

     The simple process by which a segment is multiplied any given
number of times has been already alluded to. This is done in many ways
by using the properties of similar triangles.

     It is often required to multiply a number of segments by one multi-
plier, in which case the following constructions (in which the multiplier
is taken as K) may be used, all depending upon the property of corre-
spondence in two rows of points.

O PD, . . . in one direction ; take any other point at a distance of unity
from this line or the line produced. Draw from P a perpendicular to the
direction of the line meeting it in a, and take on Pa a distance P a'=K.

     OAThe problem of successively multiplying         by K,, Kg, K3, ... is

of course practically the same as the foregoing, but may be performed in

four ways, mentioned by Cremona.^

     It may be required to multiply a segment by a series of quantities

successively. This may be done by various constructions, of which

Cremona, Favaro, and others give several. The process in all cases

simply consists in a repetition of ordinary multiplication, the construction

being modified for the sake of convenience.

finding its square) the operation may be repeated any number of times,

and any power of a quantity found. Methods of performing this opera-
tion graphically are given in various books. Reuleaux ' gives six
methods. In the first, two lines at any angle are drawn, and from their
point of intersection are taken lengths equal to unity and to a on one,,
and equal to a on the other. Joining the extremity of unity on one, and
of a on the other, and drawing through a on the first a parallel to it
gives a point distant from the intersection eqiial to a^, and so on. The
second is a similar construction, except that the lines joining the first two
are drawn perpendicular to each other. The third and fourth are prac-
tically the same. In the fifth a semicircle is drawn with diameter equal
to unity, and a chord is drawn from one extremity of the diameter equal

to a. From the point of intersection with the circle a perpendicular i»

dropped on the diameter, and the segment intercepted between this per-

pendicular and the end of the diameter originally used is equal to a?. By

repeating this process with a?- instead of a, a^ is obtained ; the segment of
the chord cut off by the perpendicular from the chord of length a} is equal
to a^. The sixth method consists in drawing two lines at right angles,
setting off on one the value of unity and also of a, and along the other
only the value of a ; the extremities of a on one and unity on the other
are then joined, and from the extremity of a on the first a parallel is
drawn intersecting the other line. The vector gives or. This process,
continued by drawing a succession of perpendiculars, gives the powers
up to any required value. This construction with any initial angle gives
a spiral, the right angle being a special case, and the general case is
given by Cremona ; Jager has pointed out that not only do the vectors
represent a geometrical progression, but also the corresponding sides of
the spiral intercepted by successive vectors.

     The various methods of finding roots are much the same as the fore-

going, the equiangular spiral being the most useful curve for this
purpose. Favaro (p. 45) treats at some length the properties of this

spiral, and gives its applications. He also gives the following con-

struction for obtaining the cube root of a segment :

    ATake a semicircle upon a segment O (fig. 11) equal to unity. Set
Aup a perpendicular I, and through O draw any straight line, cutting
Athe semicircle in C and the perpendicular I in B. "With as centre

Take OA,, OA2 (fig. 12) along the line A, and along any other line take

                                    BC=K,

the first and last ray on the parallel through O gives the sum of the

The reason for this construction is obvious, since it is merely a device

for obtaining the necessary similar triangles required, in such a position

as to enable the pi-oducts to form one continuous segment. These similar

triangles are shown in A/dotted lines, and it is obvious that since O' L

the general nature of the proposition in which the lines are taken at any
angle is, however, apparent.

     This important construction appears to have been first given by
Culmann. In the first edition of his work it is stated in paragraph 26,
under the title ' Funicular Polygon or Line of Pressure and Force

Polygon,' but in the second edition it is placed in the preliminary chapter
entitled ' Operations upon Lines,* under the heading (paragraph 4)

' Summation Polygon, or Funicular Polygon,' and it forms the basis of
much of graphic statics. It is there given in a very general form, which,
notwithstanding the number of yeai's that have elapsed, has not appeared
in any English work ; and as the style and method of Culmann are, to

say the least, original, the following free translation of that article is

given :

                             Summation or Puniculae Polygon.

    After stating that in statics we often have to multiply, not only
separate lines, but whole rows of lines by different ratios, and to add up
these ratios as well as the products, it is stated that if we execute the
summation of these products in such a way that the resulting triangles
--592 REPOET 1893.

are continually connected to one another, we get the summation polygon,
which, for its statical meaning, may also be called the funicular polygon,

and which forms one of the most important expedients of graphical

statics.

Suppose the products which have to be added together to be of the

form

             n

             ^ h;'

in which expression the a', represent abscissae measured from a given

point in a definite direction, AP,- separate loads acting vertically down-

wards, and Hj any reduction coefficients. At present we must suppose

H^Pthat the
          as well as the are given by straight lines. In fig. 13 a we

APset off on the vertical direction line of the  all the forces, having

regard to their signs, and we get on this line P=2AP.

             Fig. 13.

    On this line, therefore, can also be represented the sum of any number
of successive values, AP. Through the first extremity of ^P, we draw

a line with any chosen ratio of the ordinate and abscissa ; through

a point of this line whose distance from P measured in the direction of a-

is Hi, and through the other extremity of APj, we di-aw a line to the
       ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.                       693

point 2, whose distance from P, also measured in the direction of x, is
Hg. The distance of the extremity of Hi from the upper extremity of
AP, equals Hj^oi > therefore from the lower extremity it equals

                                Hi^oi-AP,.

But as this equals H,fi2 it follows that the ratio of the ordinates and

abscissa in the second case is

                                ---t^t12 ''01  -^^1    ·

                                                  -^^

Through the lower extremity of AP2 draw a third line through the point

2, and produce it to the point 3, whose distance from the line P equals
H3. If we proceed exactly as before we get the ratio of the ordinates in

the third case

                ~w-, _, AP2_. AP, AP,,
                *23-- n-2 TT 'o\-- TT-                          ·

                                ±12            ill        -'^2

    Proceeding in this way we get the polygon of the values of t, in

which the ratio of the ordinates and abscissa are in any given case

                               _ 'yAP,.

                                                                                            1 J^i

We can easily see from this that <oi plays the part of an integration

constant with regard to

                                     ^AP,

                                H-^ '
                                                                                                                 1 -^-^1

If through any point in fig. 13 b we draw parallels to the side of the

polygon 1, 2, 3 . . . of fig. 13 a, then these cut the ratios

                                                   AP

on the vertical whose distance from the chosen point equals 1 , and

these ratios appear on this vertical, which we now may call the line of t,

added up in the same order in which the AP have been arranged. If we

alter the ratio of the ordinates and abscissa of the first side 01, e.g., we

make it ^0/ instead of /qi (as shown by the dotted lines in fig. 13 a), then

the whole of the figure changes, but the points on the line P remain

unaltered owing to their construction, and all other points lying

outside P move on vertical lines. Accordingly both figures have the

Pstraight line and the parallel pencil of the verticals in common. But

it follows from geometry of position, or even indirectly from the con-

struction, that in such systems all corresponding rows of points lying in

the same verticals are congruent ; for the rays intersecting each other,

say in 4, cut off on all verticals the same distances of the rays as those

which intersect each other in 4', because 4 and 4' ai'e equally distant

from P ; and as this is true for any other two rays the above proposition

follows from it. Besides it must be so, for these distances can be expressed

       P
^,by the ratio  and also by the position of the verticals, both of which
       Hi

are independent of ^oi-
     All that has been said about fig. 13 a relates also to fig. 13 b, the point

new ratio, is drawu from a point a;,, (fig. 13 c) with regard to its sign
in such a way that they appear as the difierence of the abscissae a-,,-- .rj;
through all the x-i we draw verticals and join constantly those verticals

Hence

     But as this ratio is also true for any other value of AP^, then the

                           --AP-

required products (a;,, Xi) X r^ are intercepted on the vertical x,, at a

distance x,, from the fixed point, in the same order in which they were

arranged on the line P in fig. 13 a. Hence we may get on this line the

sum of any number of following products :

                                            « APj

                                                                                  k»

Let us imagine the a,';, that is, the relative position of the AP, as con-
stant, whilst the a;,, as varying, then nothing whatever will change in tho
polygon of fig. 13 c, only the vertical «,, will take another position. If
to express this generality we write x instead of a;,,, we can say that any
two rays of a ray pencil representing the funicular polygon (fig. 13 c) cut
on all verticals at a distance x the sums

of the APj lying between these rays.
     In this result nothing is changed when the sides of the polygon in

fig. 13 c are drawn parallel to the dotted sides of figs. 13 a, 13 b, for the
above partial sums are independent of the values of the first ratio. In
general, all that was formerly said about tigs. 13 a and 13 b relate also

to fig. 13 c, all corresponding verticals being congruent. This relation

gives us a means of drawing two polygons through given points. For

instance, let 01, the first side of the polygon, pass through a point x,,yg,

and the last 67 through the point a;,,?/o ; then we commence by drawing a

parallel line to ^ou 3,nd finish the polygon as above described. If, finally,
the side 67 does not pass through the definite point a;,,y,,, there is nothing
to be done except to shift the row of points obtained in the vertical a;,, in

such a way that the point next in order to 6 coincides with the given

point x,,yo. This has happened on the right side of the vertical a*,,, and

now the side of the polygon 01 passes through the point x,,y,,, and the
           ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.                    595

point 01 in the vertical ai,j ; the side 12 passes through the intersection
of 01 with x^, and the point similarly denoted in Xn, and so on. This
construction can be executed still more easily by means of the first
vertical Xg ; for this line does not even change its position, and all sides
of the polygon are intersected by it ; therefore the last side of the polygon
^7 is given by the point x^i/g, and by the point 67 in Xg, viz., the intersec-
tion of the first polygon with x^ ; the second is given by the intersection

of this side with the intersection of the coiTesponding side of the former,

and so on. Owing to the want of space this construction is indi-

cated only from the side 34.
     Expressions are next found for the ordinates i/i. The differences of

two following coordinates are denoted by A^^ j+i and Ay, ;^.j, and possess
two indices, for it is impossible to denote successive coordinates by
continuous indices. At the same time the difference should be positive
when the ordinate of the second index is the larger one.

    We have therefore

and hence

   We can get another expression for ?/,, if we take notice that the first

+chosen side of the polygon with the ordinate a^,, equals yo *n^oi> ^od ^^^

then the segment intercepted by the sides of the funicular polygon

                           = ^{x,-x^-^.

have been obtained, and by taking a new pole Pj at a distance of unity,

and drawing the rays as shown, and then drawing the parallels precisely

in the sa,me way as in the first case, a number of values of the form

KOA"^ . are obtained, each of which is called the ' moment of inertia ' of the

given segment about that point,' so that the length of 0' A4" becomes

               S0A2 . K=I=Moment of Inertia.

It may be required to obtain a series of the form

               S{(OA.K)0'A'},

where the values of OA and O'A' both change, in which case a graphical

solution is also readily obtained.

The construction for continuous products enables the mean value to

OAbe found of  (say OA,.), such that

This is done by producing the two extreme lines in the second derived

figure, which were drawn parallel to those of the first figure, until they

intersect, and through the point of intersection drawing a parallel to the

BCD,line  and the intersection of the line with the line OAj A2 . . .

Nowgiving the required distance. This is shown in fig. 12.  it does not

matter what distance O is taken along the line Aj A2 A3 . . . ; the position

A,, relatively to Ai, A2, A3, ... is always the same.

Now the actual position of the segments in the direction of their own

length has nothing to do with the result, and wherever O is taken, so

long as the perpendicular distance to the segments is unaltered, the

distance A,, of the perpendicular upon the direction of the segments

through O remains the same. Moreover, the sum of the products of the

segments into their distances from A,, (having due regard to their sign)

is zero.

     Suppose that the number of segments is infinitely great, and that

they are infinitely close together, so that their extreme points form the

locus of the boundary of a plane figure ; then the sum of the products about

any point in the line through A,., (fig. 15), parallel to the direction of the
segments, is zero. Next, suppose the same boundary to be formed by the

extreme points of a similar second series of parallel segments, taken in

some other direction. The same will hold with regard to the line through

some point A,., for the second series, and parallel to them. The inter-

Gsection of these two lines gives a point about which the sum of the

products of every series of parallel segments whose extreme points lie on

the boundary of the figure is zero. This point is called by Cremona and

others the ' centroid ' of the area in question, and its determination for

surfaces of various kinds is a matter of great practical importance.

The way in which the matter has been approached, though not perhaps

the simplest from the point of view of application in mechanics, indicates

at once the graphical loethod of determining centroids. Thus any plane

figure may be divided into parallel strips and segments, representing the

areas drawn through the centre of each ; the line containing the centroid
is then found. This operation is repeated with parallels in some other
direction, and the intersection of the two lines containing the centroid

gives the point required.

                                                                   Fig. 15.

    There are numerous propositions relating to figures of difierent known
forms given by Culmann and others, such as for the triangle, trapezium,

sector of a circle, segment of a parabola, &c., but the method of derived
figures enables the centroid of any plane area to be obtained.

     Segments representing volumes and the centroids of solids can

be found by a similar process, just in the same way as the centroid is
found for a series of segments when the first products are taken.

   A point A,, corresponding to the centroid, can be found in the per-

pendicular from any point when the second products are taken ; but it
may be remarked that

     (1) The square of the distances being taken, the sum of the products

about the point can never be zero.
     (2) The point Aj changes for every change in distance of the point O.
     The determination of the distance, which is called the radius of

gyration of this point from O, can be graphically obtained, and the
method is explained in Culmann's work, and by Chalmers and others.

     The segments have hitherto been drawn in the plane of the paper, but
there is no necessity to do this ; indeed, the cases which occur when

segments are multiplied are usually such that one series of segments is
taken as acting at right angles to the plane of the paper, their magnitude

being represented by an area, so that if an area is divided into a number
of equal parts the segments are equal, and equal in number to the

divisions. If the segment does not act at right angles to the plane, then

the intersection with the plane will give the shortest distance of the
segment fi'om it, and therefore the length of the second segment by which

it is to be multiplied.

Suppose the foregoing operation performed for a certain point O,

assuming tliat the segments which have their extremities on the boundary

of the area have a certain direction. Suppose, further, the operation

repeated with the segments in various directions and the respective radii

Oof gyration found. If these be plotted from the point in the directions

perpendicular to their respective direction, and parallels to the directions

of the segments in the corresponding positions are drawn, these parallels

will be found to envelop an ellipse. This ellipse is known as the ' ellipse

of inertia,' and in the case when the point is the centroid of the figure

under consideration the ellipse is called the ' central ' ellipse. The term

' momental                                                              ellipse  is  often  used  for   the  ellipse  of   inertia,  the                                                                                              central

--ellipse being called the ' eqnimomental ' ellipse. The foregoing is stated

as follows by M. Levy : ' If upon different lines issuing from any point

whatever, in a plane, we plot their lengths, inversely proportional to the

radius of gyration relatively to these lines, the locus of the extremity of

their lengths forms an ellipse.'

The proof of this and other properties of the central ellipse by that

writer are, with slight alterations, given in the following paragraphs,

where by using the idea of segments instead of that of forces the treat-
ment is made perfectly general.

Let O X and y he axes of coordinates. Let any line u making any

angle a with the axis of x be that about which the moment of inertia

of a segment P whose point of intersection with the plane p is

required.

    In the foregoing case the moment of inertia has the same sign as the

segments have not the same sense, the moments of inertia relatively to

the principal axis may be of contrary sign ; that is, a^ and b^ may be re-

--placed by a- and -- b^ ; the curve may then be an hyperbola. The curve

Orelatively to the point in a plane is called the curve of inertia relative

to this point, and will be a curve of the second degree, the axis of the

curve being the principal axis of inertia. When the centroids correspond

with the centre of the conic it is called the ' central conic,' and is usually

an ellipse, that is, the central ellipse. Instead of taking the rectangular

     If the axes Oa', and O//, are two conjugate diameters of tbe central
conic, the term x^y^ disappears in the last equation, that is to say

            c,=0.

Thus the characteristic relation of the conjugate diameters is

            2P.-Ci2/,=0.

     In the case of rectangular axes this relation has been shown to

characterise the principal axes.

      It will be noticed that in the foregoing treatment distances are plotted

inversely proportional to the radii of gyration, and along the lines about
which the moments of inertia are taken. M. Levy gives another method

of treating the conic of inertia, corresponding to that which has been

already mentioned. He does this in the following manner. If to
any line Ov parallels KK' and KjK/ be drawn at distances from Ov equal

to the length of the radius of gyration relatively to this straight line, the

Kconic of inertia may be defined as the envelop of the lines K' or K, K/.

Let Ou be the direction of any conjugate diameter to the line v. Let

                                        OA=a'
                                         0B=&'

be the lengths of the conjugate semi-diameters, corresponding to the

directions of Ou and Ov, and let

                                                       6=Z.t(,0v.

that is to say, the radius of gyration relatively to Ov is the length of the

perpendicular A P dropped on this line from the extremity of its conju-

Kgate diameter : hence this tangent coincides with K'.

      Jnst as the property of the ellipse of stress is only a special case

for a plane area of the more general property for solids of the ellipsoid of

stress, so the ellipse of inertia is only the special case for a plane area of

the more general property for solid bodies of the ellipsoid of inertia or
' momental ' ellipsoid, the ' central ' or ' equiraomental ' ellipsoid corre-
sponding for a solid body to the central ellipse for a plane area.

    If we suppose segments of opposite sign, it is possible to obtain an
hyperboloid of inertia and central hyperboloid ; but this, as Routh
remarks,^ does not occur in practice, since the moment of inertia is
essentially positive, being by definition the sum of a number of squares,
and it is clear that every radius vector must be real. Hence the quadric

is always an ellipsoid.

     The properties already referred to for the central ellipse have their
counterpart for the central ellipsoid ; thus at any point of a space through
which segments can be drawn there are always three principal axes at

right angles to one another.

     The above author goes on to deal with what corresponds to the
products of an infinite number of segments, explaining the method given
by Bresse.^

30 that tbe derived radius of gyration is the geometrical mean of the
distances »j and ri^.

    The geometrical property just given may be at once applied to another
very important purpose, viz., to find the mean distance from a line which,
multiplied by the sum of a series of segments whose magnitude is pro-

portional to their distance from the line '"i ques^'on, gives a result f qual

to the sum of the products of each segment into its distance from the

line. This is really the problem of finding the centre of pressure in a
surface over which the intensity of pressure varies nniformly, or the
centre of resistance of a bent beam, the intensity of stress varying
nniformly at the skin.

                                                                   Fig. 16.

     Let the area, fig. 16, be that of the surface in question, the distance of

Aevery point of which from the tangent B being a measure of the seg-

ment , which has to be multiplied into that distance. The sum of the

squares of the distances is the quantity required, and is thus found. Find

the central ellipse of the area, and through the centre draw the diameter

A AO C conjugate to the diameter parallel to B, intersecting B in C and

the ellipse in D. "From C draw the tangents C E and C F. Join E F,
ON=OMintersecang O C in M. Take
                                 in C O produced; then Nis the

A Brequired point. The point in question is the antipole of the line

relatively to the central ellipse of the given centre.

    If now for every position of the tangent A B round the given area,

--antipoles are found, a curve is obtained which is called in German,

liern ; in Fi'ench, noyau ; and in English kern, Icernel, core, and heart.
The first of these seems the best term.

    It has already been shown how the sum of a number of products may

be obtained for any conditions of sign, and in certain special cases it is

necessary to have a graphical statement of the result which one series of

the two quantities multiplied together varies between certain limits.

Bending moment diagrams, deflection curves, and moment of inertia

diagrams are examples of such graphical statements.

          The Sum of the Products of Nok-pakallel Segments.

     Hitherto the products of parallel segments have been dealt with, but

it may also be required to find the sum of a series of products in which

the segments representing different magnitudes of the same kind have

by making the segments parallel. Let AB, BC, CD, . . . (fig. 17) be

    Draw the equipollent diagram by combining the segments as ali-eady
explained. Take any pole P and draw the first derived diagram, and

then the second derived diagi-am, and through the point O draw a parallel
M Nto the resultant A' 0'. Then the part of it
                                                intersected between the

two extreme lines of the second derived diagram gives the required sum

of the products.

OIf the point lies in the resultant which is the line through the point

of the intersection of the two extreme lines parallel to the resultant in the

first derived diagram, the sum of the products is zero.

Division III. The Teaching of Graphical Methods.

The examination into the treatises and systems of dealing with

graphical methods which has been necessary in the preparation of this

report has i-evealed the great divergence in the nature of the teaching

of graphic methods in engineering colleges and schools throughout the

world. The writer therefore felt that some practical results might ensue

if information was collected from various sources as to the nature of the
teaching in different countries, such as the number of hours devoted to

the subject and the kind of teaching given.

Sir E. Grey, Under-Secretary to the Foreign Office, was good enough to

obtain the prospectuses of the colleges in several countries. Mr. J. Smith,

H.M.'s Consul at Munich, most kindly obtained the programmes of the

German schools. Professor Cremona, of Rome, and Professor Dwels-

hauvers-Dery, of Liege, sent also most valuable information. The pro-

spectuses of all the American technical institutes and colleges were

obtaiued through the kindness of Professor Ira 0. Baker, of Illinois

University.

From the materials so obtained an abstract has been made by the

writer of the details of time-tables and other information regarding

graphic statics and graphical methods in the engineering schools of
Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Russia, Belgium, Norway and Sweden,

and Switzerland, and also of most of the American colleges and technical

Aschools.    translation has also been made of the courses of instruction

in graphic statics at Braunschweig, Hanover, Liege, St. Petersburg,

Milan, Brunn, Madrid, and elsewhere. The printing of all this would

have extended the present report beyond the limit which could be allotted

to it, and the MSS., together with the printed matter above mentioned,

and numerous other documents bearing on the subject, which have been

collected in the course of the preparation of the report, are therefore

deposited in the office of the British Association for reference.

As a discussion of a report is not usual at meetings of the British

Association, the writer, taking advantage of an invitation to read a

paper at the recent International Engineering Congress in connection

with the World's Fair at Chicago, brought forward the subject on that

occasion. He was fortunate enough to obtain the opinions of some of

the most eminent professors in engineering, including Professor W.

ARitter, of Zurich.  verbatim report of the discussion, in which not

only a large number of professors of engineering but also some well-
known engineers took part, is deposited, with the matter already men-

tioned, for reference in the office of the British Association. The following

is an abstract of the paper itself:

     It was shown that graphic methods might be classified in two divi-

--sions (1) the plotting of results, and (2) the solution of problems. The

former of these is rarely considered worthy of any special training, as a

knowledge of it is apparently regarded as capable of being acquired
           ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.                                                          609

without any instruction. The solution of problems, on the other hand, has

of recent years received a great deal of attention, under the title of ' Graphic

Statics,' which is the most important, and indeed at present almost the

only, special branch of the application of graphical construction. This

branch is in many engineering schools dignified by a special course of

lectures and classes, with even a special professor for the subject, while

in many other schools the subject is not taught at all ; and, again, the

opinions held by practical men, and apparently also by professors in the

engineering science, would seem to differ in a most remarkable manner as

to the value of graphical methods. It is believed that this difference of

opinion is apparent, and not real ; and the very fact that so much attention

has been devoted to the subject, in w^hich at present there is no uniformity

in the teaching or general agreement as to methods, amply justified the

treatment  of  this  subject  before  a  congress                                           and it  was with  the hope
                                                                                         ;

that some authoritative expression of opinion might be obtained that it

was brought forward.

The two divisions may be dealt with in order, taking first the plotting

of results. This method is now universal, not only in the mechanical

sciences, but in almost any case where statistics of any kind are employed,

as it enables I'esults, which would otherwise be difficult to grasp, to be at

once made clear by a simple inspection. The various methods of plotting

and the vai'ious instruments which have come into use for automatically

recording such results were too familiar to need discussion. [A sketch

of that portion of the report presented last year relating to the plotting

of results was then given.] Now it appears to be the common idea that

the interpolation of results, no less than the actual plotting, is a sort of

intuitive process which is readily acquired and requires no sort of train-

ing ; but on careful investigation the contrary is found to be the case.
This was illustrated by various examples. The series of diagrams relating

to the action of the crank and connecting-rod of an ordinary engine which

were exhibited, and which were drawn for a meeting of an engineering

society, were noticed to be in some respect novel, giving a satisfactory

arrangement, so as to include four sets of diagrams, each of which in-

cludes a linear, central polar, and circumferential polar diagram of the

same results. To many of those present these diagrams were no doubt
perfectly familiar, but it was found that there wei-e many practical

engineers to whom, not only did the different series of diagrams have no

definite meaning, but the difference between the three diagrams and

the various points which are thereby brought out were obviously not

easily grasped ; and, moreover, from year to year, when bringing these

diagrams before students, it has been found that only after considerable

repetition, and after the student has constructed for himself a series of

similar diagrams, is he able to deal with such problems or to grasp their

general meaning.

With regard to the solution of problems the case is entirely different,

for this subject receives a certain amount of attention in every en-

gineering course of instruction. In England such instruction is given,

as a rule, in most colleges incidentally when the subjects of statics,

machines, or hydraulics are being dealt with, although recently in some

cases special training in graphical methods is being Introduced as a part

of the course of engineering instruction, in several cases being given as a

branch of descriptive geometry. Thus in the Science and Art Depart-

ment, both under the heads of descriptive geometry and also machine

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

 drawing, a knowledge of some of the elements of the subject is expected.

 On the continent of Europe, however, for many years, not only have

 special courses of lectures been devoted to the teaching of graphic statics

 as a separate branch of the subject, but there have been a large number
 of schools in which there are special professors of graphical statics. The

 reason for this difference is to be found, not altogether, as it is often

--supposed, in a want of appreciation on the part of English engineers or

 professors of graphical statics for it was in England that the germ of
 such methods was first developed by Rankine, Clerk Maxwell, Fleeming

--Jenkin, and others but because the system of appointing professors in

 the special polytechnics devoted to the allied sciences is there in vogue
 rather than in England, where one or two chairs of engineering are
 added to other chairs of the university or university college.

      Now, it is iustrnctive to note the general method of instruction indi-
 cated in the syllabuses of engineering schools, and which are even more
clearly shown in the various text-books on the subject. From these it is
clear that the general methods consist of giving certain rules, which may
 be called general graphic methods, and which apply to addition, multi-
plication, powers, and extraction of roots, which may be regarded as
forming the introductory portion. This is followed by what may be
regarded as an introduction to statics, in which special stress is laid on
geometrical constructions, and the solution of many problems is given
which would otherwise be worked out by analysis.

    We may regard the well-known work of Culmann, ' Die graphische

Statik,' as the first important treatise of the kind, in which work were
collected problems of a general nature, under the title of ' Graphical
 Calculation,' which occupied the first three chapters, under the respective
titles of ' Operations with Lines,' ' Rectification of Areas,' and the ' Recti-
fication of Solid Bodies,' the whole occupying seventy pages. In the second
editioM of his work two chapters are introduced on logarithms and calcu-
lating rules, this portion occupying in the second edition 150 pages. In
the second edition the preliminary portion of graphic statics, which
occupied 130 pages in the first, here takes up no less than 350 pages, and
is followed by 120 pages on the theory of the elements of elasticity, the
author unfortunately not living to complete the work on the lines which
he had planned out. One thing is particularly noteworthy, viz., the large
space occupied by constructions and propositions, which may be regarded
more or less of a general nature compared with the space devoted to the
solution of actual examples. The same thing occurs in the lucid and
valuable work of Bauschinger, 'Elementc der graphischen Statik,' in
which there are sixty-two pages devoted to what may be regarded as matter
of a general nature, and only thirty to the applications. In the work of
M. Levy, which is the standard work of France, although he has very
much reduced in the second edition the portion of purely geometrical
calculation, he occupies the whole of the first volume of between 500 and
600 pages with the ' Principles and Applications of Pure Graphic Statics.'
The same general facts are derived from a study of the detailed course
as set forth in the various programmes of technical schools, the general
conclusions being that a great deal of the matter taught under the head
of ' graphic statics ' contains general principles of graphic methods of
construction which might be taught apart from any applications at all
and its being so taught would be capable of its application, not only in
cases of statics, but in dyr.amics and hydro-mechanics.

ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.      611

     Take, as an example of this proposition, the ellipse of inertia and the
central ellipse, which are only applied to force, and which are given as if
they only referred to the problem of the beam. These theorems, how-
ever, have an equally important bearing on hydrostatics and rigid
dynamics, the ellipsoid of inertia having the properties, for instance, of
the momental ellipsoid of Cauchy, the central ellipsoid, and those of the
equimomental ellipsoid of Legendre. Indeed, there is every indication of
a gradual tendency towards the development of the science of graphical
calculation, quite apart from that of graphic statics. Thus we find
graphical constructions originally devised and given by writers (notably
Rankine) as they were needed in works of mechanics. Next we have the

first collection of graphical calculation, already referred to, of whicli

there are remarkable examples in the little work of Cremona, ' II Calcolo
grafico,' in the preface of the English edition of which he acknowledges
the work of Culmann. Cremona, however, goes considerably beyond that
author, particularly in adding the important chapter on ' Centroids,' in
which the properties of the centre of gravity are treated from a purely

Ageometrical point of view, without any reference whatever to force.

still more recent work is that of Favaro, who, in his ' Lessons on Graphic
Statics,' devoted his second volume entirely to the subject of graphical

calculations.

    From this it is clear that a course of instruction might be given, under
the head of Graphical Methods, which, might be taught in the same way
as descriptive geometry, and which ought, indeed, to be worked in con-

junction with that subject. This subject should deal with the construc-

tions of such geometrical figures as are important for graphical applica-
tion. It should also deal with the plotting of results and the general

properties of plane curves, as far as the student is able to numerically

Aefiect measurements with it, which he can check by calculation.

student should be expected to do his work with great accuracy, and to
regard the results he obtains as accurate enough to be useful in practical
work, although such examples need not at the time be applied to any

practical engineering problems. Thus, for instance, the propositions of
projective geometry, so far as the null or focal system is concerned, and
the projective properties of bodies, and of the pole and antipolar, might
be taught; but a systematic treatment of the subject of projective

geometry is not necessary for engineers. With regard to projective
geometry, it may be said that, unless it is desired to study the higher
branches of the subject, there is no necessity whatever of a treatment
such as Culmann has given in his chapters on the 'projective relations
between the polygon of forces and the funicular polygon ' and ' the rela-
tion of a system of forces with the focal system, and with curves of the

third degree,' or with the central axis of a system of forces, or colinear
and reciprocal relations of the funicular or force polygon.

    There appears to be no reason, therefore, why an elementary course of

a general nature, specially arranged so as to include all that an ordinary

engineering student requires to know of graphical methods, should not

be introduced as a regular subject in engineering schools, and the follow-

ing arguments, may be brought forward in support of this view :

     (1) Although the time-tables of an engineei-ing department are
already full, yet it will be found that a course such as that suggested

really includes much of what is taught at present in a desultory way, and

such a course would obviate some of the teaching given under the heading

                                                                                                                          K It 2

of * descriptive geometry,' so that during one or two terms of a year

it might be taken during the same hours as already devoted to descrip-

tive geometry, with possibly one lecture a week, for one term, in the

place of the actual lectures in the applied engineering, into which at

present graphic methods are often obliged to be introduced for the

want of proper preliminary training in the subject by a student.
Moreover, the time now devoted in the engineering laboratory for

the plotting of curves might be much better occupied in the drawing

hall itself in connection with the practice of the plotting and interpola-

tion of curves as a part of the subject of graphic methods, the data

obtained from the engineering laboratory affording useful information.

(2) The time spent in such graphical work would be an excellent

discipline in accurate drawing for a student, who is often inclined to re-

gard a sketch roughly representing an idea as sufficient for practical

Apurposes.  student should learn for himself that nothing is so easily

deceived as the eye. It is quite true, as Professor Culmann says in the

preface of his work, that ' the constructing engineer will give preference

to geometrical solutions wherever an accuracy of results up to three

decimals (one-thousandth), which can be perfectly well obtained, is suf-

ficient, for his drawing instruments are always at hand, and drawing is his

habitual expression of thought.' But such accuracy in drawing is by no

means naturally or intuitively acquired, and the student requires training

in a course of graphical methods before he would appreciate their value.

Moreover such practice in actually performing the operations, and be-

coming familiar with the solution, is absolutely necessar}-, if it is to be

expected that a student will really use these problems afterwards in his

practical work, as such modifications become extremely puzzling owing

to the want of a thorough acquaintance with the methods.

(3) It is not only necessary that a student should be familiar with

accurate drawing, but also that he should be familiar with graphical

constructions as a means of solving problems. The plan ordinarily adopted

in the teaching of statics in conjunction with graphical methods them-

selves seems expecting too much for the capacity of an ordinary student,

and the difficulty of getting a class of even intelligent students to correctly

solve problems out of the beaten track may be attributed to the difficulty

involved in combining these two things. In the use of ordinary geometry

or analytical methods there are separate classes for algebra, analytical

geometry, trigonometry, &c., and yet the ideas involved in them are no

more difficult than those included in graphical constructions and methods.

Graphical methods certainly, therefore, have the same claim to be con-

sidered as a separate branch of study.

  --The following proposition, supported by these arguments, was therefoi'e

brought forward : ' That in all engineering schools a separate course

in graphical methods of construction may with advantage be introduced

which shall deal with such problems as have a practical bearing on

mechanical science, and which do not involve applications of any concrete

subjects, such as statics and dynamics, hut which may familiarise the

student, hij means of examples accurately worhed out by himself, iviih methods

which he will he able to afterwards apply J"                                     {

     The course contemplated would be a very short one, not exceeding

ten classes or lectures of one hour each, in the course of which various

facts not generally taught to students in connection with the plotting of

curves which most frequently arise in engineering practice would be

dealt with, and it may be mentioned tbat tlie proposition seemed to meet

with the general approval of the members of the Congress.
    With regard to teaching the principles underlying the modes of

solving problems, these appear to fall under two heads : (1) The process
·which has been called ' Combination of Segments ' may be said for
brevity to consist in obtaining from segments a resultant representing two

properties of the  same  kind  as  the given  segments                                                      for instance, in the
                                                                                                         ;

case of statical problems, the magnitude, and direction of the forces.

(2) The process which corresponds to multiplication, in which two unlike
kinds of quantities are combined so as to form a result differing in kind

from either. These practically include all the processes employed, but

in applying them to different problems special teaching is necessary.

The writer is disposed to think, on subsequent consideration and from

further discussion of the subject, that it may be advantageous to employ

familiar examples in kinematics, statics, and dynamics in the actual working

out of such problems, these being so selected that the students will be able

to understand without difiBculty the mechanical principles involved. The

more difficult problems would be reserved until the student is engaged in
studying the higher branches of applied mechanics, when he will by

reason of the above teaching be familiar with the graphical principles

employed. This system of employing familiar examples undoubtedly has

the advantage of interesting students in the subject, and is a point of

great importance in making clear the value of the methods. The pro-

posed course would only slightly modify the details of what is at present

actually taught in many engineering schools. It would, however, bring

clearly before the student the methods themselves as distinguished from

their applications.

    He would also remark that some eminent authorities on technical

education have very little belief in the separate study of graphical

methods apart from geometry and machine drawing. But for those who
are engaged in the actual work of engineering, especially those who have

very little knowledge of mathematics but are to a certain extent ac-
quainted with practical geometry, the writer is convinced, both from
experience in teaching evening classes of artisans and also with day
college students, that a clear treatment of the methods employed in

graphical constructions, as applied to simple rules of arithmetic, is of the

highest value.

     In bringing the report to a close he would farther remark that the

teaching in many English schools of engineering seems to introduce as
much of the practical applications of graphical methods as in any other
country, and that much of the apparently different treatment of the subject

in Eaolish as compared with foreign schools is due to a difference of

arrangement of courses and of terminology.

--On the Physical Deviations fro')n the Normal among Children in
    Elementary and other Schools. Report of the Committee, con-
    sisting of Sir Douglas G-altoiv (Chairman), Dr. F. Warner
    (Secretary), Mr. G. W. Bloxam, Mr. E. W. Brabrook, and
     Dr. J. Cr. GrARSox. (Draivn up by Dr. Francis Warner.)

A COMMITTEE having been appointed by the International Congress of

Hygiene and Demography (1891) to conduct an investigation as to the
physical and mental condition of school children, and having commenced
their work on lines approved by ample experience, yoar Committee decided
to work with that committee, and the report here given has been pre-
pared, by permission, from the facts accumulated by it. Thirty thousand
children have been seen in forty-one schools, and notes were taken in

5,072 cases. It has not been possible to prepare a complete report, but

an analysis has been made as to 16,094 children seen in eighteen schools.
The method of pi'ocedure is as follows : All the children are seen in the

--three departments of the school infa.nts, boys, and girls. The pupils

are observed as they stand in rank, usually a standard or smaller section

at a time. The inspector, standing in front of each child in turn, holds
a shilling for him to look at, so as to fix his eyes, and thus obtains a full

face as well as a profile view of each side, noting the features separately
and the cranium, the expression and muscular action of the parts of the

face, the eye-movements, and other points. The trained observer can
read off the points in the physiognomy of the individual features and their
parts, noting the pi'oportions and form of each.

     Having inspected each child in the line as described, the children are
asked to hold out their hands in front of them, and for a moment the
action is done before them. The balance of head, spine, shoulders, as
well as of the arms, hands, and fingers, are noted in each case. Finally the
observer places his hand on the head, noting size, form, bosses, &c., and
the palate is inspected in each case.

     At each of these stages in the inquiry children presenting deviations
from the normal in any particular are asked to stand aside. The teachers
are then asked to present any exceptional or dull children not picked out
by the observer.

     Each selected child is re-examined individually, and described on a
schedule form in which the defect or abnormal nerve-sign is verbally
described. The teacher's report of the child's mental status is added.
The name, age, and standard of each child are written in, and the number

of children seen in each standard is recorded.

     As far as possible a description is given of the general social status
of the children, their nationality, and the general character of the neigh-

bourhood.
     For the purpose of preparing statistics each case verbally described

in the report on the children is entered in a register, in which headings
indicate the defects, the case being entered under such headings as corre-
spond to its defects. The cases are thus presented in a tabular form,
from which actuarial analysis and groupings can be accurately prepared.

     As regards the standard of defect in observation of points of physio-
gnomy or deviations from the normal, the observer should be well accus-

tomed to note size, texture of tissue, and in particular the parts of the

features, and describe as abnormal absence or ill-proportioning of parts.

Thus the cranium was not noted as small unless the circumference be less

in the ear the presence of helix, antihelix, pinna, lobe, and the general

convexity and character of the cutaneous covering, &c.

     The most frequent deviations from the normal cranium are in size,
small head being most common among girls, while over-large heads were
frequently associated with bosses, and were most common among boys.

Other types of heads were asymmetrical, and a few cases of hydrocephalus

were found in schools.

    Defects in palate may usually be described as narrow, arched or

vaulted, or V-shaped, the straight alveolar processes meeting at an acute

angle anteriorly.

     The bony bridge of the nose is often ill-developed, flat, and wide. The
mouth and palpebral fissures may be small.

     The epicanthis, at the inner angle of the eye-opening, is often marked.

Other defects in development are less frequently met with, including

supernumerary ears, defect or absence of limbs, cleft palate, &c.

The deviations from normal development here recorded are those well

known in criminal  anthropology, and as common                                                                                                                        among  imbeciles                                            but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

the degree of ill-proportioning in the bodily condition of school children

is usually much less than in idiots.

     Defects of bodily development are frequently found to be coincident

with defects of brain, lowering mental status, but not necessarily so. The

connecting link between defects of body and defective mental action is

the coincident defect of brain, which may be known by observation of

* abnormal nerve-signs.' ' It is the coincident observation of conditions

of development and * nerve-signs,' indicating brain action, that forms a
special feature of the present investigation, and distinguishes the methods

used from older physiognomical research.

     Another fact co-related with defect in development is the tendency of

-- --such children especially girls to become thin, pale, and delicate. It is

in the co-relation of abnormalities in the proportioning of parts of the body

with abnormal nerve-signs, low nutrition, and mental dulness that we

find a criterion of the really defective status connected with the abnor-

mality. "We describe, not only defective children, but every child pre-

senting a visible defect.

    As the ' nerve- signs ' may be new to many readers a brief description
of some may be given.

The face is conveniently divided into three zones, the frontal, the

middle down to the lower level of the orbits, and the lower containing the

nostrils and the mouth. Deviations from the normal muscular action

and balance are termed ' abnormal nerve-signs ' : their value depends on
the significance as indices of action in the nerve-centres which produce

them.

  --Frontal Muscles overacting. Horizontal creases on the forehead are

thus produced in varying degree : the creases may be fine, producing a

Dr. Warner, the Committees attach great weight.

dull  forehead                                                   or  coarse,  producing  a  frown.  This sign varies in degree,
                                                              ;

being least when the child is attentive and mentally engaged.

  --Corrugation. Knitting of the eyebrows, drawing the eyebrows

--together, with vertical creases on the forehead.
     Orhicularis Ocelli relaxed. There is a thin circular muscle encircling

the eyelids. Its tone gives sharpness of outline to the lower lid, so that

its convexity is marked. Its action is increased in laughter. When this

muscle is relaxed there is fulness or bagginess under the eyes.

  --Eye-movements defective. There may be wandering movements of

the eyes without fixation ; the child may not follow a slowly moving

object with the eyes, but turn the head without any movement of the

--eyes.
    Head-balance iveah. In the normal the head is held erect; it may

fall forward or be inclined to one shoulder.

     The normal posture of the hand when held out to the word of com-
mand is straight, all parts and the fingers being in the same plane, and
the hand on a level with the shoulder, the arms being parallel.

  --Hand-halance nervous. The wrist drooping, the palm slightly con-

tracted laterally, the thumb and fingers extended backwards at their

--junction with the palm of the hand.
      Hand-balance weaJc. In this type of balance the wrist is slightly

drooped, the palm contracted laterally, and the digits are slightly bent
or flexed. This postui'e is seen in sleep when the forearm is passively

held out.

  --Finger-twitches. These may be seen when the hand is held out and

the fingers are spread. The twitching movements may be lateral or in

flexion and extension.

  --Lordosis. When the hands are held out an altered balance of the

spine may be seen in a weak child with arching forward in the lumbal*

region, while the upper part of the trunk is thrown back.

   --Other Nerve-signs. This group includes the signs less frequently
--seen, such as the following: Slowness of response in movement, defects

of speech, over-smiling or grinning, drooped jaw with open mouth,

nystagmus, paralysis, &c.

     Analysis of Dr. Francis Warner's observations of 50,000 children seen

1890-92 has aff"orded much new information as to conditions bearing on

the mental status and well-being of school children.
     It has been shown that more boys than girls are ill-developed ; but

of such cases the girls tend more to delicacy and mental dulness, suggest-

ing that, while the average girls may work hard with advantage, there
are a certain number who need special care.

    The group of children who appeared to require special training in-
cluded the epileptic, imbeciles, those ' feebly gifted mentally,' and the
paralysed : they amounted to 16 per 1,000. It is satisfactory to know

that the School Boards of London, Birmingham, and Leicester have
made special arrangements for the care of such cases. The same scientific

principles as enabled their numbers to be ascertained may be used to

indicate their special requirements in training.

      Tracing the group of children with defects in development through

certain schools, it is evident that they are more numerous in Poor-law
schools and in certified industrial schools than in day schools, and that
though they become fatter in resident institutions they there present
more nerve disorder and more mental dulness.
                                                                               --

PHYSICAL DEVIATIONS AMONG CHILDREN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. GlV

     Children -with a defect in development form the largest class of cases-
noted in every group of schools, and such form of defectiveness is largely
associated with nerve disorder and mental duluess. It is, however^
noteworthy that a considerable proportion escape the two later evils.

                      .52. .                   per cent, present nerve-signs.

,,              ,,  ,, with nerve-signs 43     ,,  ,,,,  ,,

     Under conditions of less favourable training the proportion of de~
velopment cases with nerve-signs and the proportion who are dull rises.
It seems, then, that efficient training and education do much good in

preventing evils from arising in such cases.
     Comparing 10,000 children in elementaiy day schools of upper or

middle social class with 26,000 in poorer day schools, we have found in.

the latter a smaller proportion with defect in development, nerve disorder,

low nutrition, or mental dulness.

  --The thin, pale, delicate children 4 per cent, of the children seen

were almost entirely confined to the class ' development cases.' Could

we remove these defects we should probably have a smaller proportion

of children thin and delicate as well as fewer with nerve disorder and

mental dulness.

    Among children with defect of the body those with ' small heads '

form an important group of 2 per cent, of the children seen ; the condi-
tion falls mostly upon girls, and was found unequally distributed, rising

for girls in Strand to 7 per cent., in City 6 per cent., falling in Ber-
mondsey to 3 per cent., and in certified industrial schools for gii-ls rising

to 6 per cent. Such cases were more common among the English than

the Irish or Jew children.
     Cases presenting some defect were least frequent among the children

in the Jew free schools of Whitechapel, and most frequent among the

Irish schools, as seen.

    Eye cases were very frequent in all schools : many needed spectacles
who did not use them, and ophthalmia and its results were prevalent in
many instances.

     The children reported by the teachers as dull in school were 7 per
cent, of those seen, and 40 per cent, of the children presenting some
defect that was described in the schedules. The greater the number of

defects seen in the groups of children, the higher rises the percentage of

mental dulness.

     After inspecting a school and tabulating the resiilts of observation it
ia easy to prepai'e a report comparing the child-material seen with the
average, showing the effects of training the brain and the mental powers

of the pupils.

     The evidence accumulated tends to show that, while general educa-
tion has effected excellent results, much remains to be improved concern-

ing the care of the mental and physical conditions of children, especially
as to conditions of unevolved brain power, which are remediable by better

classification and training in certain cases.

This inquiry is directed to obtaining a definite statement of existing

physical and mental conditions by observation of 100,000 children, and

the causation of such weakness and defects as are more common among

them, and the means of removing such defects which lead to ill-health

tabulation of observations is in use, and has been amply approved by ex-
perience; the elaboration of results will be submitted to professional
actuarial investigation. Such a statement of facts based upon a wide
range of observation will show the groups of children that need special
care, and suggest the directions in which care is needed for improving
the condition of the child-population. The full report which the Com-
mittee hope to publish will present a census of the physical and mental
conditions of children which has not previously been obtained, and which
was not possible till the modern advancements of cerebral physiology
indicated the means to be employed.

     R. Meldola, Greneral Pitt-Rivers, and Mr. E. Cf. Ravenstein.
     {Braivn up by the Secretary.)

The Committee have requested the following gentlemen (not members
of the Association) to join them :

     Dr. C. R. Browne (representing, with Professor Cunningham and
Professor Haddon, the Royal Irish Academy, and forming a sub-com-

mittee for Ireland).

    Mr. Edward Clodd, Mr. Gr. L. Gomme (President of the Folklore

Society), and Mr. Joseph Jacobs (representing the Folklore Society).
     Mr. E. Sidney Hartland, Mr. Edward Laws, the Ven. Archdeacon

Thomas, and Mr. S. W. Williams (representing, with Professor Boyd

Dawkins and Mr. Romilly Allen, the Cambrian Archaeological Association)
and Professor John Rhys (forming a sub- committee for Wales).

     Mr. C. M. Kennedy, C.B. (representing, with Mr. Ravenstein, the
Royal Statistical Society).

     Mr. H. S. Milman and Mr. George Payne (representing, with General
Pitt-Rivers, the Society of Antiquaries), and a representative of the

Dialect Society.

     The Chairman and Secretary of the Committee, with Dr. Garson,
represent the Anthropological Institute. The Committee as thus formed

will consist of delegates of various learned bodies specially interested in

the work, with the addition of the Chairman of the Corresponding
Societies Committee.

   --The Committee propose to record for certain typical villages, parishes,

or places, and their vicinity

(1 ) Physical types of the inhabitants
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

(5) Historical evidence as to continuity of race.

     As a first step the Committee desire to form a list of such places in
the United Kingdom as appear especially to deserve ethnographic study,
out of which a selection may afterwards be made for the survey. The
places which appear to them most suitable for entry on the list are such
as contain not less than 100 adults, the large majority of whose forefathers

have lived there so far back as can be traced, and of whom the desired

physical measurements, with photographs, might be obtained.

    The Committee addressed to persons whom they believed to be

eminently capable of affording help in this preliminary search a request

that they would do so by furnishing the names of such places, with a
brief account of their several characteristics, mentioning at the same time
the addresses of such of their residents as would be likely to support the
Committee in pursuing the inquiry.

     The editors of the 'Times,' 'Nature,' the 'Academy,' the 'Athenajum,'

     Mr. Ferguson states that Keswick itself swarms with lodging-house

keepers, foreign to the district, but the valleys radiating therefrom are

aboriginal, except for an interesting German strain from German miners
imported tempore Eliz. to work gold mines. Mr. J. Fisher Crosthwaite,
F.S.A., has written upon the German strain, which is a most interesting
one ; the inheritors of the German blood being men of intellectual power.

     Mr. "Wilson, of the Keswick Hotel, suggests that the native population
of the dales in lake districts might be met with at such gatherings as the

hiring fairs, market days, and horse fairs in the towns. Many of the
inhabitants are undoubtedly descendants of the Northmen, who formerly

colonised the district, though the population, here as elsewhere, is
thoroughly blended. The lake country is poor in traditions, but there
are a few, such as the defeat of King Dunmail by Malcolm, King of
Scotland, at Dunmail Raise, where the former was slain, and a pile of
stones placed over his body. The dialect of Cumberland is best illustrated
by its songs and ballads, which are numerous. The vernacular on the

Cumberland side of Dunmail Raise varies considerably from that made
use of on the other side in Westmorland. The Saxons are said to
have colonised Westmorland, but did not settle in large numbers in
Cumberland, which was mostly occupied by Danes. There are numbers

      Aspatria, with a coal-mining and agricultural population, is a large
parish in central Cumberland, and the outlying hamlets are aboriginal.
Dalston is a large agricultural and manufacturing village, with similar

 hamlets.

      Orton, an agricultural village near Car-lisle, is a very primitive place,
surrounded by a hedge as a protection against moss troopers, and having
the fields all laid out on a plan which is the survival of an early villao'e
community.

      Alston is a very secluded district of lead miners, tall in limb, very fair,

due, it is said, to a German strain of miners in the fourteenth century.
     Mr. Ferguson remarks that the west of Cumberland is permeated

with Irish miners, at the hasmatite mines, but AUonby remains a most

primitive community, largely Quaker. Bromfield is agricultural, with
some mining. Wastdale and Eskdale furnish fine specimens of un-
adulterated Norsemen. Brampton is agricultural and mining; Laner-

cost agricultural.

     The parish of Addingham, in which Mr. Turnbull lives, consists of
four townships, Gamblesby, Glassonby, Hunsonby, and Little Salkeld.
In the three last named the old type of resident yeomen is fast dying out.
Gamblesby is situated at the base of Fiend's Fall : the population is a
little under 300, and the people are, for the most part, living on their own

estates.

     Appleby and the neighbouring villages are described as aboriginal
and sleepy hollows. In the villages named by Canon Mathews the in-

habitants have been notoriously adscripti glebce. At Eavenstonedale are
some of the most extensive remains of great works in the remote jiast,
and the population and dialect are exceptional. The whole parish of
Orton is a complete treasury of ancient civilisations and early wars. At
Swaledale the dialect and mode of enumeration are peculiar, and have been

Ahitherto classed vaguely as ancient British. glossary of Swaledale words

was published by the English Dialect Society in 1873. The superstitions

of the county point to fire worship and an oriental origin (in Mr. Wharton's

opinion) quite as much as to a Scandinavian source. He thinks the

original race must have been orientals, dark-complexioned, and diminutive
(as suggested by Professor Boyd Dawkins), and that they fled to the
mountains before the advance of a stronger people, these latter even
belonging to a prehistoric period. While in counties of more level

physical character, richer soil, larger population, and greater agricultural

    Mrs. Gutch remarks that in the district of New Forest there must be

tamlets as unsophisticated as any that Yorkshire can show. Her father's
family were established there for centuries, and she visited it in her
childhood ; but her people are scattered, and she has not had more than

a glimpse of it for well nigh forty years. It seemed at the ' back o'
beyont,' and she should think change itself would find some difficulty in

getting there.

    At Lastinghara, Dr. Sydney Ringer says, are two Roman camps and
some tumuli. ISTot far is an old Saxon sun-dial of the time of Edward the
Confessor. The inhabitants are Yorkshire dalesmen, with many of their

old customs remaining.

      Staithes is a fishing village, where the folk are notorious for inter,

marriages and for their conservation of old customs. Much in the same
case were the people of Robin Hood's Ba.y, near Whitby, when White

A' walked ' there in 1858. writer to the ' Times ' in 1885 said that there

was a village not more than a mile or two from Staithes ' whose in-

habitants are nearly all Romanists.' This is pi'obably Ugthorpe, one of
the most secluded places in the neighbourhood, so ' far from the madding
crowd ' that the Reformation seems never to have touched it. The like
might be asserted, says Mrs. Gutch, of more than one obscure place in
Yorkshire. It used to be true of Ovington, twelve miles from Darling-
ton, on the southern banks of the Tees.

understood parochial districts, such as his own parish, where there is no

village in the ordinary sense that is a century old. Probably about the
fifteenth century the inhabitants began to migrate from the centres in
which they had been grouped, and to scatter themselves in comparatively
isolated dwellings ; but still they were the same folk, and their descendants
continued to dwell in the land, and were conservative to a degree until

not very long ago.

    Mr. Mark Hill states that the people of Newton-upon-RawcliflFe,

Pickering, with whose customs and dialect that gentleman has a familiar,
extensive, and varied acquaintance, are extremely illiterate, untravelled,

and behind times.
     Canon Isaac Taylor remarks on the general question that the whole

population was cleared off in the devastation of the north by William I.,
after which a mixed population slowly filtered back. Even later there
have been great shiftings. In Settrington (of which parish Canon
Taylor is rector) there is a nominal list of the inhabitants iu 1598. All
the families but two have shifted. In the West Riding there is a
fonrteenth-centurv poll-book, which would make it easy to trace con-
tinuous residence ; but no earlier ethnological results would be possible,
as Wilham cleared off every soul in Wensleydale. This poll-book affords
abundant evidence of large recent fourteenth-century migrations,

Other villages iu South Lancashire

     Torver is a village at the foot of the fells, west of Coniston lake,
having a rural population similar to the Westmorland villages, but
lying in more open country, and with good approach from the sea at the

mouth of the Duddon.
     In the district of Rochdale there are a number of small hamlets

which cling to old habits, and are to a considerable extent untouched by

modem influences. A Flemish colony there is said to have introduced

among other things the Lancashire ' clog.'

Mr. Sowerbutts remarks that almost every old village in Lancashire

has a separate dialect. In South Lancashire the types of the country

people will have to be found in towns. In his own district of Ribblesdale
he can find a dozen people of the same type distinguished by a peculiar
inflexion of the voice ; but there are not many of the families left about

Balderstone, such as Fenton, Ellams (or Helm), Harrison, and Coupe.

He meets them daily in Manchester. His own family lived in Balder-

stone from time immemorial (Sowing in Butts is the derivation of the

name)                            and  wherever  the  name  is  (Lancashire, Yorkshire,  Hampshire,
                              ;

Bremen, Mexico, the United States of America) they all come from the

Ribble valley. But all are cleared out now to the towns, except a game-

keeper or two. When a lad ten or twelve years old he could go from

farmhouse to farmhouse for nearly twenty miles. All are gone now.

     Black] ey is a large parish, which has recently been absorbed in

Manchester, and is consequently rapidly losing its individuality. About
half of the parish has belonged geographically to Manchester for several
years, but the rest has been cut off by a valley called Boggart Hole
Clough, to which several traditions are attached, recorded in Roby's
' Traditions of Lancashire ' and Bamford's ' Walk.' This portion has been
until very recently a remarkably isolated and self-contained place,

although within hearing of the Manchester town-hall clock. Many of

the inhabitants have lived for generations in the place. One family

traces its pedigree to John of Gaunt, and claims kindred with Hugh

Oldham, Bishop of Exeter in 1515. The dialect of Blackley is akin to
that of Middleton and Rhodes, approaching that of Rochdale, but differ-
ing from Oldham. There are no monuments or other remains of ancient

culture.

twenty or thirty years has obliterated almost all ethnological and ethno-
graphical features in that part of Staffordshire by the vastly increased
facilities for removal from native soil, by the extension of education,

destruction of dialects and of local superstitions, beliefs, and practices,

and by the introduction of immigrants, especially attracted by the

mining and manufacturing operations there pursued. Hence it is that

the population is greatly mixed with Irish and Welsh ; still, peculiarities

of dialect prevail, resembling generally those of Yorkshire and Lan-

cashire. North Staffordshire is by no means rich in monuments and

remains of ancient culture. Until the present centuiy it was little

known. The higher regions were moorland or forest, and very thinly

Ainhabited.  few so-called Druidical monuments remain, but tumuli are

very scarce. Of Roman remains he knows none, except some roads of

cross-country character. Biddulph Moor has a peculiar race of inhabit-

ants, rapidly dying out, popularly attributed to the introduction of some

individual from the East by one of the lords of Biddulph. They are

peculiar in physiognomy and in language. There was also a peculiar

race, well-nigh extinct, in the moorland near Leek, off the road to

Buxton, in a locality known as the Goldsitch mines. There are several

fine encampments of British and Saxon times.

     This village, in the south-west corner of the county, ten miles from

the Ci'aven Arms junction of the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway, and

about eight miles from Broome, on the Central Wales line, the nearest

railway station, lies sleepily in its own little hollow, encircled by hills

1,000 to 1,400 feet high, and out of the beaten track from anywhere.
The result of Mr. Luff's nine years' diligent researches is to show a
strong and important neolithic settlement, with its centre upon Rock
Hill, communicating by a long mountain ridge with central Wales, and
protected on the English side every way by a network of formidable hill

fortresses. This position was continuously occupied by neolithic men,
overlapping the bronze period probably down to historical times. The

fusion of race with the Celts may have taken place before the final defeat

of Caractacus (which Mr. Luff holds to have taken place at Shrewsbury),

but then occurred a great dispersion. The large Roman camp near
Craven Arms probably marks the centre of attack by Ostorins, but after-

wards one small garrison planted behind Clun seems to have been suf-
ficient to keep the remaining hill populations in order. Mr. Luff found
no bronze, though outside the ring of earthworks bronze relics are

common. The collection of flint and stone implements made by him is
declared by Professor Boyd Dawkins to be all neolithic.

was a Sea Fishery Commissioner, and later as Salmon Fishery Inspector,
he was very much struck with the uniformity of type in the inhabitants
of some of these villages. The fishing population often keeps itself very

much to itself; and, indeed, he found on the Norfolk coast adjacent

villages of fishermen distinctly hostile to one another, each being careful
to accuse the others of all breaches of the fishery laws which take place.
In north-east Scotland the same type is of course very strong, the names
of some of the villages being pure Norse.

     Brandon is the site of the flint industry.
     Of the country round Ormesby Broad, north of Yarmouth, Mr. T. V.
Holmes, F.G.S., remarks that, although a railway now runs through it, it

must still retain much that is primitive. The Danes appear to have

settled there at an early period, as the place-names Ormesby, Filby,
Rollesby, &c., attest. Like Thanet, this Ormesby district was an island

1,000 years ago, although now connected with the rest of Norfolk by
marshes, as Thanet is with Kent. There are probably as many place-
names ending in -hij in the Ormesby district as in all the rest of Norfolk.

It would be interesting to compare this district with those of Mersea and
Canvey in Essex.

     Dr. Jessopp, who is rector of Scarning, East Dereham, observes that
all the Norfolk peasantry are perpetually on the move, and it is now
extremely hard to find a dozen men in any parish whose great grand-
fathers or even grandfathers were living there a century ago. Most

pei'manence of settlement will be found in the fens, including marshland,

and the coast.

story of a vision, years ago, at one of the churches, of a ghostly congrega-

tion, to whom it was being announced who should die during the coming

beginning of the year among the Celts, or the calends of winter, as it is

called in Welsh.

     Mr. Southall does not consider that Monmouthshire presents a good field

for branches one and two of the inquiry. There are some common physical

types representative of the district, but the field for the examination of

villages is much narrowed by the very considerable migration of popula-
tion that has taken place during this century. The agricultural popula-
tion have to some extent gone to the works, and their places have been
filled by English people. In Llanthony and Cwmysy the population got
mixed after the establishment of the abbey in the twelfth century. The
population of Cusop, near Hay, is, or was not long ago, a representative

one.

did the inhabitants keep themselves that they allowed no one to marry
out of the village ; they hated strangers, and had a reputation for wild-

East Mersea is extremely interesting from the survival there of primitive

routes, and its people having little intercourse with the outside world, it
is a good spot for the study of local folklore. In spots like Mersea and
Canvey Islands (as in Sheppey and Thanet, south of the Thames), the
Danes were wont to form more or less permanent stations, and Mersea is
mentioned as a Danish station in the ' Saxon Chronicle,' a.d. 895. The
villages on the upper part of the Roding probably furnish the most un-
mixed examples of the free Danish population, but on the other hand
Mersea and Cc\nvey are free from the later Huguenot element, so sti'ong

    The inhabitants of some of the villages named by Mr. Hembry have
been of the same families for very many years, pei'haps centuries. They

are all agricultural villages and (except Cheddar and Winscombe) far
removed from any railway.

     In those named by Mr. Elworthy the people have lived for the most

part, for many generations, little mixed. On the other hand, Mr. Bennett

states that at Sparkford, thii-ty-tive miles from Bath, the village of which

he is rector, nearly every inhabitant has been changed within his own

     Mr. Jones remarks that, forty years ago, the people of the towns

named by him retained many customs or the memory of many customs
lost in larger towns. As to each of them the great majority were related,

and the family feeling was remarkably strong : they sympathised in each
other's joys and sorrows, and reciprocally borrowed and lent to a strange
extent. Vessels from Appledore were manned by relatives almost entirely,

so far as the coasting trade went, and the large brigs and barques that
were in the timber trade between Bristol and Canada, or which carried
emigrants, were largely commanded by Appledore captains and manned

by Appledore crews, the men often objecting to the admission of a
' stranger.' These men are largely descendants of those who vexed the
Spaniards and manned the Bideford whaling fleet in or about the time
of Queen Elizabeth, which fleet was the next to that of Hull in import-

ance. While Kilkhampton (in North Cornwall) was noted for its Puritan
spirit, Appledore was looked upon forty years ago by the people of that

neighbourhood as being a place in which no one who feared the Lord
would live. There were many alive at that time who recollected the fact
of being taught to pray that God would send a ship ashore before morn-
ing. The Appledore men were, however, raore noted than the North
Cornishmen for fii'st saving life. Seventy to fifty years ago the men of

Appledore used to fearlessly venture ' over the bar ' in the worst weather

in order to rescue crews. They had no lifeboats, but rowed out in long
eight- to twelve-oared galleys. The Appledore people spoke a well-marked
variety of the Devonshire dialect. Schools have now almost destroyed it,
the result being a mongrel speech with a much more decided nasal twang

than forty years ago.

     Mr. Fox remarks that there is little doubt that ia some Cornish vil-

lages, especially ia fishing villages, the race has continued for generations

without any influx of new blood. In the mining districts the men move

about as mioes close or open up in different places, and some go abroad
to mines and return.

     Mr. Connock states that previous to about the year 1840 few changes
took place among the inhabitants of the whole area of which the town of
Helston is the centre. The families comprising the population had
been nearly all stationary for generations, and it was not difficult to meet
with persons of advanced age who had never travelled beyond the nearest
market town. Naturally this condition of things begot a strong love of
home, and it is probable that no people, as a whole, possessed a stronger

attachment to their native country than Cornishmen, who now seem

called upon to be the pioneers of civilisation ; and, more than the people
of any other province, are scattered over the whole earth. The opening

up of new mining fields has, of course, had most to do with bringing
about these new conditions. The ground in Cornwall had been mined

for thousands of years, and the extraction of ores from deep mines had

become expensive, and made it difficult to compete with new countries,
where operations were carried on scarcely beyond the light of day. At
first, a few tore themselves from home and gradually, as its necessity be-
came apparent, the spirit for emigration has become almost universal, so
that it is rare to meet with a young man who does not look forward to the
time when he shall have to seek a wider field in which to push his for-
tunes than is to be found at home. The spirit of enterprise that began

in the mining districts quickly extended all through, and the popula-

tion within the last fifty years has in many of the parishes diminished

considerably more than one-half.
     In the Breage mining districts it used to be a subject of remark that

' the men were like trees,' tall and finely developed ; among them the

families of Guudry, Treglohans, Magors, Penhales, and others were well

known, and for many years supplied the men that made the Western
wrestlers the acknowledged champions of the sport. As in other places,

where a number of persons having similar names existed, nicknames or
cognomens were common : one of these, ' Bendigo,' from Breage, was that
of the discoverer of the famous goldfields in Australia, which promptly
took and retained the appellation.

     Under the ancient system of mining (Mr. Connock further observes),
before the introduction of the steam engine made deep naining prac-
ticable, the business of farming was generally combined with it, the late
summer and autumn, when the springs became low and the work in the

fields for the year nearly completed, being devoted to the mining. It is

possible, he thinks, that the more recent practice of continuous employ-

ment in deep mines may have had in some cases a deteriorating efi"ect

upon the race. The small area of the enclosures in "West Cornwall indi-
cates the way in which the fields were gradually reclaimed from the waste
by hand labour.

      There are faint traditions of the former existence of a race of large

men once living in the locality. During some repairs to the chancel of
the chui'ch at Wendron about 1860 two stone coffins were discovered
containing human remains of unusual size.

     At Breage and Germoe were the homes of the Godolphins, the revivers
of mining industry in Cornwall at the close of the fifteenth century ; of
William Lemon, the great miner and merchant of the early part of the
eighteenth century ; and of Edward Pellew, afterwards Yiscount Exmouth.
In these parishes the steam engine was first applied to mining on a large
scale, and afterwards the labours of Arthur Woolf and Thomas Richards
largely helped to bring it to its present perfection. The use of combined
cyUnders, which has recently effected great economy in marine naviga-
tion, was originated and put in practice in the Breage mines by them.
The Cornish miners are able mechanics, wonderfully apt at expedients to
meet exigencies.

     The fishing village of Porthleven contains a large and increasing
number of families drawing a maintenance from fisheries. They are
almost wholly descended from those who have been long resident in the
locality, though fishing, as a steady and continuous industry, is a calUng
of very recent growth. The seine fishery for capturing the shoals of
pilchards periodically visiting the coast was formerly one of the great
634 REPOET-- 1893.

industries of the county, but this only required the attention of those

engaged during a short time of each year. This form of fishing has now

almost entirely disappeared.

     South of a line drawn across from the town of Helston to the raouth

of Helford River, the population of the Lizard peninsula is almost

entirely agricultural, and for many centuries has probably had little ad-
mixture from any outside source. The prevalence of certain names near
the Lizard point has suggested a strain of Spanish extraction. As in the

mining districts, emigration has of late years become general, and most of
the rising youth look forward to seeking wider fields in foreign lands.
During the last half-century each successive census shows a large dimi-
nution in the population. The inhabitants ai-e generally robust and, if
they escape pulmonary disease, long-lived. The proportion of tall, big

men is said to be large, and it is reported that the Meneage Rifle Corps,

"when standing shoulder to shoulder, occupies more space than an equal
number of men of any other corps in the kingdom.

     About the coast, fishing is carried on to a considerable extent, but
most of those engaged follow other pursuits at times when the weather
or season is not suitable for that industry. Formerly, when opportunity
ofiered, few of the people objected to a little contraband trading ; and
during the war it is said that this was winked at by the Government of
that day, as the pursuit was thought to be a good training for seamen for
the navy, to which, as well as to the army, the whole district furnished a

large contingent in proportion to the population.

     The extension of railways, yearly bringing an increasing number of

visitors into the district, cannot fail materially to modify the character of
the people. Generally they are intelligent and industrious, and have,
probably, throughout the prolonged agricultural depression, maintained
their ground as well as any agriculturists in the kingdom. The preva-
lence of Methodism has greatly modified their characteristics, a love of
reading and desire for information being encouraged and looked for, in
the young people especially, as they become identified with the society.
Mr. Connock mentions a representative instance of this in the case of the
late Mr. Samuel James, of St. Keverne.

     Oi original traditions and beliefs there are but the barest traces re-

maining, and these are vanishing. Among a few of the most ignorant a

sort of covert faith in charms and witchcraft lingers, which even they are

ashamed to acknowledge. Some years since a white witch and wizard
contrived to exact contributions from some dupes scattered about.

     Near Germoe ' Lane End ' (that is, the road leading from the main

road between Helston and Penzance to the church town of Germoe) once
lay beside the turnpike road three boulders or stones of about 1 cwt. each.
The place is locally called ' Tre-men-Keverne.' Tradition says that
St. Just once paid a visit to his brother saint at St. Keverne, and was
well received and entertained by him. St. Keverne, after the departure
of his visitor, discovered that his silver spoons and plate were missing.
Very angry at such ingratitude he started off in pursuit, picking up on

his way across Crowta Downs the three stones, which he placed in his
pocket to be ready for emergencies. The culprit being overtaken and the

booty recovered, the stones were dropped, but the principals parted in
anger. St. Just told St. Keverne that, although the people of his parish
should find mineral, there should never be a regular lode within the sound
of his church bells. 'As for you,' retorted St. Keverne, 'although the

people of your parish sliall liave plenty of fist, they shall never have a

    The Tolvan, or holed stone, near Gweek, on the borders of Wendron

parish, was formerly in repute as a means of curing weak or rickety-
infants, who were brought, often from a distance, to be passed through

the hole. The stone itself is a large granite slab, formerly lying in an

Ainclined position in the corner of a croft.  cottage having been built

on the site, a slice broken off from the stone is now made to do duty as

part of the garden wall, the opening in the stone being stuffed with straw

or thorns.

    The Dowsing Rod still finds some who have faith in it. Of this Mr.

Connoch has furnished some curious instances. Stories of its success are
current, even among the most intelligent.

The vicar of Manaccan, Dr. Eagar, states that, while the majority of

the inhabitants of the two villages in his parish, Manaccan church town

and Helford, ai'e strangers to the village by birth, they are all natives of
the Meneage or south country. This district is in many ways so peculiar

that an ethnographic survey of the kingdom should certainly contain

some account of it. The 'Meneage' (i.e., probably 'stony' district)

consists of twelve parishes lying south of Helford River and a line

passing from Gweek at the head of that river through Helston. It is

thus the peninsula whose southern point is the Lizard. Dr. Eagar has

noticed the existence of a very strongly marked melanochroic type

among the inhabitants, and, on inquiry, has found that the persons who

represent that type are of families that have belonged to the district as

far back as they can trace, though not necessarily to any specified

neighbourhood within the district. He has noticed the same type in
county Kerry, Ireland. As seen in Cornwall, it is a very handsome

type. The number of handsome meyi in his parish is very remai'kable,

and, for some curious reason, physical beauty seems commoner there

among men than among women. The women of this type are often very

--handsome too gipsy-looking, with sallow complexions and very bright

eyes. Some of the men of this type look almost like Spaniards. The

suggestion that this is due to an intermixture of Spanish blood from the

Armada seems to Dr. Eagar to be improbable, and he thinks it due to

the greater presence of a non-Aryan element in the population. The
plnjsique of the people is good. The men are well built, and many of the
women have beautiful figures as well as faces. Phthisis is almost un-

known, and death before old age is very rare. Three years ago 10 per

cent, of the population of Manaccan (357 in 1881, 379 in 1891) were

upwards  of  seventy, and  not  one  of  them was  bedridden                                          one woman,

aged eighty-eight, is so now. The dialect still exists among the old

people. Plurals in -en are common : a boarded floor, for instance, is

' the planclien.'' This occurs all over Cornwall. Thus, near Ealmouth,

the blackthorn blossoms are ' sloen-blowth.* The final verbal -e obtains
largely, and has even a living force. 'All the people do clarJce there,'

said a parish clerk of a church where the whole congregation said the

responses. So, too, they say ' to milke ' and ' to clunke ' i.e., to swallow.

In the district round Manaccan the bluetit is called ' patenapali ' ; a

pallet is a ' mabyle.' Among Christian names are many ' Hannibals '
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

Thomas, Giles, Roberts, James, Rogers (the same family for at least two

hundred years). The people are very warm and kindly, quick-witted,

and keen. Their faults are characteristically Celtic : they are not very
* straight,' and are exceedingly suspicious ; they fall out easily among
themselves, but do not make up again easily ; feuds go on from year to
year, and last out lifetimes. They have a very curious habit of giving,

by preference, any reason for their action except the one that has really
determined it, and one of their own proverbs credits them with ' wearing
their corns outside their boots.' The fishing villages are said to contain

a distinct race, and their inhabitants differ in character from the inland
folk. The non-fisherman Cornishman, even when he lives on the sea-
shore, is afraid of the sea, and credits it with containing, just below low-
water mark, ' villos ' and sand-cliSs and other dangers. Dr. Eagar con-

siders that the results of close intermarriage in the fishing villages are

--lamentable. Newlyn, near Penzance, contains two villages Street-

Nowyn (i.e., ' newyn ' or new) and Newlyn Town. If a Street-Nowyn
woman marries a Newlyn Town man her own relatives will not visit
her, and a man from one village passing through the other gets hooted

in the street. The Cornish Celt is prolific and exceedingly prone to

sexual irregularity.

remains in the valley, which extends from Little Brady to the sea at
Burton Bradstock. Till recently it was very much cut off from the rest
of the world. The people have intermarried to a great extent, and many
of the same names can be traced back a long way.

     Mr. Mansel states that in 1891 Puncknoll had a population of 423,
decreasing, as it was over 480 in 1881. The inhabitants are partly

agricultural and partly fishing (seine for mackerel, herring, and sprats).

lield by the lords of the manor, three successive rectors, named George
Frome. Old customs have been preserved, and there are many small

freeholds in the parish. Physically the inhabitants are an exceptionally

fine race, and very musical.

that they can distinguish the Jutish population from all others. The

valley runs from (say) Botley to Bishop's Waltham through Meonstoke,

Carhampton (iu the church of which parish there is an unspoilt bit of
Anglo-Saxon -work), Droxford, West Meon, and East Meon. The chief

part of the valley is seven or eight miles from any railway. The New

Forest also contains some very primitive places. The Rev. G. N. God-

win, of East Boldre, a parish seven miles from the nearest station,

believes that his village, which has a distinctly Celtic name, is in the

main a Celtic community almost untouched by the outside world. There

are numerous barrows all around, and he believes tbem to be literally
the graves of the leaders among his parishioners' ancestors. In no other

way can many traits of character which prevail among them be under-
stood. One of the tumuli is known as ' Colt Pixey's cave.'

    Mr. Clutterbuck, who is rector of Penton Mewsey, states that the
Test valley parishes, including the ' Anne ' lot round Andover, have a
character cf their own. The valley is very clearly marked out by the

high ground enclosing it ; a tribal boundary runs on one side, on the
opposite Wiltshire joins it ; and the valley is the limit of the manor and
hundred (with foreign hundred) of Andover. Of this manor the rolls

exist back to an early date, and the tythingmen's returns are in many

cases preserved, so that by them, as far back as the sixteenth century,

and by the rolls of the gild merchant to a much earlier date, the names

of pretty well all the inhabitants are known. The migration from

village to village probably greatly exceeded the emigration from the

valley and manor itself. The existence of the same name through a long-

period is very striking in the corporation records. The dialect is marked
more by grammatical structure than by difference of verbal forms.

There are some barrows (two in Penton Mewsey), a dyke, some camps,

and two intersecting Roman ways. There is a very interesting chain of

evidence of the growth of local government. Not only does historical
evidence point to the commencement of the port of Andover, but the

configuration of the ground upon which the town is built and that of the
town itself show how the port was fenced in. The parish of Penton
Mewsey, which was a separate manor, unlike the rest in the valley, has
274 inhabitants.

Upon the general question as regards the conditions of life in the
ON THE ETUNOQlurUICAL SUKVEY 01)' THE UNITED KINGDOM. G39

pastoral and agricultural districts of Wales Mr. Hartland states that the

Welsh do not gather much in villages. The peasants live chiefly in home-

steads, scattered over a larger or smaller area. The population of Gower

is divided by a sharply defined line between the English and Welsh.

This line corresponds roughly with the line dividing the coal measures

from the limestone. On the latter, the southern side, are descendants

of immigrant settlers from the opposite coast, or, as is sometimes

thought, from Flanders, who appear to have driven out the Welsh.

They speak English exclusively ; they have well-recognisable charac-

teristics ; and their families have lived on the same spot, or at least in the

same neighbourhood, for many generations. On the northern side, the

less fertile, and formerly in every way the less desirable, the Welsh-

speaking inhabitants remain, having distinct characteristics. Of late

years there has been an influx of foreign population around the mines

and works, but it is possible there are still spots where the old inhabit-

ants remain almost unadulterated. Ystradfellte, a small village at the

top of the valley through which the Mellte, a tributary of the Neath

River, runs, is the centre of a very secluded wild and rugged district. The

people are Welsh mountaineers, engaged in pastoral and agricultural

Awork.    number of interesting traditions were collected not very far

away by a lady and sent to Croker, and they appear in the third volume

of his ' Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland.' Mr.

Hartland thinks it likely, from his own experience, that many still

survive.

Mr. Williams says that, though the extraordinary growth of the

county during the last twenty years has transformed the villages of the

mining districts into towns, there are still some left in the hilly parts,

and there are very old and curious villages in the Vale of Glamorgan

which remain very much what they were many generations back.

For all Welsh antiquities ' Arch^ologia Cambrensis ' should be consulted.

     Viewing the fact that since tlie beginning of the century the popula-

to be taken as a whole. Except some very slight differences of pro-
nunciation in Manx, and a slightly larger preponderance of the Scandi-
navian in the northern part, Mr. Moore is unable to trace any difference
between the north and south of the isle, and the difference between the

Hifhlanders never lived in villages, but there are many traditions still
floating among people who live in scattered hamlets. In each of the

hundreds of years, and each is characteristic of certain phases of Celtic

     Mr. D. Christison remarks that in most parts of the Scottish lowlands,
since the introduction of railways, there has been a great shifting of the
population and an inroad of Irish, which, with the almost complete
Anglicising of the upper classes in the country districts, is rapidly extin-
guishing the Scottish character of Scotland ; but there are plenty of quiet,
retired villages which still retain something of their primitive population.
At Dundee intermarriage between the Irish and Scots, which at first was

unusual, has now become quite common.

                   IRELAND.

     This part of the United Kingdom will be investigated by the Sub-
Committee for Ireland under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy.

Communications for the Sub-Committee should be addressed to Professor
Haddon, as secretary, at the Royal College of Science, Dublin.

     The preceding tables show that in the islands of Great Britain
there are more than 250 places which, in the opinion of competent
authorities, would be suitable for ethnographic survey. The opinions of
the eminent persons who have favoured the Committee with this advice
show that, notwithstanding the rapid changes which have taken place
during the last fifty years in all parts of the country, much valuable
material remains for the Committee to work upon. They confirm the
considerations which were urged upon the Association when the appoint-
ment of this committee was asked for as to the necessity of proceeding
with the work without delay if it is to be carried into effect at all.

    The Committee have therefore prepared, for the use of those who

have expressed their readiness to help in this matter, the following circular
letter and forms of schedule :

               ' Fishers' villages.

642 KEPOBT-- 1893.

  --'Dear Sir, Referring to our previous circular letter, and to your

obliging oflFer of assistance in answer to it, we have now the pleasure to
enclose Forms of Schedule, which will, we trust, enable you to furnish

the desired information with respect to the district mentioned by your-

self.

    ' You will observe that a separate page or pages of foolscap has been

prepared for each head of the inquiries, on which are questions and hints

prepared by a member of the Committee, who has undertaken to digest

the answers in respect of his particular branch, the lower portion of

each page, to which should be added as many separate sheets of foolscap
as may be required, being left for your answers. And that, with regard

to the physical observations, a single page of foolscap has been set aside

Wefor the measurements of each individual to be observed.                                                      shall be

obliged by a note from you, stating how many individuals you think you

will have the opportunity of photographing and measuring, in order that

we may supply you with the requisite number of copies of the form.

   We' are sure you will excuse our urging what may at first sight appear

to be trivial details, but which are in reality of great practical importance

to those who have to arrange and consult a large collection of commu-

nications from diiferent persons. These are that the communications

should all be written on foolscap paper, and that the writing should be
on one side only of the page, and should never run so near the margin
as to be an obstacle to future binding.

     ' The Committee are satisfied that the value of the returns will be

much reduced if they do not give information under all the several heads.
If it should happen, therefore, that your own pursuits or means of infoi--

mation do not enable you to fill up the whole of the forms desired, they
would take it as a particular favour if you could induce friends to supply
the missing details, and thus to render the information complete.

     ' The Committee, in addressing you individually, wish to disclaim any
idea of interfering with the action of local Societies, from many of which,
on the contrary, they have reason to expect very valuable assistance. If
it should suit your convenience to present to your local Society an even

fuller account of your observations than may be necessary to comply

with the requirements of this Committee, such a course would be highly
desirable, and it is hoped that the local Societies will, on the other hand,

Facial characteristics are conveniently recorded by means of photo-

graphs, taken in the three ways explained below. Amateurs in photo-

graphy are now so numerous that it is hoped the desired materials may

be abundantly supplied. At least twelve more or less beardless male

adults and twelve female adults should be photographed. It will add

much to the value of the portrait if these same persons have also been mea-

sured. The photographs should be mounted on cards, each card bearing

the name of the district, and a letter or number to distinguish the indi-

vidual  portraits                                          the  cards  to  be  secured  together  by a thread  passing

loosely through a hole in each of theii' upper left-hand corners. Three
sorts of portrait are wanted, as follows:

    A(a) few portraits of such persons as may, in the opinion of the

person who sends them, best convey the peculiar characteristics of the
race. These may be taken in whatever aspect shall best display those
characteristics, and should be accompanied by a note directing attention

to them.

     (b) At least twelve portraits of the left side of the face of as many

different adults of the same sex. These must show in each case the
exact profile, and the hair should be so arranged as fully to show the ear.
All the persons should occupy in turn the same chair (with movable
blocks on the seat, to raise the sitters' heads to a uniform height), the
camera being fixed throughout in the same place. The portraits to be on
such a scale that the distance between the top of the head and the bottom
of the chin shall in no case be less than 1;^ inch. Smaller portraits can
hardly be utilised in any way. If the incidence of the light be not the

same in all cases, they cannot be used to make composite portraits, By
attending to the following hints the successive sitters may be made to

occupy so nearly the same position that the camera need hardly be re-
focussed. In regulating the height of the head it is tedious and clumsy
to ari'ange the proper blocks on the seat by trial. The simpler plan is
to make the sitter first take his place on a separate seat with its back to
the wall, having previously marked on the wall, at heights corresponding
to those of the various heights of head, the numbers of the blocks that
should be used in each case. The appropriate number for the sitter is
noted, and the proper blocks are placed on the chair, with the assurance
that what was wanted has been correctly done. The distance of the sitter

from the camera can be adjusted with much precision by fixing a looking-

glass in the wall (say five feet from his chair), so that he can see the
reflection of his face in it. The backward or forward position of the
sitter is easily controlled by the operator, if he looks at the sitter's head,
over the middle of the cainera, against a mark on the wall beyond. It
would be a considerable aid in making measurements of the features of
the portrait, and preventing the possibility of mistaking the district of
which the sitter is a representative, if a board be fixed above his head in
the plane of his profile, on which a scale of inches is very legibly marked,
and the name of the district written. This board should be so placed as
just to fall within the photographic plate. The backgi'onnd should be of

a medium tint (say a sheet of light bi-own paper pinned against the wall
beyond), very dark and very light tints being both unsuitable for com-

posite photography.

     (c) The same persons who were taken in side face should be subse-
quently photographed in stricthj full face. They should occupy a diffei-ent
chair, the place of camera being changed in accordance. Time will be

greatly saved if all the side faces are taken first, and then all the full
faces ; unless, indeed, there happen to be two operator.", each with his

own camera, ready to take the same persons in turn. The remarks just
made in respect to h are, in principle, more or less applicable to the
present case ; but the previous method of insuring a uniform distance

between the sitter and the camera ceases to be appropriate.

     It is proposed that composites of some of these groups shall be taken
by Mr. Galton, so far as his time allows.

                                       Directions for Measurement.

   --The instruments required for these measurements are Garson's 'Traveller's

anthropometer,' manufactured by Aston and Mander, 25 Old Compton Street,
London, price 'dl. Zs. complete ; without box footpiece 21. \0s. ; a standard for measuring
height, or a tape-measure fastened vertically on a wall, with the zero just level with
the floor ; a pair of Broca's callipers ; and a Dublin boxwood craniometer for the
head measurements, manufactured by Robinson and Sons, Grafton Street, Dublin,

price 11. IQs.

   --IIc'ujM' standing. The subject should stand perfectly upright, with his back to

the standard or fixed tape, and his eyes directed horizontally forwards. Care should
be taken that the standard or support for the tape is vertical. The height is measured
by placing a carpenter's square or a large set-square against the support in such a
manner that the lower edge is at right angles to the scale ; the square should be
placed well above the head, and then brought down till its lower edge feels the
resistance of the top of the head. The observer should be careful that the height
should be taken in the middle line of the head. If the subject should object to take
off his boots, measure the thickness of the boot- heel and deduct from stature indi-

cated in boots.

   --Helffht sitting. For this the subject should be seated on a stool or low bench,

having behind it a graduated rod or tape with its zero level with the seat ; he should
sit perfectly erect, with his back well in against the scale. Then proceed as in
measuring the height standing. The square should be employed here also if the tape

against a wall is used.

   --Length of head. Measured from the projection between the eye-brows (glabella)

to the most distant point at the back of the head in the middle line. For this
measurement the callipers are used, and care should be taken to keep the end on the

glabella steady by holding it there with the fingers while the other extremity is

searching for the maximum projection of the head behind.

   --Breadth of head. The maximum breadth of head is measured at right angles to

tlie length. Care must be taken to hold the instrument so that both its points are
exactly on the same horizontal level.

   --Height of head. The head should be so held that the eyes look straight forwards.

The callipers of Garson's anthropometer should be held vertical!}^ in front of the face
of the subject, and the upper straight arm should be extended as far as possible,
and placed along the middle line of the head ; the shorter lower arm should be
pushed up to the lower surface of the chin.

   --Face length. This is measured from the slight furrow which marks the root of

the nose to the under part of the chin. Should there be two furrows, as is often the
case, measure from the upper one.

   --Upper face length. From root of nose to the separation between the two central

front teeth at their roots.

  --Face breadth. Maximum breadth of face between the bony projections in front

of the ears.

   --Bigonial breadth. Breadth of face at the angles of the lower jaw below the ears.
   --Nose length. From the furrow at root of nose to the angle between the nose and

the upper lip in the middle line.

   --Breadth of nose. Measured horizontally across the nostrils at the widest part,
--but without compressing the nostrils.

     Internal bi-octdar breadth. "Width between the internal angles of the eyes. While
this is being measured the subject should shut his eyes.

     Head height.--This Is taken with the Dublin craniometer, the plugs of which
should be well inserted into the ear-holes, so as to press against the bony wall, and
the sliding indicator brought down on the top of the head, at a point vertical to the
ear-hole, the head being so held that the eyes are directed to a point at the same

level as themselves, i.e., the plane of vision should be exactly horizontal.

   --Auriculo- nasal radius. From centre of ear-hole to root of nose.
   --Auriouh-alveolar radius. From centre of ear-hole to gum at root of front teeth

of the upper jaw.
G46 KEPORT-- 1893.

--A-urlcuJo-mental radius. From centre of ear-hole to point of chin.

For these three measurements the Dublin craniometer should be used.

  --Note. It is essential that these rules should be strictly followed in order to

secure accuracy. If possible, the subject's weight should be obtained, and recorded
in the place set apart for remarks. The observer is recommended to procure ' Notes
and Queries on Anthropology,' the Anthropological Institute, 3 Hanover Square,

London ; net price, 3s. (id.

     The detailed measurements, for -wliicli a special schedule is provided
for each person measured, form the most important part of our anthropo-
metric investigations. In addition to this, however, we would impress
upon observers the necessity for far more numerous observations than can
be collected by the former method. If these are made in any part of the
country whenever opportunity presents weitself, shall not only have a
mass of valuable material, but we shall have suggestions as to where it
might be profitable to prosecute more detailed investigation.

   We would recommend observers to attend village fairs and festivals,

and to provide themselves with a sufficient number of marking cards. It
would be advisable for two or more observers to work independently on
the same occasion ; the average results of two or more observers would
be of more value than the report of a single observer.

     On the back of each card should be written the general impression,

not only of the hair and eye colour, but also of other characteristics and
peculiarities this should be recorded immediately after the observation

                                                                    ;

has been made, and not from memory after an interval.
     It must be distinctly understood that this is to be regarded as sup-

plemental to the more detailed measurements, and that the latter should

receive most attention.

     The anthropological data most readily obtainable are the colour of the
hair and eyes. The marking cards introduced by Dr. Beddoe are in every
way admirably adapted for field work, since they are small enough to fit
in a waistcoat pocket. As the noting of an individual can be made by a
single pencil mark, they admit of rapid and accurate use in situations
where writing would be difficult. The cards are marked as in the

diagram on page 647, which, also, will be found to be a convenient

size.

     Each card is divided vertically into three main divisions for eye colour:
light, medium, and dark respectively. The three spaces thus formed are
further subdivided vertically into five columns for the five hair colours :
red, fair, brown, dark, and black. These are indicated by the letters R,

Nr, B, D, and at the heads of the columns. The card is subdivided by

--a horizontal line into two equal parts the upper for males, the lower for

females. It is convenient to leave a space at the end of the card for the
        ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 647

name of the locality and the date. The back of the card can be utilised
for further particulars. The initialling of the card by the observer

indicates that the record is completed for that card.

                              2. Current Traditions and Beliefs.

                                                    FOLKLOEE.

     Every item of folklore should be collected, consisting of customs,
traditions, superstitions, sayings of the people, games, and any supersti-
tions connected with special days, marriages, births, deaths, cultivation of
the land, election of local officers, or other events. Each item should
be written legibly on a separate piece of paper, and the name, occupa-

tion, and age of the person from whom the information is obtained

should in all cases be carefully recorded. If a custom or tradition relates
to a particular place or object, especially if it relates to a curious natural

feature of the district, or to an ancient monument or camp, some infor-
mation should be given about such place or monument. Sometimes a
custom, tradition, or superstition may relate to a particular family or

group of persons, and not generally to the whole population ; and in

this case care should be exercised in giving necessary particulars. Any

objects which are used for local ceremonies, such as masks, ribbons,
coloured dresses, &c., should be described accurately, and, if possible,
photographed or might be forwarded to London, either for permanent

                                                                                         ;

location, or to be drawn or photographed. Any superstitions that are

believed at one place and professedly disbelieved at another, or the exact
opposite believed, sliould be most carefully noted.

     The following questions are examples of the kind and direction of the
inquiries to be made, and are not intended to confine the inquirer to the
special subjects referred to in them, nor to limit the replies to categorical
answers. The numbers within brackets refer to the corresponding articles

            3. Pectdiarities of Dialect.

            DiKECTIONS TO COLLLECTOKS OP DULECT TeSTS.

1. Do not, if it can be helped, let your informant know the nature of

your observations. The true dialect speaker will not speak his dialect

freely or truly unless he is unaware that his utterance is watched. In

some cases persons of the middle class can afford correct information,
and there is less risk in allowing them to know your purpose.

     2. Observe the use of consonants. Note, for example, if f and z are

used where the standard pronunciation has /and s. This is common in

the south.

     3. Observe very carefully the nature of the vowels. This requires
practice in uttering and appreciating vowel sounds, some knowledge of

phonetics, and a good ear.

4. Record all observations in the same standard phonetic alphabet, viz.,

Athat given in Sweet's ' Primer of Phonetics.'  few modifications in this

may be made, viz., ng for   Sweet's symbol for the sound of ng in  thing                               sh
                                                                                                    ;

for his symbol for the sh in she ; ch for his symbol for the ch in choose ; th

for the th in thin ; dh for the th in the^i. If these modifications are used

say so. But the symbol ^ must only be used for the y in you, viz., as in

German. If the sound of j in jttst is meant Sweet's symbol should be

nsed. On the whole it is far better to use no modifications at all.

Sweet's symbols are no more difficult to use than any others after a very
brief practice, such as every observer of phonetics must necessarily go

through.

5. If you find that you are unable to record sounds according to the

above scheme it is better to make no return at all. Incorrect returns are

misleading in the highest degree, most of all such as are recorded in the

ordinary spelling of literary English.

6. The chief vowel-sounds to be tested are those which occur in the

following words of English origin, viz., man, hard, name, help, meat

(spelt with ea), green (spelt with ee), hill, wine, fire, soft, hole, oak (s[)elt
"with oa), cool, sun, house, day, laiv, or words involving similar sounds.

Also words of French origin, such as just, master {a before s), grant,

(a before 7?), try, value, measure, bacon, pay, chair, journey, pity, heef, clear,
profit, boil, roast, pork, false, butcher, fruit, blue, pure, poor, or words in-

volving similar sounds.

     The best account of these sounds, as tested for a Yorkshire dialect, is

to be found in Wright's ' Dialect of WindhiU ' (English Dialect Society,
1892), published by Kegan Paul at 12s. Qd. Sweet's symbols are here
employed throughout.

Sweet's ' Primer of Phonetics ' is published by the Oxford Press at

3s. 6d.

   A list of text- words (of English origin) is given at p. 42 of Skcat's

' Primer of English Etymology,' published by the Oxford Press at Is. Qd.

     7. The task of collecting words whicli seem to be peculiarly dialectal
(a to form or meaning, or both) has been performed so thoroughly that
it is useless to record what has been often already recorded. See, for
example, Halliwell's (or Wright's) ' Provincial Glossary * and the publi-
cations of the English Dialect Society. In many cases, however, the

jprominciation of such words has not been noted, and may be carefully set
down with great advantage.

     The Rev. Professor Skeat has been kind enough to draw up the fore-
going directions, and the collections under this head will be submitted

to him.

              4. Monuments and other Remains of Ancient Culture.

     Plot on a map, describe, furnish photographs on sketches, and state
t"he measurements and names (if any) of these, according to the following

classification :

     Drift implements. Caves and their contents.
      Stone circles. Monoliths. Lake dwellings.
      Camps. Enclosui'es. Collections of hut circles.
      Cromlechs. Cairns. Sepulchral chambers.
     Barrows, describing the form, and distinguishing those which have
not been opened.

       Inscribed stones.
      Figured stones. Stone crosses.
      Castra (walled). Earthen camps.

     Foundations of Roman buildings.

     Cemeteries (what modes of sepulture).
      Burials, inhumation or cremation.

      Detailed contents of graves.

      Types of fibulte and other ornaments.
      Coins. Implements and weapons, stone, bronze, or iron.
      Other antiquities.

    A list of place-names within the area. No modern names required.

      Special note should be made of British, Roman, and Saxon interments
occurring in the same field, and other signs of successive occupation.

     Reference should be made to the article ' Archseology ' in ' Notes and

 Queries on Anthropology,' p. 176.
     These relate to England only. The sub-committees for other parts of

the United Kingdom will prepare modified lists.

     The collections under this head will be digested by Mr. Milman and
Mr. Payne.

                     5. Historical Evidence as to Continuity of Bace.

      Mention any historical events connected with the place, especially
such as relate to early settlements in it or more recent incursions of alien
immigrants.

      State the natui'e of the pursuits and occupp^tions of the inhabitants.
      State if any precautions have been taken by the people to keep them-
selves to themselves ; if the old village tenures of land have been pre-

 served.

     Has any particular form of religious belief been maintained ?

     Are the people constitutionally averse to change ?

    What are the dates of the churches and monastic or other ancient

buildings or existing remains of former buildings ?

    Do existing buildings stand on the sites of older ones ?

    How far back can particular families or family names be traced?

     Can any evidence of this be obtained from the manor rolls; from
the parish registers ; from the tythingmen's returns ; from guild or

corporation records ?

     Are particular fiimily names common ?

     In what county or local history is the best description of the place to
be found ?

      Evidences of historical continuity of customs, dress, dwellings, im-
plements, &c., should be noted.

     The collections under this head will be digested by Mr. Brabrook.

     The Committee recommend that they be reappointed, and that a
grant be made to defray the expenses already incurred and to carry on

their work.

--The North-Western Tribes of Canada. Report of the Committee,

    consisting of Dr. E. B. Tylor (Chairman), Mr. Gr. W. Bloxam
     {Secretary), Dr. Gr. M. Dawson, Mr. E. Gr. Haliburton, and

     Mr. H. Hale, appointed to investigate the physical characters^
     languages, and industrial and social condition of the North-
     Western Tribes of the Dominion of Canada.

Since the death of Sir Daniel Wilson the work of the Committee in
America has been directed by Mr. Horatio Hale and Dr. G. M. Dawson -,
during the past year, however, the state of Mr. Hale's health has rendered
it imperative for him to give up the active part which he has heretofore
taken in the work of the Committee, and for which they feel that they

are deeply indebted to him.

     The absence of Dr. Dawson from America on business connected with

the Behring Sea Arbitration and the fact that the whole of Dr. Boas's
time has been occupied at the World's Columbian Exhibition at Chicago
have rendered it impossible for the Committee to carry out their orjo-inal
intention of terminating their work with this year's report.

   A considerable amount of material has already been collected by

Dr. Boas and Dr. Chamberlain on behalf of the Committee, and this they
hope to be able to publish next year.

    The Committee ask for reappointment, and, in order that they may
be enabled to draw up a final report and bring their work to a close in a
satisfactory manner, they ask that they may be permitted to retain and
utilise any portion of last year's grant that may remain in their hands
after the payment of expenses for which they have already made them-

selves liable.

--Anthropometric Laboratory. Report of the Committee, consistirig

     of Sir W. H. Flower (Chairman), Dr. J. G-. GtAKSON (Secretary),
     Mr. Gf. W. Bloxam, Professor A. C. Haddon, and Dr. Wilber-
     FORCE Smith. (Draivn up by Dr. J. G-. Garson, Secretary.)

The Committee have to report that at the Edinburgh meeting of the
Association last year excellent accommodation was provided for the

Anthropometric Laboratory near to the meeting-room of the Anthropo-
logical Section. The services of a clerk were, as usual, placed at the
disposal of the Committee, and by the kind permission of Mr. Francis
Galton those of the official measurer at his laboratory in South Kensing-

ton Museum were again available for measuring the members of the
Association who visited the laboratory.

     The schedule of observations and measurements made on each person
examined was the same as has been used for several years past by the
Committee, and includes the sex, age, birthplace, colour of eyes and
hair, profile of nose, height when standing, sitting, and kneeling, vertical
projection from the vertex of the head to the tragus, mouth, and chin,
length and breadth of the head, length and breadth of nose, length of
cubit and hand, span of arms, weight in ordinary clothing, strength of

pull with each hand, vital capacity of lungs, strength of vision, sense of
colour, and in males the circumference of the chest during forced inspi-
ration and expiration respectively.

      Since the close of the meeting the observations recorded during it
have been carefully worked up, under the direction of the Secretary, after
the plan which has been adopted in previous years.

     The Committee ask to be reappointed and to have a sum of 5L again

placed at their disposal.

     The following are the results of the observations made on the 55 males
and 49 females who presented themselves for measurement at the Labora-

tory during the course of the meeting.

   --Aij(\ The males varied in age from 17 to 72 years. Of these 4 were

tinder 20 years, 19 were 20 and under 30 years, 16 were 30 and under
40 years, 4 were 40 and under 50 years, 6 were 50 and under 60 years,
4 were 60 and under 70, and 2 were 70 and 72 years.

     The ages of the females varied from 16 to 59 years. Four were
under 20 years, 16 were 20 and under 30 years, 15 were 30 and under
40 years, 7 were 40 and under 50 years, and 7 were 50 and under
60 years.

     Between the ages of 24 and 56 there were 38 males and 40 females.
Ten of the males and 8 of the females were below 24 years of age, and 7
of the males and one female were over 56 years of age ; 70 per cent, of
the males and 82 per cent, of the females were fully developed and in
the prime of life.

  --Birtliplace and Residence. Thirty-eight per cent, of the males were

Scotch by birth, and44 were English. The remainder were Irish and persons
born in British dependencies, or foreigners from various parts of Europe.

     Of the females 27 per cent, were Scotch by birth, 56 per cent.
English, 8 per cent. Irish, principally from Belfast, and therefore

probably of the same racial stock as the Scotch ; 8 were bom in British

dependencies.

     The majority of both sexes measured were town dwellers, 69 per cent,
of the males and 11 per cent, of the females being townspeople ; while 31
per cent, of the former and 27 per cent, of the latter had lived their lives

in the country.

     It may be stated that residents of smaller towns were classed as
country dwellers only those who had lived the greater part of their lives

                                                                                           ;

--in large towns or cities were included as town dwellers.
     Occupation. The larger proportion of the males were engaged in

professional pursuits.

   --Colour of Eyes. The colour of the iris has been classified under the

three categories, light, medium, dark.
     In the males 58 per cent, had light eyes, 16 per cent, medium, and

26 per cent. dark.
      In the females 57 per cent, had light eyes, 27 per cent, medium, and

16 per cent. dark.

   --Colour of Hair. Dividing the colour of the hair into the divisions
--light, medium, and dark including red in the light group, dark brown

and black in the dark group, and omitting all cases of grey hair due to

--senile or other changes 31 per cent, of the males had light hair, 47 per

cent, medium, and 22 per cent, dark ; while in the females the percentages
were 22 light, 37 medium, and 41 dark.

from the total indicated height. The stature thus obtained, as has been
proved from many observations, does not err in being more than it really
is, but, if anything, rather less, because usually the place where the heel
of the foot rests is more or less hollowed out in the boot below the

external heel level.

     The stature of the males and females at the 25th, 50th, and 75th
grades, according to Mr. Francis Galton's method of working out these
statistics, also the probable deviation (indicated by the letter Q) which
when added to the figures of the 25th grade gives the corrected mean,

are as follows :

--corrected mid-grade would be 944 millimetres.
     Visio7i. The power of vision was tested with Snellen's test-types
placed at a distance of 6 metres from the eye. Each eye was tested
separately ; while one eye was being tested the other was kept open, and
a black card was held over it to prevent the type being seen by it.

     The number of males who could read No. 6 type with both eyes at
6 metres, and whose sight was therefore normal, was 27 out of 55, or
49"1 per cent. Of these 17, or 309 per cent., were able to read No. 5

type at G metres.

     The females who were able to read No. 6 type with both eyes at
6 metres numbered 22 out of 49, or 44*9 per cent., and of these 13, or

26"5 per cent., were able to read No. 5 type at 6 metres.
     In a large number of cases in both sexes the vision in the two eyes

differed, that of one eye being more defective than that of the other.
     The time which could be devoted to each candidate was too short to

permit of any investigation as to the cause of the deficiencies in vision

--being undertaken.
     Colour Sense. The test-colours recommended in the Report of the
Committee of the Royal Society on Colour Blindness have been adopted in
testing the appreciation of colour. For this purpose a number of skeins
of coloured wools were added to wools of the colour given in the plate of
the just mentioned report, so as to increase the number of confusion
colours. Each candidate was given the three standard skeins and told
to pick out from the heap of coloured wools those that were like them in

colour. No case of colour blindness was found amongst either the males

or females.

     The table will give some idea of the variations of the diflFerent mea-
surements which have been obtained during the last three meetings of
the Association, and of the canon of proportion of the several parts

 of the body.

     It wiU also enable anyone who has been measured in the laboratory
 to find what his place is with respect to the corrected mean of each
 measurement. If he is above or below the mean in any measurement,

by referring to that measurement in the report he will be able to ascer-
tain further particulars with respect to his position. The 25th, 50th,
and 75th grades are the positions which would be held by the 25th, 50th,

and 75th man if a hundred men were marshalled in a row, beginning

from the smallest up to the greatest, with respect to the particular
measurement.

titles of the papers submitted to Sections E and H.

     As regards barbaric languages, the Committee are not prepared to

offer other suggestions than that

     1. The above-named system should be adopted so far as it is

applicable.

     2. That in selecting symbols to express additional sounds endeavour
should be made to conform to the usage of previous authors.

     3. That explanatory examples of the signification of those symbols be
given by the writer.

     4. That the Secretary of the British Association shall direct the

attention of those travellers who may hereafter receive money grants

from the Association to the above resolutions.
     The system of orthography referred to above is subjoined.
     The Committee request to be reappointed.

    SYSTEM OF ORTHOGRAPHY FOR NATIVE NAMES OF

                                         PLACES.

      Taking into consideration the present want of a system of geographical
orthography, and the consequent confusion and variety that exist in the
mode of spelling in English maps, the Council of the Royal Geographical
 Society have adopted the following rules for such geographical names as

are not, in the countries to which they belong, written in the Roman

character. These rules are identical with those adopted for the Admiralty
charts, and will henceforth be used in all publications of the Society.^

     1. No change will be made in the orthography of foreign names in
countries which use Roman letters : thus Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,

 &c., names will be spelt as by the respective nations.
      2. Neither will any change be made in the spelling of such names in

 languages which are not written in Roman character as have become by

 long usage familiar to English readers ; thus Calcutta, Cutch, Celebes,
 Mecca, &c., will be retained in their present form.

      3. The true sound of the word as locally pronounced will be taken as

 the basis of the spelling.

    A4. An approximation, however, to the sound is alone aimed at.

 system which would attempt to represent the more delicate inflections of
 sound and accent would be so complicated as only to defeat itself. Those
 who desire a more accurate pronunciation of the written name must leam
 it on the spot by a study of local accent and peculiarities.

       5. The broad features of the system are that vowels are pronounced
 as in Italian and consonants as in English.

   -- --6. One accent only is used the acute to denote the syllable on which

 stress is laid. This is very important, as the sounds of many names are

 entirely altered by the misplacement of this ' stress.'

      7. Every letter is pronounced. When two vowels come together each

machinery having reciprocating parts may be referred to ; sacli, for

instance, as some classes of mining machinery, sorting and grading machi-

nery as nsed in flour mills, some textile machinery, paper-making machi-

nery, coal screens, and the like. In all the machines of this class the

push and pull of the reciprocated part is attended by a corresponding

pull and push against that part of the machine framing to which the

bearings of the crank or other reciprocating medium are fixed. As far as

possible, this is compensated by the use of balance weights on the crank

shaft, but in many cases the motion which would otherwise be set up has

to be opposed by the costly method of constructing very strong framing, or

the often inconvenient one of employing guy ropes or stays ; a method which

often gives rise to vibration in the building to which these stays are attached.

After attempting to prevent vibrations thus set up and to conquer this

--hete noire of mechanical engineering, the author has found that the best

way to conquer it is to make use of it -to convert this mechanical by-

product into a mechanical servant. This can be done in a large number

of cases. Where, for instance, a part of a machine is reciprocated by

means of a crank and connecting rod, the weight of which is balanced by

rotating weights on the crank shaft, the whole of the vibration in the

framing of the machine may be avoided by dispensing entirely with the

crank and connecting rod, and using only the rotating balance weights

on a shaft running in bearings which are attached, not to the framing, but

to the thing which has to be reciprocated or gyrated. The crank and

oonnecting rod being absent, the balance weights are now unbalanced

except dynamically, and the want of balance is kinetically equivalent to

the required motion in the thing to be gyrated. This was shown by

the models placed upon the table, and by reference to a simple case as

shown by the diagram exhibited.

The relation between the range of reciprocation or gyration of the part

to be operated and of the rotating unbalanced weight, as well as of their

respective weights, may be represented by the following expressions :

If R^radius of gyration of part moved,

                           r= radius of unbalanced rotating weight,

                          W= weight of part to be moved,

attached, namely, in this case the screen, and the whole of the work done
is absorbed in vibrating or gyrating the screen through a range which is
proportional to the relations as to dimensions and weights already
referred to. In fig. 6 is shown in plan an alternative method on the same
principle, by means of which a rotating eccentric weight, "W, running
in bearings in a bracket, B, and driven by a flexible connection, C,
imparts to the screen a reciprocating motion. In this case the range
of reciprocation is limited by the mode of suspension of the screen
weight, of the screen and its load when it is undesirable that the

screen should be lifted by the inertia of motion of the weight, W, in the

downward part of its rotating path. The movements described with
reference to these diagrams are illustrated by three of the models

exhibited.

               THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

The Peesident delivered the following address :

Beeoee dealing with the subject which I hope to hring to your notice this

morning, I wish to express my deep regret for the circumstances which have

prevented Professor Clifton, who had accepted the nomination of the Council, from

heing your President this year.

    It was specially fitting that he who has done so much for this coUege, and
particularly for this laboratory in which we meet, should take the chair at
Nottingham. The occasions on which we see him are all too seldom; and we who

come frequently to these meetings were looking forward to help and encouragement

in our work, derived from his wide experience. You would desire, I feel sure, that

I should convey to him the expressions of your sympathy. For myself I must ask

mythat you will pass a lenient judgment on                                    efibrts to fill his place.

Let me commence, then, with a brief retrospect of the past year and the events

which concern our Section.

    From the days of Galileo the four satellites of Jupiter have been objects of
interest to the astronomer. Their existence was one of the earliest of the dis-

coveries of  the telescope                                                    they proved conclusively  that all the bodies of  the solar
                                                                           ;

system did not move round the earth. The year which has passed since our last

-leetmg is memorable for the discovery of a fifth satellite. It is a year to-day

Sept. 13-14, 1892) since Professor Barnard convinced himself that he had seen with

he great telescope of the Lick Observatory this new member of our system as a

tar of the thirteenth magnitude, revolving round the planet in 11 hours 57 minutes

.'3 seconds.'

The conference on electrical standards held at our meeting last year has had

mportant results. The resolutions adopted at Edinburgh were communicated to

Ale Standards Committee of the Board of Trade.                                                          supplementary report

.ccepting these resolutions was agreed to by that Committee (Nov. 29, 1892), and

resented to the President of the Board of Trade. The definitions contained in
nis report will be made the basis of legislation throughout the world. They

:ive been accepted by France, Germany, Austria, and Italy. Tlie congi-ess at

bicago which has just been held has ratified them, and thus we may claim that

your Committee, co-operating with tlie leaders of physical science in other lands,

have secured international agreement on these fundamental points.

    Among the physical papers of the year I would mention a few as specially call-

ing for notice. Mr. E. H. Griffiths's re-determination of the value of the mechanical
equivalent of heat has j ust been published,^ and is a monumental work. With untiring

energy and great ability he struggled for five years against the difficulties of his

task, and has produced results which, with the exception of one group of experi-

ments, do not diifer by more than 1 part in 10,000 ; while the results of that one
excepted group differ from the mean only by 1 part in 4,000.

     The number of ergs of work required to raise 1 gramme of water 1° C. at

15° C. is 4'198 X 10'. Expressed in foot-pounds and Fahrenheit degrees, the

value of J is 77977. The value obtained by Joule from his experiments on the

friction of water, when corrected in 1880 by Rowland so as to reduce his readings

to the air thermometer, is 7785 at 12°-7 C. The result at this temperature of

Rowland's own valuable research is 780'1. Another satisfactory outcome of Mr.

Griffiths's work is the very exact accordance between the scale of temperature as

determined by the comparison of his platinum thermometer with the air thermometer,

which was made by Callendar and himself in 1890, and that of the nitrogen

thermometer of the Bureau International at Sevres.

Another great work now happily complete is Rowland's ' Table of Standard

Wave-lengths.' " Nearly a thousand lines have been measured with the skill and

accuracy for which Rowland has made himself famous ; and in this table we see

the results achieved by the genius which designed the concave grating and the

mechanical ingenuity which contrived the almost perfect screw.

    Those of us who have seen Mr. Higgs's wonderful photographs of the solar
spectrum taken with a Rowland grating will rejoice to know that his map also is

now finished.

Lord Rayleigh's paper on ' The Intensity of Light reflected from Water and

3Iercury at nearly perpendicular incidence,' ^ combined with the experiments on re-

flexion from liquid sujfaces in the neighbourhood of the polarising angle,* establishes

results of the utmost importance to optical theory. ' There is thus,' Lord Rayleigh

-- --concludes, ' no experimental evidence against the rigorous application of Fresuel's

formulae ' for the reflexion of polarised light ' to the ideal case of an abrupt

transition between two uniform transparent media.'

Professor Dewar has, during the year, continued his experiments on the lique-

faction of oxygen and nitrogen on a large scale. To a physicist perhaps the most

important results of the research are the discovery of the magnetic properties of

liquid oxygen, and the proof of the fact that the resistance of certain pure

metals vanishes at absolute zero.^ The last discovery is borne out by Griffiths

and Callendar's experiments with their platinum thermometers.®

                                                                                                                                                       '  Some of his

deductions will be noticed later.

The title-page of the first edition of Maxwell's 'Electricity and Magnetism' bears

the date 1873. This year, 1893, we welcome a third edition, edited by Maxwell's

distinguished successor, and enriched by a supplementary volume, in which

Professor J. J. Thomson describes some of the advances made by electrical science

in the last twenty years. The subject matter of this volume might well serve as

a text for a Presidential Address.

     The choice of a subject on which to speak to-day has been no easy task. The

field of physics and mathematics is a wide one. There is one matter, however, to

which for a few minutes I should like to call your attention, inadequately though

it be. Optical theories have, since the year 1876, when I first read Sir George

Stokes's ' Report on Double Refraction,'^ had a special interest for me, and I think

the time has come when we may with advantage review our position with regard
to them, and sum up our knowledge.'

    That light is propagated by an undulatory motion through a medium which
we call the ether is now an established fact, although we know but little of the
nature or constitution of the ether. The history of this undulatory theory is full

of interest, and has, it appears to me, in its earlier stages been not quite clearly

apprehended. Two theories have been proposed to account for optical phenomena.

Descartes was the author of the one, the emission theory. Hooke, though his
work was very incomplete, was the founder of the undulatory theory. In his

' Micrographia,' 1664, page 56, he asserts that light is a quick and short vibratory

motion, ' propagated every way through an homogeneous medium by direct or

straight lines extended every way like rays from the centre of a sphere. . . . Every

pulse or vibration of the luminous body will generate a sphere which will continu-

ally increase and grow bigger, just after the same manner, though indefinitely

swifter, as the waves or rings on the surface do swell into bigger and bigger

circles  about                                             a point  on  it  ;      and  he  gives  on  this  hypothesis  an  account of  reflexion,
                                                                                '

refraction, dispersion, and the colours of thin plates. In the same work, page 58,

he describes an experiment practically identical with Newton's famous prism experi-

ment, pubhshed in 1672. Hooke used for a prism a glass vessel about two feet

long, filled with water, and inclined so that the sun's rays might enter obliquely

at the upper surface and traverse the water. * The top surface is covered by an

opacous body, all but a hole through which the sun's beams are suffered to pas?

into the water, and are thereby refracted' to the bottom of the glass, ' against which

--part if a paper be expanded on the outside there will appear all the colours of the

rainbow that is, there will be generated the two principal colours, scarlet and

blue, with all the intermediate ones which arise from the composition and

diluting of these two.' But Hooke could make no use of his own observation;
he attempted to substantiate from it his own theory of colours, and wrote pure

nonsense in the attempt ; and though his writings contain the germ of the theory,

and in the light of our present knowledge it seems possible that he understood it

more thoroughly than his contemporaries believed, yet his reasoning is so utterly

vague and unsatisfactory that there is little ground for surprise that he convinced

but few of its truth.

And then came Newton. It is claimed for him, and that with justice, that be

was the true founder of the emission theory. In Descartes' hands it was a vague

hypothesis, Newton deduced from it by rigid reasoning the laws of reflexion and

refraction                                                 he applied it with      wondrous        ingenuity to  explain the colours of      thin
                                                        ;

and of thick plates and the phenomena of diifraction, though in doing this he had

to suppose a mechanism which he must have felt to be almost impossible; a

mechanism which in time, as it was applied to explain other and more complex

phenomena, became so elaborate that, in the words of Verdet, referring to a period

one hundred years later, * all that is necessary to overturn this laborious scaflfold-

ing is to look at it and try to understand it.'

But though Newton may with justice be called the founder of the emission

theory, it is unjust to his memory to state that he accepted i+ as giving a full and

satisfactory account of optics as they were known to him. "When he first began

his optical work he realised that facts and measurements were needed, and his

object was to furnish the facts. He may have known of Hooke's theories. The

copy of the * Micrographia ' now at Trinity College was in the Library while

Newton was working with his prism in rooms in college, and may have been con-

Ansulted by him.                                                    early note-book of his contains quotations from it. Still

there was nothing in the theories but hypotheses unsupported by facts, and these

would have no charm for Newton. The hypotheses in the main are right. Light

is due to wave motion in an all-pervading ether ; the principle of interference,

vaguely foreshadowed by Hooke ('Micrographia,' p. 66), was one which a

century later was to remove the one difficulty which Newton felt. For there was
one fact which Hooke's theory could not then explain, and till that explanation
was given the theory must be rejected ; the test was crucial, the answer was

decisive.

  --Newton tells us repeatedly what the difficulty was. In reply to a criticism of

Hooke's in 1672 he writes : * For to me the fundamental supposition itself seems

impossible, namely, that the waves or vibrations of any fluid can, like the rays of
light, be propagated in straight lines without continual and very extravagant
spreading and bending into the quiescent medium where they are terminated by it.
I mistake if there be not both experiment and demonstration to the contrary. . . .

For it seems impossible that any of those motions or pressions can be propagated

in straight lines without the like spreading every way into the shadowed mediima.'
     Nor was there anything in the controversy with Hooke, which took place

about 1675, to shake this belief. Hooke had read his paper describing his dis-

co^ery of diSraction. He had announced it two years earlier, and there is no doubt
in my mind that this was an original discovery, and not, as Newton seemed to

imply soon after, taken from Grimaldi ; but his paper does not remove the diffi-

culty. Accordingly we find in the ' Principia' Newton's attempted proof (lib. ii.

--prop. 42) that ' motus omnia per fluidum propagatus divergit a recto tramite in

spatia immota ' a demonstration which has convinced but few and leaves the

question unsolved as before.

Again, in 1690 Huygens published his great ' Traite de la Lumiere,' wi-itten in

1678. Huygens had clearer views than Hooke on all he wrote ; many of his

demonstrations may be given now as completely satisfactory, but on the one

crucial matter he was fatally weak. He, rather than Hooke, is the true founder

of the undulatory theory, for he showed what it would do if it could but explain

the rectilinear propagation. The reasoning of the latter part of Huygens' first

chapter becomes forcible enough when viewed in the fight of the principle of

interference enunciated by Young, November 12, 1801, and developed, independ-

ently of Young, by Fresnel in his great memoir on ' Diffraction ' in 1815 ; but with-

out this aid it was not possible for Huygens's arguments to convince Newton, and
                                                                                                                                                                                 :--
hence  in   the  '  Opticks    '  (2nd   edit., 1717)  he wrote                                              the  celebrated                                       Query     28            '  Are

not all hypotheses erroneous in which light is supposed to consist in pressure or

motion propagated through a fluid medium ? If it consisted in motion propagated

either in an instant or in time it would bend into the shadow. For pressure or

motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines beyond an obstacle which

stops part of the motion, but will bend and spread every way into the quiescent
medium which lies outside the shadow.' These were his last words on the subject.

They prove that he could not accept the undulatory theory ; they do not prove

that he believed the emission theory to give the true explanation. Yet, in spite

of this, 1 think that Newton had a clearer view of the undulatory theory than his

contemporaries, and saw more fully than they did what that theory could achieve

--if but the one difficulty were removed.
    This was Y'^oung's belief, who writes : ' 'A more extensive examination of

Newton's various -writings has shown me that he was in reality the first who sug-

gested  such        a  theory     as  I  shall  endeavour                                                to  maintain                                              that his own  opinions

varied less from this theory than is now almost universally believed ; and that a

variety of arguments have been advanced as if to meet him which may be found

in a nearly similar form in his own works.' I wish to call attention to this state-

ment, and to bring into more prominent view the grounds on which it rests, to

place Newton in his true position as one of the founders of the undulatory theory.

The emission theory in Newton's hands was a dynamical theory ; he traced

the motion of material particles under certain forces, and found their path to

coincide with that of a ray of light; and in the ' Principia,' prop. 96, Scholium,

he calls attention to the similarity between these particles and light. The particles

obey   the  laws       of reflexion   and  refraction                                               but  to  explain  why                                          some  of  the incident

of easy reaexion and transmission. These are explained in the 'Opticks,' book iii.,
props. 11, 12, and 13 (1704), thus:--

      ' Light is propagated from luminous bodies in time, and spends about seven or
eight minutes of an hour in passing from the sun to tbe earth.

     ' Every ray of light in its passage through any refracting surface is put into a
certain transient constitution or state, which in the progress of the ray returns at
equal intervals, and disposes the ray at each return to be easily transmitted
through the next refracting surface, and between the returns to be easily reflected
by it.

   --' Definition. The return of the disposition of any ray to be reflected I will call

its fit of easy reflexion, and those of the disposition to be transmitted its fits of
easy transmission, and the space it passes between every return and the next return

the interval of its fits.

    ' The reason why the surfaces of all thick transparent bodies reflect part of the

light incident on them and refract the rest is that some rays at their incidence are
in their fits of easy reflexion, some in their fits of easy transmission.'

     Such was Newton's theory. It accounts for some or all of the observed facts
but what causes the fits ? Newton, in the ' Opticks,' states that he does not inquire
he suggests, for those who wish to deal in hypotheses, that the rays of light
striking the bodies set up waves in the reflecting or reiracting substance which

move faster than the rays and overtake them. When a ray is in that part of a

--vibration which conspires with its motion it easily breaks through the refractino-

surface it is in a fit of easy transmission; and, conversely, when the motion of
the ray and the wave are opposed, it is in a fit of easy reflexion.

     But he was not always so cautious. At an earlier date (1675) he sent to

Oldenburg, for -the Royal Society, an ' Hypothesis explaining the Properties of

Light' ; and we find from the journal book that ' these observations so well pleased
the society that they ordered Mr. Oldenburg to desire Mr. Newton to permit them
to be published.' Newton agreed, but asked that publication should be deferred
till he had completed the account of some other experiments which ought to precede
those he had described. This he never did, and the hypothesis was tirst printed in
Birch's 'History of the Eoyal Society,' vol. iii., pp. 247, 262, 272, &c.; it is also
given in Brewster's ' Life of Newton,' vol. i., App. II., and in the ' Phil. Mao- '

September 1846, pp. 187-213.

      ' AVere I,' he writes in this paper, ' to assume an hypothesis, it should be this,
if propounded more generally, so as not to assume what light is further than that

it is something or other capable of exciting vibrations of the ether. First, it is to

be assumed that there is an ethereal medium, much of the same constitution with
air, but far rarer, subtiller, and more strongly elastic. ... In the second place, it is to

be supposed that the ether is a vibrating medium, like air, only the vibrations far
more swift and minute ; those of air made by a man's ordinaiy voice succeedino-

at more than half a foot or a foot distance, but those of ether at a less distance

than the hundred-thousandth part of an inch. And as in air the vibrations are

some larger than others but yet all equally swift, ... so I suppose the ethereal
vibrations diflPer in bigness but not in swiftness. ... In the fourth place, therefore,

I suppose that light is neither ether nor its vibrating motion, but something of a

difl'erent kind propagated from lucid bodies. They that wiU may suppose it an
aggregate of various peripatetic qualities. Others may suppose it multitudes of

unimaginable small and swift corpuscles of various sizes springing from shining

bodies at great distances one after the other, but yet ^^·ithout any sensible interval

of time. . . . To avoid dispute and make this hypothesis general, let every man here

take his fancy                                                        only, whatever light be, I would suppose it consists of success! ve rays

diflfering from one another in contingent circumstances, as bigness, force, or vigour,

like as the sands on the shore ; . . . and, further, I would suppose it diverse from

the vibrations of the ether. . . . Fifthly, it is to be supposed that light and ether

mutually act upon one another.' It is from this action that reflexion and refrac-

tion come about ; ' rethereal vibrations are therefore,' he continues, ' the best

means by which such a subtile agent as light can shake the gross particles of solid

bodies to heat them. And so, supposing that light impinging on a refracting or

                                                                                                  XX2

reflecting sethereal superficies puts it into a vibrating motion, that physical super-

ficies being by the perpetual appulse of rays always kept in a vibrating motion,
and the ether therein continually expanded and compressed by turns, if a ray of
light impinge on it when it is much compressed, I suppose it is then too dense and
stiif to let the ray through, and so reflects it ; but the rays that impinge on it at
other times, when it is either expanded by the interval between two vibrations or

not too much compressed and condensed, go through and are refracted. . . . And
now to explain colours. I suppose that as bodies excite sounds of various tones>
and consequently vibrations in the air of various bignesses, so when the rays o-f

light by impinging on the stiff refracting superficies excite vibrations in the ether,

these rays excite vibrations of v.arinus bignesses ; . . . therefore, the ends of the
capillamenta of the optic nerve which front or face the retina being such refract-

ing superficies, when the rays impinge on them they must there excite these vibra-
tions, which vibrations (like those of sound in a trumpet) will run along the

aqueous pores or crystalline pith of the capillamenta through the optic nerves
into the sensorium (which light itself cannot do), and there, I suppose, affect th*

--sense with various colours, according to their bigness and mixture the biggest

with the strongest colours, reds and yellows ; the least with the weakest, blue»
and violets ; the middle with green ; and a confusion of all with white.'

     The last idea, the relation of colour to the bigness of wave-length, is put even

--more plainly in the ' Opticks/ Query 13 (ed. 1704) : * Do not several sorts of rays

make vibrations of various bignesses, which according to their bignesses excite

sensations of various colours ; . . . and, particularly, do not the most refrangible-
rays excite the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet ; the least
refrangible the largest for making a sensation of deep red ? '

     The whole is but a development of a reply, written in 1672, to a criticism of

myHooke's on his first optical paper, in which Newton says : ' It is true that from

theory I argue the corporeity of light, but I do it without any absolute positiveness,
as the word perhaps intimates, and make it at most a very plausible consequence
of the doctrine and not a fundamental supposition.' ' Certainly,' he continues,

* my hypothesis has a much greater affinity with his own [Hooke's] than he seems

to be aware of, the vibrations of the ether being as useful and necessary in this as

in his.'

     Thus Newton, while in the ' Opticks ' he avoided declaring himself as to the-
mechanism by which the fits of easy reflexion and transmission were produced, has
in his earlier writings developed a theory practically identical in many respects with
modern views, though without saying that he accepted it. It was an hypothesis
one difficulty remained, it would not account for the rectilinear propagation, and it
must be rejected till it did.

      Light is neither ether nor its vibrating motion ; it is energy which, emitted from
luminous bodies, is carried by wave motion in rays, and falling on a reflecting
surface sets up fresh waves by which it is in part transmitted and in part reflected.

HeLight is not material, but Newton nowhere definitely asserts that it is.

' argues the corporeity of light, but without any absolute positiveness.' In the

' Principia,' writing of his particles, his words are : ' Harum attractionum baud
multum dissimiles sunt Lucis reflexiones et refractiones ; ' and the Scholium con-

cludes with : ' Igitur ob analogiam quae est inter propagationem radiorum lucis et
progressum corporum, visum est propositiones sequentes in usus opticos subjungere

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

interea de natura radiorum (utrum sint corpora necne) nihil omnino disputans,
sed trajectorias corporum trajectoriis radiorum persimiles solummodo determi-

nans.' '

     No doubt Newton's immediate successors interpreted his words as meaning that

he believed in the corpuscular theory, conceived, as Herschel says, by Newton, and

      ' The reflexions and refractions of light are not very unlike these attractions.
Therefore, because of the analogy which exists between the propagation of rays of
light and the motion of bodies, it seemed right to add the following propositions for
optical purposes, not at all with any view of discussing the nature of rays (whether
they are corporeal or not), but only to determine paths of particles which closely
resemble the paths of rays. Principia, lib. i., sect, xiv., prop. 96, Scholium.

called by his ilhistrioua name. Men learnt from the ' Principia ' how to deal with
the motion of small particles under definite forces. The laws of wave motion were
obscure, and till the days of Young and Fresnel there was no second Newton to

explain them. There is truth in Whewell's words (' Inductive Sciences,' ii., chap, x.)
' That propositions existed in the " Principia " which proceeded on this hypothesis

was with many ground enough for adopting the doctrine.' Young's view, already
quoted, appears to me more just; and I see in Newton's hypothesis the first clear

indication of the undulatory theory of light, the first statement of its fundamental

laws.

     Three years later (1678) Huygens wrote his ' Traits de la Lumiere,' published

in 1690. He failed to meet the main difficulty of the theory, but in other respects

he developed its consequences to a most remarkable degree. For more than a cen-
tury after this there was no progress, until in 1801 the principle of interference
was discovered by Young, and again independently a few years later by Fresnel,
whose genius triumphed over the difficulties to which his predecessors had succumbed,
and, by combining the principles of interference and transverse vibrations, established
^n undulatory theory as a fact, thus making Newton's theory a vera causa.

     There is, however, a great distinction between the emission theory as Newton
left it and Fresnel's undulatory theory. The former was dynamical, though it could

explain but little : the particles of light obeyed the laws of motion, like particles of

matter. The undulatory theory of Huygens and Fresnel was geometrical or kine-
matical : the structure of the ether was and is unknown ; all that was needed was
that light should be due to the rapid periodic changes of some vector property of a
medium capable of transmitting transverse waves. Fresnel, it is true, attempted to
give a dynamical account of double refraction, and of the reflexion and refraction
-of polarised light, but the attempt was a failure ; and not the least interesting part
of Mr. L. Fletcher's recent book on double refraction (' The Optical Indicatrix ') is
 that in which he shows that Fresnel himself in the first instance arrived at his
theory by purely geometrical reasoning, and only attempted at a later date to give
it its dynamical form. ' If we reflect,' says Stokes,^ ' on the state of the subject as
 Fresnel found it and as he left it, the wonder is, not that he failed to give a rigo-
rous dynamical theory, but that a single mind was capable of effecting so much,'
 Every student of optics should read Fresnel's great memoirs.

     But the time was coming when the attempt to construct a dynamical theory of

light could be made. Navier, in 1821, gave the first mathematical theory of elas-

ticity. He limited himself to isotropic bodies, and worked on Boscovitch's hypo-

tihesis as to the constitution of matter. Poisson followed on the same lines, and
 the next year (1822) Cauchy wrote his first memoir on elasticity. The phenomena
of light afforded a means of testing this theory of elasticity, and accordingly the

 first mechanical conception of the ether was that of Cauchy and Neumann, who

conceived it to consist of distinct hard particles acting upon one another with forces
 in the line joining them, which vary as some function of the distances between the

particles. It was now possible to work out a mechanical theory of light which

 should be a necessary consequence of these hypotheses. Cauchy's and the earlier

theories do not represent the facts either in an elastic solid or in the ether. At
ipresent we are not concerned with the cause of this ; we must recognise them as the
first attempts to explain on a mechanical basis the phenomena observed. According
to this theory in its final form, there are, in an isotropic medium, two waves which

Atravel -with velocities V'A/p and \/B/p, and B being constants and p the density.

 Adopting Cauchy's molecular hypothesis, there must be a definite relation between

A and B.
    A truer view of the theory of elasticity is given by Green in his paper read

 fcefore the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1837. This theory involves the two

Aconstants, but they are independent, and to account for certain optical effects must

·either vanish or be infinite. The first supposition was, until a few years since,
 thought to be inconsistent with stability ; the second leads to consequences which in
 part agree with the results of optical experiment, but which differ fatally from those

results on other points. And so the first attempt to construct a mechanical theory

Weof light failed.  have learnt much from it. At the death of Green the sub-

ject had advanced far beyond the point at which Fresnel left it. The causes of the

failure are known, and the directions in which to look for modifications have been

pointed out.

    Now I believe that the effort to throw any theory into mechanical form, to

conceive a model which is a concrete representation of the truth, to arrive at that

which underlies our mathematical equations wherever possible, is of immense

value to every student. Such a course, I am well aware, has its dangers. It may

he thought that we ascribe to the reality all the properties of the model, that, in
the case of the ether, we look upon it as a collection of gyrostatic molecules and

springs, or of pulleys and indiarubber bands, instead of viewing it from the standpoint

of Maxwell, who hoped, writing of his own model, ' that by such mechanical
fictions, anyone who vmderstands the provisional and temporary character of his

hypothesis will find himself helped rather than hindered in his search after the true

interpretation of the phenomena.' Professor Boltzmann, in his most interesting-

paper on ' The Methods of Theoretical Physics,' ^ has quoted these words, and has

expressed far more ably than I can hope to do the idea I wish to convey.

    The elastic solid theory, then, has failed ; but are we therefore without any
mechanical theory of light ? Are we again reduced to merely writing down our

equations, and calling some quantity which appears in them the amplitude of the

light vibration, and the square of that quantity the intensity of the light ? Or can

we take a further step ? Let us inquire what the properties of the ether must be

which will lead us by strict reasoning to those equations which we know represent

the laws of the propagation of light.

    These equations resemble in many respects those of an elastic solid ; let us,,
then, for a moment identify the displacement in a light-wave with an actual dis-

placement of a molecule of some medium having properties resembling that of a
solid. Then this medium must have rigidity or quasi-rigidity in order that it may

transmit transverse waves ; at the same time it must be incapable of transmitting

Anormal waves, and this involves the supposition that the quantity which appears

in Green's equations must vanish or be infinite. To suppose it infinite is to recur to

the incompressible solid  theory                                   we  will assume, therefore, that  it  is  zero.  Re-
                                                                ;

flexion and refraction show us that the ether in a transparent medium such as

glass diflers in properties from that in air. It may differ either (1) in density or

effective density,- or (2) in rigidity or efl'ective rigidity. The laws of double re-

fraction and the phenomena of the scattering of light by small particles show us that

the difierence is, in the main, in density or effective density ; the rigidity of the
ether does not greatly vary in different media. Dispersion, absorption, and ano-

malous dispersion all tell us that in some cases energy is absorbed from the light-

vibrations by the matter through which they pass, or, to be more general, by some-

thing very intimately connected with the matter.

   We do not know sufficient to say what that action must be ; we can, however,

try the consequences of various hypotheses. Guided by the analogy of the motion

of a solid in a fluid, let us assume that the action is proportional to the acceleration

of the ether particles relative to the matter, and, further, that imder certain circum-

stances some of the energy of the ether particles is transferred to the matter, thus

setting them in vibration. If such action be assumed, the actual density of the ether

may be the same in all media, the mathematical expression for the forces wiU lead
to the same equations as those we obtain by supposing that there is a variation of

density, and since it is clearly reasonable to suppose that this action between

matter and ether is, in a crystal, a function of the direction of vibration, the appa-
rent or effective density of the ether in such a body will depend on the direction of

displacement.

    Now these hypotheses will conduct us by strict mathematical reasoning to laws

for the propagation, reflexion and refraction, double refraction and polarisation,
dispersion, absorption, and anomalous dispersion and aberration of light which are

in complete accordance with the most accurate experiments.
     The rotatory polarisation of quartz, sugar, and other substances points to a more

complicated action between the ether and matter than is contemplated above ; and,
accordingly, other terms have to be introduced iuto the equations to account for
these eflects. It will be noted as a defect, and perhaps a fatal one, that the
connection between electricity and light is not hinted at, but I hope to return to

that point shortly.

     Such a medium as I have described is afforded us by the labile ether of Lord

Kelvin. It is an elastic solid or quasi-solid incapable of transmitting normal waves.

AThe quantity is zero, but Lord Kelvin has shown that the medium would

still be stable provided its boundaries are fixed, or, which comes to the same thing,
provided it extends to infinity. Such a medium would collapse if it were not

held fixed at its boundaries ; but if it be held fixed, and if then all points on any
closed spherical surface in the medium receive a small normal displacement, so that

the matter within the surface is compressed into a smaller volume, there will be

no tendency either to aid or to prevent this compression, the medium in its new

state will still be in equilibrium, the stresses in any portion of it which remains

unaltered in shape are independent of its volume, and are functions only of the

rigidity and, implicitly, of the forces which hold the boundary of the whole medium

fixed.

   A soap film affords in two dimensions an illustration of such a medium ; the

tension at any point of the film does not depend on the dimensions ; we may

--suppose the film altered in area in any way we please so long as it remains

--continuous without changing the tension. AVaves of displacement parallel to the

surface of the film would not be transmitted. But such a film in consequence of

its tension has an apparent rigidity for displacements normal to its surface : it can

transmit transverse waves with a velocity which depends on the tension. Now

the labile ether is a medium which has, in three dimensions, characteristics re-

sembling those of the two-dimensional film. Its fundamental property is that

the potential energy per unit volume, in an isotropic body, so far as it arises from

a given strain, is proportional to the square of the resultant twist. In an incom-

pressible elastic ether this potential energy depends upon the shearing strain.

-- --Given such a medium and there is nothing impossible in its conception the main
Wephenomena of light follow as a necessary consequence.
                                                                                                                                                         have a mechanical

theory by the aid of which we can explain the phenomena ; we can go a few steps

behind the symbols we use in our mathematical processes. Lord Kelvin, again,

has shown us how such a medium might be made up of molecules having rotation

in such a way that it could not be distinguished from an ordinary fluid in respect

to any irrotational motion                                                                                                    it would, however, resist  rotational movements with a
                                                                                                                           ;

force proportional to the twist, just the force required ; the medium has no real

rigidity, but only a quasi-rigidity conferred on it by its rotational motion. The
Weactual periodic displacements of such a medium may constitute light.
                                                                                                                                                         may

claim, then, with some confidence to have a mechanical theory of light.

But nowadays the ether has other functions to perform, and there is another

theory to consider, which at present holds the field. Maxwell's equations of the

electromagnetic field are practically identical with those of the quasi-labile ether.

The symbols which occur can have an electromagnetic meaning; we speak of

permeability and inductive capacity instead of rigidity and density, and take as

our variables the electric or magnetic displacements instead of the actual displace-

ment or the rotation.

Still such a theory is not mechanical. Electric force acts on matter charged

with electricity, and the ratio of the force to the charge can be measured in mecha-

Anical units.  fundamental conception in Maxwell's theory is electric displacement,
680 REPORT-- 1893.

and this is proportional to the electric force. Moreover, its convergence measures

the quantity of electricity present per unit volume; but we have no certain

mechanical conception of electric displacement or quantity of electricity, we

have no satisfactory mechanical theory of the electromagnetic field. The first

edition of the ' Electricity and Magnetism ' appeared twenty years ago. In it

Maxwell says : ' It must be carefully borne in mind that we have made only one

Westep in the theory of the action of the medium.  have supposed it to be in a

state of stress, but we have not in any way accounted for this stress or explained

how it is maintained. This step, however, appears to me to be an important one,

as it explains by the action of consecutive parts of the medium phenomena which

were foj'merly supposed to be explicable only by direcc action at a distance. I
have not been able to make the next step, namely, to account by mechanical con-

siderations for these stresses in the dielectric' And these words are true still.
    But, for all this, I think it may be useful to press the theory of the quasi- labile

ether as far as it will go, and endeavour to see what the consequences must be.
     The analogy between the equations of the electromagnetic field and those of

an elastic solid has been discussed by many writers. In a most interesting paper

on the theory of dimensions, read recently before the Physical Society, Mr. Williams

has called attention to the fact that two only of these analogies have throughout a

simple mechanical interpretation. These two have been developed at some length

by Mr. Heaviside in his paper in the ' Electrician ' for January 23, 1891. To one
of them Lord Kelvin had previously called attention (' Collected Papers,' vol. iii.

p. 450.)

    Starting with a quasi-labile ether, then, we may suppose that fi, the magnetic

permeability of the medium, is 47rp,' where p is the density, and that K, the in-

Bductive capacity, is l/4rrB, being the rigidity, or the quasi-rigidity conferred by

the rotation.

    The kinetic energy of such a medium is | p (i" + +fj'^ ^·), where ^, fj, f are the

components of the displacement. Let us identity this with the electromagnetic

energy (a^ + jS^ + y'^jSTr, a, ^, y being components of the magnetic force, so that
a = i, fi = fj,y = ^. Then the components of the electric displacement, assuming

them to be zero initially, are given by

               ' 47r \dy dz/'          '

®that is, the electric displacement multiplied by iw is equal to the rotation in

the medium. Denote this by Q.
     The potential energy due to the strain is

               i BQ^ or ^167r-B2)-,

Band on substituting for this becomes

which is Maxwell's expression for the electrostatic energy of the field.
     Thus so far, but no farther, the analogy is complete ; the kinetic energy of the

medium measures the magnetic energy, the potential energy measures the electro-
static energy. The stresses in the ether, however, are not those given by Max-

well's theory.

     la the other form of the analogy we are to take the inductive capacity as
47rp and the magnetic permeability as l/47rB. The velocity measiu-es the electric

force, and the rotation the magnetic force, so that electrostatic energy is kinetic,
and magnetic energy potential. Such an arrangement is not so easy to grasp as
the other. Optical experiments, however, show us that in all probability it is p,

lu either case we look upon the field as the seat of energy distributed per unit

of volume according to Maxwell's law. The total energy is obtained by integration

throughout the field.

    Now we can transform this integral by Green's theorem to a surface

integral over the boundary, together vdth a volume integral through the space

and the form of these integrals shows us that we may look upon the effects, dealing

for the present with electrostatics only, as due to the attractions and repulsions of

a certain imaginary matter distributed according to a definite law over the

boundary and throughout the space. To this imaginary matter, then, in the ordi-

nary theory we give the name of Electricity.
    An electrified conducting sphere, according to these analogies, is not a body

charged with a quantity of something called electricity, but a surface at which

there is a discontinuity in the rotation impressed upon the medium, or in the flow

across the surface ; for in the conductor a viscous resistance to the motion takes

the place of rigidity. No permanent strain can be set up.

From this standpoint we consider electrical force as one of the manifestations of

some action between ether and matter. There are certain means by which we can

strain the ether : the friction of two dissimilar materials, the chemical action in a

cell are two ; and when, adopting the first analogy, this straining is of such a nature
as to produce a rotational twist in the ether, the bodies round are said to be electri-

fied ; the energy of the system is that which wouJd arise from the presence over

their surfaces of attracting and repelling matter, attracting or repelling according

Weto the inverse square law.  falsely assign this energy to such attractions

instead of to the strains and stresses in the ether.

     Such a theory has many difficulties. It is far from being proved perhaps I
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

have erred in trespassing on your time with it in this crude form. The words of

the French sarrtw^, quoted by Poincar^, will apply to it: 'I can understand all

Maxwell except what he means by a charged body.' It is not, of course, the only

hypothesis which might be formed to explain the facts, perhaps not even the most

probable. For many points the vortex sponge theory is its superior. Still I feel

confident that in time we shall come to see that the phenomena of the electror
magnetic field may be represented by some such mechanism as has been outlined,

and that confidence must be my excuse for having ventured to call your attention

to the subject.

6. On the Period of Vibration of Electrical Disturbances upon the Earth.
        By Professor G. F. FitzGeeald, Sc.D., M.A., F.E.S., F.T.C.D.

     Professor J. J. Thomson and Mr. 0. Heaviside have calculated the period of
vibration on a sphere alone in space and found it about '059 second. The fact
that the upper regions of the atmosphere conduct makes it possible that there is a

period of vibration due to the vibrations similar to those on a sphere surrounded
by a concentric spherical shell. In calculating this case it is not necessary to con-
sider propagation in time for an approximate result, and it was pointed out that a
roughly approximate result could be obtained by equating the electric force at the
centre of the earth to a simply harmonic distribution of electricity on its sur-
face and on that of a concentric shell, to the electric force due to the rate of varia-
tion of the Vector potential of the electric currents calculated on the assumption of
a simply periodic variation of the electric distribution. It appears that the dis-
placement currents between the outer and inner shells are the only contributors to

the Vector potential. The value of the time of vibration obtained by this very

simple approximation is

                                      rp_ /2Kfumogalb

Applying this to the case of the earth with a conducting layer at a height of 100

kilometres (much higher than is probable) it appears that a period of vibration of

Aabout one second would be possible.  variation in the height of the conducting

layer produces only a small effect upon this if the height be small compared with

the diameter of the earth. In the case of the sun the period of vibration would

be about a hundred times as great. An approximate estimate was made as to the

electric density at the pole required to produce a horizontal force at the equator

equal to about the hundredth part of the earth's horizontal force, and it was found

to be eight electrostatic units per square centimetre. Anything very much greater

than this should produce a measurable reduction of barometric pressure. Atten-

tion was called to the desirability of having a sufficient number of magnetic

stations in a ring round the magnetic pole to be able to determine whether there

were simultaneous, easterly or westerly, waves of disturbance of horizontal force.

Such a simultaneous disturbance, of which there was some evidence from the pre-

sent sparsely distributed observatories, would mean that there was an earth current

which was running through the earth in such a way that it must be continued by

auroral discharges in the upper regions of the air.

            7. The Moon^s Atmosphere and the Kinetic Theory of Gases.

                                   By G. H. Brtan, M.A.

     [The possibility of applying the kinetic theory of gases to explain the absence

of any perceptible atmosphere round the Moon seems to have been contemplated

ever since the earliest days of the kinetic theory itself. Mr. S. Tolver Preston
claims to have been the first to suggest this explanation (' Nature,' Nov. 7, 1878) ;

but the idea was thought of long before then, for "Waterston, in his now well-
known paper on 'The Physics of Media' (' Phil. Trans. R.S.,' 1892 [A]), specially
considers the problem of the Moon's atmosphere. His investigation would, how-
ever, require all the molecules of a gas to have the same velocity, which we now
know to be incorrect, and it leads to the conclusion that the existence of a lunar

atmosphere would be possible at ordinary temperatures.]
     Now, according to the well-known 'error' law of distribution of velocity

among the molecules of a gas, there must always be some molecules moving with

sufficiently great speeds to overcome the attraction of any body, however powerful,
and some whose speed is too small to enable them to escape from the attraction of

any body, however feeble. On this assumption no planet would theoretically

have an absolutely permanent atmosphere. If, however, the proportion of mole-
cules which escape is relatively exceedingly small, the atmosphere of the planet

may be regarded as practically permanent. In order, therefore, to test the relative
                         TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.          683

degree of permanence of the atmospheres of different celestial bodies, the author has

calcidated what proportion of the molecules of oxygen and hydrogen at different

temperatures have a sufficiently great speed to fly off" from the surfaces of, and

never return to, the Moon, Mars, and the Earth. The corresponding results for the

Sun are also given, not, hovpever, at its surface, but at the Earth's distance from

V2the Sun's centre, where the critical speed is, of course,  x the speed of the

Earth's orbital motion.

     The numbers, which are given in Table I., p. 684, represent, in each case, the
average number of molecules, among which there is o>ie molecule whose speed

exceeds the critical amount. Thus, for oxygen at temperature 0° C. rather over

one molecule in every three billwn is moving fast enough to fly off" permanently

from the Moon, and only one in every 2'3 x 10^'-^ is moving fast enough to escape

from the Earth's atmosphere, while the Sun's attraction, even at the distance of

the Earth, prevents more than one in every 2 x 10^"''" from escaping.

    Now it is generally stated that at the Earth's surface there are somewhere

about 18 X 10'^ molecules in a cubic centimetre of air. If we suppose the Moon's

surface were invested with an atmosphere, say of oxygen, of this density, every

cubic centimetre would contain, roughly, about six million molecules moving with

suihcient speed to carry them away from the Moon. But the velocity requisite to

overcome the Earth's attraction would only be attained by one molecule in a

volume of 1'3 x ]0^'° cubic centimetres, that is, in a globe of radius about 2x10^'^

kilometres. In our Earth's atmosphere the acquisition of the requisite speed by

a single molecule would only occur once at rare intervals, and would probably be

far too rare to affect the permanency of the Earth's atmosphere, even during the

long periods of time through which we are wont to trace the history of the solar

system.

In the case of Mars the corresponding figure shows that an atmosphere con-

taining oxygen is practically permanent at all ordinary temperatures, but that

such an atmosphere could not remain on the planet if its temperature were as high

as 819° C.

If the Earth possessed an atmosphere of hydrogen at temperature 0° C, con-

taining 10'^ molecules per cubic centimetre, there would be one molecule in every

60 cubic centimetres whose velocity would be sufficient to carry it away perma-
nently. Remembering that the Earth at one time was much hotter than at

present, we see that the absence of hydrogen from the Earth's atmosphere (except

in the form of water) is easily accounted for. In the case of the Sun, a hydrogen

atmosphere would be permanent at 0° 0., even as far off as the Earth, as is shown

by the number 2-7 x 10^"'. At one-tenth of the Earth's distance from the Sun wo

should obtain the same number with an absolute temperature ten times as high,

Ai.e., 2730° absolute, or 2457° C, and so on.    considerably higher temperature

would, however, be consistent with peronanency. Thus the kinetic theory quite

explains the existence of hydrogen in the Sun's atmosphere at high temperatures.

    The present theory seems to preclude the possibility of the Moon ever having
had an atmosphere. If the Moon were formerly much hotter than at present the

proportion of gaseous molecules tending to ffy off" would be greater, and such a

loss would be exactly the reverse of the process which the nebular hypothesis

assumes to be taking place in the solar system.

But it would seem probable that this flying off of gaseous molecules is not an

essential condition in explaining the Moon's absence of atmosphere by means of the

kinetic theory. It is only necessary to assume the existence of a distribution of

matter of excessive tenuity pervading interplanetary space in order to account for

a gradual increase taking place in the atmospheres of all the planets, and such an

assumption, taken in conjunction with the kinetic theory, is quite compatible with

the absence of a,nj perceptible atmosphere surrounding the Moon, and of any per-

ceptible resistance to the motions of the Moon and planets.
     The kinetic theory enables us to compare the densities at different points of a

mass of gas in equilibrium under such fixed central forces as the attractions of

the celestial bodies. If we apply the theory to the system consisting of the Sim,
Moon, and Earth, we shall find the relative densities given in Table II., the density

of the corresponding gas in the atmosphere at the Earth's surface being taken as

unity. If we take the density at an infinite distance from the Sun to be unity, the

corresponding results will be given by Table III.

The assumption on which these results are calculated may be called an ' equi-

librium theory,' since it takes no account of the motions of the bodies in question,

and it assumes a permanent distribution to have been attained, so that the whole

of the gas is at a uniform temperature.

    when every allowance is made for the artificial character of the assumptions it
is still highly unreasonable to suppose that the Moon could have an atmosphere so

far in excess of that required by the equilibrium theory that its presence could be
detected even by the most careful observations ; and a very few molecules of

oxygen and nitrogen flying about in interstellar or interplanetary space would

represent a number far in excess of that required by the equilibrium theory, and
would therefore tend to augment the total mass of the Earth's atmosphere.

    If we try to compare the atmospheres of different planets, such as the Earth
and Mars, the ' equilibrium theory ' breaks down completely, as is only natural
when we remember how rarely a single molecule leaves the atmosphere of either

planet.

     It is diff'erent in the case of two bodies so near each other as the Earth and

Moon. Among the molecules of gas which at any time might find themselves in
the neighbourhood of the Moon and Earth the greater number would be drawn in
by the more attractive body, and the Moon would not, therefore, be likely to

obtain an atmosphere like that surrounding the Earth.

At no period has it possessed an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen com-
Aparable in density with that of the Earth.
                                                   decrease of density in a planet's-

atmosphere could only take place by the condensation in liquid form of vapours

present in it, not by matter leaving the planet.

     Thus the kinetic theory of gases is capable of accounting for absence of air
from the Moon without making any assumptions contradictory to the nebular

hypothesis.

      9. Simple Apparatus for Observing and Photographing Interference

             and Liffraction Phenomena. By W. B. Croft, M.A .

   A wooden screen ] 6 inches high and 9 inches broad has an opening at a height

of 10 inches which will take a spectroscope slit or a thin metal plate with a pin-
hole : a convex lens focusses sunlight or limelight on the small aperture ; a lamp,

however, gives sufficient light for the main effects without the finer detail. At

about 2 feet distance an a or b Huygens' microscope eyepiece is adjusted so that

its field is evenly covered with the light ; about 6 inches in front of this is the

--holder for the diffraction-objects a stiif-jointed arm about 3 inches long is a

convenient adjustment for height. Various things are fixed on 3-inch squares of
wood which have a central hole J inch square ; a slot in the middle of one side of
the wood goes over a screw at the end of the jointed arm ; a nut clamps it, but
allows movement in a vertical plane. The chief simple objects are : Single edge,
square corner, double edge, bi-prism, inclined mirrors, needle-eyes, needle-points,
needles of various thicknesses, needle with opaque slip on one side, needle with mica
slip on one side, perforated zinc, wire gauze, shot cemented on glass for Arago's
bright spot at the centre of the shadow of a circular screen, holes of gi-aduated sizes
in a metal plate.

     If the eyepiece is passed through a collar which will fix on the front of a
carnera in the place of the ordinary lens, an image is made on the groimd glass
which can be photographed. The rays emerge parallel and the image varies in
size, but remains in focus for all positions of the eyepiece and ground glass.

     In illustration of the two modes of observing these pheiiomtna the author drew
attention to an old set of diffraction objects, consisting of lilty-nine small geo-

metrical figures on glass. They were intended to be placed in front of a telescope
foeussed to a distant point of light, according to the plan of Fraunhofer and
Schwerd. The result is a system of radiating lines, which consist of spectral
images of the point of light ; but if the same are viewed as above with the eye-
piece alone, the extending spectra mostly disappear, and more elaborate and finely

defined central figures are formed.

10. Oil Wilsmi's Theory respecting the asserted foreshortening of the inner

       side of the Penumhrca of the Solar Spots ivhen near the Sun's Limh, and
       of the prohable thickness of the Photospherio and the Pemimhral Strata

      of the Solar Envelopes. By E,ev. Frederick Howlett.

     For a considerable portion of the period of upwards of thirty years, during
which the author of this paper has maintained a more or less continuous record of

--the solar spots during, be it noted, three full successive periods of the maximum,

minimum, and intei-mediate conditions of solar-spot activity, and including some

--thousands of careful and roughly micrometric observations one point has not a

little excited his surprise, viz., to have scarcely in anyone undoubted instance been
able to verify the observation first made by Dr. Wilson, Professor of Practical
Astronomy in the University of Glasgow, as long ago as the months of November

and December 1769, as well as on, he aflirms, many subsequent occasions.
     The phenomena in question which Wilson claims to have frequently seen is, in

brief, this, that if a spot, when well on the disk, has its penumbra equally dis-

tributed on all sides of the umbra, the effects of foreshortening on the sphere, in
consequence of the funnel-shaped nature of a spot, will be that whenever a spot is
near the limb the side of the penumbra nearest to the sun's centre will be extremely

foreshortened, and that when very near the limb, not only the whole of the inner
side of the penumbra, but the whole of the umbra itself, will become invisible, the

outermost side of the penumbra alone remaining in sight.

     Wilson tells us (as recorded in the ' Philosophical Transactions' for 1774) that

he effected his observations by direct vision, using a small, and he says an excellent,
Gregorian reflecting telescope of 26 inches focal length, with a magnifying power of

112 linear.

     The author's observations were made by projecting the sun's image on a large
-screen nearly 5 feet by 4 feet, using a small but excellent refractor by the elder
Dollond of 3" inches aperture with 46 inches focal length, with magnifying powers

of from 80 to 200 times linear.

    When using power 80, with the screen placed 4 feet 3 inches from the eyepiece,

the projected image of the sun has a diameter of 32 inches, so that, consequently,

each inch of the image is equivalent to just about 60" of celestial arc, and which
Ais the scale on which the author's drawings are usually made.
                                                                sort of micro-

meter, moreover, consisting of a small disk of glass ruled off into the two-hundredths

of an inch, is placed in the focus of the eyepiece, so that the divisions on the glass

disk are distinctly seen projected also on the screen, each exactly half an inch

apart.

    When a power of 200 linear is used the sun's image is seen 6 feet 4 inches in

diameter on the screen when placed at the same distance from the eyepiece as before
mentioned, and when each minute of arc thereon measures 2h inches, so that, in
fact, in such enlarged images seconds of arc can be readily measured by a pair of

--common dividers.

    Now as regards Wilson's observations with which the author professes him-

--self to be most strongly at issue, especially when spots of any considerable magni-

tude are concerned nothing could be stated in a more exact, cautious, and circum-

stantial manner. And it is, in all probability, in consequence of this that the

phenomena Wilson claims to have seen have been handed do-wTi as facts (without
their having been adequately verified or disproved) in almost all works on physical

astronomy to the present day.
     The author, however, had the honour of calling the special attention of astro-
                                                             TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION A.                                                                                         687

nomers to the point in question in a paper read before the Royal Astronomical
Society in June, 1886, soon after which Mr. Cowper Ranyard, the late Mr. Whipple

of the Kew Observatory, and the late Father Perry of Stonyhurst, expressed them-

selves in close agreement on the whole with the author, the two former emphati-
cally so ; as also, quite lately, has Father Sidgreaves, Durector of the last-mentioned

observatory.

   Professor Sporer, also, of Munich, in a copious resumS of his labours in con-

nection with the solar spots (read at Geneva in August, 1885) denies that the spots

possess the character of funnels (tonnoirs) so commonly attributed to them.

   Not, however, that the statements of Wilson at the time when they were brought

forward remained unchallenged. For not only did the Rev. Francis WoUaston

(father of the great chemist) demur to them, but the great mathematician and
observer De la Lande (as recorded in the French Academy ' Memoirs ' for 1776)

admitted tliat whilst some spots behaved as Wilson states, yet that the rule by no

means always held good. Wilson's spot, moreover, of November, 1769, had so large

a size as a length and breadth of one minute of arc, and he states that the effects

of foreshortening even in a spot of such extensive dimensions was to cause the
central umbra to completely disappear when about 24" from the limb, whilst the

side of the penumbra nearest the limb still continued to be eminently conspicuous,

which would necessitate, of course, a very large amount of depth and of shelvino-

indeed ! The                                     author      of  this  paper,  however,        can  only say                                                    that in repeated
                                              _

observations he has never found any of this asserted foreshortening, nor con-

sequent apparent relative displacement of the umbra, when spots of the above-

mentioned size have been no more than 20", 15", or even 5" from the limb. The

author does not wish to affirm that no measure whatever of the foreshortening

ever occurs, but he emphatically affirms that where it does it is only in the ver'i/

slightest degree, though it necessarily is somewhat more apparent in very small

spots.

   All these appearances can be readily exhibited on a globe of a foot or so in

diameter, in which depressions have been worked of various sizes and various

depths                                   and  from  which        it  will  at  once  be  seen  how  very  shallow                                                    must be the
                                      ;

spots which admit of the umbra remaining apparently central in the midst of the

penumbra, when so near the limb as has just been mentioned.

   Such, then, is the experience of the author of this paper, who also would wish

to state that in the present year he requested leave (and was most courteously

permitted) to corapare his hand-drawings of the sun for the last ten years em-

--bracing two maximum and one minimum period of solar spot activitv with the
photographic                                                 the Royal
                                                 record  at                Observatory at      Greenwich                                                        and  when,  as  far
                                                                                                                                                             ;

as could be perceived by means of a magnifying lens, his contention was found to

hold good in every instance in which the concurrent dates of observation admitted

of such a comparison, as was allowed by both Mr. Hollist and another junior mem-
ber of the assistants, who aided in the investigation.

     The appearance of a spot may, occasionally, seem to militate against the author's
views, and strongly to favour Wilson's, but, as Mr. Turner, chief assistant at

Greenwich, wrote him lately, ' the history of a spot needs studying.' And this is

very essential, because, on various occasions, a spot which when near the limb
seemed to favour Wilson was found not to do so when further from the limb, when
it was plainly evident that the umbra was not central.

     The results, finally, of the author's protracted observations and measurements
lead him to the conclusion that both the photospheric and also penumbral envelopes
of the sun are comparatively extremely shallow, and that the photosphere consists

of one layer only of the so-called ' rice-grain ' entities, lying in close contiguity to
the_ subjacent penumbra, and at most not more than the ^J^th part of the sun's
radius, or, say, about one thousand miles in thickness, and that the penumbral

stratiun is but little, if any, thicker ; otherwise the umbra could not remain jilainly
central within the penumbra (as it almost always does) when the latter is no more
than ten, or even five, seconds from the sun's limb.

     The author reported progress in his experiments to examine into the connection
between ether and matter, and concludes that at least unless matter is electrified
there is no stress-connection between these two bodies of a kind to interfere with

their relative motion.

   --From this he draws several conclusions, one of which is that radiation is due to

                         By R. T. Glazebrook, M.A., F.B.S.

     In the figure A, B, C represent a series of particles, each of mass w, connected
together by strings of length a. The particles can vibrate on the plane of the
paper, and a wave of simple harmonic vibration will travel along them with

definite velocity. The tension in the string is F. Each particle is connected as

shown by two springs to two masses A,, A^ ; Bj, B^,, &c., respectively, the masses

of these particles being M. This second series of particles is connected by springs

to the sides of the frame. The period of vibration of one of the particles, such

as A, when the string joining it to the particles on either side is cut and the

masses Aj, Aj are held fixed, is t^ ; the period of vibration of a particle such as

Aj under the action of the spring joining it to the frame alone is Tg. The string

joining the particles A, B, C is continued, and carries a series of particles each of

mass wjo unconnected to any springs. Suppose a wave of period T to be travelling
Awith velocity Vg along this string; on reaching the particle

4. Note on Professor Eiert's Estimate of the Radiating Foiver of an Atom,
        luitli Bern arks on Vibrating Systems giving Special Series of Over tunes
        like those Given Out hj some Molecules. Bij Professoi- G. F. FiTZ-
        Gerald, M.A., F.B.S.

Attention was drawn to Professor Ebert's paper in ' AViedemann's Annalen

for 1893, in which he estimated that the energy radiated by a sodium atom as deter-
mined by Professor E. Wiedemann was approximately the same as tliat calculated

from Hertz's equation for the radiation from one of his oscillators, if the oscillator

he supposed of the diameter of the atom and electrical charge be the ionic charge

and the time of vibration the period of the sodium line.

     It was pointed out that the period of vibration of a simple oscillator of the size
of an atom would be very many times more frequent than that of the sodium line,
and that as the energy radiation increases inversely as tbe cube of the wave-length

it follows that the radiation of a simple Hertzian oscillator of tbe size of an atom
might be many thousands of times as great as what Wiedemann has found to be tbe

radiating power of a sodium atom. It follows that sodium atoms must be complex

Hertzian oscillators if they are Hertzian oscillators at all, and if they be complex

ones their radiating power might be either greater or less than that of a Hertzian
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

so that Professor Ebert's calculation only shows that if an atom be a Hertzian
oscillator its radiating power is approximately what he has calculated. It was ex-

plained that the fact that the vibration-frequencies of molecules were within the

r^nge of frequencies that might be expected if the molecules are systems of the size

they are known to be, and of a rigidity about that of ordinary rigid bodies, made
it appear that the rigidity of hard bodies may be principally the rigidity of the

molpcu^es.of.which they are composed. The fact that crystalline structure is gene-

i'ally attributed to a peculiarity in the shapes of the molecules, and that deforma-

tion confers a crystalline structure on solids, tends to the conclusion that the

molecules are deformed by strain. It is otherwise not easy to see why the liglit-

frequencies are so nearly those that might be expected from rigid bodies of the size

of tbe molecules.

In connection with the question of the vibrations of molecules, it is to be

observed that vibrating systems in which tbe motion can be very simply specified

may produce extremely complex systems of lines, as is evident to anybody who has

Atried to express an algebraic function in a Fourier series.      finite series of

discrete lines may be produced by supposing a finite vibrator to divide itself into

loops and nodes. If the vibrator be of such a structure that, as in an air column,

the velocity of propagation of a wave is independent of the wave-length, then tbe

system of overtones will be a system of harmonics. But if the velocity of propa-

gation be any other function oi the wave-length, say V =/(X), then it is easy to see

1893.                                                                      TY

An example of a system with a remarkable reiation between the velocity of pro-

pagation and the wave-length is the case of a system of magnets with their poles
close to one another when disturbed to an amount small compared with the
distance apart of the poles. In this case the force of restitution is proportional to
the sum of the angular displacements of contiguous magnets, and it appears that
the velocity of propagation of a disturbance is given by

when X is the wave-length of the disturbance. This case is interesting in connec-

tion with Professor Ewing's theory of the nature of magnets, and it follows that
the rate of progression that might be expected of this kind of disturbance in
a real magnet would be extremely slow unless the period of vibration approxi-
mated to lO'' per second. The rate of propagation of energy into the system is,

however, very much more rapid, and might be about 200 to 300 centimetres per

eecond. In a finite system of such magnets the system of overtones is given by

                                   N = 2NoCos^^,

                                                                                                            Ij

which is evidently represented by a series of lines coming up to an edge which is
so characteristic of many spectra.

     Vibrating linear systems having any desired relation out of a very great
number of different relations connecting the velocity of propagation of a wave and

the wave-length may be constructed by connecting a system of equidistant wheels

by means of indiarubber bands or elastic friction wheels, the latter case being some-

what similar to the case of the magnets already considered. By connecting the
wheels each with its next neighbour we get the simplest system. If to this be

superposed a system of connection of each with its next neighbour but one, and
then each with its next neighbour but two, and so on, complex systems with very
various relations between wave-length and velocity can be constructed depending
on the relative strengths of the bands employed. These systems would be some-
what analogous to systems of particles connected by laws of force varying in a

complex way with the distance apart of the particles. In the case of the bands,

&c., the general form of the relation between the velocity and wave-length is

X' °      X'  X

which can be varied in a very great number of ways by a proper choice of /;,, A;,, &c.
    It was pointed out how a model such as that described by Mr. Glazebrook for

illustrating anomalous dispersion could be modified so as to produce almost any

desired system of overtones.

be the equation of the surface, the problem of reflection is readily solved so

^long as in (1) is small relatively to k or Stt/X ; that is, so long as the wave-

length of the corrugation is large in comparison with that of the vibrations. The
solution assumes a specially simple form when the second medium is impenetrable,
so that the whole energy is thrown back either in the perpendicularly reflected

--wave or in the lateral spectra. Of this two cases are notable : (a) when in the
--application to sound the second medium is gaseous and devoid of inertia, as in

the theory of the ' open ends ' of organ-pipes. The amplitude A,, of the perpen-
dicularly reflected wave, so far as' the fourth power of pjk inclusive, is then
given by

in which there is no limitation upon the value of kc, so that the corrugation

--may be as deep as we please in relation to X. If p be very small, the result

viz., -J^, (2Ae) is the same as would be obtained by the methods usual in

Optics                            and it appears  that these methods  cease to be available  when p cannot be

     If p, instead of being relatively small, exceeds k in magnitude, there are no

lateral spectra in the reflected vibrations ; and if the second medium is impene-

trable, the regular reflection is necessarily total. It thus appears that an

extremely rough wall reflects sounds of medium pitch as well as if it were mathe-

matically smooth.

    The question arises whether, when the second medium is not impenetrable, the
regular reflection from a rough wall {p>k) is the same as if c = 0. Eeasons are

given for concluding that the answer should be in the negative.

                                  7. On a Piezo-electric Pile. By Lord Kelvin, Pres.E.S.

The application of pressure to a voltaic pile, dry or wet, has been suggested as

an illustration of the piezo-electric properties of crystals, but no very satisfactory

resultshave hitherto been obtained, whether by experiment or by theoretical con-

siderations, so far as I know. Whatever effects of pressure have been observed

have depended upon complex actions on the moist, or semi-moist, substances be-

tween the metals and electrolytic or semi-electrolytic and semi-metallic conduct-

ances of the substances. Clearing away everything but air from between the

opposed metallic surfaces of different quality, I have made the piezo-electric pile

which accompanies this communication. It consists of twenty-four double plates,

each 8 centimetres square, of zinc and copper soldered together, zinc on one side

and copper on the other. Half a square centimetre is cut from each comer of each

zinc plate, so that the copper square is left uncovered by the zinc at each of its

four corners. Thus each plate presents on one side an uninterrupted copper sur-

face, and on the other side a zinc surface, except the four uncovered half square
Acentimetres of copper.
                                                  pile of these plates is made, resting one over the other

on four small pieces of indiarubber at the four copper corners. The air-space

between the opposed zinc and copper surfaces may be of any thickness from half a

millimetre to 3 or 4 millimetres. Care must be taken that there are no minute

shreds of fibre or dust bridging the air-space. In this respect so small an air-space

as half a millimetre gives trouble, but with 3 or 4 millimetres no trouble is found.

     The lowest and uppermost plates are connected by fine wires to the two pairs of

quadrants of my quadrant electrometer, and it is generally convenient to allow the

lowest to lie uninsulated on an ordinary table and to connect it metallically with

the outer case of the electrometer.

To make an experiment, (1) connect the two fine wires metallically, and let

the electrometer needle settle to its metallic zero.

(2) Break the connection between the two tine wires, and let a weight of a

few decigrammes or kilogrammes fall from a height of a few millimetres above the

Aupper plate and rest on this plate.  startlingly great deflection of the electrometer

needle is produced. The insulation of the indiarubber supports and of the quad-

rants in the electrometer ought to be so good as to allow the needle to come to

rest, and the steady deflection to be observed, before there is any considerable loss.

If, for example, the plates are placed with their zinc faces up, the application of

the weight causes positive electricity to come from the lower face of the upper-

most plate, and to deposit itself over the upper surface of plate and weight, and on

the electrode and pair of quadrants connected with it.

8. Electrical Interference Phenomena someivJiat Analogous to Newton^s Rings,

       hut exhibited hj Waves in Wires. By Edwin H. Barton, B.Sc.

Ilerr von Geitler, > while experimenting in 1892 with electrical waves passing

along a pair of long parallel wires, noticed the following phenomena :

if the wires at any part of their length ware either
     (1) replaced by others thicker or thinner than the normal wires, as shown
               at A, fig. 1, or

(2) arranged nearer together or farther apart than their normal distauce, as

Bshown at   and C, fig. 1, then, in any of these cases, a partial

reflection of the electrical waves occurred at such place of change in

the wires.

--Fig. 1. Arrangements which produce partial reflection.

    Von Geitler then made further observations of what occurred when a con-

denser was attached at a sinr/le point of each wire, as at D, fig. 1, but did not qucaiti-
taticely examine the reflections of the waves produced by the changes first named.
This I commenced to do, as it seemed interesting to ascertain if theory and experi-

ment agreed quantitatively. Now it is easy to see that with a finite length ot the

altered or abnormal part of the wires we should have not a single reflection merely,

but trvo places at which reflections would occur, namely, the beginning and the end
of this abnormal part. I thus anticipated that interference phenomena would
·occur, and that if the length of the abnormal part were gradually increased, the
intensity of the transmitted waves would periodically increase and" decrease.

     The best arrangement which I have obtained for observing these interference
effects is that diagramatically shown in fig. 2.

     The needle of the electrometer is uncharged, and therefore turns in the same

Edirection whether or E' is positive, and is thus able to give a deflection undis-

turbed by the high frequency used, viz., about 33 million per second.
     Although the interference phenomena under consideration care essentially

analogous to those of light in thin plates, yet the mathematical theory of the
latter will not suffice for our case. Because in the optical phenomena the ampli-

tude of the incident light may be assumed constant, whereas in the electrical

analogue the primary oscillator emits waves each of which is feebler than its

predecessor. It thus induces in the long wires a continually diminishing series of

waves which advance along the wires in the form of a damped train with its large

end leading.
     I have already published an elementary mathematical theory^ dealing with

the interference phenomena of such a wave train. The results of this theory when

graphically exhibited, the lengths of the abnormal part being abscissje, and the
intensities of the transmitted waves being ordiuates, yield a damped wavy curve.

the curve shown by T, fig. 4. It is thus seen that the lengths of the abnormal
parts which give maxima and minima are the same as in the corresponding optical
phenomena, but that the values of these maxima and minima, instead of being
respectively equal, as in optics, form a damped series fading away to a common

steady value.

     These interference phenomena may, of course, be experimentally obtained by
any of the changes in the wires which produce reflection. But the most striking
method which 1 have found is that of hanging sheets of tin foil upon the con-
ducting wires so as to form the abnormal part, as shown in fig. 3. The sheets of
tin foil were 32 cm. deep, the cross-pieces used for separating the wires and sheets
were of wood.

     The beginning of the abnormal part thus formed reflected a wave whose ampli-
tude is of the order 0'8 of that incident upon it. With this arrangement upwards
of 200 electrometer readings were taken, the final result of which is shown by the

Eupper curve marked in fig. 4, the lengths of the abnormal parts being abscissae

and the intensities of the transmitted waves ordinates. It is noticeable that in
tig. 4 the theoretical curve lies wholly below the experimental one. The dis-

     This research was begun by the author with a view to try and definitely
answer the question whether electrolytes possess for rapid electric oscillations the
same resistance as for steady currents. Some attempts were first made to directly
improve the procedure used in 1889 by Prof. J. J. Thomson,- but the results were
unsatisfactory, and the following method, by which it was hoped absolute measure-
ments might be obtained, was finally adopted :

Aof long copper wires spanned 6 centimetres apart.  short length of these wires

was then immersed in an electrolyte, and the intensities of the transmitted wave

trains for several different thicknesses of the electrolyte layer compared by an

electrometer. If the altered intensity of the wave train were due solely to absorp-

tion in the conducting layer, it would be easy from such data to calculate the

conductivity of the solution.

The matter proved, however, to be not so simple. The transmitted intensity

did not regularly decrease, but varied periodically. The effect was obviously

analogous to, or rather identical with, the interference phenomena of thin plates.

The transmitted ray is a minimum for a plate a quarter wave-length thick, a
maximum for a plate a half wave-length thick, &c.

Owing to this, and a further experimental complication arising from the

multiple reflection of waves between every pair of reflecting points on the circuit,

the method became too complex to permit of calculating the conductivity of the

solution, but the phenomenon retained sufficient intrinsic interest to warrant more

complete investigation. Curves showing the transmitted intensity as the thickness

of the layer was increased were determined for water, dilute solutions of zinc

sulphate, 95 per cent, alcohol, and a mixture of alcohol and water. In all cases

the first maximum is very well marked. As this first maximum gives us the half

     The figures for water and alcohol, though rather low, agree approximately
with those found by previous investigators ; and the experiments with zinc sulphate
solutions confirm Cohu's result,' that an addition of salt which largely affects the

conductivity of a solution only slightly increases its dielectric constant.

    An attempt was finally made to determine the constants of common salt and

of soda crystals, but owing to the disturbance of the multiple reflections noted
above scarcely any interference effects were noticeable. This shows, however, that
the constants for these materials approximate more to normal values than the very
high figures found for water and alcohol.

     10. On a Familiar Type of Caustic Curves. By J. Laemoe, F.B.S.

     The illustration of the formation of caustics by the reflection of the light of the
sun or other point-source from a band of polished metal is in everyday use. But
it seems worth while to call attention to the fact that obliquity of the incidence on
a cylindrical reflector does not vitiate the experiment as an exact representation of
the geometrical caustic. The bright caustic surface formed by reflection from a
cylinder is, in fact, always itself cylindrical ; and the caustic curve depicted on any
screen placed across it is merely the section of this cylinder formed by the screen.

Although, once this proposition is propounded, its reason is plain, yet it does not
seem to have occurred to any of the writers on optics.

     It may be shown, also, that when the reflector is a piece of a conical surface

--the caustic surface is always a conical surface with the same vertex thus suggest-

ing an extension of the theory of actual caustics into spherical geometry, or rather
realising in actuality the analogous theory in spherical geometry. More generally,

when tlie reflector is such as may be bent flat without stretching, i.e., when it is a

piece of a developable surface, the caustic surface is one of the same kind, and a

geometrical corjelation may be established between them.

3. On a Spherical Vortex. By M. J. M. Hill, M.A., D.Sc, Professor of

                          Mathematics at University College, London.

     In a paper by the author published in the ' Philosophical Transactions of the
Eoyal Society' in 1884, on the Motion of Fluid, part of which is moving'
rotationally and part irrotationally, a certain case of motion symmetrical with
regard to an axis was noticed.

     Takiog the axis of symmetry as the axis of z, and the distance of any point
from it as r, it was shown that the surfaces

                               -ar"' {z-Zy- + b (_!·· ^c^)"- = const.,

where «, b, c are fixed constants, Z any arbitrary function of the time, contain
always the same particles of fluid in a possible case of motion.

      If the constant be less than j6c^ these surfaces are rings.

     The autlior has not succeeded in determining an irrotational motion on one
side of any of these surfaces continuous with the rotational motion on the other side,
except in the particular case in which b = a, and the constant on the right-hand
side = ^bcK

     The object of this paper is to discuss this case.

     In it tlie surface containing the same particles of fluid breaks up into the

evanescent cylinder

                                                         r= = 0,
and the sphere

                                                 7-''+{z-Zy- = c\

     The molecular rotation is given by Soj = 10«r, so that the molecular rotation
along the axis vanishes, and therefore the vortex sphere stiU possesses the character

of a vortex ring.

     The irrotational motion outside a spliere moving in a straight line is known,
and it is shown in this paper that it will be continuous with the rotational motion

inside the sphere provided a certain relation be satisfied.

    This relation may be expressed thus :

      The cyclic constant of the sj}herical vortex is Jive times the product of the 7-adius
of the sphere and the uniform velocity with which the vortex sphere moves along its

axis.

     The analytic expression of the same relation is

This makes      4ac- = 3i.
            2co = 15Z?V(2c^).

     All the particulars of the motion are placed together in the following table.
     The notation employed is as follows :

     If the velocity parallel to the axis of r be r, and the velocity parallel to the
axis of s be w, then the molecular rotation is given by

                            By A. W. RtJCKER, F.B.S.

     The formulae were found which express the shielding of two concentric perme-
able spherical shells, and several special cases were discussed. The result was
reached that if the smallest and largest radii and the volume of the permeable

matter are given, the shielding is a maximum for a given portion of the empty-
shell. If the magnetic field is produced by a small magnet placed at the common

centre of the shells, if the empty space is small and the matter highly permeable,
the best position is that in which the volume enclosed by the 'crack' is the
harmonic mean of the volumes included by the outermost and innermost surface.

5. On the Equations for Calculating the Shielding of a Long Iron Tube

   Attention was called to the desirability of having the integrals of the form

6. On the Equations for Calculating the Effect of a Hertzian Oscillator
    on Points in its Neighbourhood. By Professor G. F. FitzGerald,

     M.A., F.B.S.

Attention was recalled to the error made by Maxwell when he assumes that for

variable electrification it is legitimate to assume =that A-\//- at points of space

where there was no electrification. The true expression is =A^\//- Kfi . yjr. The
                             --=^rcos u d}L
evaluation of the integrals                  was also advocated in order to facilitate

                             J s/P' + u-

the calculation of the efiects of a linear Hertzian vibrator on points in its neigh-

bourhood, The elliptic motion of the electric force in the neighbourhood of such

an oscillator follows at once from the fact that the vector potential is parallel to

Athe oscillator, and may be taken as = t'F. From this we get that the magnetic

Hforce is = VaA, and thence the electric force 2 = VaH.

     If the vibration on the oscillator be simply periodic it is easy to see that the

form of E is

                             E=EiCos?!L* + E, sin%^,

                                                   Tr

where Ei and E, are two vectors, so that E is the vector of an ellipse.

     In determining the period of vibration of an oscillator the difficulty arises that
the energy is being dissipated by radiation, and that some impressed forces must
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  699

be exerted on the oscillator to keep the vibration simply periodic, and if the im-
pressed force be of a proper period any period of vibration is possible. To solve
the problem a system of equal incoming waves is superposed on the outgoing ones,
and then the simply periodic vibration is possible without any impressed force, and

this condition then gives the free period of vibration.

   A number, N, of which the ?« digits on the right hand are the same as the vi

digits on the right hand of its nth power (N°), when both are expressed in the
scale whose radix is r, is styled an Ageeeable Ntjmbek of the m.th order and nth

mdegree in the i-ary scale. When the agreement of N, a number of digits, with
m Nits nth power, extends throughout its digits, the number is styled a Complete

Agreeable Number. The analytical condition is

     The properties of these numbers are investigated in a quite general manner
applicable to any scale of radix ;· ; and simple rules for their computation given.
These rules are completely reduced for the denary scale to their simplest form,
and the auxiliary quantities are tabulated. Computations of complete agreeable
numbers are given in detail for the denary scale. Tables are given of all agreeable

--numbers to the fifth order, and in some cases to the tenth order.
     Example. The numbers, N, of ten digits (shown in table below), and also
the numbers of fewer digits obtainable therefrom by erasing one or more of the
extreme left-hand digits of N, are complete agreeahles in all the degrees n stated
in column n; and are, moreover, the only complete agreeahles (often digits, or less,
ending in 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) in all those degrees, except when n has the critical forms
named in column n', in which case there are a number of complete agreeahles
(increasing rapidly with the value of n' and with the number of digits of N).

          3. Apparatus for Class-ioorh in Elementary Practical Physics.

                        By Professor Gr. Carey Foster, F.B.S.

     The author described and exhibited samples of simple apparatus which he had
devised for the purpose of practical instruction in physics. The object aimed at
was to devise arrangements by which the chief quantitative laws of physics could
be verified with fair accuracy, and which should at the same time be so inexpensive
that they could be multiplied at a small cost, so that all the members of a class
could make the same experiments at one time. In addition to the mere saving of
expense, it was maintained that the simplification of apparatus, so long as it was
efficient for its purpose, had the positive advantage of bringing students into more
direct contact with the phenomena to be studied than was the case with more
elaborate and complicated appliances.

         4. On Physics Teaching in Schools.^ By W. B. Croft, M.A.

      It must be remembered that there are several classes of students:

     1. Those who aim at scientific or technical careers, but are compelled to make

their education as brief as possible.

    2. Those to whom science is the best education,
     3. Those who may aspire to be mathematical physicists, and can afford to enjoy

the benefit of wide and varied education.
     4. The great majority receiving at our schools the usual general training in

preparation for various professions. None of these should be without the benefits

of science.

     Of the first two classes I have not the experience to speak. The latter two

appear to me to be well provided for under one scheme. Soon after the Duke of
Devonshire's commission twenty years ago action was taken by the new governing
bodies of public schools to make effective the recommendations of the British
Association in 1867. At Winchester teacher.s and suitable apparatus were pro-

vided for the following scheme:
     If a boy were to pass up the school between the ages of twelve and nineteen, he

would learn

      first year : Geometrical drawing, botany, physical geography.
     Second year : Simple mechanics and graphics, hydrostatics, heat.
     Third year : Chemistry.
     Fourth year : Chemistry.
      Fifth year : Geology.
      Sixth year : Electricity.
     Seventh year : Acoustics, geometrical and physical optics.

    Two hours per week, with one or two hours out of school work.

     Biology purposely has no place. It is better to be able to engage the interests
of boys in it without reference to their age or position in the school. This is
excellently done by a Natural History Society.

     The general nature of teaching in the sixth and seventh years consists of
experimental demonstrations of phenomena over as wide a range as possible. Boys
who survive in a school to this stage are usually capable of appreciating scientific
ideas through lectures, but in a public school they are seldom able to give time for
practical work done by themselves. Those who may afterwards be thorough
physicists had better be much occupied at this age with mathematics. .So far as

possible they should avail themselves of the opportunities which most schools give
for learning drawing, carpentering, and photography.

     There is a significance in tlie order of subjects as arranged above. Experience
shows that the subjects are suited to the various ages.

5. Notes on Science Teachivg in Fiiblic Schools. By A. E. Hawkins, B.Sc.

The following 'items' represent convictions formed after twenty-two years'

experience, the greater part of which (fifteen years) have been spent in the Bedford

Modern School of about 600 boys.

I. The subject must be taught experimentally. The author has known splendid

examinational results obtained without a single experiment having been performed

by either teacher or taught.

In the bauds of an experienced and vivacious teacher it is astonishing what

mere drawings on the blackboard can accomplish for examinational purposes,

disastrous, however, to real science.

Experiments involve the expenditure of much time ; very frequently one is

enough for a lesson e.ff., determination of a specific heat or the resistance of a

wire. If it is asked how an examination can be passed when time is so short, the

answer is ' Teach, and let the examination take care of itself.' Where real teach-

ing exists a pupil, worthy of the name, will soon find ways and means of getting

up collateral matter.

But an experiment is not everything. It must be led up to. It must be

preceded by discussion, and questions and answers should follow.

     The couversational method is very difficult, especially with classes of thirty or
more. Only one or two points can be made in a three-quarters of an hour lesson,
and the matter must be clearly summed up at the end. The other quarter of an

hour should be spent in writing an answer to a good comprehensive question. The

answers should be marked and returned at the beginning of the next lesson.

II. But this is only half the work ; experiments must now be done by the boys

themselves. But practical work means plenty of apparatus, which in the majority

of cases is not expensive. For a class of thirty boys ten sets at least will be re-

quired, which will allow three boys to work together. It is, however, much better

if they can be arranged in pairs.

The boys, having done their experiments, should take their rough results home,

and bring to the next lesson a clean copy and a detailed account of the method,

with a drawing where desirable.

III. The work required of a pupil must frequently be, as far as he is concerned,
Aoriginal.
            class, long accustomed to mere reproduction of the teacher's words and

ideas, will feel unwonted life and delight if requested to devise some improvement

upon a method just used, or to say what they would expect to happen if some

modification were made. This is one of the surest ways of engendering an

intelligent interest in the subject taught.

    IV. What science should be tauglit ? Heat and magnetism are the two best

where expense is a primary consideration, and it is desired to get to work at once.
Electricity should come afterwards, as so much of the subject, even in the simplest

experiments, requires explanations which must be based on theory.

V. The teacher must have time allowed him to prepare the apparatus. Like

other masters he has to prepare his lectures and also to correct exercises, but

besides the preparation he has frequently to manufacture apparatus. This requires

an expenditure of time which is, unfortunately, sometimes imrecognised.

                                     By F. H. Nalder.

     The instrument shown fulfils the purpose of commutating the resistances to be
compared with respect to the ratio resistance coils and a series of bridge wires, to
be used according to the value of the coils under comparison. It consists of
copper bars mounted on an ebonite base, and furnished with mercury cups for
making the necessary contacts.

   AAt Aj and B Bj are the cups for the ratio coils, which are wound upon one

bobbin and usually of the value of 1", 10", 100"', and 1,000TM on each side. At
I Ij and J Jj are placed the resistances whose difference is to be measured, and at

G is the slide wire mounted on a detachable frame, with the key M, which runs on
the divided rod L for making contact,

    RIn order to commutate the coils and X, the ebonite plate upon which the
Dconnections C E F are mounted is drawn up against the spring which presses the

contacts into their respective cups, until the guide pin is lifted out of its recess. The
plate can then be turned through 180° till the contacts are in the position shown

Mby the dotted lines marked CjDjEjFj ; the galvanometer is then brought to zero

by moving the contact key into another position on its wire.

   KThe battery connections are shown at K, and those of the galvanometer

at MO.

      In order to obtain a wide range of measurement, instead of using a lono- wire a
number of short bridge wires are provided, usually about ten, though if necessary
this number need not be considered the limit.

     The plate upon which each wire is mounted is detachable, as already stated and

Nin addition to the milled head two steady pins are fixed in the base' of the com-

mutator so that it or any of the series can always be replaced accurately in posi-
tion with respect to the scale and key.

   A considerable variation of resistance of the short bridge wires shown will not

vitiate the accuracy of the measurement.

    This apparatus has been in use for the last five years substantially as now

shown.

                 4. Note on a Galvanometer suited to Physiological Use.

                By Dr. Oliver Lodge, F.B.S., and T. H. Nalder.

      Physiologists require galvanometers for exhibiting very small transient currents,

but they seem often to use highly damped galvanometers for the purpose.
      The first-named author, after some experiences with Professor Gotch, concluded

that a more suitable galvanometer could be designed, and accordingly sent a sketch

to Messrs. Nalder Brothers, who have carried it out.

     The main points are :

     1. Extreme lightness and small moment of inertia of needle.

      2. Great intensity of magnetisation.

     3. Wire brought very close to the needle, so as to give a strong field without
excessive resistance, and to have many smaU coils in preference to few big ones.

     4. To avoid damping and to secure a long period by delicate suspension film
rather than by heavy needle.

     5. To use either a bee sting or some other sharp point in field of microscope for
reading, wherever a spot of light is inconvenient.

     The last condition has not been attended to yet, and perhaps biologists would
not care for it. The second-named author finds the sensitiveness of a galvano-
meter as above designed with 8 coils two or three times as sensitive as usual.

5. 071 a Simple Interference Arrangement.

        By Lord Rayleigh, Sec.R.S.

     If a point, or line, of light be regarded through a telescope, the aperture of
which is limited to two narrow parallel slits, interference bands are seen, of which

the theory is given in treatises on Optics. The width of the bands is inversely

proportional to the distance between the centres of the slits^ and the width of the
field, upon which the bands are seen, is inversely proportional to the width of the

individual slits. If the latter element be given, it wiU usually be advantageous

to approximate the slits until only a small number of bands are included. In this

way not only are the bands rendered larger, but illumination may be gained by the

then admissible widening of the original source.

Supposing, then, the proportions of the double slit to be given, we may inquire
A mas to the effect of an alteration in scale.
meffect of magnifying      diminution in ratio will have the

                       times the field and the bands (fixed in number) visible

upon it. Since the total aperture is diminished wi times, it might appear that the

illumination would be diminished ni' times, but the admissible widening of the
--V04
                             EEPOET 1893.

moriginal source times reduces the loss, so that it stands at wi times, instead of m'

times.

     It remains, and this is more particularly the ohject of the present note, to point
out the effect of the telescope upon the angular magnitude and illumination of the
bands. If the magnifying power of the telescope exceed the ratio of aperture of

ohject glass and pupil, its introduction is prejudicial. And even if the ahove limit

be not exceeded, the use of the telescope is without advantage. The relation
between the greatest brightness and the apparent magnitude of the bands is the
same whether a telescope be used or not, the loss by reflections and absorptions
being neglected. The function of the telescope is merely to magnify the linear

dimensions of the slit system.

     This magnification is sometimes important, especially when it is desirable to
operate separately upon the interfering pencils. But when the ohject is merely to
see the bands, the telescope may be abolished without loss. The only difficulty is

to construct the very diminutive slit system then required. In the arrangement

now exhibited, the slits are very fine lines formed by ruling with a knife upon a
silver film supported upon glass. This double slit is mounted at one end of a

tube, and at the other is placed a parallel slit. It then suffices to look through
the tube at a candle or gas flame in order to see interference bands in a high

degree of perfection.
      It is suggested that this simple apparatus could be turned out very cheaply,

and that its introduction into the market would tend to popularise acquaintance

with interference phenomena.

7, Supplementary Note on the Ether. By Dr. Oliver Lodge, F.B.S.

After my paper on Friday asserting no mechanical stress connection between

ether and matter, Mr. Cowper lianyard asked me, 'How, then, does dust polarise

Howlight ? ' Or more generally the question might be asked, '  can ordinary matter

affect light in any way ? '

The note is suggested by that question, and the point of it is that since the dust

is not electrified it cannot (e.v hypotJiesi ) be acted on by oscillating ether, but only

by electric oscillations. (The action of dust on the electromagnetic theory has been

explained by Lord llayleigh.) Hence all elastic-solid, or mechanical theories of

                            By A. B. Basset, M.A., F.B.8.

    Two suggestions have been made with regard to the pubhcation of scientific

--papers first, that all papers of importance should be published in a central

organ ; secondly, that a digest containing an abstract of such papers should from
time to time be published.

     I do not think the first scheme could be carried out so as to serve any useful
purpose ; for, although it might suit the requirements of a few juvenile societies,
it is unlikely that societies of position and standing, which have ample funds at

their command for the publication of their proceedings and transactions, would

consent to sink their individuality by giving up the publication of papers com-
municated to them. Moreover, as many societies derive a considerable portion of
their income from the sale of their proceedings, it would be impossible for them to
allow the concurrent publication of papers in the central organ, as this might

seriously diminish their revenue.

     The importance of distributiug copies of papers in quarters where they are
likely to be read has been alluded to in ' Nature ' by more than one correspondent.

In order to do this efl'ectively it is necessary that the author should receive a
certain number of gratuitous copies. These are supplied by most scientific

societies, and also by many of the American and foreign scientific journals. On

the other hand, the ' Philosophical Magazine ' refuses to present authors with any
t/ratuitous copies, but makes them pay for any that they require. The question,

therefore, arises as to whether the proposed ' central organ ' is going to conduct

its business on the principle embodied in the Latin maxim, Do ut des, do ut facias,

facio ut deSf/acio ut facias, or whether it intends to follow the example of the
* Philosophical Magazine,' and try to get all it can without giving anything in

return.

It appears to me most improbable that important and prosperous societies like

the Cambridge Philosophical and the London Mathematical (to say nothing of the

Royal) would lend a hand in  promoting the  scheme  of                                                                                                                                                                                                               a  central  organ                           and  in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

that event the scheme could not possibly be successful unless it were able to ofiier

far greater advantages and attractions to authors than the societies do.
     The only feasible scheme seems to be the publication of a digest of papers by

the co-operation of the various scientific societies ; and, if thought desirable, papers

published in foreign countries might also be included. In order to prepare the

way for such a digest, I should strongly recommend that in future all societies
should follow the example of the Incorporated Society for Law Reporting, and

require authors to append a headnote to their papers briefly setting forth the
object of the investigation. Every three or four years the titles and headnotes

of all papers relating to each separate branch of science should be copied out and

arranged in proper order, and a series of digests of each separate branch of science
should be published. Mathematicians would thus be enabled to purchase the
mathematical digests, and chemists the chemical one. They woidd thereby be in

a position to find out at a glance what papers have been published on their own
special subjects during that period. These digests would do for science what the

      digests of law cases have done for the legal profession. Thirty years' experience

     has shown that this scheme would work well in practice ; and as many country
(solicitors take in the ' Law Reports,' any member of the British Association who

desires further information can easily obtain it by applying to one of the leading

firms in Nottingham.

To develop an existing periodical which is a well-known and paying concern is

often more successful than to start an entirely new one                                                                                                                                                                                                              and as many authors who
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

contribute papers to societies send abstracts of them to ' Nature,' it might be worth

while considering whether an arrangement could not be made with the pro-

prietors of ' Nature ' by which a supplemental number could be issued (say, once a

quarter) containing a digest of the most important papers published in the United

Kingdom during tliat period. The abstracts (with possibly a little pruning), and

also the type used in setting them up, would be available, and the cost of compiling

the supplemental number would have to be met by a small extra charge for it.

   A committee of members of the British Association might be formed with

advantage for discussing this matter, and drawing up a report embodying the

Arecommendations at which they arrive.  copy of the report should then be sent

      as soon as practicable (without ivaiting for the meeting next year) to the presidents

         the principal scientific societies, in order that it may be laid before their respec-
      tive governing bodies. Each of the societies which are concerned with pure and

Lofapplied mathematics and approve of united action could then appoint a delegate
     to discuss further proceedings with regard to their own particular subjects, and
      the same could be done by societies connected with other branches of science.

       11. On Electro-magnetic Trails of Images in Plane, Spherical, and
                   Cylindrical Current Sheets. Bij G. H. Bryan, M.A.

      The problem of electro-magnetic induction in spherical and ellipsoidal current

 Nsheets has been dealt with by Professor iven, Dr. Larmor, Professor Horace Lamb,

 and other writers, but, so far as the author is aware, no attempt has been made to
 apply the method of images to current sheets except in the well-known case of an
 infinite plane sheet, so fully treated by Maxwell and other writers. The author
 has worked out the images of a fixed magnetic pole of variable intensity in
 presence of a spherical current sheet, and has performed the corresponding investi-
 gation for the cylinder under the influence of a line distribution of magnetism of

 variable intensity parallel to the axis of the cylinder, the problem being in this

 case two dimensional. From the results thus obtained the images of a moving
 pole may be constructed in the same manner as for a plane sheet. In the particular
 case of a pole revolving outside a spherical shell about its centre, the images which

 determine the magnetic potential at any point inside the shell lie on an equiangular

 spiral.

                       Bij Hugh Robert Mill, D.Sc, F.B.S.E.

      The conclusions stated in this paper were deduced mainly from the author's
 observations on the Clyde Sea Area. The physical character of the Clyde Sea
 Area depends mainly on the form of the hollows of which it is composed and
the degree of isolation of each from oceanic influences. The North Channel between
 Scotland and Ireland was found always in a homothermic condition, i.e., the tem-
perature was the same from surface to bottom, an effect traced to the tidal mixing
of the water. The Channel water was on the average of the whole year 1°'7 F.,
warmer than the air at the Mull of Cantyre. The air reached its maximum in the

end of July, the water not until the middle of September. Up to that date the
air was warmer, but from September to April the water was warmer. On the

plateau or broad shallow stretching across the mouth of the Sea Area from
 Cantyre to Galloway the water was usually highly heterothermic, i.e., the tempera-
ture varied greatly from surface to bottom. Only at the period of the annual

minimum was the temperature uniform throughout. On the plateau the Channel

 water mixed with that of the great Arran basin, the deepest and most open of the
natural divisions of the Clyde Sea Area. In the Arran basin the water was homo-

thermic throughout at each spring minimum about the month of March, and as

heat was being stored or lost the lower layers remained homothermic, becoming
least so about the time of the autumn maximum. The surface layers heated up
most rapidly, and cooled down most rapidly, but the average temperature of the
whole mass of water was always lower than that of the Channel, except for about

a month at the spring minimum. The maximum temperature of the mass also was

retarded to the middle of October, up to which date the water as a whole was
colder than the air, but after that date was warmer till the spring minimum. The
condition of things in the more isolated barred off' sea lochs, such as Loch Fyne
and Loch Goil, showed still more strongly the effects of isolation from oceanic
influence. The mass of the water in Loch Fyne, although nearly of the same
temperature as the other divisions about the period of minimum, was much colder
during the rest of the A^ear than that of the Arran basin, which in turn was colder

than the Channel. The date of maximum temperature was a few weeks later than
that of the Arran basin, and at least three months later than that of the air. The

diflference between the behaviour of the surface and bottom water with regard to
temperature became more and more marked with the degree of isolation from
oceanic water. In Loch Fyne and Loch Goil the warmth of summer did not affect
the bottom water for about six months, and the greatest cold of winter took about
three months to make itself felt at the bottom.

                   Section B.-- CHEMICAL SCIENCE.

--Pkesident of the Section Professor J. Emeeson Reynolds, M.D., Sc.D., F.R.S.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER U.

The Pkesident delivered the following Address :

At the Nottingham Meeting of the British Association in 1866, Dr. H. Becce
Jones addressed the Section over which I have now the honour to preside on the

place of Chemical Science in Medical Education. Without dwelling on this topie

to-day, it is an agreeable duty to acknowledge the foresight of my predecessor as

to the direction of medical progress. Twenty-seven years ago the methods of inquiry

and instruction in medicine were essentially based on the formal lines of the last

--generation. Dr. Bence Jones saw that modern methods of research in chemistry

and in the experimental sciences generally must profoundly influence medicine^

and he urged the need of fuller training of medical students in those sciences.

    The anticipated influence is now operative as a powerful factor in the

general progress of medicine and medical education ; but much remains to be

desired in regard to the chemical portion of that education. In the later stages

of it undue importance is still attached to the knowledge of substances rather than,

of principles ; of products instead of the broad characters of the chemical changes
in which they are formed. Without this higher class of instruction it is unreason-

able to expect an intelligent perception of complex physiological and pathological

processes which are chemical in character, or much real appreciation of modern

pharmacological research. I have li'.tle doubt, however, that the need for this-

fuller chemical education will soon be so strongly felt that the necessary reform

will come from within a profession which has given ample proof in recent years of

its zeal in the cause of scientific progress.

In our own branch of science the work of the year has been substantial in
Wecharacter, if almost unmarked by discoveries of popular interest.
                                                                     may probably

place in the latter category the measure of success which the skill of Moissan has

enabled him to attain in the artificial production of the diamond form of carbon,

apparently in minute crystals similar to those recognised by Koenig, Mallard,

Daubr^e, and by Friedel in the supposed meteorite of Canon de Diablo in Arizona.

Members of the Section will probably have the opportunity of examining some of

mythe-se artificial diamonds through the courtesy of M. Moissan, who has also, at

request, been so good as to arrange for us a demonstration of the properties of the

element fluorine, which he succeeded in isolating in 1887.

Not less interesting or valuable are the studies of Dr.Perkin, on electro-magnetio

rotation ; of Lord Rayleigh, on the relative densities of gases ; of Dewar, on
chemical relations at extremely low temperatures ; of Clowes, on exact measurements
of flame-cap indications aff"orded by Miners' testing lamps ; of Horace Brown and
Morris, on the chemistry and physiology of foliage leaves, by which they have been

led to the startling conclusion that cane-sugar is the first sugar produced during the
assimilation of carbon, and that starch is formed at its expense as a more stable

reserve material for subsequent use of the plant; or of Cross, Bevan, and Beadle,

on the interaction of alkali-cellulose and carbon bisulphide, in the course of which

they have proved that a cellulose residue can act like an alcohol radical in the

formation of thiocarbonates, and thus have added another to the authors' valuable

contributions to our knowledge of members of the complex group of celluloses.

But it is now an idle task for a President of this Section to attempt a slight

sketch of the works of chemical philosophers even during the short space of tM'elve

months; they are too numerous and generally too important to be lightly treated,

--hence we can but apply to them a paraphrase of the ancient formula Are they

not written in the books of the chronicles we term ' Jahresberichte,' ' Annales,' or

'Transactions and Abstracts,' according to our nationality?

     I would, however, in this connection ask your consideration for a question re-

--lating to the utilisation of the vast stores of facts laid up some might even
--say buried in the records to which reference has just been made. The need exists,

and almost daily becomes greater, for facile reference to this accumulated wealth,

and of such a kind that an investigator, commencing a line of inquiry with whose

previous history he is not familiar, can be certain to learn all the facts known on

the subject up to a particular d ate, instead of having only the partial record to be

found in even the best edited of the dictionaries now available. The best and

most obvious method of attaining this end is the publication of a subject-matter

index of an ideally complete character. I am glad to know that the Chemical Society

of London will probably provide us in the years to come with a compilation which

will doubtless aim at a high standard of value as a work of reference to memoirs,

and in some degree to their contents, so far as the existing indexes of the volumes

of the Society's Journal supply the information. Whether this subject-matter

index is published or not, the time has certainly arrived for adopting the imme-

diately useful course of publishing monographs, analogous to those now usual in

Natural Science, which shall contain all the information gained up to a particular

date in the branch of chemistry' with which the author is specially familiar by

reason of his own work in the subject. Such monographs should include much

more than any mere compilation, and would form the best material from which a

complete subject-matter index might ultimately be evolved.

ily attention was forcibly drawn to the need of such special records by noting

the comparatively numerous cases of re-discovery and imperfect identification of

derivatives of thiourea. In my laboratory, where this substance was isolated, we

naturally follow with interest all work connected with it, and therefore readily

detect lapses of the kind just mentioned. But when it is remembered that the

distinct derivatives of thiourea now known number considerably over six hundred

substances, and that their descriptions are scattered through numerous British and

foreign journals, considerable excuse can be found for workers overlooking former

results. The difficulty which exists in this one small department of the science I

hope shortly to remove, and trust that others may be induced to provide similar

works of reference to the particular branches of chemistry with which they are

personally most familiar.

    When we consider the drift of investigation in recent years, it is easy to recog-

nise a distinct reaction from extreme specialisation in the promineTice now given

to general phj'sico-chemical problems, and to those broad questions concerning the

relations of the elements which I would venture to group under the head of ' Com-

parative Chemistry.' Together these lines of inquiry aftbrd promise of definite in-

formation about the real nature of the seventy or more entities we term ' elements,'

and about the mechanism of that mysterious yet definite change in matter

Nowwhich we call ' chemical action.'  and again one or other class of investiga-

tion enables us to get some glimpse beyond the known which stimulates the

imaginative faculty.

For example, a curious side-light seems to be thrown on the nature of the

elements by the chemico-physical discussion of the connection existing between

the constitution of certain organic compounds and the colours they exhibit.

Without attempting to intervene in theinterestingcontroversy in which Armstrong

jiod Hartley are engaged as to the nature of the connection, we may take it as an
710 KEPOBT-- 1893.

established fact that a relation exists between the power which a dissolved chemical
compound possesses of producing the colour impression within our comparatively
small visual range, and the particular mode of grouping of its constituent radicals in
its molecule. Further, the reality of this connection will be most freely admitted
in the -class of aromatic compounds ; that is, in derivatives of benzene, whose con-

stituents are so closely linked together aa to exhibit quasi-elemental persistence.

If, then, the possession of what we call colour by a compound be connected with
its constitution, may we not infer that ' elements ' which exhibit distinct colour,

msuch as gold and copper, thin layers and in their soluble compounds, are at least

complexes analogous to definitely decomposable substances ? This inference, while

legitimate as it stands, would obviously acquire strength if we could show that any-
thing like isomerism exists among the elements ; for identity of atomic weight of
any two chemically distinct elements must, by all analogy with compounds, imply

dissimilarity in constitution, and, therefore, definite structure, independently of

any argument derived from colour. Now, nickel and cobalt are perfectly distinct
elements, as we all know, but, so far as existing evidence goes, the observed difler-

ences in their atomic weights (nickel 58'G, cobalt 58'7) are so small as to be within,
the range of the experimental errors to which the determinations were liable. Here,

then, we seem to have the required example of something like isomerism among-

elements, and consequently some evidence that these substances are complexes^
of difierent orders; but in the cases of cobalt and nickel we also know that in

--transparent solutions of their salts, if not in thin layers of the metals themselves,.

they exhibit strong and distinct colours compare the beautiful rosy tint of cobalt
sulphate with the brilliant green of the corresponding salt of nickel. Therefore,.
in exhibiting characteristically difierent colours, these substances aftbrd us some
further evidence of structural diflerences between the matter of which they consist,
 and support the conclusion to which their apparent identity in atomic weight,

would lead us. By means of such side-lights we may gradually acquire some idea
of the nature of the elements, even if we are unable to get any clue to their origin

 other than such as maj' be found in Crookes' interesting speculations.
      Again, while our knowledge of the genesis of the chemical elements is as smalL

as astronomers possess of the origin of the heavenly bodies, much suggestive work

 has recently been accomplished in the attempt to apply the principle of gravitation,.
 which simply explains the relative motions of the planets, to account for the inter-
actions of the molecules of the elements. The first step in this direction was sug-

 gested by Mendeleef in his Royal Institution lecture (May 31, 1889), wherein he
proposed to apply Newton's third law of motion to chemical molecules, regarded a»
 systems of atoms analogous to double stars. The Rev. Dr. Ilaughton has-
 followed up this idea with his well-known mathematical skill, and, in a series of
 papers just published, has shown that the three Newtonian laws are applicable to

 explain the interactions of chemical molecules, ' with this ditl'erence, that whereas

 the specific coefficient of gravity is the'same for all bodies, independent of the particu-
 lar kind of matter of which they are composed, the atoms have specific coefficients

 of attraction which vary with the nature of the atoms concerned.' The laws of
 gravitation, with this proviso, were found to apply to all the definite cases examined,
 and it was shown that a chemical change of combination is equivalent to a planetary
 catastrophes So far the fundamental hypothesis of ' Newtonian Chemistry ' has led
 to conclusions which are not at variance with the facts of the science, while it
 gives promise of help in obtaining a solution of the great problem of the nature of

 chemical action.
      Passing from considerations of the kind to which I have just referred, permit

 me to occupy the rest of the time at my disposal with a short account of a line of

 study in what I have already termed ' comparative chemistry,' which is not only of
 inherent interest, but seems to give us the means of filling in some details of a

 hitherto rather neglected chapter in the early chemical history of this earth.

      The most remarkable outcome of ' comparative chemistry ' is the periodic law-
 of the elements, which asserts that the properties of the elements are connected in
 the form of a periodic function wnth the masses of their atoms. Concurrently with
 the recognition of this principle, other investigations have been in progress, aiming-
                                                                                                                                                              --

                                                                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                             711

at more exact defiuitions of the characters of the relations of the elements, and

ultimately of their respective offices in nature. Among inquiries of this kind

the comparative study of the elements carhon and silicon appears to me to

possess the highest interest. Carhon, whether combined with hydrogen, oxygen,

or nitrogen, or with all three, is the great element of organic nature, while silicon,

in union with oxygen and various metals, not only forms about one-third of the

solid crust of the earth, but is unquestionably the most important element of

inorganic nature. The chief functions of carbon are those which are performed at

comparatively  low  temperatures                                                                                                                hence carbon  is  essentially the  element  of the

very high temperatures                                                                                                               hence  it  is  the  element whose chief work in nature was
                                                                                                                                  ;

performed in the distant past, when the temperature of this earth was far beyond

that at which the carbon compounds of organic life could exist. Yet between these

dominant elements of widely different epochs remarkably close analogies are

traceable, and the characteristic differences observed in their relations with other

elements are just those which enable each to play its part eflfecti^ely under the
conditions which promote its greatest activity.

The chemical analogies of the two tetrad elements carbon and silicon are

most easily recognised in compounds which either do not contain oxygen, or which

are oxygen compounds of a very simple order, and the following table will recall a
few of the most important of these, as well as some which have residted from the

fine researches of Friedel, Crafts, and Ladenburg :

in tlie way have not obtained results of a very conclusive kind. It is known that

the product when strongly heated in a current of ammonia gas affords ammonium

chloride, which volatilises, and a residue, to which Schutzenherger and Colsonhave

assigned the formula SioN^H. This body they regard as a definite hydride of

SioNj, which latter they produced by acting on silicon at a white heat with pure

nitrogen. Gattermann suggests that a nearer approach to the silicon analogue of

cyanogen, Si.,N,,, should be obtained from the product of the action of ammonia on

silicon-chloroform                                                                                      but it does not appear that this suggestion has  yet borne fruit.
                                                                                                     ;

It was scarcely probable that the above-mentioned rather indefinite compounds of

silicon with nitrogen were the only ones of the class obtainable, since bodies includ-

ing carbon combined with nitrogen are not only numerous but are among the most

important carbon compounds known. Further investigation was therefore neces-

sary in the interests of comparative chemistry, and for special reasons which will

appear later on ; but it was evident that a new point of attack must be found.

   A preliminary experimental survey proved the possibility of forming numerous

compounds of silicon containing nitrogen, and enabled me to select those which

seemed most likely to afford definite information. For much of this kind of work

silicon chloride was rather too energetic, hence I had a considerable quantity of

the more manageable silicon tetrabromide prepared by Serullas' method, viz., by

passing the vapour of crude bromine (containing a little chlorine) over a strongly

heated mixture of silica and charcoal. In purifying this product I obtained inci-

dentally the chloro-bromide of silicon, SiClBrg, which was required in order to

complete the series of possible chlorobromides of silicon.^

Silicon bromide was found to produce addition compounds very readily with

many feebly basic substances containing nitrogen. But one group of bromides

of this class has yet been investigated in detail, namely, the products aflforded by

thioureas. The typical member of this group is the perfectly definite but uncrys-

talline substance

                                                                                                                /(CSN,,H,),Br
                                                                                                        SiBr

     Substituted thioureas afford similar bodies, the most interesting of which is the
allyl compound. This is a singularly viscid liquid, which requires several days at
ordinary temperatures to regain its level, when a tube containing it is inverted.
But these are essentially addition compounds, and are therefore comparatively un-

important.

     In most cases, however, the silicon haloids enter into very definite reaction with
nitrogen compounds, especially when the latter are distinctly basic, such as aniline
cr any of its homologues. One of the principal products of this class of change is
the beautiful typical substance on the table, which is the first well-defined crystal-
line compound obtained in which silicon is exclusively combined with nitrogen.
Its composition is Si(NHC^Il5)4.'" Analogous compounds have been formed with the
toluidines, naphthylaminea, &c., and have been examined in considerable detail,
but it suffices to mention them and proceed to point out the nature of the changes

we can effect by the action of heat on the comparatively simple anilide.
    When silicon anilide is heated carefully in vacuo it loses one molecule of aniline

very easily and leaves triphenyl-guanidine, probably the a modification; if the
action of heat be continued, but at ordinary pressure and in a current of dry
hydrogen, another molecule of aniline can be expelled, and, just before the last
trace of the latter is removed, the previously liquid substance solidifies and affords
a silicon analogue of the insoluble modification of carbodiphenyldiimide, which

Amay then be heated moderately without undergoing further material change.

      Moreover, the diimide has been heated to full redness in a gas combustion
furnace while dry hydrogen was still passed over it ; even under these conditions
little charring occurred, but some nitrogen and a phenyl radical were eliminated,
and the purified residue was found to approximate in composition to SiNPh, which

would represent the body as phenylsilicocyanide or a polymer of it. Even careful
heating of the diimide in ammonia gas has not enabled me to remove all the phenyl
from the compound, but rather to retain nitrogen, as the best residue obtained
from such treatment consisted of SioNjPh, or the phenylic derivative of one of the
substances produced by Schutzenberger and Colson from the ammonia reaction.
It may be that both these substances are compounds of silicocyanogen with an
imide group of the kind indicated below

                                                                                                                        SiN.             SiN.

Further investigation must decide whether this is a real relationship ; if it be,

we should be able to remove the imidic group and obtain silicocyanogen in the free

state. One other point only need be noticed, namely, that when the above silicon

compounds are heated in oxygen they are slowly converted into SiO.,; but the last

traces of nitrogen are removed with great difficulty, unless water-vapour is present,

when ammonia and silica are quickly formed.

Much remains to be done in this department of comparative chemistry, but we

may fairly claim to have established the fact that silicon, like carbon, can be made

to form perfectly well-defined compounds in which it is exclusively united with the

triad nitrogen of amidic and imidic groups.

Now, having proved the capacity of silicon for the formation of compounds of

this order with a triad element, Nature very distinctively lets us understand that

nitrogen is not the particular element which is best adapted to play the triad role

towards silicon in its high-temperature changes, which are ultimately dominated

Weby oxygen.                      are not acquainted with any natural compounds which include

silicon and nitrogen                                                                                               but  large numbers of the most  important  minerals  contain
                                                                                                                ;

the pseudo-triad element aluminium combined with silicon, and few include any

other triad. Phosphorus follows silicon in the periodic system of the elements as

nitrogen does carbon, but silicates containing more than traces of phosphorus are

rare                     on  the  other hand, several                                                                         silicates  are known containing boron, the  lower
                      ;

liomologue of aluminium ; for example, axinite, datholite, and tourmaline.

^Moreover, it is well known that silicon dissolves freely in molten aluminium,

though much of the former separates on cooling. Winkler has analysed the gangue

of aluminium saturated with silicon, and found that its composition is approxi-

mately represented by the formula SiAl, or, perhaps, SioAU, if we are to regard

this as analogous to OjNo or cyanogen. Here aluminium at least resembles nitrogen

in directly forming a compound with silicon at moderately high temperature. It

would appear, then, that while silicon can combine with both the triads nitrogen

and aluminium, the marked positive characters of the latter, and its extremely

low volatility, suit it best for the production of permanent silicon compounds

similar to those which nitrogen can afford.

With these facts in mind we may carry our thoughts back to that period in the

earth's history when our planet was at a higher temperature than the dissociation

point of oxygen compounds. Under such conditions the least volatile elements were

probably liquids, while silicides and carbides of various metals were formed in

Wethe fluid globe.                can imagine that the attraction of aluminium for the large excess

of silicon would assert itself, and that, as the temperature fell below the point at

which oxidation became possible, these silicides and carbides underwent some

degree of oxidation, the carbides suffering most owing to the volatility of the

oxides of carbon, while the fixity of the products of oxidation of silicides rendered

the latter process a more gradual one. The oxidation of silicides of metals which

had little attraction for silicon would lead to the formation of simple metallic

silicates and to the separation of the large quantities of free silica we meet with in

the solid crust of the earth, whereas oxidation of silicides of aluminium would not
                            --

714 EEPORT-- 1893.

break up the union of the two elements, hut rather cause the ultimate formaiion
of the aiumino-silicates which are so abundant in most of our rocks.

    Yiewed in the light of tbe facts already cited and the inferences we have drawn
from them as to the nitrogen-like relationship of aluminium to silicon, I am

disposed to regard the natural aiumino-silicates as products of final oxidation of

sometime active silico-aluminium analogues of carbo-nitrogen compounds, rather

than ordinary double salts. It is generally taken for granted that they are double
salts, but recent work on the chromoxalates by E. A. Werner has shown that this

view is not necessarily true of all such substances.

     Without going into undue detail we can even form some conception of the

general course of change from simple aluminium silicide to an alumino-silicate, if

we allow the analogies already traced to lead us further.

   We recognise the existence of silico-formyl in Friedel and Ladenburg's silico-

formic anhydride ; hence silico-triformamide is a compound whose probable formation
we can admit, and, on the basis of our aluminium-nitrogen analogy, an aluminium
representative also. Thus

                                                                      triformamide.
                                                                                                                        silicic acid.

Now, oxidation of triformamine would lead to complete resolution into nitrogen

gas, carbondioxide gas and water rendering it an extremely unstable body ; under
similar conditions silico-triformamide would probably alford nitrogen gas and

silicic  acid  (or silicon  dioxide  and water)                                              while the  third  compound, instead       of
                                                                                          ;

breaking up, would (owing to the fixity of aluminium as compared with nitrogen)

be likely at first to afford a salt of an alumino-silicic acid, in presence of much

basic material.

The frequent recurrence of the ratios SijAl, SijAl.,, &c., in the formulse of

natural aiumino-silicates, suggests that some at least of "these minerals are derived

from oxidation products of the above triformic type. Without stopping to trace
all the possible stages in the oxidation of the primary compound Al(SiO^Il)3, or

variations in basicity of the products, I may cite the four following examples out

--of many others which might be given of resulting representative mineral groups :

    Five years ago Professor F. W. Clarke, of the United States Geological

Survey, published a most interesting paper on the structure of the natural sili-
cates. In this he adopts the view that the mineral xenolite, SiaAljO,,, is the

primary from which all other aiumino-silicates may be supposed to arise by various

substitutions. Nature, however, seems to teach us that such minerals as xenolite,
fibrolite, and the related group of ' clays' are rather to be regarded as end-products
of a series of hydrolytic changes of less aluminous silicates than primary substances
themselves ; hence the sketch which I have ventured to give above of the probable
genesis of aiumino-silicates seems to provide a less arbitrary basis for Clarke's
interesting work, without materially disturbing the general drift of his subsequent

reasoning.

   We may now consider for a moment in what direction evidence can be sought

for the existence in nature of derivatives of the hypothetical intermediate products

of oxidation between a primary silicide and its fully oxidised silicate.

   ' In these cases where R"' = A1 it is, of course, assumed that the latter is acting

only as a basic radical.

     In the atsence of a working liypothesis of the kind wliicli I have already sug-

--gested, it is not probable that direct evidence would yet be obtainable this must
--be work for the future but when we consider that the existence of compounds of

the order in question would manifest themselves in ordinary mineral analyses by

the analytical products exceeding the original weight of material, we seem to find

Asome evidence on the point in recorded cases of the kind.  deficiency of a single

atom of oxygen in compounds having the high molecular weights of those in
question would be indicated by very small excesses (from 2 to 3 per cent.) whose
real meaning might be easily overlooked. Now, such results are not at all unusual

in analyses of mineral alumino-silicates. For instance, Amjihiboles containing a
mere trace of iron have afforded 102-7o parts from 100, and almost all analyses

of Microsominite are high, giving as much as 103 parts. In less degree Vesuvicuiite
and members of the Andalusite group may be noted. All these cases may be
capable of some other explanations, but I cite them to show that such excesses are
commonly met with in published analyses. On the other hand, it is scarcely to
be doubted that a good analyst, who obtained a really significant excess, would

throw such a result aside as erroneous and never publish it. I therefore plead for

much greater care in analj^ses of the kind in question and closer scrutiny of

results in the light of the suggestions I have ventured to ofier. It is probable
that silicates containing only partially oxidised aluminium are rare ; nevertheless

the search for them would introduce a new element of interest into mineralogical

inquiries.

    If the general considerations I have now endeavoured to lay before you are

allowed their full weight, some of the alumino-silicates of our primary rocks reveal

to us more than we hitherto supposed. Regarded from this newer standpoint, tliey

are teleoxidised representatives of substances which foreshadowed in terms of silicon,
aluminium, and oxygen the compounds of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen required

at a later stage of the earth's history for living organisms. Thus, while the

sedimentary strata contain remains which come down to us from the very dawn of

life on this globe, the rocks from whose partial disintegration the preserving strata

resulted contain mineral records which carry us still further back, even to Nature's

earliest eftbrts in building up compounds similar to those suited for the purposes of

organic development.

1. On Tools and Ornaments of Copper mid Other Metals from Egypt and
                     Palestine. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S.

The author gave an account of analyses of various specimens of metallic tools

and ornaments found by Dr. Flinders Petrie in Egypt and Mr. Bliss in Palestine.

The oldest copper tools were from Meydum, and date back probably to the fourth

Egyptian dynasty, about 3500 b.c. Other copper tools were obtained at Kahun,

and date 2500 B.C. These contain small quantities of arsenic, antimony, &c. : but

among the specimens from Meydum was a rod of bronze containing about 9 per

cent, of tin. Bronze needles were also found at Kahun, and of course bronze was

abundant in later periods. That tin was known in the metallic condition was

evidenced by a finger-ring made of tin belonging to the eighteenth dynasty, about

1400 B.C. Lead was often mixed with the bronze for the casting of statuettes.

The mound of Tel-el-Hesy, which is believed to be the Lachish of the Scriptures,

consists of the ruins of several successive Amorite towns, above which are the ruins

Aof the Israelitish town.  copper tool from the lowest stratum, and which could

       not be of later date than 1500 B.C., was made of a very red, hard, brittle metal, of

k a specific gravity of only 6-6, and consisted of cuprous oxide to the extent of about
B 25 per cent. This oxide, no doubt, gave the desired hardness to the copper. In

I the strata dating from 1400 B.C. to 800 B.C. occurred many arrow-heads and other

K objects made of bronze. In the upper Israelitish portion the bronze implements
      were gradually replaced by iron. At Lacliish there were also found a wire of

B almost pure lead, and what seemed to be a bracelet of silver. The latter was

coated witli cliloride of silver, doubtless from the chlorides in the soil, and contained
6*5 per cent, of copper and 1-44 per cent, of gold.

    At Illahun, in Egypt, some beads or buttons were found which proved to be of
metallic antimony badly reduced from the sulpliide. They date back to about

800 B.C.

3. On Native Iron Manufacture in Bengal. By H. Harris and T. Turner.

                 4. On Nitride of Iron. By G. J. Fowler, M.Sc.

     This research was undertaken with the object of repeating and extending the
work of Stahlschmidt ('Pogg. Ann.,' v. cxxv., 1865, p. 37) on the same subject,
his results differing in many points from those of his predecessors.

   --The best way of preparing nitride of iron was found to be the following : Iron

is reduced from the hydrate by hydrogen, in a tube of such dimensions that it can
be weighed, together with its contents, and thus the end of the reaction deter-
mined without exposing the iron to the air. AVhen complete reduction has been
eftected, the iron is heated in a fairly rapid current of ammonia gas, until no further
increase in weight is observed. The temperature should be kept a little above the
melting-point of lead.

     The product obtained when the reaction was complete was analysed. The
nitrogen was determined by dissolving the substance in hydrochloric acid, evapo-
rating with platinum chloride, and weighing the ammonium-platinum-chloride

obtained.

     The hydrogen given oif on solution of the substance in sulphuric acid was

measured.

     The iron was determined by ignition and weighing as oxide, and by solution
in sulphuric acid and titration with permanganate.

    As will be seen from the results obtained, the nitride prepared as above has a
composition corresponding to the formula Fe.^N. On solution in hydrochloric acid

the following reaction takes place :

                               Fe^N + 5HC1 = 2FeCl3 + NH.Cl + H.

N . , . 11-07  Found  Calculated for FegN.

H . . . 231 CO. from -275 subst. . . 24-4 c.c

     In another sample 10-94 N. was found. In a third case, in which the iron, after
solution of the nitride in acid, was precipitated by ammonia and weighed as oxide,
89-44 per cent, of iron was obtained and 10-5 per cent, of nitrogen, showing again
that the substance dissolves in acid according to the above equation, all the nitro-
gen being converted into ammonia.

    No percentages of nitrogen above 11-1 could be obtained, while any percentage

below that could be got according to the time during which the iron had been
exposed to the current of ammonia.

     These results are fully in agreement with those obtained by Stahlschmidt, and
confirm his conclusion that only one nitride of iron exists, and that it has the above

composition.

    Nitride of iron is formed when iron amalgam is heated in ammonia, and also
when ferrous chloride or bromide is heated in this gas. These methods, however,

do not so readily give a product containing the full percentage of nitrogen, and free
from the presence of a third element.

     Nitride of iron is a grey powder, rather less blue in tone than iron reduced from

the hydrate. On rubbing it is more gritty than iron prepared as above. It is

feebly magnetic.

     Heated in hydrogen, ammonia is produced at about the same temperature as
that at which the nitride is formed.

     It readily bums in chlorine, ferric chloride and nitrogen being formed.
     Heated in carbon monoxide, no evidence of the formation of cyanogen com-

pounds could be obtained.
     Steam at 100° slowly oxidises the nitride with evolution of ammonia.

     Hydrogen sulphide begins to react with it at 200°, forming ammonium sulphide

and sulphide of iron.

     Heated in nitrogen to the boiling-point of sulphur, no change occurs. The
temperature at which nitrogen is evolved by the action of heat alone must there-

fore be above this point.

    An ethereal solution of iodine is without action upon the nitride.

    From a slightly acidified solution of copper sulphate, nitride of iron deposits

copper.

     Heated with ethyl iodide to 200° in a sealed tube, defines are formed, and
iodides of iron and ammonium, the reaction evidently being

                   5C2H,I + Fe^N = 2FeI,, + NHJ + SC.H^ + H.

     Heated similarly to 200° with phenol no reaction occurred.
     Treated with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulphuric acid, analyses
showed that very little, if any, of the nitrogen is oxidised, the whole dissolving as

usual to form ammonium sulphate.

     In conjunction with Mr. P. J. Hartog, the author has determined the heat of
formation of the nitride by dissolving it in sulphuric acid contained in a platinum
calorimeter, and observing the rise of temperature. Three well-agreeing experi-
ments showed that the substance is formed with evolution of about three calories.

     In general the nitride of iron behaves as an ammonia derivative, the nitrogen
being either evolved in the free state, or converted into ammonium compounds,

according to circumstances.

5. On the Iodine Value of Sunlight in the High Al]js. By Dr. S. Rideal.

     During the past winter, at St. Moritz, in the Engadine, I had an opportunity
of determining the intensity of the light as measured by the liberation of iodine
from an acidulated solution of potassium iodide on the lines formulated by the Air
Analysis Committee of Manchester. St. Moritz is at an altitude of about 7,000 feet
above the sea level, and a succession of bright, sunny days can usually be relied
upon, even in the depths of winter. The experiments in England, which have

been carried out chiefly in towns, have not given a maximum value for the quantity

of iodine that can be liberated by sunlight in one hour ; and as the atmosphere in
St. Moritz is not only free from haze, but is also remarkable for its exceptionable
dryness, higher values than those likely to be obtained elsewhere were to be ex-

pected. Also, since the daily meteorological conditions of the place are carefully

taken and recorded in the ' Alpine Post,' the observations may possibly be of addi-

tional value.

100 c.c. This number represents only the average of the brightest days, and larger

Myresults have been obtained in summer.  average for the nineteen brightest

days in January of the present year is equal to 9-34 mgms. of iodine per 100 c.c.
per hour. Owing to the situation of the village with regard to the surrounding

mountains, the total amount of light per day is small compared with places which

are less shut in ; and, as will be seen from the accompanying table, the values

given are for the hours during which there was a bright sunlight. The actual

amount of possible sunlight on the days mentioned will be found in the meteoro-

logical records already referred to. It is interesting to note that in Manchester in

January 1892, with a day of 8-3 hours' light, or nearly half as long again as at

St. Moritz, the total liglit per week-day averaged only 4-5 mgms. iodine, or about

that obtained during half an hour's exposure at St. Moritz. Even on comparing

the Sunday values for the Manchester district, I find that the daily average is only

8-3 mgms., or less than the hour's average at St. Moritz. I believe that the com-

paratively large amount of sunlight per day experienced in the High Alps contri-

butes largely in determining the hygienic value of a sojourn in the«e mountain

health resorts.

    The maximum hour value was 13-5 mgms. per 100 c.c. on January 1, and the
lowest on January 24 of 5-7, and even this minimum was about 20 per cent, above

the average daily value in Manchester.

  6. On a Modified Form of Bunsen and Roscoe's Pendulum AcUnometer}
                      By Dr. Arthtje Richaedson and J. Quick.

      In Bunsen and Koscoe's pendulum actinometer the oscillations of a pendulum
cause a sliding shutter to pass backward and forward before sensitised paper, which
is thus exposed for a known time and again shaded from the light.

      In the present form an arrangement has been devised whereby the backward
and forward motion of the shutter is brought about by a movement in one direc-

tion only.

     This is done in the following manner : the shutter, which is made of a
fle.'cible material and in the form of an endless band, passes over the wooden
rollers, the adjacent surfaces being brought close together by means of two addi-
tional smaller rollers. Two slits of equal length are cut in the band, so that
when the latter rotates an aperture is uncovered when the slits overlap one
another, and which again close when the band has travelled round a certain

distance.

      Beneath this aperture the sensitised paper is placed, which is thus exposed for
definite times depending upon the length of the slits and the velocity of the band.

     In order to bring about the movement of the shutter one of the rollers is con-
nected with an eight-day clock, the escapement of which has been removed, the
alterations in the speed, usually occurring when a clock is running down under
such circumstances, being compensated by a fusee adjustment.

    Two advantages are claimed for this modification :

     (1) It is portable, and measurements can be made when it is placed in any

position.

     (2) The time during which any portion of the slit is open (over the sensitised

paper) is directly proportional to that occupied in opening the entire slit ; since the
rate at which the shutter moves is constant, whereas in the pendulum apparatus

a series of calculations must be made to determine the length of time during
which the slit is open for each mm. of its entire length.

7. On the Expansion of Chlorine Oas and Bromine Vapour under the
               Influence of Light, By Dr. Arthur Richardson.

    It was first obser\'ed by Budde that when chlorine is exposed to the infiu-

ence of sunhght, an expansion of the gas occurs which is independent of the

                        ' Published in the Phil. Mag., xxxvi. (1893), pp. 459-163.

direct heating eflPects of the light. He also made a similar observation in the

case of bromine vapour. These statements have been repeatedly called in ques-

tion by other observers, who failed to obtain these results on repeating Budde's

experiments.

     Experiments made by the author, however, fully confirm Budde's results, and
an arrangement is described in which the expansion of chlorine and bromine, as
compared with that of air, under the influence of light, can be exhibited as a

lecture experiment.

8. On the Cause of the Red Colouration of Phenol. By Charles A. Kohn,

      Ph.D., B.Sc, Lecturer on Organic Chemistry, University College,

       Liverpool.

     The cause of the turning red of phenol has from time to time been the subject
of investigation, but the published results are vague and conflicting. That even
the purest carbolic acid of commerce becomes coloured on keeping has long been
observed, and the general view of the cause of this colouration has been to trace it

to some impurity or other contained in the phenol. By some the presence of a

metal, especially copper or iron or their salts, has been regarded as the cause of
the reddening, by others the colouration has been attributed to alkalis or to cresol,
which last in presence of the phenol has been oxidised with the formation of

rosolic acid. Fabini, who more recently has investigated the subject, regards the

colouration as due to the action of hydrogen peroxide on phenol containing
metallic salts in presence of ammonia, the presence of all three reagents being
necessary for the production of the colour.

   -- --Since oxidising agents, alkalis especially ammonia and metallic salts play

an important part in the turning red of phenol, the action of these and similar re-
agents on phenol of varying degrees of purity was tried.

     The phenol used was the purest commercial product known as ' absolute phenol,^
and in the later experiments a sample of specially pure phenol, kindly prepared bv
0. Lowe, Esq., of Manchester. The original product was repeatedly distilled from
glass vessels and the distillates after one, six, nine, and sixteen distillations care-

fully tested with ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, caustic potash, mixtures of these
reagents, and also with salts of iron and of copper both in the presence and absence
of alkalis and of hydrogen peroxide. In all cases characteristic colourations
ensue. That with strong ammonia is violet, and those with hydrogen peroxide,
caustic potash, dilute ammonia, hydrogen peroxide in presence of caustic alkali, or
of ammonia, metals or metallic salts with or without hydrogen peroxide, red or
reddish brown. Each of the three reagents which, according to Fabini, must all
be present in order to produce a colouration gives marked colourations on
its own account. The blue colouration obtained with ammonia is identical with
Phipson's * phenol-blue,' and is probably phenol-quinone-imide. Sublimed phenol,,
as well as phenol prepared by the saponification and subsequent decomposition of
gaultheria oil, behaves similarly.

     Furthermore, all the samples thus prepared, and which were found on testing
to be perfectly free from metallic impurities, turned red on exposure to ordinary
moist air. Hence it is to be concluded that the purest phenol does redden of its
own account, and not on account of the presence of impurities of any kind. This
reddening does not take place in the dark, nor is it eflected by the less refrangible
rays of light. Phenol exposed in vacuo keeps colourless for months, as it also

does when exposed in presence of water in absence of air, or in presence of air when

perfectly dry. Both air and moisture are necessary for the colouration to ensue.
It has been shown by Dr. Richardson that hydrogen peroxide is produced during

the reddening, and to its formation the reddening of phenol when exposed to
ordinary moist air is to be traced. The similarity of the colour produced by

hydrogen peroxide with that which phenol assumes on exposure supports this
statement. The colour is also produced by the electrolysis of phenol in acid solu-
tion. The colouring matter is not volatile, and the colouration is always accom-
panied by the absorption of moisture.

       The nature of the colouring matter produced is still under investigation · the

   essential point so far established is that pure phenol possesses the intrinsic pro-

   perty of reddening when exposed to light iu presence of air and moisture.

   9. On the Rate of Evaporation of Bodies in Atmospheres of Different
                            Densities. By Dr. R. D. Phookan,

        The results of his experiments showed ' that under the same conditions of heat
   and pressure a substance volatilises more quickly in an atmosphere oi gas of lesser

   density than in one of greater. For instance, 0-05 grm. of naphthaliu, heated in a
   bath of naphthalin vapour, volatilised in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas in 18
   seconds, in air iu 30, in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, both of which possess
   the same molecular weight, in .36 seconds.

        Although these figures do not furnish sufficient data to determine the relative

   densities of the gases, yet they amply justify the above conclusion.

        An atmosphere of vapour, on the contrary, seems to have no influence on the

   time taken for a substance to volatilise iu it : 0-026 grm. of normal propyl alcohol

   heated in a steam bath, took one and the same time, 12 to 1.3 seconds'

   to volatilise in vapours of such different densities as that of ether, methyl, and

   ethyl alcohol, chloroform, tetrachlor-methan, and ethyl iodide.

        AIt is difficult to account for this anomaly.                 certain difference in conditions

   --in the employment of the two classes of bodies i.e., the true gases and the

   vapours must, however, be borne iu mind, namely, that the gases were experi-

   mented with at a temperature much more removed from their point of condensa-

   tion than that of the vapours.

       It will be therefore interesting to know whether experiments made with
   vapours at a temperature equally removed from their point of condensation would

   not give results similar to tliose obtained from gases.

       It may be that a vapour must attain a certain degree of energy or velocity

   of its molecules before it can act like true gases in influencing the° volatilisation

   of a substance.

                                                        By T. W. Hogg.

         In this paper is given a short account of the fact there are probablv about half
   a million isolated crystals of cyano-nitride of titanium in each cubic "inch of the

   high percentage ferro-manganese now used for steel-making purposes, titanium

   carbide and nitride being also occasionally present.

        The size of these crystals generally lies between 0-0001 and 0-001 of an inch
   comparatively few of them being larger than this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           '

        The number of crystals has been counted, and the lowest estimate gave 336 000
   to the  cubic inch of
                          alloy                       as a matter of  interest, the weight of this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             number of
                                                   ;

   cubes of cyano-nitride of titanium of 0-0001 of an inch has been calculated and
   found to be only 0-00003 of a gramme. Similarly, the weight of the same number
   of cubes of 0-001 of an inch weighs -03 gramme. The crystals are possessed of a
   high metallic lustre with brilliant mirror-like facets, and occur in the form of
   cubes, octahedra, and forms resembling the icositetrahedron
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;  there are also present

   beautiful combinations of pyramids and prisms, and many of the cubes possess
   interesting symmetrical face modifications. As these different forms are all found
   together they are microscopic objects of great beauty and interest to the student of
   crystallography. These crystals are obtained by careful elutriation of the car-
   bonaceous residue left after treating considerable quantities of the ferro-man^-anese
   with hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, or dilute nitric acid : this latter is recom-
   mended as being the most convenient. In using it the mixture must be kept as
   cool as possible, and allowed to stand for about twentv-four hours ; the larger
   crystals separate at once, the smaller forma beiutr retained in the residue which
   must be dried and gently pounded before submitting it to elutriation. This is best

performed iu a large porcelain 'basm, using plenty of water, gently rocking and
rotating the mixture, and allo-wing it to rest at intervals ; the lighter portions are
then su'cked up hy means of a pipette, this being continued until nothing but the
copper-coloured crystals are left.

     The largest quantity which has been separated in this way is equal to '032

 per cent.
      Ferro-manganese containing different percentages of manganese and of different

makes has been examined, and, with the exception of spiegeleisen containing 11 per
per cent, of manganese, they have all been found to contain this remarkable coni-
poimd.

     As the quantities available for examination were small, with the exception of

determining the specific gravity and the amount of the titanium only qualitative
tests have been applied. In different specimens the specific gTavity has been found
to vary between 4-1 and 5-1, and the titanium from GO'5 to 79-8 per cent. These
latter determinations include a small proportion of iron, which I have always found
to be present ; this is also the case with crystals separated from an old blast-furnace
' bear.' After several days' heating with hydrochloric acid there is 1-5 per cent, iron
retained, and probably this is the cause of the crystals being slightly but distinctly

 magnetic.

     Attention is specially directed to the fact that much valuable information with
regard to the condition of the foreign elements may be obtained by decomposing'

large quantities of the alloys with suitable reagents, and separating the substances
 of different specific gravity from the residue. In doing this it is pointed out that
there is great" danger of decomposing the compounds originally present, and form-

ing new ones as a result of the reaction which takes place between the reagent
 and the various substances present. Such a method as is indicated in this paper
is recommended to be used iu conjunction with the examination of etched speci-

 mens, which of themselves do little beyond revealing changes of structure induced
by different modes of manipulation and varying temperatures. The insufiiciency
of etched specimens to give us information with regard to the condition of im-
 purities is evident from the fact that, being opaque, so nearly alike in colour, and
in such minute and uniformly distributed particles, they escape observation.

     The science of bacteriology touches upon the leather industry in the following

important points :

     2. The Soaks.
      3. Changes in lime liquors.
      4. Bating or ' Pining.'

      6. Drenching.
      6. Fermentation of tan liquors.

     The author only gave a short resume of our present knowledge of the ' drench-

ing ' process, as this closely resembles ordinary fermentations.
     Skins from the bate after washing are placed in vats containing an infusion of

bran in water (0-4 to 1 per cent, of bran) at a temperature of 30° to 35° C. This
ferments vigorously for eighteen to twenty-four hours with evolution of consider-
able quantities of gas and the formation of weak organic acids, which have a

slight swelling action on the skin, cleanse the pores, and make it in a fit condition
to receive the tannin. On examination with a high power of the microscope the
liquid is found to be swarming with active bacteria. They are mostly in the form
of pairs or dumb-bells, each cell 0'75jLt x 1-25/i ; some form chains. I described ' a
method by which the organism causing the fermentation was separated, as it re-
fused to grow in ordinary nutrient gelatine, and lately, in conjunction with Mr.

W. H. "Willcox, B.Sc, have made a complete examination of the products of the

actual fermentation as it takes place in the works, previous to carrying out a
similar research with the pure ferment.

   We found that an unorganised ferment, ' cerealin,' changes the starch of the

hran into glucoses and dextrin ; the bacteria then ferment the glucoses, splitting

them up into the gases and acids alread}' mentioned.

B.furfuris has no action on the cellulose of the bran, nor on the skins, as some

bacteria in the bate have ; in every case where the skin is attacked it is putrefac-

tive or gelatine liquefying bacteria introduced from the bate, or in specially

favourable circumstances (hot, sultry -weather) developing from germs always pre-

sent in the atmosphere. The gases evolved have only a mechanical action on the

skin, floating and distending them, and so enabling them better to take up the

acids. In carrying out this -work we discovered a delicate test for lactic acid.

  --The presence of lactic acid was shown in the following manner : 10 c.c. of the

liquid were placed in a small distilling flask along with 2 c.c. strong II^SO; and

about 0-5 grm. potassium chromate in a little water. This was distilled and

the vapours received in a test tube surrounded by cold water; on adding magenta

solution discolourised by SO., to the liquid in the test tube a red colour was pro-

duced by the aldehyde formed from the lactic acid ; aldehyde was also recognised

Weby its smell.  tind this an exceedingly delicate test for lactic acid, and as far

as we know it is quite new in this form.

For 10 c.c. of liquid to be examined we find 2 c.c. strong HoSO^ and 1 grm.

of potassium chromate to be the best proportions. Formic, acetic, propionic,
butyric, valerianic, succinic, malic, tartaric, and citric acids do not give the

reaction.

      In conclusion, there are no doubt other organisms capable of fermenting a bran

infusion in a somewhat similar way, and the work of isolating and separately

examining their life-history and products yet remains to be done.

                9. On some Ferments derived from Diseased Pears.
                            By Geoege Tate, P'h.V., F.C.S.

    From diseased pears the author has isolated, among other micro-organisms,

three which possess morphological and chemical interest.

   A(1) yeast {Saccharomyces viscosus) which is characterised by forming small

cells of an average length of 0-003 mm. and white, strongly viscid growths

upon solid nutrient media. It brings about no alcoholic i'ermentation of the better-

known sugars, but inverts cane sugar. It can propagate either by budding or by

endogenous division.

   A(2) bacterial organism (Ascococcus luf.eits) forming yellow growths upon

nutrient gelatine. Growths of two types have been obtained, one showing
nscococci, the other only rods. It is an acid ferment of dextrose and mannitol.

   A(3) bacterial organism forming white growths upon nutrient gelatine. Two

types of growth have been obtained upon nutrient media, one in which micrococci
and rods predominate, another in which the tendency to form ascococci is strongly
marked. These two types are represented by widely diff'ering macroscopic cultures
upon solid media. Botli forms behave as lievo-lactic ferments towards dextrose

and mannitol.
     The organism is an inactive-lactic ferment of rhamnose, but after such action

still retains its power of decomposing dextrose into Irevo-lactic acid.

         and Sulphate. By G. E. Brown and Dr. W. W. J. Nicol.

11. On the Application of Sodium Peroxide to Water Analysis.
                 By Dr. S. Kideal and A. J. Boult.

No-w that sodium peroxide can be obtained commercially, its use in analysis

W.seems desirable.  Hempel ^ has already shown that it is a useful oxidising

agent for the detection of chromium and manganese, and that it forms a very con-

venient reagent for opening up tungsten minerals and for effecting the decomposi-

tion of titanic iron ores. Since the commercial sodium peroxide is free from

sulphur, it can also be used quantitatively for estimating the sulphur in sulphides.

It occurred to us that an alkaline oxidising agent of this character, if used as a

substitute for alkaline permanganate in -water analysis, might throw some light

upon the character of the organic nitrogen in waters. Hitherto either methods for

determining the total nitrogen e.g., Frankland's and Kjeldahl's, or Wanklyn's

well-known process in which only a portion of the nitrogen present in the organic

--matter is discovered have been employed. In this latter process very difierent

quantities of ammonia are obtained from the difierent classes of nitrogenous organic

bodies. Only when the nitrogen is present as some simple amido- compound like

urea, aspartic acid, or leucine does this process yield the whole of the nitrogen

present. Preusse and Tiemann - have shown in their review of the various pro-

cesses for determining organic substances in water that no reliance can be placed

upon this process for estimating the absolute quantity of nitrogen in many sub-

stances, and that, therefore, when used as a method of water analysis the quantities

Aof ammonia obtained are only relatively true for waters of the same type.

comparison of the quantities of ammonia evolved from a water when treated with

alkaline permanganate and with sodium peroxide might therefore possibly afford

a means of differentiating the nitrogenous constituents. With this purpose in view

we have compared in the ordinary course of analysis the amounts of ammonia

given off under these two ti-eatments. In one case when using one grm. of

sodium peroxide per half litre of water, the total ammonia evolved was equal to

0-027 part per 100,000, while with alkaline permanganate 0-050 part per 100,000

was obtained. On repeating this experiment with the same water and under

similar conditions, 0-026 part per 100,000 was yielded by the peroxide and 0048

by the permanganate. The addition of a further quantity of the sodium peroxide

and further distilling did not increase the quantity of ammonia produced, and it
was therefore evident that the sodium peroxide had failed to break down the

organic nitrogenous substances present to the same extent as had the alkaline

permanganate. In fact, we have since found it possible to obtain a fresh quantity

of ammonia from a water after treatment with sodium peroxide by the addition of

the alkaline permanganate. The following table gives the results obtained in

parts per 100,000 with four samples of water :

the peroxide, followed by permanganate, is in most cases about equal to that

obtained when tbe water is distilled with alkaline permanganate alone. There

appears to be no ratio between the quantities of ammonia evolved by the two re-

agents, and therefore the nitrogenous organic matter present in waters might be

divided into two classes, viz., that which is oxidised by the sodium peroxide and

that which resists such treatment. The results obtained by Wanklyn's process, as

compared with the total nitrogen present in a water, also show a differentiation in

the organic nitrogen substances present in waters, but this knowledge has hitherto

not been of any value owing to the complex nature of the problem. Further

experiments can alone decide whether the limited oxidation of the nitrogenous

matter in waters will throw any fresh light on the condition of these organic con-

Westituents of water.  have, however, noticed that in some cases a water which

lias been partially oxidised by the peroxide yields the remainder of its ammonia to

the alkaline permanganate with much greater rapidity than when the water has

Wenot been so treated.  suggest that the explanation of this phenomenon may be

due to the presence in waters of organic nitrogenous substances which, when

partially oxidised, are then in a condition to be completely broken up by the

stronger reagent. This result has been obtained with waters containing fresh

sewage, but we hope by taking solutions containing nitrogenous compounds of

known constitution to confirm this suggestion, and to show that in this reagent

we have an oxidising agent which will be useful in establishing the constitution

of the nitrogen in complex organic substances.

2. On the Application of Electrolysis to Qualitative Analysis. By Charles

       A. KoHN, Ph.D., B.Sc, Lecturer on Organic Chemistry, University

         College, Liverpool.

     Since the publication of C. Bloxam's papers on ' The Application of Electro-

lysis to the Detection of Poisonous Metals in Mixtures of Organic Matters ' ^
little has been done to apply this method of analysis to qualitative investigations,
despite the fact that Classen and his pupils, together with E. F. Smith and others,

have made rapid advances in electrolytic methods of quantitative analysis. Many

of these later methods offer special attraction for qualitative work, especially in
cases of medical and of medico-legal inquiry. They are not supposed to supersede

in any way the ordinary methods of qualitative analysis, but to serve as a final
and crucial means of identification for the more important mineral poisons. The

applicability of the methods for the detection of antimony, mercury, lead, copper,
and cadmium has been examined. The method originally devised by Bloxam for

the detection of arsenic has been more recently elaborated by Wolff, who has

--succeeded in detecting O'OOOOl grm. of arsenious acid electrolytically.
     Antimony. The method employed is that used in the quantitative estimation
·by electrolysis, a method devised by Classen, and which ensures a complete separa-
tion from antimony and tin. The precipitated sulphide is dissolved in potassium
sulphide, any polysulphides present oxidised with hydrogen peroxide, and the
solution electrolysed with a current of l"5-2'0 cc. of electrolytic gas per minute
(10'436 c.c. at 0° and 760 mm. = 1 ampere), a small circular piece of platinum
1 cm. in diameter being employed as the cathode. The deposited metal can be
confirmed for by evaporating a little ammonium sulphide on the foil. One part of

antimony in 1,600,000 parts of solution may be thus detected. The precipitation

of small quantities is complete in one hour.

Mefciiry is separated from a nitric acid solution as metal, on a small closely-
Awound platinum spiral.
                         current of 4-5 c.c. per minute can be used. As a

confirmatory test the spiral is washed, dropped into a test-tube, heated to sublime

the mercury, and then converted into the iodide by the addition of a small crystal
of iodine and warming gently : 0-0001 grm. of metal can be detected thus in

l.jO c.c. of solution.

Lead is precipitated either as peroxide at the anode from a nitric-acid solution

or as metal from an ammonium-oxalate solution ; the latter method is more deli-
cate, but the former has the advantage that it can be made approximately quanti-

tative. In this case also 0-0001 grm. is readily detected, the confirmation being

·effected by converting the metal or oxide into the sulphide or iodide.

Copper is electrolysed as usual from an acidified solution, and 0-00005 grm.

can be readily detected, the confirmation being effected by dissolving the precipi-

tated metal in acid and testing with potassium ferrocyanide. Quantitative results
with 1 mgrm. of metal are obtained thus.

     Cadmium is best deposited from a potassium cyanide solution, with a current of
-2 c.c. per minute. The yellow sulphide serves as the confirmatory test

0-0001 grm. of metal can be thus detected.

The detection of the above metallic poisons in urine can be effected directly by

these methods as described, but owing to the presence of the organic matter it is

necessary to pass the cui-rent twice as long as when aqueous solutions are employed.

In twenty-four hours a current of 1-2 c.c. per minute completely decomposes urine,

leaving a clear solution. In the case of lead the electrolysis of an ammonium-

oxalate solution gives a more delicate reaction than the separation as peroxide from
nitric acid solution. To detect these poisons in other cases the destruction of the
organic material with which they are associated, by the ordinary means, is

necessary.

     These electrolytic tests are one and a half time more delicate than the colori-
metric tests for antimony and copper by means of sulphm-etted hydrogen, and ten
times more delicate than the tests for mercury and lead by the same reagent.

It is further to be noted that the methods are in many cases methods of separa-

tion as well as of detection, e.g., the separation of lead from iron by electrolysis in
nitric acid solution. Also where it is desirable to obtaui approximately quantita-

tive results, electrolysis possesses a marked advantage over the usual colorimetric

processes, because the erroneous results due to the influence of the varying con-

stituents in the solutions tested on the reliability of the reaction are entirely

obviated.

    4. Apparatus for Extraction for Analysis of Oases Dissolved in Water.
   J5y Edgar B. 'Truman, Jf.D., F.C.S., Borough Analyst, Nottingham.

   A glass flask of 500 c.c. capacity is joined by means of its tubular termina-

tion to a second lower flask of 200 c.c. capacity by means of a water-joint.
In the lower flask is suspended from the upper one a thermometer, reading up to

150° C. From the neck of the upper flask proceed two millimetre tubes. The

right-hand one, after receiving a stopcock, expands into a cup having a
capacity of .30 c.c. The tube on the left rises to the level of the bottom of the

--cup. This tube has two tubes supplied with stopcocks joined on to it at right

angles one above and the other below. To the one above is attached, by a
water or glycerine joint, a mercury tube doubled on itself above and below,
and having a length when so doubled of 880 mm. This tube is graduated in
mm. from to 400 in two directions, downwards in the open limb and upwards

in the long limb, starting in each case from the level of the horizontal tuhe. This
tube is filled with mercury up to the zero points, and indicates the rate of exhaus-
tion of the apparatus, and is also a test of leakage.

     The second tube a little further on points downwards for attachment to a
Geissler's water-pump. Still further on a stopcock is let into the main horizontal
tube, which then bends downwards for communication with a Sprengel pump.

     The apparatus is put into connection with both mercurial and water-pumps,

and the stopcock at the base of the cup is closed. By means of the water-pump the

apparatus is exhausted in a great measure of air ; five minutes' pumping with high-
pressure water produces a vacuum of 730 mm., when the barometer stands at 75.3.
The water-pump stopcock is then closed, and exhaustion is completed by the
Sprengel in about thirty minutes more.

     The liquid to be examined for gases is then, after measurement, introduced by
the cup into the upper flask, whence it flows into the lower one.

     The liquid is allowed to stand for an hour, so that gases disengaged at ordinary
temperatures may come oil'. These are collected by the Sprengel and analysed in
the usual way.

     The vacuum having been restored, heat is cautiously applied to the lower flask
by means of a Bunseii burner. If carefully done there is no bumping. The effect
of heat is, by disengaging gas, to increase tension, and to enable the water to
become hotter. The mercury in the mercurial tube and that in the thermometer
rise. AVhen the mercury in both places remains constant the Bunsen burner is

removed.

     The gas given off by boiling is then collected and analysed.

6. The A]jplication of the Hydrogen Flame in an Ordinary Miner's Safety

    Lamp to Accurate and Delicate Gas Testing. By Professor Feank

      Clowes, D.Sc. Land.

     The 'flame cap' or halo seen in the dark above a pale flame in air containing
combustible gas serves as the most rapid and practical means of detecting the
presence of inflammable gas or vapour in the air. The method has been in common
use by the miner, but the oil flame which he uses for the purpose is wanting, not

only in delicacy, but also in accuracy. It will not readily detect the presence of less
than 3 per cent, of fire-damp in the air, whereas for modern purposes it should detect
less than 0'5 per cent. ; and, owing to the variation in the size and adjustment of

this flame when applied to testing, its indications are very variable, and are not of
a standard character. Many objections exist to the employment of a separate
alcohol lamp carried for testing purposes. None of these applies to the use of the
hydrogen flame, especially when it is applied in an ordinary safety lamp burning
oil from a wick in the usual way. The hj'drogen flame is the most delicate indi-
cator known, and it is applied of uniform size, giving standard and invariable

indications.

     The author's early work consisted in measunng with accuracy the height and

noting the appearance of the flame cap appearing over the standard 10 mm.

( = 0'4 inch) hydrogen flame. The flame was exposed for this purpose to air containing
known percentages of gas in the ' test chamber ' specially devised for the purpose.
The statement, previously made, that the hydrogen flame is the most delicate gas-
testing flame known was fully confirmed by comparing its indications with those
yielded by a small alcohol flame and by a reduced oil flame. The small alcohol
flame could not detect less than 1 per cent, of fire-damp, even under the most
favourable conditions ; the reduced oil flame could not detect with certainty less
than 3 per cent.

     The author then directed his attention to applying the hydrogen flame in a

practical way to the detection and measurement of minute quantities of fire-damp
in the air. This was ultimately effected by supplying the hydrogen from a small

steel cylinder containing the gas in a compressed condition. The cylinder can be
readily carried in the pocket, and, when necessary, it can be immediately attached
to the ordinary safety lamp, and made to furnish the standard hydrogen flame
burning at a jet in the lamp. The gas is kindled at the jet by the oil flame, which
is then extinguished. The accurate estimation of proportions of fire-damp in air
varying from 0'2 to 3 per cent, is rapidly and easily effected by the standard
hydrogen flame. Higher percentages are estimated either by reducing the size of
the hydrogen flame, or by employing the oil flame diminished in size until it
becomes non-luminous.

     The small pocket cylinder is under a pound in weight, and when freshly charged,
by being connected with a store cylinder at 120 atmospheres' pressure, it carries a
store of gas sufficing for over 200 tests. This combined lighting and testing safety
lamp has been found to be thoroughly practical in its nature after lengthened use
in several collieries, and it surpasses in convenience all the delicate and accurate
mine gas-testing apparatus yet described. The lamp, in a modified form, has been

adapted to detecting and measuring petroleum vapour in the air.

     The fact that this interesting substance is produced in such small quantities
made its further investigation a matter almost of impossibility. More recently,

however, Professor Perkin has found that the substitution of ethylene chloride for
the bromide is effectual in greatly increasing the yield of ethyl butanetetracarboxyl-

ate. As soon as the new method for the preparation of this substance had been
thoroughly worked out, I investigated, at the suggestion of Professor Perkin, some

of its derivatives, and I desire to give a brief notice of some of the results at which

we have arrived. When treated with sodium ethylate, ethyl butanetetracarboxyl-

ate forms a di-sodium compound, which reacts readily with the iodides or chlorides

of the alcohol radicals. For example, when acted on by methyl iodide the reaction

takes place as follows :

ethyl dimethylbutanetetracarboxylate being formed,

                ' Perkin, Journ. C. S., 61, 1.
--730 REPORT 1893.

     lu tlie course of this investigation I have already made a detailed study of the

di- methyl, di-ethyl, di-cetyl, and di-benzyl derivatives of ethyl butanetetracarboxyl-
ate, formed by the action of alcohol radicals on its di-sodium compound.

     These derivatives on hydrolysis yield tetracarboxylic adds, which possess some
veiy remarkable properties, which have not been, so far as I know, observed in the
case of any other organic acids. These acids, although they contain four carboxyl

groups, do not in all cases behave as tetrabasic acids. On determining their basi-

city by titration with standard solution of potassium hydrate, some of them react
as di-basic acids. Notably is this the case with di-benzyl butanetetracarboxylic

acid, the result being the same whether phenol phthalein or litmus be used as the

indicator. In this connection it is to be noted that on forming the silver or calcium

salts of di-benzyl butanetetracarboxylic acid, they were found to have the formuliB

CjHjoOgAg, and CjoHjoOgCa + SH^O respectively. On the other hand, di-methyl

and di-ethyl butanetetracarboxylic acid on titration with potassium hydrate give
different results according as phenol phthalein or litmus is used as an indicator.

They behave as tetrabasic acids when phenol phthalein is employed. If, how-

ever, one or two drops of litmus solution be added to the solution of these acids in
potassium hydrate, which, as shown by phenol phthalein, had been neutraUsed by

hydrochloric acid, a distinctly blue colouration is produced. On adding more

hydrochloric acid the blue colouration changes gradually to a red tint, and the
solution appears to become neutral to litmus, only when sufficient hydrochloric
acid is added to neutralise one half of the potassium hydrate, which was equivalent,
as shown by phenol phthalein, to the tetracarboxylic acid present. The silver

salts of di-methyl and di-ethyl butanetetracarboxylic acid, unlike that of di-benzyl

butanetetracarboxylic acid, are tetrabasic.

    The di-substitiited butanetetracarboxylic acids we have obtained, when heated

to 200°, all lose two molecules of carbonic anhydride, yielding di-substituted adipic
acids. The study of these acids appeared to be especially interesting in view of
the recent work on the di-substituted succinic, and glutaric, and pimelic acids. In

accordance with Van 't Hoff's theory, the di-substituted succinic and glutaric acids
are found in two modifications. The substituted pimelic acids, on the other hand,

have only been found in one modification.

Considerable interest is therefore attached to the question of isomerism in the

Wesubstituted adipic acids.  have found that the di-substituted adipic acids,

obtained from substituted butanetetracarboxyUc acids, invariably exist in two

modifications, which are readily capable of separation by crystallisation from

benzene or toluene.

     The difference between the melting points of the two modifications is usually

60-80°. For example, two modifications of di-benzyl adipic acid were isolated,

one crystallising in diamond-shaped crystals, which melted at 211-3°, the other

crystallising in six-sided prisms melting at 152°. Of these derivatives of adipic
acid the di-methyl alone have been previously obtained. They were prepared by

Zelinsky, by the hydrolysis of ethyl dicyandimethyl adipate.'

     Experiments on succinic acid have shown that the more alkyl groups there are
introduced, the more readily can an anhydride formation take place, and it was
thought that this would also be the case in the adipic series. Now, the anhydride
of adipic acid has been formed, yet on attempting to form anhydrides by heating
the substituted adipic acids in sealed tubes with acetyl chloride, in no case could

any evidence of an anhydride formation be obtained. On the other hand, whether

the higher melting or lower melting modification was employed, a partial conversion
into the other modification was eflected. This result is remarkable, and cannot at

present be understood.

     The author has also formed ethyl dibromohutanetetracarboxylate, by the

action of bromine on a solution of ethyl butanetetracarboxylate in chloroform.
It crystallises in magnificent prisms, which melt at 82-3°. The author is engaged
in the investigation of this substance, and expects interesting results from the

etudy of its derivatives and its use in synthetical chemistry.

   10. Oil the Salts of a nevj Flaiimun-sulplmrea Base. By "W. J. Sell,

                 M.A., F.G.S., F.I.C., and T. H. Easterfield, M.A.

     The authors have obtained the salts of a base Pt(CSN,,H,)4(OH)2 by the action
of platinic chloride upon a hot solution of thiocarbamide in dilute hydrochloric
acid, and subsequent addition of the acid the salts of which are required. The
chloride Pt(CSN,HJ CL,, sulphate Pt(CSN,,Hj)jS04, and the picrate have been pre-
pared and analysed.

     The free base corresponding apparently to Eeiset's first base Pt(NH,,)4(0H)o
has not yet been obtained pure, for its solutions undergo partial decomposition upon
evaporation even in a vacuum. That the crystalline residue thus formed contains
the base is evident from the fact that the above-mentioned salts can be regenerated
from it,

    A. W. V. Hofmann has shown that citrazinic acid is in all probability to be re-

garded as a, a' dioxyiso-nicotinic acid. In this paper it is shown that in a number
of cases the tautomeric keto formula more readily represents the reactions of the
substance. The chlorine, bromine, and isonitroso, and derivatives prepared with
a view to testing the constitution are quite in accordance with the keto formula,
whilst the phenylhydrazo derivative has not been sufBciently studied for the

authors to decide its constitution. Isonitroso-citrazinic acid

with dilute sulphuric acid it yields quinhydroketopyridin

which on oxidation with dilute nitric acid yields the corresponding quinone, and by

reduction appears to yield the hydroquinone which has not yet been obtained in

the analytically pure condition.

The above-mentioned quinhydroketopyridin dissolves in alkaline solutions with

the production of a deep-blue solution, and it appears to be to this cause that the

Bycharacteristic ' nitrite ' test for citrazinic acid is due.  the oxidation of isonitroso-

citrazinic acid with nitric or nitrous acids a bright yellow acid results which gives

very characteristic salts. The acid potassium and ammonium salts are precipitated

in the crystalline condition by adding the chlorides of these radicles to an aqueous

solution of the acid. Although the acid contains only two hydrogen atoms these

are both replaceable by metals. Reduction of the yellow acid leads to the formation

of the quinhydroketopyridin.

By the action of cold nitric acid upon citrazinic acid a substance is produced

which appears to be represented by the formula

i.e., it seems to be a nitroquinoketopyridin ; the calcium salt of this substance
crystallises in beautiful yellow needles. Experiments are also in progress upon

the products of reduction of citrazinamide. The reduction takes the same course
as in the normal reduction of amides of the aromatic series, an alcohol being

produced.

     12. On a Nottingham Sandstone containing Barium Sulphate as a
           Cementing Material. By Professor Frank Clowes, B.Sc.

     The author draws attention to papers presented by him to former meetings of
the British Association (' Brit. Assoc. Reports,' 1885, p. 1088, and 1889, p. 594),
These papers described sandstone extending over a large area at Bramcote and
Stapleford, in the immediate neighbourhood of Nottingham, in which crystalUsed
barium sulphate occurred in large quantity. Bramcote and Stapleford Hills and
the Hemlock stone were wholly composed of such stone. The largest quantity
found in the specimens analysed reached 50 per cent. ; complete analyses were
given of specimens of sandstone from different parts of this district. The sulphate
was in a beautifully micro-crystalline condition, and the crystals had been identified
and separated both lay Professor Lebour and by Mr. J. J. H. Teall. In some
parts of the sandstone the barium sulphate uniformly permeated the mass. In

other parts the sulphate occurred in streaks or network, the latter distribution

leading to a curious mammiUated weathering of the surface of the rock, owing to
removal of the uncemented grains. Occasionally the cementing material occurred

in nodular patches, as seen in sections of the sandstone : this led to the formation

of the so-called * pebble sand-beds' at the top of one of these sandstone hills. The
beds were the effect of weathering; the uncemented sand-grains became loose
sand, and disseminated amongst the loose sand were the ' pebbles,' consisting
of masses of sand-grains bound together by barium sulphate. The author has not
been able to obtain from any source evidence of the occurrence of similar sandstone
in any other part of this country ; he is still without direct evidence whether the
sulphate has been deposited as such, as in the colliery boxes of Durham, or is the
result of chemical change occurring between calcium sulphate in solution coming
into contact with barium carbonate already deposited in the sandstone.

President of the Sectioit.--J. J. H. Teall, M.A., F.E.S., F.G.S.

                                THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

            The President delivered the following Address:

       It is a striking and remarkable fact that, although enormous progress has been
      made in petrographical science during the last hundred years, there has been com-
       paratively little advance so far as broad, general theories relating to the origin of
       rocks are concerned. In Hutton's ' Theory of the Earth,' the outlines of which

   --were published in 1788, the following operations are clearly recognised: The

       degradation of the earth's surface by aqueous and atmospheric agencies; the
       deposition of the debris beneath the waters of the ocean ; the consolidation and
      metamorphosis of the sedimentary deposits by the internal heat and by the injec-
       tion of molten mineral matter; the disturbance and upheaval of the oceanic
       deposits ; and, lastly, the formation of rocks by the consolidation of molten
       material both at the surface and in the interior of the earth.

            Hutton regarded these operations as efficient causes ordained for the purpose of
       producing an earth adapted to sustain animal and vegetable life. His writings
       are saturated with the teleological philosophy of the age to which they belong, and
       some of his arguments strike us, therefore, as strange and inconclusive ; moreover,
      the imperfect state of the sciences of chemistry and physics occasionally led him

      into serious error. Notwithstanding these imperfections, we are compelled to
      admit, when viewing his work in the light of modern knowledge, that we can find

       the traces, and sometimes far more than the traces, of those broad general theories
       relating to dynamical geology which are current at the present day.

            If Hutton had contented himself with proving the reality of the agencies to
       which reference has been made, it is probable that his views would have been

      generally accepted. But he went much further than this, and boldly maintained
      that one or other of these agencies, or several combined, would account for all the
       phenomena with which the geologist has to deal. It was this that gave rise to the

       controversial fire which blazed up with such fury during the early years of this
       century, and whose dying embers have not yet been extinguished.

            The views of Hutton were in strong contrast to those of Werner, the celebrated

     professor of mineralogy at Freiberg, to whom science owes a debt of gratitude as

      great as that due to the Scottish physician. The value of a man's work must not

   --simply be judged by the truth of the theory which he holds. I consider that the

       Wernerian theory by which I understand a reference to the early stages of

   --planetary evolution for the purpose of explaining certain geological facts has

      been on the wane from the time it was propounded down to the present day ; but

     I claim to be second to none in my admiration for the knowledge, genius, and

      enthusiasm of the illustrious Saxon professor. The uniformitarian doctrines of
       Hutton gave a very decided character to the theoretical views of British geologists
       during the middle of the century, in consequence of the eloquent support of

I

Lyell ; but of late tliere has been a tendency to bark back to a modified form of

Wernerism. This tendency can, I think, be largely traced to the recognition of

evolution as a factor in biology and physical astronomy. The discoveries in these

sciences may necessitate a modification of the views held by some of the extreme

advocates of uniformitarianism. This admission, hovcever, by no means carries

with it the conclusion that the methods based on the doctrine of uniformitarianism

must be discarded. If I read the history of geology aright, every important

advance in the theoretical interpretation of observed facts relating to physical

geology has been made by the application of these methods. It does not, of course,

foUow that the progress in the future will be exactly along the same lines as that

in the past ; but, if I am right in the opinion I have expressed, it is a strong reason

for adhering to the old methods until they have been proved to be inapplicable to

at least some of the facts with which the physical geologist has to deal. Let us

consider for a moment whether the recognition of evolution as a factor in biology

and physical astronomy gives an a priori probability to some form of Wernerism.

The period of time represented by our fossiliferous records is perhaps equivalent

to that occupied by the evolution of the vertebrata, but all the great subdivisions

of the invertebrata were living in the Cambrian period, and must have been

differentiated in still earlier times. Is it not probable, therefore, that the fossili-

ferous records at present known represent a period insignificant in comparison

with that during which life has existed upon the earth ? Again, is it not probable

that the period during which life has existed is a still smaller fraction of that

which has elapsed since the formation of the primitive crust ? And if so, what d

priori reason have we for believing that the rocks accessible to observation contain

the records of the early stages of the planet's history ? But the advocates of the

diluted forms of Wernerism which find expression in geological writings at the

present day almost invariably refer to recent speculations in cosmical physics. The

views of astronomers have always had a powerful influence on those of geologists.

Hutton wrote at a time when the astronomical world had been profoimdly affected

by Lagrange's discovery, in 1776, of the periodicity of the secular changes in the

forms of the planetary orbits. The doubts as to the stability of the solar system

which the recognition of these changes had inspired were thus removed, and astro-

nomers could then see in the physical system of the universe ' no vestige of a
-- Nowbeginning no prospect of an end."
                                         it is otherwise. Tidal friction and the

dissipation of energy by the earth and by the sun are each referred to as fixing a

limit to the existing conditions. I have not the knowledge necessary to enable me

to discuss these questions, and I will therefore admit, for the sake of argument,

that the phenomena referred to indicate the lines along which the physical evolu-

tion of our planet has taken place ; but does it follow that geologists should desert
a working hypothesis which has led to brilliant results in the past for one which

has been tried again and again and always found wantinsr ?

If there were absolute unanimity amongst mathematical physicists, it might be

necessary for us to reconsider our position. This, however, is not the case. After

referring to the argument from tidal friction, Professor Darwin, in his address to

--the Mathematical and Physical Section for 1886, says: 'On the whole, then, I

can neither feel the cogency of the argument from tidal friction itself, nor, accepts

ing it, can I place any reliance on the limits which it assigns to geological history.'

In reviewing the argument from the secular cooling of the earth, he points out

that the possibility of the generation of heat in the interior by tidal friction has

been ignored, and that the thermal data on which the calculations are based are

not sufficiently complete to remove all reasonable doubt. lie regards the case

depending on the secular cooling of the sun as the strongest ; but it is evident

that, in view of undreamt-of possibilities, he would not allow it to have much

weight in the face of adverse geological evidence. In conclusion he says :

' Although speculations as to the future course of science are usually of little avail,

yet it seems as likely that meteorology and geology will pass the word of command

to cosmical physics as the converse. At present our knowledge of a definite limit to

geological time has so little precision that we should do wrong to summarily reject
any theories which appear to demand longer periods of time than those which now
                   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.               735

appear allowable. lu each branch of science hypothesis forms the nucleus for the

aggregation of observation, and as long as facts are assimilated and co-ordinated

we ought to follow our theory.' Now, my point is that the uniformitarian

hypothesis, as applied to the rocks we can examine, has assimilated and co-ordinated
so many facts in the past, and is assimilating and co-ordinating so many new dis-
coveries, that we should continue to follow it, rather than plunge into the trackless
waste of cosmogonical speculation in pursuit of what may after all prove to be a

will-o'-the-wisp.

As an additional illustration of the want of agreement amongst mathematical

physicists on questions relating to the earth, I maj^ refer to certain papers by

Mr. Chree.* This author maintains that the modern theory of elasticity points

to the conclusion that if a spherical globe, composed of a nearly incompressible

elastic solid of the size of the earth, were set rotating as the earth is rotating, it

Howwould take the form which the earth actually possesses.  is the question of

the fixity of the earth's axis affected by Mr. Chree's researches, and by the recent

observations which prove a simultaneous change of latitude, in opposite directions,

in Europe and at Honolulu ? If geological facts point to a shifting of the position

of the axis, is there any dynamical reason why they should not receive due con-

Wesideration? Geologists want as much freedom as possible.  do not object to

any limitations which are necessary in the interest of science, and we cordially

welcome, and as a matter of fact are largely dependent upon, assistance from other

departments of knowledge ; but those who would help us should bear in mind that
the problems we have still to solve are extremely difficult and complex, so that if

certain avenues of thought are closed on insufficient grounds by arguments of the
validity of which we are unable to judge, but which we are naturally disposed to

take on trust, the difficulties of our task may be greatly augmented and the

progress of science seriously retarded. So far as I can judge, there is no a priori

reason why we should believe that any of the rocks we now see were formed

Weduring the earlier stages of planetary evolution.  are free to examine them

in our own way, and to draw on the bank of time to any extent that may seem

necessary.

    For some years past the greater part of my time has been devoted to a study
of the composition and structure of rocks, and it has occurred to me that I
might, on the present occasion, give expression to my views on the question as

to whether the present position of petrographical science necessitates any important

modification in the theoretical views introduced by the uniformitarian geologist.?.
Must we supplement the ideas of Hutton and Lyell by any reference to primordial

conditions when we endeavour to realise the manner in which the rocks we cau
see and handle were produced ? The question I propose to consider is not whether
some of these rocks may have been formed under physical conditions dilTerent from

--those which now exist life is too short to make a discussion of geological possi-
--bilities a profitable pursuit but whether the present state of petrographical science

renders uniformitarianism untenable as a working hypothesis ; and, if so, to what
extent. There is nothing original in what I am about to lay before you. All
that I propose to do is to select from the numerous facts and more or less conflict-
ing views bearing on the question I have stated a few of those which appear to

me to be of considerable importance.

     The sedimentary rocks contain the history of life upon the earth, and on this
account, as well as on account of their extensive development at the surface, they
have necessarily received an amount of attention which is out of all proportion to
their importance as constituent portions of the planet. They are, after all, only
skin deep. If they were totally removed from our globe its importance as a mem-
ber of the solar system would not be appreciably diminished. The general laws
governing the formation and deposition of these sediments have been fairly well

    ' C. Chree, ' On Some Applications of Physics and Mathematics to Geology,'

Phil. Mag., vol. sxxii. (1891), pp. 233, 342.

understood for a long time. Hutton, aa we have already seen, clearly realised that

the land is always wasting away, and that the materials are accumulating on the
beds of rivers, lakes, and seas. The chemical effects of denudation are mainly seen
in the hreakiug up of certain silicates and the separation of their constituents into
those which are soluble and those which are insoluble under surface conditions.
The mechanical effects are seen in the disintegration of rocks, and this may, under
certain circumstances, take place without the decomposition of their component
minerals.' Quartz and the aluminous silicates, which enter largely into the compo-
sition of shales and clays, are two of the most important insoluble constituents. It

must be remembered, however, that felspars often possess considerable powers of
resistance, and rocks which contain them may be broken up without complete or

anything like complete decomposition of these minerals. Orthoclase, microcline,
and oligoclase are the varieties which most successfully resist decomposition ; and,
as a natural consequence, occur most abundantly in sedimentary deposits. It is

commonly stated that when felspars are attacked the general effect is to reduce
them to a fine powder, composed of a hydrated silicate of alumina, and to remove
the alkalies, lime, and a portion of the silica. But, as Dr. Sterry Hunt has so

frequently urged, the removal of alkalies is imperfect, for they are almost invariably
present in argillaceous deposits. Three, four, and even five per cent., consisting

mainly of potash, may frequently be found. This alkali appears to be present in

micaceous minerals, which are often produced, as very minute scales, during the

decomposition of felspars. White mica, whether formed in this way or as a product

of igneous or metamorphic action, possesses great powers of resistance to the ordi-

nary surface agencies of decomposition, and so may be used over and over again
in the making of sedimentary deposits. Brown mica is also frequently separated

from granite and other rocks, and deposited as a constituent of sediments ; but it is

far more liable to decomposition than the common white varieties, and its geological

life is, therefore, comparatively short." Small crystals and grains of zircon, rutile,

ilmenite, cyanite, and tourmaline are nearly indestructible, and occur as accessory

constituents in the finer-grained sandstones.^ Garnet and staurolite also possess

considerable powers of resistance, and are not unfrequently present in the same
deposits. If we except the last two minerals and a few others, such as epidote, the

silicates containing lime, iron, and magnesia are, as a rule, decomposed by surface

agencies and the bases removed in solution ; augite, enstatite, hornblende, and

lime-felspars are extremely rare as constituents of ordinary sediments.

     The insoluble constituents resulting from the waste of land surfaces are deposited

as gravel, sand, and mud ; the soluble constituents become separated as solid bodies

by evaporation of the water in inland seas and lagoons, by chemical action, and by
organic life. They are deposited as carbonates, sulphates, chlorides, and sometimes,

as in the case of iron and manganese, as oxides. The soluble silica may be deposited

in the opaline condition by the action of sponges, radiolaria, and diatoms, or as

sinter.

The question that we have now to consider is whether there is any marked

difference between ancient and modern sediments. One of the oldest deposits in

the British Isles is the Torridon sandstone of the north-west of Scotland. The

recent discovery of Olenellxis high up in the stratified rocks which unconformably

Nowoverlie this deposit has placed its pre-Cambrian age beyond all doubt.  this

formation is mainly composed of quartz and felspar, at least in its upper part, and

the latter mineral is both abundant and very slightly altered. One is naturally

--tempted, at first sight, to associate the freshness of the felspar with the great age

of the rock to assume either that the sand was formed at a time when the chemical

agents of decomposition did not act with the same force as now, or that they had

Anot been in operation for a sufficient length of time to eliminate the felspar.
pure quartzose sand is probably never formed by the direct denudation of a granitic

or gneissose area. The coarser sediments thus produced contain in most, if not in
all, cases a considerable amount of felspar. But felspar is more liable to decompo-
sition by percolating waters when it occurs as a constituent of grit than when
present in the parent rock. Silica may thus be liberated in a soluble form and

subsequently deposited on the grains of quartz so as to give rise to secondary
crystalline faces, and kaolin may be produced as beautiful six-sided tablets in the
Wheninterstices of the grit.
                                 the gi-it is in its turn denuded the felspar is still

further reduced in amount, and a purer quartz-sand is formed. As the coarser

detrital material is used over and over again, thus measuring different periods of
time like the sand in an hour-glass, the felspar and other decomposable minerals

are gradually eliminated. The occurrence of a large amount of fresh felspar in the

Torridon sandstone might, I say, at first sight be thought to be due to the great

age of the rock. Any tendency to accept a view of this kind is, however at once
checked when attention is paid to the pebbles in the coarser conglomeratic beds of

--the same deposit. These consist largely of quartzite a rock formed by the con-

Wesolidation of as pure a quartz-sand as any known to exist in the later formations.
        are therefore led to_ the conclusion that the special features of the Torridon

sandstone are not a function of time, but of the local conditions under which the
rock was produced.

A similar conclusion may be reached by considering other types of sediment.

^\lien the stratified rocks of the different geological periods represented in any
limited area are compared with each other certain marked differences may be

observed, but the difl!"erent types formed in any one area at different times can

often be parallelled with the diflTerent types formed in different areas at the same
time, and also with those now forming beneath the waters of rivers, lakes and seas.
Deep sea, shallow water, littoral and terrestrial deposits can he recognised in the
formations belonging to many geological periods, from the most ancient to the most
                                 and there is no evidence that
recent                                                          any of  our  sedimentary rocks  carry us back
                              ;

to a time when the physical conditions of the planet were materially difierent from
those which now exist. After reviewing all the evidence at my disposal, I must
however, admit that the coarser as well as the finer deposits of the earlier periods
appear to be more complex in composition than those of the later. The grits of the

Palseozoic formations, taken as a whole, contain more felspar than the sandstones of
the Mesozoic and Tertiary formations, and the slates and shales of the former contain
more alkalies than the clays of the latter. This statement will hold o-ood for the
British Isles, even when allowance is made for the enormous amount "of volcanic

material amongst the older rocks--a phenomenon which I hold to be of purely

local significance--but I strongly suspect that it will not be found to apply univer-

AHsally. In any case, it is not of much importance from our present point of view.

      geologists will admit that denudation and deposition were taking place in
pre-Cambrian times, under chemical and physical conditions very similar to, if not

identical with, those of the present day.

     There is, however, one general consideration of more serious import. Additions

to the total amount of detrital material are now being made by the decomposition

of igneous rocks, and there is no doubt that this has been going on during the
whole period of time represented by our stratified deposits. It follows, therefore,

as a necessary consequence that strict uniformitarianism is untenable, unless we
suppose that igneous magmas are formed by the melting of sediments.
_ So far we have been dealing with the characters of sedimentary rocks as seen

in hand-specimens rather than with those which depend on their distribution over
large areas. Thanks to Delesse ^ and the officers of the ' Challenger ' Expedition,^

an attempt has now been made to construct maps on which the distribution of the

sediments in course of formation at the present time is laid down. It is impossible

to exaggerate the importance of such maps from a geological point of view, for on
the facts which they express rests the correct interpretation of our stratigraphical

soundings, often taken at great distances apart. ^ An examination of such imper-

fect maps as we have raises many questions of great interest and importance, to

--one of which I wish to direct special attention not because it is new, but because

it is often overlooked. The boundary lines separating the distinct types of deposit
on these maps are not, of course, chronological lines. They do not separate sedi-

ments produced at different times, but different sediments simultaneously forming

in different places. Now, the lines on our geological maps are xisually drawn by

tracing the boundary between two distinct lithological types, and, as a natural

consequence, such lines will not always be chronological lines. It is only when

the existing outcrop runs parallel with the margin of the original area of deposit

--that this is the fact. Consider the case of a subsiding area or, to avoid theory,
--let us say an area in which the water-level rises relatively to the land and, for

the sake of illustration, let us suppose that the boundary separating the districts

over which sand and mud are accumulating remains parallel to the old coast-line

during the period of deposition. This line will follow the retreating coast, so that

if, after the consolidation, emergence, and denudation of the deposits, the outcrop

happens to be oblique to the old shore, then the line on the geological map sepa-

rating clay and sand will not be of chronological value. That portion of it which

lies nearer to the position of the vanished land will represent a later period than

that which lies further away. If such organisms as ammonites leave their remains

in the different deposits, and thus define different chronological horizons with

approximate accuracy, the imperfection of the lithological boundary as a chrono-

logical horizon will become manifest. It is not that the geological map is wrong.

Such maps have necessarily to be constructed with reference to economic considera-

tions, and from this point of view the lithological boundaries are of paramount

importance. They are, moreover, in many cases the only boundaries that can be

actually traced.- The geological millennium will be near at hand when we can

construct maps which shall represent the distribution of the different varieties of

sediment for each of the different geological periods. All we can say at present is

that increase of knowledge in this direction tends greatly to strengthen the uni-

Weformitarian hypothesis.  can see, for example, that during Triassic times

marine conditions prevailed over a large part of what is now the great mountain-

belt of the Euro-Asiatic continent, whilst littoral and terrestrial conditions existed

in the north of Europe ; and we can catch glimpses of the onward sweep of the

sedimentary zones during the great Cretaceous transgression, culminating in the

widespread deep-sea * conditions under which the Chalk was deposited.

Wo turn now to the igneous rocks.  myIt is no part of  purpose to treat in

detail of the growth of knowledge from an historical point of view and to attempt

to allot to each observer the credit due to him ; but there is one name that I
desire to mention in this connection, because it is that of a man who clearly

proved the essential identity of ancient and modern volcanic rocks by the appli-

cation of precise petrograpbical methods at a time when there was a very general

belief that the Tertiary and pre-Tertiary rocks were radically distinct. I need

hardly say that I refer to Mr. Samuel Allport.* He wrote at a time when ob-

servers in this country had to prepare their own sections, and those who, like
myself, have had the privilege of examining many of his slides scarcely know

--which to admire most the skill and patience of which they are the evidence, or

the conciseness and accuracy of his petrographical descriptions. His papers do

not occupy a large number of pages, but they are based on an amount of obser-

vation which is truly surprising. The general conclusions at which he arrived as

to the essential identity of ancient and modern igneous rocks are expressed with

the utmost confidence, and one feels, after going over his material, that this con-

fidence was thoroughly justified. It is curious now to note that the one British

champion of the distinctness of the Tertiary and pre-Tertiary rocks pointed to the

difference between the Antrim and Limerick traps. These traps differ in exactly

the same way as do the corresponding Tertiary and pre-Tertiary continental rocks,
with this important difference. On the Continent the ophitic structure is cha-

racteristic of the pre-Tertiary rocks, whereas in the north of Ireland it is a
Wemarked feature of those of Tertiary age.
                                                                     see, therefore, that the arguments

for the distinctness of the two sets of rocks derived from the two areas, based in

both cases on perfectly accurate observations, neutralise each other, and the case

hopelessly breaks down as regards the basalts and dolerites.

In this country it is now generally recognised that, when allowance is made

for alterations which are necessarily more marked in the earlier than in the later

rocks, there is no important difference either in structure or composition between

the rhyolites, andesites, and basalts of the Palfeozoic and Tertiary periods. But

identity of structure and composition may in this case be taken to imply identity

Weas to the physical conditions under which the rocks were produced.                            are thus

led to picture in our minds long lines of volcanoes fringing the borders of Palaeo-

zoic continents and rising as islands in the Palteozoic seas. Then, as now, there

issued from the craters of these volcanoes enormous masses of fragmental material,

a large portion of which was blown to dust by the explosive escape of steam and

other gases from the midst of  molten  rock                          and  then, as  now, there  issued from
                                                                  ;

fissures on their flanks vast masses of lava which consolidated as rhyolite, andesite,

Weand basalt.  may sum up the case as regards the volcanic rocks by saying that,

80 long as observations are confined to a limited area, doubts may arise as to the

truth of the uniformitarian view, but these doubts gradually fade away as the area

of observation is extended. There are still some outstanding difficulties, such as the

apparent absence of leucite lavas amongst the Palaeozoic formations; but as many

similar difficulties have been overcome in the past, it is improbable that those

which remain are of a very formidable character.

     So far we have been referring to rocks formed at the surface of the earth
under conditions similar to those now in operation. But there are others, such as

granite, gneiss, and mica-schist, which are obviously unlike any of the products of
surface agencies. If these rocks are forming now, it must be beneath the surface.
This point was clearly realised by Hutton. Granite was proved by him to be an
igneous rock of subterranean origin. His conclusions as to the formation of the
schists are expressed in a passage so remarkable when viewed in connection with
what I regard as the tendency of modern research that I make no apology for

quoting it at length. ' If, in examining our land, we shall find a mass of matter
which had been evidently formed originally in the ordinary manner of stratifica-
tion, but which is now extremely distorted in its structure, and displaced in its

--position which is also extremely consolidated in its mass, and variously changed
--in its composition which therefore has the marks of its original or marine com-

position extremely obliterated, and many subsequent veins of melted mineral
matter interjected ; we should then have reason to suppose that here were masses

of matter which, though not different in their origin from those that are gradually
deposited at the bottom of the ocean, have been more acted upon by subterranean
heat and the expanding power, that is to say, have been changed in a greater
degree by the operations of the mineral region. If this conclusion shall be
thought reasonable, then here is an explanation of all the peculiar appearances
of the Alpine schist us masses of our land, those parts which have been erroneously

considered as piimitive in the constitution of tlie earth.' ' Surely it is not claiming

too much for our author to say that we have there, sketched in broad outline, the
theories of thermal and dynamic metamorphism which are attracting so much

attention at the present day.

     The hypogene origin of the normal plutonic rocks and their formation at
different periods, even as late as the Tertiary, are facts which are now so generally

recoo-nised that we may leave these rocks without further comment and pass on to

the consideration of the crystalline schists.

    Everyone Imows that the statement, ' lie who runs may read,' is untrue when

the stratigraphical interpretation of an intensely folded and faulted district is

concerned. The complexity produced by the earth-movements in such regions

can only be unravelled by detailed work after definite palajontological and litho-
logical horizons have been established. But if the statement be untrue when

applied to districts composed of ordinary stratified rocks, still less can it be true of

regions of crystalline schist where the movements have often been much more

intense; where the original characters of the rocks have been profoundly modified ;

and where all distinct traces of fossils have in most cases been obliterated. If
detailed work like that of Professor Lapworth at Dobb's Linn was required to

solve the stratigraphical difficulties of the Southern Uplands, is it not probable that

even more detailed work will be required to solve the structural problems of such
a district as the Highlands of Scotland, where the earth-stresses, though some-
what similar, have operated with greater intensity, and where the injection of

molten mineral matter has taken place more than once both on a large and on a

small scale ? With these few general remarks by way of introduction, I will now
call attention to what appear to me to be the most promising lines of investigation

in this department of geology.

    The crystalline schists certainly do not form a natural group. Some are un-

doubtedly plutonic igneous rocks showing original fluxion ; others are igneous rocks

which have been deformed by earth-stresses subsequent to consolidation ; others,

again, are sedimentary rocks metamorphosed by dynamic and thermal agencies, and

more or less injected with 'molten mineral matter' ; and lastly, some cannot be
classified with certainty under any of these heads. So much being granted, it is

obvious that we must deal with this petrographical complex by separating from it

those rocks about the origin of which there can be no reasonable doubt. Until this

separation has been effected, it is quite impossible to discuss with profit the question

as to whether any portions of the primitive crust remain. In order to carry out this

work it is necessary to establish some criterion by which the rocks of igneous may

be separated from those of sedimentary origin. Such a criterion may, I think, be
found, at any rate in many cases, by combining chemical with field evidence.- If

associated rocks possess the composition of grits, sandstones, shales, and limestones,

and contain also traces of stratification, it seems perfectly justifiable to conclude

that they must have been originally formed by processes of denudation and

deposition. That we have such rocks in the Alps and in the Central Highlands of
Scotland, to mention only two localities, will be admitted by all who are familiar

with those regions. Again, if the associated rocks possess the composition of

io-neous products, it seems equally reasonable to conclude that they are of igneous

origin. Such a series we find in the north-west of Scotland, in the Malvern Hills,

and at the Lizard. In applying the test of chemical composition it is very neces-

sary to remember that it must be based, not on a comparison of individual speci-
Amens, but of groups of specimens.
                                    granite and an arkose, a granitic gneiss and

a gneiss formed by the metamorphosis of a grit, may agree in chemical and even

in mineralogical composition. The chemical test would therefore utterly fail if

employed for the purpose of discriminating between these rocks. But when we

introduce the principle of paragenesis it enables us in many cases to distinguish

between them. The granitic gneiss will be associated with rocks having the

composition of diorites, gabbros, and peridotites ; the sedimentary gneiss, with rocks

answering to sandstones, shales, and limestones. Apply this test to the gneisses of
Scotland, and I helieve it will be found in many cases to furnish a solution of the
problem. Caution, however, is necessary ; for crystal-building and the formation of
segregation veins and patches in the sedimentary schists clearly prove that a

migration of constituents takes place under certain circumstances.

     Recent work on tlie gneisses and schists of igneous composition has shown that
the parallel structure, by no means invariably present, is sometimes the result of
fluxion during the final stages of consolidation, and sometimes due to the plastic

deformation of solid rocks. When compared with masses of ordinaiy plutonic

rock, the principal points of diftljrence, apart from those due to secondary dynamic

causes, depend on what may be called their extreme petrographical differentiation.

Indications of differentiation may, however, be seen in the contemporaneous veins

and basic patchee so common in ordinary irruptive bosses, but they are never so
marked as in gneissic regions, like those of the north-west of Scotland, where

specimens answering in composition to granites, diorites, and even peridotites

may be collected repeatedly in very limited areas. The nearest approach to the

conditions of gneissose regions is to be found in connected masses of diverse
plutonic rocks, such as those which are sometimes found on the borders of great

granitic intrusions.

     The tectonic relations of those gneisses which resemble igneous rocks in

composition fully bear out the plutonic theory as to their origin. Thus, the intru-
sive character of granitic gneiss in a portion of the Himalayas has been demon-

strated by General McMahon.^ The protogiue of Mont Blanc has been investigated

by M. Levy - with the same result. Most significant of all are the discoveries in

the vast Archiean region of Canada. Professor Lawson ^ has shown that immense

areas of the so-called Laurentian gneiss in the district north-west of Lake Superior

are intrusive in the surrounding rocks, and therefore newer, not older, than these.

Professor Adams* has quite recently established a similar fact as regards the

--anorthosite rocks--the so-called Norian of the Saguenay River and other districts

lying near the eastern margin of the ' Canadian shield.' Now that the intrusive

character of so many gneisses is being recognised, one wonders where the tide of

Howdiscovery will stop.  long will it be before the existence of gneisses of Tertiary

age will be generally admitted ? At any rate, the discoveries of recent years have

compelled the followers of Wernerian methods to evacuate large slices of territory.

    Turning now to the gneisses and schists which resemble sedimentary rocks in
composition, we note that the parallel structure may be due to original stratifica-

tion, to subsequent deformation, or to both of these agencies combined. It must

also be remembered that they have often been injected with igneous material, as

Hutton pointed out. Where this has followed parallel planes of weakness, .we

have a banding due to alternations of igneous and sedimentary material. This
injection lit par lit has been shown by M. Levy to be a potent cause in the forma-

tion of certain banded gneisses.

     Will the various agencies to which reference has been made explain all the

phenomena of the crystalline schists and gneisses ? I do not think that the present

state of our knowledge justifies us in answering this question in the affirmative.

Those who are working on these rocks frequently have brought under their notice

specimens about the origin of which they are not able to speak with any degree of
confidence. Sometimes a flood of light is suddenly thrown on a group of doubtful
rocks by the recognition of a character which gives unmistakable indications of
their mode of origin. Thus, some of the fine-grained quartz-felspathic rocks asso-
ciated with the crystalline schists of the Central Highlands are proved to have

 been originally sands like those of Hampstead Heath by the presence in them of
 narrow bands rich in zircon, rutile, and the other heavy minerals which are so
 constantly present in the finer-grained arenaceous deposits of all ages. Such

 pleasant surprises as the recognition of a character like this increase our confidence
 in the theory which endeavours to explain the past by reference to the present,
. and refuses to admit the necessity of believing in the existence of rocks formed

 under physical conditions different from those which now prevail simply because

 there are some whose origin is still involved in mystery.

    A crystalline schist has been aptly compared to a palimpsest. Historical records

 of priceless value have often been obscured by the superposition of later writings
 so it is with the records of the rocks. In the case of the schists the original
 characters have been so modified by folding, faulting, deformation, crystallisation,
 and segregation that they have often become unrecognisable. But when the asso-

 ciated rocks have the composition of sediments we need have no hesitation in
 attributing the banded structure in some way to str.atification, provided we clearly

 recognise that the order of succession and the relative thicknesses of the original
 beds cannot be ascertained by applying the principles which are valid in compara-
 tively undisturbed regions.

      In studying the crystalline schists nothing, perhaps, strikes one more forcibly
 than the evidence of crystal-building in solid rocks. Cliiastolite, staurolite, auda-
 lusite, garnet, albite, cordierite, micas of various kinds, and many other minerals
 have clearly been developed without anything like fusion having taken place.

 Traces of previous movements may not unfrequently be found in the arrangement
 of the inclusions, while the minerals themselves show no signs of deformation.
 Facts of this kind, when they occur, clearly indicate that the crystallisation was

 subsequent to the mechanical action. Nevertheless, it is probable that both

 phenomena were closely related, though not in all cases as cause and efiect. The

 intrusion of large masses of plutonic rock often marks the close of a period of
 folding. This is well illustrated by the relation of granite to the surrounding-
 rocks in the Lake District, the Southern Uplands of Scotland, and the west of
 England. Those of the two first-mentioned localities are post-Silurian and pre-
 Carboniferous, those of the last-mentioned locality are post-Carboniferous and pre-
 Permian ; one set followed the Caledonian ^ folding, the other set followed the
 Hercynian folding. That the intrusion of these granites was subsequent to the
 main movements which produced the folding and cleavage is proved by the fact

that the mechanical structures may often be recognised in the crystalline contact-

 rocks, although the individual minerals have not been strained or broken. In

many other respects the rocks produced by so-called contact-metamorphism re-
semble those found in certain areas of crystalline schist. Many of the most
characteristic minerals are common to the two sets of rocks, and so also are many
structures. The cipolins and associated rocks of schistose regions have many

 points of resemblance to the crj'stalliue limestones and ' kalksilicathornfels ' pro-
 duced by contact-metamorphism.

     These facts make it highly probable that, by studying the metamorphic action
surrounding plutonic masses, we may gain an insight into the causes which have
produced the crystalline schists of sedimentary origin just as, by studying the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

intrusive masses themselves and noting the tendency to petrographical difi'erentia-

tion, especiall3' at the margins, we may gain an insight into the causes which

have produced the gneisses of igneous origin.^ In the districts to which reference
has been made the igneous material came from below into a region where the
rocks had been rendered tolerably rigid. Difierential movement was not taking
place in these rocks when the intrusion occurred. Consider what must happen if
the folding stresses operate on the zone separating the sedimentary rocks from the

Tinderlymg source of igneous material. Intrusion must then take place during

interstitial movement, fluxion structures will he produced in the more or less

difl'erentiated igneous magmas, the sediments will he injected and impregnated

with igneous material, and thermo-metamorphism will he produced on a regional

myscale. The origin of gneisses and schists, in                        opinion, is to be sought for in a

combination of the thermal and dynamic agencies which may be reasonably

supposed to operate in the deeper zones of the earth's crust. If this view be

correct, it is not improbable that we may have crystalline schists and gneisses of

post-Silurian age in the north-west of Europe formed during the Caledonian fold-

ing, others in Central Europe of post-Devonian age due to the Hercynian folding,

and yet others in Southern Europe of post-Cretaceous age produced in connection

with the Alpine folding.^ But if the existence of such schists should ultimately

be established it will still probably remain true that rocks of this character are in

most cases of pre-Cambrian age. May not this be due to the fact, suggested by a

consideration of the biological evidence, that the time covered by our fossiliferous

records is but a small fraction of that during which the present physical conditions

have remained practically constant ?

     The good old British ship ' Uniformity,' built by Hutton and refitted by Lyell,

has won so many glorious victories in the past, and appears still to be in such

excellent fighting trim, that I see no reason why she should haul down her colours

either to ' Catastrophe ' or ' Evolution.' Instead, therefore, of acceding to the

request to ' hurry up ' we make a demand for more time. The early stages of the

planet's history may form a legitimate subject for the speculations of mathematical

physicists, but there seems good reason to believe that they lie beyond the ken of

those geologists who concern themselves only with the records of the rocks.
    In this address I have ventured to express my views on certain disputed

theoretical questions, and I must not conclude without a word of caution. The

myfact is, I attach very little importance to                          own opinions, at least on doubtful

questions connected with the origin of the crystalline schists ; but, as you have

done me the honour to accept me as your President, I thought you might like to
know my present attitude of mind towards some of the unsolved problems of

geology. There is still room for legitimate difierence of opinion on many of the

subjects to which I have referred. Meanwhile, we cannot do better than remember

I the words with which one of our great living masters recently concluded an article

on a controversial subject : ' Let us continue our work and remain friends.'

Although it is convenient to speak of the three types of folding which have so

largely influenced the structure of the European continent as if each belonged to a

definite period, it is important to remember that this is not strictly true. The
movements were prolonged ; they probably crept slowly over the surface of the

lithosphere, as did the zones of sedimentation, so that those of the same type are

not in all places strictly contemporaneous.

understood, the town of Nottingham was placed in a most unfavourable position as

regards drainage and water-supply. As regards the former the drainage of the
houses for the most part was run off into cesspools sunk in the sandstone rock on
which the town is built ; and as regards the latter the water-supply was drawn
from wells sunk through the same formation down to the water-level, so that often
the cesspools and wells were in proximity to each other. The result of such a state
of affairs may easily be surmised. However excellent as a filter may be the sand-
stone rock, it must assuredly become clogged with faecal matter when filtration of

water is carried on for an indefinite period, subject to such contamination as is
here referred to, and in course of time the water from the wells becomes unfit for
drinking and household purposes.

    Now all this is changed : the cesspools have been closed or filled up, and the

water-supply is drawn Irom large and deep wells far removed from possibility of

contamination.

    Few towns in central England are more favourably situated for purposes of
water-supply than Nottingham. Built on a foundation of New Red Sandstone and

conglomerate, which rises at the Castle in a precipitous cViS above the valley of
the Trent, the formation on which the city stands in its prolongation northwards is

a source of water- supply of the highest excellence, and yields several millions of
gallons per day of pure water from three or four wells situated within a few miles

o-f the city.

     The conditions which render this formation so well adapted for water-supply
may be briefly explained. The succession and character of the strata all combine

From the above succession it will be seen that the permeable beds of the Bunter

Sandstone, about 200 feet in thickness, are underlaiu by impervious marls of the

Permian series, which thus form a water-tight floor, effectually preventing the water

which percolates downwards from the surface to escape into the magnesian lime-

stone                        and, as the beds dip eastwards at a small angle from the western margin of
                          ;

the formation, an underground reservoir is thus formed M'ith a naturally permanent

level corresponding to that of the springs which break out at the junction of the

sandstone with the marl along the western outcrop.

The proportion of the rainfall, taken at an average of 30 inches, which sinks

down into the Bunter Sandstone north of Nottingham must be very large owing to

the absence of drift deposits and the sandy character of the ground. As there is

no surface drainage the percolation cannot be less than about 20 inches per annum,

giving a supply of about 1,000,000 gallons to every 3 square miles. Taking the

area of the formation between Nottingham and Worksop at 120 square miles, the

amount of water which annually percolates into the rock and becomes a reservoir

of supply may be estimated at about 40,000,000 gallons per day.

This large quantity of water tends to flow eastwards, following the dip of the

beds; and that it has permanently saturated the Bunter Sandstone under an exten-

sive area occupied by the overlying formations is proved by the result of the boring

at Scarle, near liincoln, which, commencing in the Lower Lias, passed down through

the Keuper marls into the Bunter, when the water came up with force and flowed

over the surface.' This boring is at a minimum distance of 20 miles from the

    · Two feeders of water were struck--one at a depth of 917 feet in the Lower

Keuper Sandstone, and the other at 1,250 feet in the Bunter Sandstone.

tiiat Nottingham is most favourably situated as regards its water-supply for a long

period to come ; a circumstance of great importance at a time when so many large

manufacturing towns are looking forwards with anxiety to the future as regards

this prime necessary of progress and prosperity.
     Since the above was written I have been favoured by Mr. L. T. Godfrey Evans,

the Borough Engineer, with information, of which the following is a summary :
     There are four pumping stations, of which one, the Park, Zion Hill, is not now

in use. The others are :

1. Basford or Bagthorpe, yielding 12,800,000 gallons per week.

2. Bestwood, yielding 11,800,000                                                                                                                         ,,,,

        In all 36,790,000 gallons per week, or 5,257,113 gallons per

        day.

     The supply at Bestwood is decreasing, owing probably to mining operations in
the neighbourhood. The yield at the Park Station is about 5i millions of gallons
per week. The water is excellent.

3. On the Discovery of a Concealed Ridge of pre-Carho7iiferous Rocks under
    the Trias of Netherseal, Leicestershire. By Professor Edward Hull,

     LL.D., F.B.S., F.G.S.

             It is now generally recognised that the Leicestershire and Warwickshire Coal-

         measures were deposited along the borders of a land surface of older Palaeozoic
        rocks, of which the visible representatives occur at Oharnwood Forest and Ather-

        stone. The attenuated condition of the Lower Carboniferous beds at Calke Abbey

         on the north of the Leicestershire Coalfield and their entire absence below the
        Coal-measures of Warwickshire show that these older rocks remained unsubmerged

I till the commencement of the Upper Carboniferous period, when they were gradually

         overspread, as the land became depressed, by successive deposits of the Coal period.
        The general north-westerly trend of these old foundation rocks, both at Charnwood
         Forest and Atherstone, appears to indicate that this old land was composed of a

        succession of ridges and furrows running in N.W. and S.E. directions ; but as

         the country is for the most part covered by Triassic strata the position of such
         ridges and hollows can only be determined by experiment. One of these ridges
         appears to have been in this manner determined at Netherseal Colliery in a boring
        put down for the purpose of determining the extension of ' the main coal.' Having

       mybeen invited by Mr. G. J. Binns, F.G.S. , the manager of the colliery, to give

          opinion regarding the age of the beds passed through in the lower part of the
         boring, I visited the colliery and inspected the cores which were brought up and

     --were arranged in their order of relative depth at the works. The following is an

     The interest attaches to the beds called ' pre-Carboniferous.' They consist of
sandstones, grits, and quartzites, of purple and yellowish tints, occasionally shaly.
They contrast strongly with the Coal-measures, not only in the absence of beds of
coal, grey and black shale and ironstone, but also in the complete absence of plant
remains with which the overlying Coal-measures are crowded ; not one solitary

instance of any plant-form having been found amongst all the cores after careful

examination. It became clear that the beds were not of Carboniferous age, yet it

was very difficult to determine with certainty to what period they were to be

referred. Such sandstones, grits, and quartzites might be found in several pre-

Carboniferous formations, either the Old Red Sandstone, the Upper Silurian, Lower

ASilurian (Ordovieian),or Cambrian.  reference to the Old Red Sandstone was con-

sidered out of the question, as this formation is not found anywhere in this part

of England ; nor did it seem probable that they were referable to the Upper or
Lower Silurian period, though this is possible. On the other hand, we cannot

forget that at no gi-eat distance to the south of the boring the Lower Cambrian beds

form the floor of the Coal-measures, and, although the cores at Netherseal boring

do not show a very strong resemblance to those of the Hartshill ridge, there is no

good reason why they may not be referable to the same general period, and con-
sist of beds not visible in that locality. For these reasons I am disposed with
some hesitation to regard them as of Lower Cambrian age ; a view in which I am

supported by Professor Lapworth, who was kind enough to examine the specimens
of the cores which I brought away with me from Netherseal Colliery. I will only

add that no conclusion could be gathered regarding the question of unconformity

of these beds with the overlying Coal-measures, as the dip of both series appeared

Ato be very slight.  strong discordance could have been immediately detected.

Since the above was written No. 2 boring has entered these old rocks, and

the specimens brought up confirm the conclusion arrived at from the results of

boring No. 1. The rock entered at a depth of about 760 feet consists of reddish

vitreous quartzite, slightly micaceous, and very similar to the Hartshill stone of

Warwickshire.

     4. On the Geology of the Coastland of Caria. Bij John L. Mtees.

     The interior of Caria, so far as it has been explored, presents only thick bedded
blue and grey limestones of Cretaceous age, lying almost horizontally, and forming
great plateaus with steep sea-slopes, the natural di-ainage falling partly into deep

gorges, partly into the frequent swallow-holes.

    In the peninsula, however, which projects westward beyond Budrum (the

ancient Halikarnassos) the occurrence of a volcanic series, both below and above

the thick limestones, causes a complete change in the character of the country.
     The * fundamental ' beds of this area are light-coloured crystalline quartzose

and felspathic rocks, which are interbanded with one another, and present occasion-
ally traces of foliation. The dips are almost universally to the east, and rise in
some places to the vertical, but are not wholly pre-Cretaceous. The age of these

beds is quite undetermined, but they may probably be correlated with the very

similar beds in Patmos, and with those which underlie the thick limestones in the
eastern half of the peninsula of Kavo Krio further south, and the white marble
series which represents them in Naxos, Attica, and elsewhere.

     These beds are traversed, as in Patmos and Naxos, by numerous necks and

dykes of very various composition. Two or three types, however, may be distin-

guished, and appear to represent successive periods of volcanic action. In par-

ticular, a purple porphyritic rock which is especially common in the neighbourhood
of Gumashli (ancient Myndos), on the west coast, occurs as the main constituent
in an altered tuft", underlying the basal schists of the limestone series, in which
several other common types are not represented.

     The pre-Cretaceous volcanic outbreak was not yet over when the great subsidence
began at the opening of the Limestone period ; for the last deposits of dt§bris on
the flanks of the old land-mass have a distinctly subaqueous character, and are

immediately succeeded by fine clays and schists at the base of the great limestones.
The lower part of this series is in this region unusually full of thin sandy beds,
and it contains also a number of bands of black chert in the parts east of Budrum.

The higher beds, however, are cleaner, and conform to the more normal type
represented in the neighbouring areas of Kavo Krio, Kos, and Kalymnos. One
 small outlier in the middle of the volcanic area has been wholly metamorphosed
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                             747

into a coarsely crystalline and very clean -white marble, strikingly like that of

Naxos ; and a "large area east of Budrum shows signs of similar but less complete
metamorphism. The basal sands and clays are in all cases much more altered than

the limestones associated with them.

At the end of the limestone period a prolonged elevation allowed of the erosion

of the principal existing features of the Carian coastland ; so that the Tertiary beds

which cling about the slopes of the limestones and older rocks have all a littoral

character, which is maintained in the eastern  part of Kos                                                  though in  the central
                                                                                                         ;

plain of that island deep-water limestones of some thickness occur. This series

consists of a basal breccia of limestone and fragments of crystalline rocks, followed

by sandstones and schistose clays, and then by thin-bedded cream-coloured clayey

hmestones of the normal type. All these are locally altered where they come in

contact with rocks of the later volcanic series. In the absence of fossils these

beds can only be roughly correlated with the very similar rocks in Rhodes and

Crete to the south, and of Samos, Chios, and the mainland opposite to the north.

Above this normal series occurs a thick but very irregular accumulation of

volcanic debris, which can be associated with a second series of necks and dykes

in the old rocks. The limestone appears to have been largely denuded from the

western half of the peninsula before the outbreak took place ; but boulders of it
Aoccur in a very perplexing, mainly volcanic, breccia near Gumashli.
                                                                                                                       very

markedlocal variety of thisvolcanic series on the coast between Gumashli andGeretsi

supplied in classical and mediasval times an admirable peperino for building

purposes, which is still occasionally worked. The latest beds found in this area

are almost wholly composed of pumice, and may be referred to the very recent

volcanic centres in Kos and Nisyros. They fill several small bays in the penin-

sulas of Budrum and Kavo Krio, are well developed on the shores of Porto

Kalymno, and fringe the steep south-east shore of Kos, over agaiust Nisyros, where

they contain larger fragments, and are associated with limestone. They are almost

always level ; cliff breccias seldom occur more than twenty or thirty feet above

the sea-level, and are probably of very recent date.

    It may be noted in conclusion that the argentiferous galena, which was worked
so largely in classical and mediteval times at Gumashli (the Turkish name means

' Silver Town '), is still found frequently, and of good quality, in the old rocks
of the neighbourbood. Many good veins of pyrolusite have lately been reported

in the same series near Gumashli and Kephaloucha, and a cobalt mineral, not yet

assayed, is found in workable quantities at the latter place.

CSpittal Pavement Quarry, Caithness, resembling Camphelltownensis, Whiteayes,

in having a pointed snout, but differing from it in having the coruua proportion-
ately short and broad-based, instead of slender and curved; the cranial shield
is ornamented externally by a very fine tuberculation, and the inner margins of the
cornua are not denticulated. This is the first recorded occurrence of Cephalaspis in
the Orcadian area of the Old Red Sandstone north of the Grampians, and the species
is the largest known, the length of the cranial shield being no less than 8^ inches.

8. 0)1 some Vertebrate Remains not hitherto recorded from the Bhcetic Beds
                of Britain. Bij Montague Browne, F.G.S., F.Z.S.

                                   Plesiosaurus rostratus, Owen.'

     In the autumn of 1890, when visiting Aust OlifF for a day, the writer found
some interesting vertebrate remains in the celebrated Rhtetic ' bone-bed ' there.
Amongst others was a large tooth which there was little difficulty in referring to
the so-called Termatosaurus albertii, a description of which, with figures, was pub-
lished by Plieninger - in 1844, and by Quenstedt^ in 1858. This type of tooth has
been queried subsequently, indeed, by Quenstedt himself,* as pertaining to a Plesio-

saurus, but the species has never been determined. Since 1890 the Rhsetics of
Aust Cliif, of Westbury-on-Serern, and of the Spinney Hills, Leicester, have
yielded to the Avriter teeth of the same character, and he has recognised similar
specimens, either unreferred or attributed to Termatosaunts alhertii, in the British,

Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Gloucester, and Leicester Museums, the Museum of Prac-
tical Geology, Jermyn Street, and some from the Rhsetics of Stanton-on-the-Wolds,

Nottinghamshire, collected by Mr. E. AVilson, F.G.S.
     During a visit to the Geological Department at South Kensington the writer

succeeded in referring them, with some certainty, to Plesiosaurus rostratus, and
considered that, could some vertebrae of the same Plesiosaurian be found, this

would furnish corroborative evidence. On a second and third visit to Aust, there-

-- --fore (in 1891-92) both of several weeks' duration no pains were spared in search-

ing for vertebrae, with the result that several specimens were procured ; and since

that time many have been acquired, by purchase and presentation, from the same

beds, and others have been recognised as Rhretic specimens in the British, Bristol,
and Gloucester Museums ; whilst subsequent visits to the British Museum, and an
examination of the whole of the vertebrae there definitely assigned to Plesiosaurus
rostratus, have resulted in the conviction that the Rhaetic Plesiosaurian vertebrae
are specifically identical. It is noteworthy also that one of the specimens in

--the writer's possession a cervical vertebra --might have been used for the figure

given by Owen ^ on tab. x. fig. 1, and the description tallies well, especially on

p. 23, where is stated the fact, patent on all the Rhaetic specimens possessed or seen
by the writer, that ' the fore surface of the centrum presents a slightly fibrous
character, not so smooth as in some other species, nor so irregular as in the Plesio-
saui-us rugosus, for example ; ' and again, on pp. 24, 25, ' The sides of the neural
spines of these vertebrte are roughened by irregular or granulate ridges, directed
toward their summit, which is bent backward.' Another agrees exactly with
No. 39849 British INIuseum specimen labelled Pretmosaurus rugosus, but which has

been shown " to be a vertebra of Plesiosaurus rostratus from the Lias of Lyme

Regis.

     The specific determination of this Plesiosaurus (hitherto recognised only as
Liassic) is a new record altogether for the Rhietic throughout the world, its verte-
brae having hitherto been referred geuerically only, and its teeth having been
recorded as Termatosaurus albertii, PlieningerJ and Plesiosawnis sp. non det. The

synonymy, therefore, will be as follows :--

comparison of the tooth with that of Ichthyosaurus, and with those of EhaeticLaby-
rinthodontia, leads to the conclusion that it is to the latter (sp. ind.) they must be
assigned. In this connection the writer, having probably a larger amount of such
material at his disposal than is elsewhere known, is convinced that teeth of various
species of SaurichtJii/s, Ag,,^ and other authors will have to be divided between the
Labyrinthodontia and various species of fishes, being, probably, called Saurichthys

erroneously.

     In 1890 the writer found a small bone, which, having somewhat the texture and
appearance of a Ceratodus tooth, was labelled as probably pertaining to Ceratodus :
but on the second visit, in 1891, more and larger pieces were found of the same
nature, but which, having the appearance of plates of the ichthyic skull, were pro-
visionally referred to Ceratodus. One was shown to Mr. A. Smith "Woodward,
F.G.S., F.Z.S., who concurred in this opinion, at the same time calling attention to
a recent memoir upon the skull of a Ceratodus by F. Teller.* On comparison with

the description and plates, it now appears that some of these bones are the

median and other plates of the skull of Ceratodus ; and although, no doubt, they
have been collected before, and in one instance within the writer's knowledge
attributed to Mastodonsaurus jcegeri,^ a Labyrinthodont, yet this is the first instance
in which such specimens have been definitely referrred ; consequently this will
be a new record for the Rhastic of Britain.

     Some of the teeth of Ceratodus, collected in 1891 and 1892, are interesting as
having, in the case of the mandibular teeth, parts of the splenial attached, and

in the palatal teeth parts of the palato-pterygoid.

     The underground observation of faults which are visible on the surface, and
are thus familiarly known, affords points of vantage for the elucidation of various
facts in connection with them, which mere surface examination cannot afford. It
has been the author's good fortune to trace below ground a series of ' faults,' of

which two are visiWe at the surface in the road leading by Cinder Hill Brickyard,
and -which are laid down on the maps of the Geological Survey.

     There are three points in connection with this series of ' faults ' which may he

especially interesting to this Association, and which were illustrated on the section
displayed on the screen.

     The first point of interest is that whilst the ' throw ' of the ' fault ' in the Per-
mian rocks at the surface only amounts to 76 feet, in the Coal Measures below the
' throw ' amounts to 340 feet, a very much larger amount; and this shows that
there was an enormous movement prior to the deposition of the Permian strata,
and that there was a further small movement on the same lines after the deposi-
tion of the Permians. Both these movements took place when the rocks which
they affected had obtained their full degree of induration, and it is obvious that
the interval which elapsed between the two movements must have marked a long

 period of geological time.

      The second point which is noticeable about this series of ' faults ' is the great
lateral movement of which it gives evidence. AVhilst the ' throw ' of the ' fault
on the slide or hade amounts to 340 feet, and the vertical displacement amounts
to 210 feet, the horizontal movement amounts to 270 feet, showing enormous
lateral movement.

    A third point may also be noticed, which is, that the main fault, though a large

one, practically makes no difference in the position of the zone of strata through
which it cuts. If the coal seana on the left of the section shosvu be continued at
its normal dip across the faulted ground, the position of the large ' fault,' it was
.seen that it practically meets the coal on the upcast oi" eastern side of that
* throw.' The rapid dip of the strata on the westward of the ' fault ' line is thus
merely the slipping of the different beds along the fractural edge of the fault,
owing to the horizontal movement already indicated ; and the fractures, the
alterations in inclination, are the result mainly of horizontal and not of vertical
movements.

     If there is, as has been maintained by the author and others, a very marked
unconformity at the base of the rocks usually classed as Cambrian in Wales, the
evidence furnished by an examination of those basal beds which indicate shore
condition is of the utmost importance. The author, therefore, in this paper gives
a summary of the results bearing on this question which he has obtained iu his
examinations of these rocks in Wales.

                                                Pembeokeshtee.

   --St. David's. The basal beds are exposed on the north and south sides of the

pre-Cambrian Axis. Where faults do not intervene the lowest beds are rough

conglomerates from GO to 150 feet in thickness, in which pebbles over a foot in
diameter are very frequently met with. The matrix and pebbles vary constantly,
as they rest on different parts of the pre-Cambrian Axis, and there is the clearest
evidence of an unconformity between the conglomerates and the highest beds of
the Pebidian exposed in this area. The overlying beds, which are grits and sand-
stones, are ripple -marked, and show other proofs of having been deposited in
shallow shore-water. The author has recently re-examined the basal beds in this
area, and has accumulated additional evidence in support of the above view.

     Samsey Island.--The Cambrian conglomerates here rest on pre-Cambrian
felstones and breccias. The pebbles are mainly well-rolled fragments of felstones
cemented together by a felsitic matrix. Pebbles of quartzite and other materials
are occasionally found, but the main amount of the material was undoubtedly
derived from the rocks immediately underlying the conglomerates. The under-
lying rocks had undergone the marked changes now visible in them before the
fragments in the conglomerates had been broken off.

     Trefyarn.--The pre-Cambrian rocks in this area are mainly felstones of a
peculiar type and volcanic ash. The conglomerates which repose on these rocks
contain pebbles of large size, and have been proved by microscopical examination
to be identical in character with the rocks on whose eroded surface they repose.
Here again the marked similarity in the minutest particulars between the rolled
fragments and the underlying rocks proves indisputably that the peculiar changes
which these rocks have undergone must have taken place before the fragments were
broken off, therefore in pre-Cambrian times.

     Harlech Mountam.--Nea.T the centre of the well-known anticlinal of Cambrian
rocks in the Harlech Mountain there are conglomerates exposed which contain

fragments of granitoid rocks, felstones, &e., in addition to pebbles of quartzites
and quartz, and it is clear that they are, though not actually at the base, yet very

near the base of the Cambrian rocks of that area. The most important con-
glomerates, however, in this district are those which were discovered by Professor
Hughes and the author on the east side of the Trawsfynnydd Road, between Cae
Cochion and Penmaen. Here they are seen resting unconformably upon an older
series of rocks, and large fragments of the latter occur plentifully in the con-

glomerates.

    As Sir A. Geikie has recently admitted that many of the rocks in Anglesey,
coloured on the Geological Survey Map of that island as 'altered Cambrian (aiid

partly Silurian),' are ' undoubtedly far older than at least any of the Cambrian
rocks of Anglesey or Carnarvonshire,' the evidence furnished by the basal beds
where they rest on these rocks is highly important. The author was the first to
point out, in a paper read before the British Association in 1879, that the patch
near the centre of Anglesey coloured as ' intrusive granite chiefly of Lower Silurian
age ' contained within its boundary rocks of pre-Cambrian age, and evidently the

oldest rocks in the island. (The rocks in this patch Sir A. Geikie now says appear
to him to be ' unquestionably Archaean.') In the year 1884 the author further

showed that the Cambrian conglomerates near Llanfaelog contained large pebbles

mof granitoid and other rocks, which, on microscopical examination, proved to be

identical with rocks situ in their immediate neighbourhood.
     Professor Hughes has shown by fossil evidence that the beds which overlie the

conglomerates near Llanerchymedd are of Upper Cambrian age, and, as these are
separated by faults from the conglomerates and gi-its, it is clearly justitiable to
classify these beds as the basal beds of the Cambrian in that area. The basal
Cambrian beds near Beaumaris furnish equally convincing proofs of proximity to a

--shore-line composed of pre-Cambrian schists and felsitic rocks.
     Bangor and Caernarvon. The basal beds at and near Caernarvon described by
Professor Hughes show clearly that they must have been deposited along a shore-
line where granitoid and felsitic rocks were undergoing denudation, and the absence
there of the usual thickness of overlying Cambrian roclcs is due, the author believes,
mainly to faults, but in part also to the unevenness of the pre-Cambrian land sur-
face. There is much evidence in the various areas to show that the pre-Cambrian
land surface was very irregular in character, and that the Cambrian sediments
were accumulated along fairly well-defined lines of depression.

     Bethesda, Llyn Padarn, and Moel Tri/faen.~The basal beds of the Cambrian in
these areas, where not removed by faults, are also conglomerates, and the frag-
ments in the conglomerates are mainly such as would be derived by denudation
from the ridge of rocks in the neighbourhood which had been claimed by the
author and Professor Hughes as of pre-Cambrian age. These views, put forward

min the year 1877, were not accepted by the chiefs of the Geological Survey ; but
    the year 1891, in his anniversary address to the Geological Society, Sir A.
Geikie admitted that the rocks in this ridge, ' variously termed quartz porphyries,
felsites, and rhyolites,' were not intrusive in the Cambrian rocks, but ' tho oldest

mentary rocks into it ; on the contrary, the consrlomerates which abut against it

are in great part made out of its fragments, so that it must have heen already in

existence before these Cambrian strata were deposited.'

The grits and slates which overlie the conglomerates in these areas have always

been classed  by  the  Geological  Survey  as  the  Lowest  Cambrian                                                   therefore  any

attempt to extend the term Cambrian so that it might include the much older

rocks which the surveyors had incorrectly marked as intrusive, and ' chiefly of

Lower Silurian age,' the author thinks is unwarrantable. The error which caused the

surveyors to class other pre-Cambrian rocks as ' altered Cambrian ' equally renders

it impossible to group these with the Cambrian, especially as in no instance has it

been shown that the so-called ' altered Cambrian rocks ' have their equivalents

amongst the unaltered Cambrian rocks of the Survey. Moreover, it is certain that

there is a marked unconformity at the base of the Cambrian (unaltered Cambrian

of the Survey) in all the areas in AYales where the beds are seen to rest on the

rocks classed by the author and others as of pre-Cambrian age.

11. On the Eeptilia of the British Trias. By E. T. Newton, F.B.S.

This communication is a review of our knowledge of the reptiles which have

been recorded from the Triassic strata of Britain. In the first place attention is

called to the teeth from Durdham Down, Bristol, described by Riley and Stutch-

bury in 1836 imder the generic names of Palceosaurus and Thecodontosaurits,

which, with additional specimens, were further described by Professor Huxley in
1869, he regarding them both as dinosaurian. The two genera are distinguished

by the form of their teeth. Closely allied to Pnlaosaurus is the tooth described
by Murchison and Strickland in 1837 as Mer/alosaurus, but subsequently named

Cladyodon by Owen. Another and still larger tooth, from the same neighbour-

hood, has been referred by Professor Huxley to Teratosawus ( = Zanclodoii) : it is

very similar to that of Cladyodon, but is more compressed, and has both anterior

and posterior edges serrated to the base.

Mhynchosaurus articeps, from the Keuper of Grinshill, Shropshire, was described

by Owen in 1841 from a skull, but was further illustrated by additional specimens,

including other parts of the skeleton, described by Professor Huxley in 1887.

This form, which is allied to the recent Sphenodon, is also near to the

Hyperodapedon, remains of which have been found in the Elgin Sandstone and

also in the Trias of Warwick and Devon. Hyperodapedon was made known by

Professor Huxley in 1858, but first described it in 1869, and more fully in 1887

from a fine example now preserved in the British Museum.

Telerpeton Elginense, the celebrated lizard of the Elgin Sandstone, was found

in 1850 by Mr. Patrick DuS", and described by Dr. Mantell in 1851 as having

amphibian affinities. Additional examples were, however, described by Professor

Huxley in 1867, who showed that its affinities were with the lacertilia, and not

with the amphibia. Telerpeton is probably closely related to the living Sphenodon.

Stagonolepis Robertsoni was really the  first  reptile found  in the Elgin Sandstone
                                                                                                                                                              ;

a series of scutes from Lossiemouth being thus named by Agassiz just fifty years ago

(1843), but were thought by him to be the scales of a fish. The reptilian nature
of this fossil was shown by Professor Huxley in 1858, and more abundant material

has been described by the same writer in 1875 and 1877, which has established

the crocodilian affinities of this Triassic reptile.

    Dasygnathus longideiis is the name suggested by Professor Huxley for a jaw

with long teeth from the Elgin Sandstone, which had at first been referred to
Stago?iolepis. This form Professor Huxley thought might be dinosaurian, but

additional information is much wanted to establish its true affinities.

     The dicynodont remains, noticed by the present writer at the meeting of this

Association last year at Edinburgh, have now been worked out, and the results,

fully illustrated, will shortly appear in the ' Phil. Trans.' of the Hoyal Society.
Four forms nearly allied to Bicynodon have been named Gordonia Traquairi,

 G. JIuxleyana, G. Duffiana, and G. Juddiana. Another dicynodont more nearly
related to the Ptychognathus of Owen, hut with a short muzzle and no teeth, has
been named Geikia El(/inensis.

     The peculiar horned reptile, resembling the Moloch lizard, but apparently most
nearly related lo the South African Pareiasaurus, has been named Elginia

mirabilis.

     Work among the Elgin reptiles is still going on, and two entirely new forms
are now made known for the first time. One of these was found by Mr. James

Grant, of Lossiemouth; and, although the exact locality is uncertain, there is no
doubt as to its being from the sandstone of the Elgin area. This specimen, which
includes the skull (about three inches long) and the front part of the tnink, is evi-

dently related to Stagonolepis.

     The second new form was obtained by the Eev. Dr. Gordon from the EVin

Sandstone of Spynie Quarry, and will eventually be preserved in the British

Museum. With the exception of the fore limbs and neck, nearly the whole of the
skeleton has been preserved. Much of the skull has been very successfully cleared
from the matrix by Mr. Richard Hall, of the British Museum, and was exhibited
at a soiree of the Royal Society, when its resemblance to Aetosaurus was pointed
out by Mr. Arthur Smith Woodward. This reptile is of much interest, as it seems

to be a form intermediate between the crocodiles and dinosaurs, being, apparently,
related on the one hand to the Parasuchia and on the other to the theropodous
dinosaurs. The skull is, in fact, that of a miniature megalosaur.

       2. The Dissected Volcano of Grandall Basin, Wyoming.

                 By Professor Joseph Paxson Iddings.

     The writer in exploring the north-eastern corner of the Yellowstone National
Park and the country east of it came upon evidences of a great volcano which had
been eroded in such a manner as to expose the geological structure of its basal

portion.

     The work was carried on as a part of the survey of this region under the charge
of Mr. Arnold Hague, of the United States Geological Survey. This paper is an
extract from a chapter in the final report on the Yellowstone National Park in pro-

cess of completion, and the writer is indebted to Major J. W. Powell, Director of

the Survey, and to Mr. Hague, chief of the division, for permission to present it at
this time in anticipation of the publication of the final report.

     The area of volcanic rocks described is but a small portion of the great belt of
igneous material that forms the mountains of the Absaroka range, lying along the
eastern margin of the Yellowstone Park. The volcano of Grandall Basin is one of
a chain of volcanic centres situated along the northern and eastern borders of the
Yellowstone Park, which are all distinguished by a greater or less development of
radiatintr dikes, and by a crystalline core eroded to a variable extent.

     The Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata which formed an almost continuous series
to the coal-bearing Laramie had been greatly disturbed, and almost completely
eroded in places, before the volcanic ejectamenta in this vicinity were thrown upon
them. The period of their eruption is therefore post-Laramie, presumably early

Tertiary.

     The first eruptions of andesite were followed by those of basalt in great quan-
tities, and these by others of andesite and basalt like the first. This was succeeded

1893.                                                        3c

ty a period of extensive erosion, reducing the country to nearly its present form.

Then came the eruption of a vast flood of rhyolite constituting the Parlv plateau,

which was followed in this region by smaller outbreaks of basalt. The last phase

of volcanic activity is found in the geysers and fumaroles which have rendered the

region famous.

The volcano of Crandall Basin consists chiefly of the flrst series of basic ande-

sites and basalts. The earliest acid andesite which occurs beneath these rocka

appears to be the remnant of eruptions from neighbouring centres.

    Nothing remains of the original outline of the volcano. The district is now

covered by systems of valleys and ridges of mountain peaks that rise 2,000 to 5,000

feet above the valley bottoms. The geological structure of the country, however^

makes its original character evident.

The outlying portions of the district to the south, west, and north consist of

nearly horizontally bedded tuff's and subaerial breccias of basic andesite and basalt.

With these are intercalated some massive lava flows, which are scarce in the lower

parts of the breccia, but predominate in the highest parts above an altitude of

10,000 feet. Here they constitute the summits of the highest peaks.

In contrast to the well-bedded breccias around the margin of the district the

central portion consists of chaotic and orderless accumulations of scoriaceous

breccia with some massive flows. These breccias carry larger fragments of rock and

exhibit greater uniformity in petrographical character.

   A still more noticeable feature of the central portion of the district is the

occurrence of dikes, which form prominent walls, and may be traced for long dis-

tances across the country.

The greater number of them are found to converge toward a centre in the highest

Aridge ia the middle of the drainage basin of Orandall Creek.        small number

converge towards a second centre three or four miles east of the first. In the

southern part of the district there are many dikes trending towards a centre near

the bead of Sunlight Basin, about fifteen miles south of the Crandall centre.

The centre towards which the Crandall dikes converge is a large body of

granular gabbro graduating into diorite. It is about a mile wide, and consists of

numerous intrusions penetrating one another, and extending out into the sur-

rounding breccia, which is highly indurated and metamorphosed in the immediate
vicinity of the core. AVithin the area of indurated breccia the dike rocks become
rapidly coarser-grained as they approach the gabbro core. This was undoubtedly

the central conduit of an ancient volcano, the upper portion of which has been

eroded away.

     Upon comparing the geological structure of this region with that of an active

volcano like Etna it is apparent that the lava flows which form the summits of the

outlying peaks musthave been derived from lateral cones fed by dikes radiating from

the central conduit ; and assuming that tlie volcano of Crandall Basin was similar in
type to that of Etna, an idea of its original proportions is derived by constructing

upon profile sections through the Crandall core the outline of Etna. If the erosion

of the summits of the highest peaks is neglected the resulting height of the ancient

volcano above the limestone floor is estimated at 13,400 feet. This is undoubtedly

too low, and is well within the limits of present active volcanoes.

     Erosion has removed at least 10,000 feet from the summit of the mountain to
the top of the high central ridge in which the granular core is situated, and has

cut 4,000 feet deeper into the valleys on either side. It has prepared for study a

dissected volcano, which, it is hoped, will in time reveal some of the obscurer

relationships existing between various phases of igneous rocks.

      3. On Structures in Eruptive Bosses wliicTi resemble those of ancient
                    Gneisses. By Sir Archibald Geikie, F.B.S.

     While it is now the general belief of geologists that the older granitoid and

banded gneisses were originally eruptive masses, considerable difference of opinion
exists as to the cause of the peculiar and characteristic structure which distin-
guishes gneiss from ordinary amorphous eruptive material. The pregnant sugges-
   TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                     755

    tion of Lehmann that this structure is essentially due to mechanical deformation

    has heen widely accepted, and has undoubtedly been of great service in the inves-
    tigations of the last ten years among pre-Cambrian rocks. That the foliation of

    many gneisses has arisen from the efiects of enormous compression can no longer be
    disputed. But among these rocks other structures occur which cannot be satisfactorily

    80 explained. In the granulitic gneisses, where the folia are thin, and where over
    considerable spaces a marked uniformity of lithological character prevails, crushing
    and recrystallisation have no doubt played a chief part in the production of the
    gneissic structure. But in the coarsely banded varieties, where thick layers of
    different chemical and mineralogical composition alternate irregularly with each
    other, mechanical deformation seems to be wholly inadequate to account for this
    arrangement. The author stated that he had pointed out some years ago that a
    close analogy might be traced between this banded character and certain structures
    to be observed in the deeper portions of large intrusive bosses. lie had since then
    had opportunities of repeating and extending his observations, which had led him
    to the belief that the coarsely banded arrangement in the ancient gneisses was not
    due to any subsequent crushing and recrystallisation, but was a structure developed
   in the original, massive, or eruptive rock before its final consolidation. In the
    deeper-seated parts of intrusive bosses he had noticed that the component minerals
   had sometimes been segregated in parallel bands, each of which was marked by
   the predominance of one of them, and that the minerals had there crystallised in

   much larger forms than in the main body of the rock. Layers of felspar, pyroxene,
   olivine, and iron ores had in this way been separated out, and could be traced in
   alternate parallel bands for distances of many yards, sometimes even exhibiting

   puckered, folded, and inverted structures. Such segregations were so like the

   hornblendic, felspathic, quartzose, and pyroxenic bands of many gneisses that

   the observer could hardly at first believe that they were not portions of some

   ancient rock enclosed within the eruptive boss. He could soon convince himself,

   however, that they were really integral parts of the general mass. Not only is
   the banded structure of the gneisses perfectly reproduced in the bosses, but another

   equally characteristic structure, that of the pegmatite veins, is likewise simulated.
   Occasionally veins of this nature composed of the same minerals as the boss, but

   aggregated in different proportions, may be seen, not only in the main amorphous

   mass of the rock, but even traversing the segregated bands. So closely does this

   association of structures resemble that of the old gneisses as to impress the convic-

   tion on the observer that it probably represents the origin of some of the most

   conspicuous features in these rocks. Illustrations of the structures described may

   be found in eruptive bosses of Palaeozoic age, but the best examples which the
   author has seen occur among the Tertiary gabbros of the Western Isles.

   4. On the Fittings in Pebbles from the Trias.
     By Professor W. J. Sollas, D.Sc, F.B.S.

   The singular indentations in the pebbles of the pebble beds of the Trias have

   been variously attributed to solution and pressure, and in limestone pebbles Sorby

   has conclusively shown how both have shared in their formation. No one, how-

   ever, appears to have suggested the influence of slight movements as a powerful

   adjunct to pressure ; and yet earth tremors are of such constant occurrence that

   Howslight movements must exist.       great may be the influence of these is proved

   by the incised bones of the great Irish deer, which have made sharp and deep cuts

   into each other wherever they have happened to lie in contact, and this although

   only under the pressure of a peat bog. Still better illustrations are afforded by

   some pebbles, to which my attention has been directed by my colleague Mr.

   MacHenry, These are from an ancient beach over which the tram line passes at

   Tritonville, Sandymount: they are covered with impressions essentially similar to

   those on the Trias pebbles, a result of the perpetual jarring produced by the pass-

   ing trams. It is obvious that under the great pressure to which the Trias pebble

   beds have been exposed the slightest trembling at points of contact would produce

   similar or even more marked effects.

5. On Bones and Antlers of Cervus giganteus incised and marTced hy

    Mutual Attrition while buried in Bogs or Marl. By V. Ball, C.B,,

     LL.D., F.B.8.

     From time to time bones and antlers of tliis extinct deer have been found with

peculiar cuts and marks upon them, wliicli have suggested to some observers the

work of man ; careful examination has shown, however, that these cuts and

polished and indented surfaces are all really due to the same cause, namely, the

sawing or rubbing together of bones and antlers as they lay in contact while em-

Webedded in marl underlying peat.                                                                                                                  cannot say with any degree of certainty

what the cause of the movement may have been. It may perhaps have been due

to alternate expansion and contraction, up and down, according to the amount of

moisture  in  the bog                                 possibly, however, it was connected with earth-tremors, the
                                                   ;

origin and extent of which cannot be so easily explained.

     The several finds of these cut bones, of which examples were exhibited to the

Section, were made at Legan, five miles south of Edgeworthstown, Co. Longford
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and on the left bank of the river Oamoge, one mile from Lough Gur, and close to

Kilcullen House, Co. Limerick.

     In the former case, which was described by Professor Jukes in the year 1863,

the bones lay in shell marl 2 or 3 feet thick, resting on blue clay (drift) and

covered by 15 feet of peat; but originally, before being cut, the peat had been

50 feet thick at this spot. In the Lough Gur locality, which is described by Dr.

Carte, the mode of occurrence of the bones was similar.

   7. Note to accompany the Exhibition of a Geological Map of India.
By R. D. Oldham, A.B.8.M., F.G.8., of the Geological Survey of India.

    Two maps are exhibited, on the scales of 96 and 32 miles to the inch

respectively. The smaller is a chromo-lithograph, and will be published shortly

with the second edition of that portion of the ' Manual of the Geology of India

which deals with the stratigraphical and structural geology of the Empire. The
larger is a manuscript map representing in greater detail the state of our know-

ledge of Indian geology at the end of 1S92. ·

     It is well known that the Indian Empire is divisible into three geological

regions, which are recognised as (1) the Peninsular, (2) the extra-Peninsular, and,
separating them, (3) the Indo-Gangetic alluvium.

     It is in the extra-Peninsular region that most of the additions to our know-

ledge of Indian geology have been made since the publication of a general map

with the first edition of the ' Manual of the Geology of India.' The most important

of these additions, so far as the area coloured goes, are in Upper Burma and the

country explored by my colleague Mr. Griesbach while attached to the Afghan

Boundary Commission                                                                                                             but, besides  actual  additions to  the  coloured  area, great
                                                                                                                             ;

additions have been made to our knowledge of the stratigraphy and correlation of

the rocks within the area which was coloured on the previous map.

    Among the most important stratigraphical features of the extra-Peninsular area
may be ranked the fine development, and abundant fossils, of the Lower Trias of

the  Central  Himalayas                                                                                                         the rich fauna of  this period, very scantily represented in
                                                                          ;

Europe, is now under description, and the publication of the results must be

looked forward to as an important addition to geological knowledge. Another

feature is the very fine development of Cretaceous and Tertiary"- beds on the

western frontier, and here the main stratigraphical break is not between the

Cretaceous and Tertiary, but at the base of the Lower Cretaceous of accepted

chronology.

     Structurally the most important feature of the extra-Peninsular area is the

great disturbance the beds have undergone, a disturbance which has taken place
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  757

principally within the Tertiary era, and mainly within the latter half of it. In
 lact, none of the mountains which hound the Indian Empire appear to have existed
in anything like their present form or size at the commencement of the Tertiary

 era.

     The Indo-Gangetic alluvium occupies a zone of depression formed entirely
within the Tertiary era concomitantly with the elevation of the extra-Peninsular
ranges. The surface deposits are all Recent or Pleistocene in age, but the occur-
rence of extinct mammals in the alluvium of the Jumna, some of which are
identical with those of the uppermost Siwalik heds, points to an Upper Tertiary
age of the deeper seated deposits of the Gangetic alluvium, whose thickness has
been proved to reach 1,300 feet under Lucknow.

     The Peninsular area differs from the extra-Peninsular in having been dry land
since the close of the Paleozoic era, and in the very small amount of disturbance

the rocks have undergone during this period. Two of its main geographical
features appear to be of very ancient date. On the north-west the Aravalli range

of the present day is the mere wreck of a mountain range whose elevation was
completed in the Vindhyan period ; the exact age of this system cannot be deter-

mined, as no fossils have been found in it, but it is certainly pre-Carboniferous,

though probably not much older than Devonian. On the east the present coast-

line appears to have been approximately determined about the same period, and
the manner in which the small patches of marine deposits found on the east coast
thin out against the older rocks shows that throughout the Secondary era the sea

could never have extended much west of the present coast, though dry land may

at times have extended further to the east.

     The west coast appears to be of much more recent origin. Throughout the

Secondary era there seems to have been a more or less continuous land connection
between Southern India and South Africa ; at the close of the Secondary era,
however, this was broken up, the present west coast defined, and the range of the
Western Ghats elevated. The palreontological evidence of the former connection
between India and Africa is very complete, and, besides this, there is a very re-
markable analogy between the geology of the two regions. The Karoo series of

the interior of South Africa and the Uitenhage series of the coast are represented
in India physically, stratigraphically, and palreontologically by the Gondwanas of

the interior of the Peninsula and the Upper Gondwana outliers of the east coast.
     So far reference has only been made to the most important features of what is

known, and it will be well now to point out briefly what has still to be done.

Within the thoroughly settled districts of the Peninsula large areas have been left
uncoloured because absolutely nothing is known of them, and even in the area

which has been coloured much remains to be done. The vast area coloured with
one uniform tint of pink contains many v^arieties of rock, and at least two probably

-- --many more successive systems of deposits, besides intrusive and eruptive rocks of

the most diverse kinds. The succession and correlation of the various rock systems
which are classed as Transition, Ouddapah, and Vindhyan have yet to be esta-
blished ; while the relation between the Upper and Lower Gondwana beds and the
proper classification of this great series of river deposits, ranging in age from Car-

boniferous to Cretaceous, have still to be worked out.
    In the extra- Peninsular area the Himalayas have much information to yield,

especially as regards the zonal distribution of the Siwalik fauna, and the sequence
and correlation of the great series of as yet unfossiliferous slates and limestones of

the North-west Himalayas. On the east our newly-acquired province of Burma,

besides almost the whole of Assam, has to be surveyed, and the very fine series
of Tertiary rocks and the economically important mineral deposits have to be
examined in detail.

    If fact, the most pressing need of the immediate future is not so much the
exploration and imperfect examination of new regions as the completion and

filling up of gaps in our knowledge of the geology of the land which lies within

ouv frontier.

8. Geological Sketch of Central East Africa. By "Walcot Gibson, F.G.S.

     The tract of country described in this paper is situated in Equatorial East

Africa. It extends from the coast inland to the N.W. borders of Victoria

Nyanza.

The small island of Mombasa, the starting-point of the expedition, lies fifty

Amiles north of the island of Pemba.            narrow creek, fordable at low water,

separates the island from the mainland.

The sea cliffs are composed of coral rock, which also forms an inland belt

about two miles broad, with a general elevation of 50 feet, which sometimes rises

Ato 100 feet.  fringing reef borders the coast. The shore sand consists of

comminuted corals and shells mixed with rounded fragments of quartz, orthoclase,

garnets, and spUnters of clear blue cyanite. These constituents appear to be

derived from a submerged ridge, of which the Seychelles Islands are a remnant.
    The coral rock rests on a sedimentary series consisting of shales, limestones,

flaggy sandstones, grits, and conglomerates in descending order. The beds dip

gently to the east. They extend inland to the borders of the Taru Plain, a

distance of about forty-seven miles.

The beds are of marine origin, ammonites and ichthyosaurian remains having

been found near Rabai and other localities.

It is impossible to correlate these beds with any occurring in South Africa,

but they appear to form a belt running many miles north and south of Mombasa.

The sedimentary beds rest unconformably on a metamorphic series, consisting

of gneisses, schists, and intrusive granites. The strike is N.N.W. and S.S.E., and
the dip is generally high. The beds are often intensely folded (Ndange River).

Biotite is the commonest mica, and orthoclase the predominant felspar. The

schists contain much cyanite, full of iron inclusions. Common garnets are

plentiful. Hornblendic rocks are remarkably scarce, the main mass being mica-

ceous. Graphite schists occur, and the Bura Hills are largely composed of a

crystalline limestone containing scales of graphite. No fossils could be detected.

Quartz veins and quartzites are only feebly developed. They form gently un-

dulating country or else nearly level plains (Taru, Serengeti) through which low

isolated hills of gneiss and granite protrude.

It is evident that they have suffered enormous denudation. They no doubt

represent a complex metamorphosed series of sediments and intrusive rocks, but of
what geological age or ages it is impossible to state.

     The intrusive granites are generally pegmatites. Porphyritic granite covers a

large area in Kavirondo. Biotite is the essential mica, and a pink orthoclase the
predominant felspar. The relation of this large mass of granite to the gneisses
and schists could not be ascertained.

The area covered by granite and metamorphic rocks is enormous. Fully two-

thirds of Central East Africa are composed of these rocks. The remaining portion

of the countiy, excepting the narrow coast belt of sedimentary rocks, is formed of

recent volcanic rocks.

    No traces of the fossiliferous sandstones and shales found by Professor Drummond

near Lake Tanganyika, and quite recently by Mr. Joseph Thomson to the west of
Lake Nyassa and around Lake Bangweolo, were detected. If further investigation

proves their absence from East Africa to be a fact, then we have in the deposits
around Lake Tanganyika the most northerly extension of the Karoo beds of South

Africa.

     Volcanic rocks form the grandest scenery in East Africa. They occur in two
forms, giving rise to two distinct types of scenery. They have either built up
tall isolated mountains like Kilimanjaro (19,718 ft.), Kenia (18,000 ft.), Elgon
(14,000 ft.), Chibchangani (12,000 ft.), besides numerous other smaller hills, or they
are arranged in lines running north and south. The lavas, tuffs, and ashes composing
the high central plateaux of Mau, Kamasia, and Lykipia have evidently issued

from a north and south fissure. The site of this fissure is now occupied by the

chain of lakes commencing with Naivasha on the south, and terminating northward
in Lake Baringo. Along this line recent eruptions, some still giving out steam,
                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                       759

have broken out, and it is the interception of the drainage by the material thrown
out from these vents that forms the lakes Naivasha, Nakuru, and Elmeteita.

      Highly acid and ultra-basic rocks are represented. Kilimanjaro and the
Kyulu Mountains are chiefly built up of basic rocks, while the lavas of Lykipia

and the Mau plateaux are chiefly acid. It appears that the latter localities have

been the seat from which acid lavas have continued to be poured from times prior

to the first eruptions of Kilimanjaro up to the present day.
     The basic lavas of Kilimanjaro do not extend very far from the original point

of issue. .A.t least this is so to the north, for no lavas were found on the plains of

Lytokitok, distant thirty miles north of Kilimanjaro. On the other hand the
acid lavas of Mau and Lykipia extend for great distances. Eastwards they

stretch as far as the Athe plain, about fifty miles, and westwards to near the shores

of Victoria Nyanza, a distance of nearly one hundred miles.
      Further westward, in Busoga and Buganda, basic igneous rocks pierce the

metamorphic roclcs, but without possessing any general trend.

     With the exception of the still active volcanoes it is impossible to state even
the approximate geological age of any of the eruptions. Some of the volcanoes are

possibly only dormant, others are certainly extinct, but none appears to be of great
geological antiquity. All that can be safely asserted is that they are long
subsequent to the deposition of strata containing ammonites, for, whereas the
conglomerates of these sedimentary deposits contain pebbles of schist and gneiss,

they nowhere yield fragments of igneous or volcanic rocks.

10. On Quart:: Enclosures in Lavas of S'romhoU and Stromholicchio, and
    their Effect on the Composition of the Eoch. By Professor H. J.

     Johnston-Lavis, M.D., M.B.G.S., B.-es-Sc, F.O.S.

In a recent dolerite lava stream that reaches the sea at Punta Pietrazza, on the

island of Stromboli, are numerous inclusions of vein quartz and quartzite. These

attain several centimetres in diameter ; some specimens are almost clear glassy,

while others are opaque and granular.

They have undergone more or less softening and fluxion, if not actual fusion,

by the lava. They are surrounded by a glassy crust containing numerous augite

-crystals, more especially at the periphery. AVhere the glassy envelope has formed

veins penetrating along the fissures in the quartz, augite crystals have crystallised

out of this vitreous fluid. The amount of augite in the vicinity of these quartz

·enclosures is greater than the average in the surrounding lava, showing that the
quartz has afforded a material necessary for the individualisation of augite. The

crystallisation of such out of the glass envelope would have been more complete

if sudden cooling of the lava had not prevented such a result.

The small island of Stromholicchio, close to Stromboli, is the wreck of an old

volcanic neck. The rock composing it is lighter than the lavas of Stromboli, being

of a purple tint, in which dark bottle-coloured and also bright emerald green

augites are visible, the latter being fewer but very striking. The Strombolicchio

rock is crowded with quartz enclosures, more opaque, more granular, and en-

wreathed with numerous emerald green augites. This green crust is seen micro-

Wescopically to be composed of mixed grains of quartz and augite.  can trace

the emerald green augites to an origin in the quartz which has combined with the

Tesidual fluid of basic oxides with insufficient silica for the individualisation of a

mineral to form an augite.
     The process is seen better here on account of the slow cooling of the plug and

the absence of the mechanical disturbance in the flowing stream of lava of the

Punta Pietrazza.

I have elsewhere shown the olivine nodules and many loose crystals are nothing

more than altered limestone enclo=!ures, and here we see quartz adding augite to a

lav a which may owe its diminished acidity in part to the absorption and conversion
--760 REPORT 1893.

of quartz into augite, the supply of the free silica possibly affecting the rock in

other ways as to its composition, not so easily demonstrable as the one here

described.

     This is one more fact which goes to show that igneous rocks are markedly modi-
fied in their composition by the rocks they traverse. I have pointed out elsewhere

that it is not a case of simple fusion or fluxion but rather one of selective diffusion.

      11. On the Gypsum Deposits of Nottinghamsldre and DerlysMre.
                               By A. T. Metcalfe, F.O.S.

     The gypsum deposits of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire belong to the Keuper
series (Triassic). The ' Upper ISIarls,' in which the gypsum deposits occur, con-
sist of beds of marls with minor bands of sandstone. Rock salt is apparently absent
in both counties, but gypsum is abundant.

     The chief gypsum works in Nottinghamshire are at Newark, Orston, Barton,
Thrumpton Gotham, and Kingston, and in Derbyshire at Chellaston and Aston.
The gypsum varies in thickness from a mere film to fifteen feet or so, and occurs iii
the marls in the form of ' bowls,' ' cakes,' beds, and thin bands or veins, and
in every degree of purity. The more massive portions are usually saccharoidal or
amorphous, and the purest kiud is by the trade termed ' Superfine.' The tough
variety, commonly called ' Alabaster,' which is worked up into ornaments, is found
only in the Chellaston district. The thin bands or ' rivings ' are fibrous (' satin
spar '). These gypsum deposits were probably foi-med in salt lakes or inland seas,
similar to the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake of Utah.

     After extraction gypsum is cleaned, ground down to flour, and burnt. The

burning drives ofl" the combined water. When ground down to flour and properly

burnt gypsum possesses the valuable property of recombining with water, and
setting from a thin paste into a solid mass. The mineral thus treated forms
plaster of Paris, and is an ingredient in Keene's and other hardened cements.

          13. On a Bed of Oolitic Iron-ore in the Lias of Eaasay,
                           By Horace B. Woodwakd, F.G.S.

  [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

     The author drew attention to the occurrence in Raasay of a bed of oolitic iron-
ore which had not been previously noticed. The bed in question attains a thick-
 ness of five feet, and lies at the top of the Middle Lias, beneath the dark shales of
the Upper Lias. The straligraphical position is thus approximately the same as-
that of the Cleveland iron-ore, although in Yorkshire the upper part of the Middle

 Lias contains a series of ironstone bands.

    An analysis of the Raasay ore, made by Mr. A. B. Dick, showed in the grey

 (unweathered) rock 29 per cent., and in tlie brown (weathered) rock 37 per cent.,
of metallic iron. The discovery of the iron-ore was made during the progress of

the Geological Survey.

14. Note on a Transported Mass of Chalk in the Boulder Clay at Catworth
       in Huntingdonshire. By A. C. G. Cameron, Geological Survey.

           [Communicated bj' permission of the Director-General of the Survey.}

     In this paper the author comments upon the abundance of chalk fragments and
boulders that culminate in the Drift around the highest points in the county west
of the town of Huntingdon. At particular elevated spots there are outcrops of
white Chalk which are dug up and used about the farmyards, where it sets hard.
        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                                                                                                     761

making a firm 1)0110111 like cement. At Catworth, near Kimbolton, on the summit

of high ground overlooking the plain of the Oxford Clay, there is a mass of chalk

of great size, regularly interstratified with flint and lying on Boulder Clay. The

very unusual phenomenon is presented of a village, or the greater and principal

part of a village, built on chalk far avcay from any place where the Chalk forma-

tion occurs in place, or any outliers of that rock are seen. The evidence is striking.

There are ponds and pits about in bare chalk, the soil in the gardens is chalk, and

the graves in the churchyard leave off in chalk. There are numerous old excava-

tions besides, whence hundreds of loads of chalk have been got out and carted

away to the farms adjacent.

The flints in this chalk are angular, and show little signs of being weathered or

worn, and there are in it besides thick tabular masses of flint. Copious springs

issue at the base of this chalk, and it is therefore an important water-bearing bed

in the village. The water in the wells sunk through the chalk to the clay beneath,

frequently runs over the top                                                                                                                                    while  in that portion of the village which is outside

the chalk area no water can be got by sinking in the clay. Besides Chalk there are

boulders of other rocks clustered about this village, but none of notable size. It is

--not clear whether the Catworth ChaUc is all one boulder it may, perhaps, be
--several boulders with clay between but as the material has been transported

unaltered from the parent rock, it is not, in any sense of the term, a reconstructed

chalk.

 15. Augen Structure in Relation to tJie Origin of Eruptive BocJcs and Gneiss,

                               By 3. G. GooDCHiLD, F.0.8.

   --The author discriminates between two types of augen structure that (also

 termed phacoidal structure) in which the ' eyes ' are not necessarily crystalline in
 structure, but are the unsheared portions of the rock which have escaped conver-
 sion into the schist to which their matrix has been reduced, and that in which the
 ' eyes ' are crystalline minerals, generally undeformed, and of later date in origin
 than the movements which have produced the schistosity.

      True augen structure occurs under two different conditions. In the one the
 constituents out of which the augen have been formed were already in existence
 within the rock, and their development in a crystalline form is merely a case of
 regeneration under plutonic conditions. In the other class of augen structure
 one or more of the essential constituents that go to form the ' eyes ' did not ori-
 ginally exist within the rock, but have been introduced at a late period in its his-
tory from some foreign source.

      Both of these classes of augen structure appear to be due to segregatory action,
which came into play at a time when the rocks in which the structure occurs were
in a potentially molten condition arising from the heat developed by earth move-
ments acting under great pressure. Under these conditions of high temperature a
slight and very gradual relief of the pressure referred to permitted some of the
less refractory minerals to pass into a condition which favoured their segregating
from a state of diffusion throughout the mass. Under these circumstances the
more refractory minerals remained practically unaffected. If, following the dimi-
nution of pressure (which is equivalent in this case to a rise of temperature), there
ensued a fall of temperature, the newly-formed minerals passed into the crystalline
condition, while the rock material within which the augen had been developed
still retained the schistose or other structure impressed upon it by the earth move-
ments of prior date.

      According to this view, therefore, phacoidal amphibolite and augen-amphibolite

are respectively the results of mechanical and chemical action upon the same-
original type of rock.

     In the other types of augen structure the 'eyes' are developed by the
heat generated by earth movements, as in the former case; but an essential
component of one or more of the constituents of the augen has been derived

from an outside source. Augen of this class may consist of any one of several

minerals; but those of most importance in the present connection are the

augen of one or other of the felspars. These consist of crystalline and, usually,
very clear and fresh felspar, which has been developed, in the cases specially under
consideration, in rocks of detrital origin, from whose original constituents the
soluble alkahes had been removed by surface agencies. AVhen such rocks were first
acted upon by plutonic agencies they did not, therefore, contain the whole of the

constituents out of which new felspar could arise. The question in such a case
is. Whence came the alkalies which have combined with the silicates of alumina to
form the felspar ? In a few cases it may be surmised that part of the alkaline
matter may have been introduced through the agency of percolating waters de-

rived from a land-surface, or from the bottom of the sea. In such cases the alka-
lies liberated by the weathering are partly returned underground, there to enter

upon a new cycle of change. But it is just possible that the chief source of most
of the alkalies that are introduced into rocks in process of metamorphism may lie
within the inner zones of the earth's crust, whence both potassium and sodium may
be expelled in some mobile form capable of diffusing itself throughout certain
kinds of rock, and there enter into new combinations in the manner already

suggested.

     Augen structure graduates into true pegmatite, in which certain rock-forming

silicates have aggregated into zones or bands following the planes of structural
weakness in the rock wherein they occur. True pegmatite is thus of subsequent
origin to the consolidation of the rock in which it occurs : in this respect, amongst
others, it differs from ' giant granites.' Pegmatite, according to this view, is not
intrusive in the ordinary sense of the word, but is developed in situ as a conse-

quence of local and slight relief of pressure when the parent rock was in a poten-

tially molten state resulting from earth-creep under plutonic conditions.
     The continued formation of bands of pegmatite along the dominant planes of

weakness in a schistose rock of metamorphic origin must result in the develop-
ment of a truly foliated (not schistose) rock, into whose structure crystalline
felspar enters as an essential constituent. Such a rock would differ in no respect
from a true gneiss.

     If the superincumbent pressure is relieved joer saltum, while any given rock is
subjected to a temperature above that of the fusing point of its most refractory
constituent, the entire mass enters into a state of fusion, in which form it eats its

way upward until a communication is established between the subterranean zones

of fusion and the surface, and a volcano is the result.
     It would thus appear that augen structure is one of the first stages alike in the

conversion of a metamorphic rock into gneiss, and in that fusion of deep-seated
masses which eventually leads to the formation of the non-foliated rocks of erup-

tive origin.

     The following Papers and Report were read:

1. The Genetic Relations of the Basic Eruptive Bocks of Gran (Krisiiama

  Region). By Professor W. C. Brogger, of the University of Kristiania.

      This paper dealt with a series of eruptive bosses and laccolites forming a line

--of hills, of which the chief, in order from north to south, are : (1) Brandberget,

(2) Solvsberget, (3) Viksfjeld, and (4) Dignaes. The main rock type in these
bosses was called by the author Olivine-gabbro-diabase. It is basic (43 per cent.
SiO.j) in (1), rather less basic (47 per cent.) in (2), and somewhat acid (49 per cent.)
in (4). From the intimate connection of the minerals in the different types, and
 the occurrence of all intermediate varieties, it was proved that these rocks had

segregated in succession from a magma whose average composition was not unlike

that of the rock of Solvsberget. The gradation in chemical composition produced
                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

                                                                                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                                           763

a similar gradation in the mineral percentages, the felspar increasing from 12 per cent,

to 64 per cent., and the pyroxene diminishing from 67 per cent, to 10 per cent, in a

southerly direction. The author briefly stated that the contact metamorphism due

to these plutonic rocks was quite diS'erent in character from that produced by a

neighbouring mass of quartz-syenite in the same group of sedimentary rocks.

The eruptive bosses are accompanied by a great series of dikes and sheets of 1am-

prophyric character, and varying from camptonite to bostonite. The author brought

forward a quantity of evidence to prove that (1) these two extreme types, with

SiO., percentages varying from 40 to 56, had been derived from the same magma

that (2) 9 parts of camptonite and 2 of bostonite (about the proportion observed

in the field) would give a magma of the composition of the Olivine-gabbro-diabase

of Solvsberget ; that (3) these lamprophyric dikes had been derived from the same

magma as the plutonic rocks ; and that (4) the diiferentiation had been efiected
while the magma still remained fluid. It was further shown that the differentiation

was probably due to the migration of less soluble constituents to the cooling

margin                                that the camptonites had                                       a composition closely allied to that of the brown
                                   ;

hornblendes of the area ; and that, while the essential cooling of the plutonic rocks

had taken place in the eruptive bosses themselves, the dike rocks had segregated

before extrusion.

   A subsidiary diSerentiation of the plutonic rocks has also taken place in some

of the bosses, giving rise in the pure basic Brandberget to a pyroxenite (with 95 per

cent, pyroxene) and augite-diorite, and in the less basic Solvsberget pyroxenite and

labrador-porphyrite.

Other points of information to be noted were : (1) That, under different physical

conditions, not only various mineral aggregates, but rocks of varying chemical

composition                           had  resulted                                        from      the  differentiation  of  the  same  magma                                 (2) that
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

similar products result in this case from the segregation of an Olivine-gabbro-

diabase magma as have elsewhere been derived from a magma that has produced

nepheline-syenite                                                                     (3)  that the  direction of segregation,      according  to                               laws  of
                                                                                   ;

crystalhsation, throws considerable light on the order of volcanic eruptions from

neighbouring centres.

2. Petrological Features of the Dissected Volcano of Crandall Basin,

           Wyoming. By Professor Joseph Paxson Iddings.

It will not be possible in an abstract to do more than present in the briefest

manner the more sali?nt features of the petrology of the rocks of this volcano. The

rocks are mostly the same as those in various parts of the Yellowstone National Park,

some of which have been described in another place. The older acid breccia con-

sists of fragments and dust of hornblende-mica-andesite, hornblende-andesite, and

hornblende-pyroxene-andesite. They are partly glassy and partly holocrystalline.

In some places they appear to pass into the overlying breccia, but in others they

have been eroded and weathered before the latter were thrown over them.

The upper breccia, which constitutes the main mass of the volcano, is basaltic

as a whole. It consists of pyroxene-andesite and basalt, the latter predominating

in the upper part of the accumulation. The massive flows, so far as investigated,

Aare all basalt. The composition varies constantly within narrow limits.                                                                                                        great

part of these rocks contain glassy ground mass.

The rocks constituting the dikes exhibit more variation than the breccias,

though the majority of them are like the breccias in composition and habit, being

Abasalt. They are generally more crystalline.                                                             great many dike rocks resemble

the basalts in outward appearance, but have no olivine, and are more crystalline.

The absence of olivine appears to be due to the conditions which influenced the

crystallisation of the rocks, and not to their chemical composition, for in some

cases what appear in hand specimens to be decomposed olivines are found to be

paramorpha after this mineral, consisting of grains of augite, magnetite, and biotite.

As the rocks become more crystalline biotite becomes an essential constituent, the

porphyritic minerals lose their sharpness of outline and assume some of the

microscopical characteristics they possess in gabbro.
764 REPORT-- 1893.

Within the core the coarsest-grained forms are gabhro. The composition

Yaries in different parts of one rock mass, and also between different intrusions
within the core. The transition is from a gabbro to a diorite with biotite and quartz

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and the extreme variety is that form of granite called haplite, the range in silica

being from 61"81 to 71'62 per cent. Fine-grained andesitic equivalents of diorite

occur in dikes outside of the core, but none of the most siliceous varieties haa

been found outside of it.

    From this it appears that towards the end of volcanic activity near the core the
composition of the magmas became more and more siliceous, and the volume of the

lava erupted smaller. But this change in composition was not xminterrupted, for
there are evidences of the alternate eruption of basic magmas as well. Dikes of

more siliceous rocks are traversed by later dikes of basic rocks. This has taken

place both inside and outside of the core.

     Some of these basic rocks are exceptionally low in silica for rocks of this region.

They are all found at some distance from the core, with one exception, which

is an inti'usion within it. They are lamprophyric, and approach more or less
closely camptonites, monchiquites, kersantites, and minettes. They are connected

with the basalts of the region by mineralogical and structural transitions.

These exceptionally basic rocks are the chemical complements of the acid ones

in the core, and appear to be among the latest eruptions. "While they agree with

one another in having a low percentage of silica, they differ in the relative abun-

dance of magnesia, lime, and iron oxide on the one hand and of alumina, soda,

and potash on the other.

As already pointed out by the writer in another place, the variability in

composition of all the igneous rocks in this volcano illustrates one mode of

Adifferentiation of a magma at a particular centre of eruption.  comparison of the

chemical and mineral composition of the rocks of this district furnishes additional

evidence of the fact that magmas which are chemically similar will crystallise into

different groups of minerals, according to the conditions through which they pass.

Thus chemically similar magmas may form basalt under one set of conditions and

gabbro under others, the first composed of plagioclase, augite, olivine, magnetite,

and sometimes hypersthene, the second consisting of plagioclase, augite, hyper-

sthene, and biotite, besides some magnetite, orthoclase, and quartz, with or without

hornblende. Minerals, then, which are primarily functions of the chemical

composition of rocks are also functions of the physical conditions affecting

crystallisation.

Some of the conditions under which the molten magmas solidiiied within the

dikes and core of the volcano of Crandall Basin may be inferred from a considera-
tion of the geological structure of this ancient volcano. The magmas which
solidified within that portion of the core now exposed and those in dikes within a

radius of two miles must have occupied positions at nearly the same distance

--beneath the surface of the volcano tliat is, at a depth of about 10,000 feet. The

latter rocks were as deep or as abysmal as the former, and yet their degrees of

crystallisation range from glassy to coarsely granular. The influence of pressure

on the crystallisation is not recognisable either in the size of grain or the phase of

crystallisation.

    Marked changes in the crystallisation may be traced horizontally in the imme-

diate vicinity of the core. They are rapid near the core, and are accompanied by
the induration and metamorphism of the surrounding rocks. They are in great

measure independent of the size of the rock-body, since narrow dikes within the

core are coarse-grained, while much broader ones in the surrounding breccias are

very fine-grained. It was unquestionably the differences in the temperature of the

core-rocks and of the outlying breccias which affected the degree of crystallisation.
The former must have been more highly heated than the surrounding rocks, and

the magmas solidifying within them cooled much more slowly than those injected

into the outlying parts of the volcano. In this case the depth at which the

magmas solidified appears to have been of little moment in comparison with the

temperature of the rocks by which they were surrounded.

The core of gabbro and diorite, with an intricate system of veins of middle-
                 --

                 TIUNSACTIONS OF SECTION C.              765

grained porphyritic rocks, and radiating dikes of aphanitic and glassy lavas, encased
in an accumulation of tuffs and breccias, with flows of massive lava, constitute an

extinct or completed volcano. The central core consists of magmas that closed
the conduit through which many of the eruptions had reached the surface. In
solidifying they became coarse-grained. The question naturally suggests itself,

Are these rocks any less volcanic than those that reached the surface ? What

part of a volcano is n on-volcanic ?

             3. Berthelot^s Principle applied to ALagmatic Concentration.

                              Bij Alfred Harkeg, M.A., F.G.S.

     The paper deals with that type of concentration in which an igneous rock-
magma, supposed originally homogeneous, has been difierentiated by accumulation
of the more basic ingredients in the cooler marginal part of the liquid. The author
tries to find a physical cause for this action by comparing such a magma with a
saturated saline solution, and applying Berthelot's ' principle of maximum work ' or
the cognate one of ' most rapid degradation.' The migration of the least soluble
ingredients to the part of the liquid most easily saturated would determine
crystallisation, the process which in the case supposed would give the most rapid

evolution of heat.

4. On the Origin of Intermediate Varieties of Igneous BocJcs hy Intrusion
     and Admixture, as observed at Barnavave, Carlingford. By Professor
    W. J. SOLLAS, B.Sc, F.B.S.

     The two principal kinds of rocks composing the mountain of Barnavave are a
dark-coloured, almost black, gabbro and a light-coloured, almost white, grano-

phyre. This extreme contrast in colour renders the study of their relations to each

other in the field a comparatively easy task. The gabbro which overlies the grano-
phyre was the first-formed rock, and had ah-eady cooled and solidified before the
granophyre was injected into it. The injection of granophyre has been of the
most searching character, and the rock can be traced from the parent mass through
dykes of all gradations in size down to the minutest films and specks which till
cracks and cavities in and amongst the constituent minerals of the gabbro. The
gabbro has thus become converted locally into the quartz gabbro of authors, and
it is suggested that in other cases, as that of Carrock Fell, this rock has had a
similar origin. The granophyre, on the other hand, contains fragments of the
gabbro, ranging from great blocks down to mere crystal dust of its constituent
minerals, labradorite and augite. It thus passes into hornblendic granophyre, the
  syenite ' of the Survey. There is no evidence here, as has been erroneously sup-
posed, of the diff'erentiation of an originally homogeneous magma, and the minute
granophyric dykes are neither contemporaneous nor segregation products. On
the contrary, rocks of intermediate character have been produced from already dif-
ferentiated and opposed types solely by admixture.

5. On the Transformation of an Amphiholite into Qtiartz-mica-diorite.
                 By Professor W. J. Sollas, D.Sc, F.B.S.

    On the steep northern side of the upper lake of Glendalough, Co. Wicklow, a

coarsely crystalline rock, weathering spheroidally, protrudes in a bold mass through
the surrounding Ordovician mica-schists, which it welds at the junction into des-
mosite. It consists almost entirely of hornblende, possesses a specific gravity of
3-03, and analysed in bulk gives the following results :

Silica                                       48-94

766 KEPORT-- 1893.

      Great interest attaches to the remarkable change in character and composition
which the rock undergoes on passing from its eastern to its western boundary :
quartz and orthoclase as well as plagioclase felspar appear as additional consti-
tuents ; simultaneously the hornblende becomes actinolitic, and gives rise to a

profusion of black mica. From an amphibolite the rock changes into a quartz-

mica-diorite.

     Numerous veins of quartz traverse the adjacent schists, and can be traced on
the western side of the amphibolite up to and into it ; they contain potash felspar
near the junction, and it is to their influence that the transformation of the

amphibolite is unquestionably due.
      Another instance is thus afforded of a rock of intermediate type resulting from

the admixture of already differentiated material.

6. On some Igneous Hoclcs of South Pemhrohesldre, luith a Note on the Hocks
      of the Isle of Qrassholme. By F. T. Howard, B.A., and E. W. Small,

        M.A., B.Sc.

   --I. Constitution of the District. The district is largely composed of rocks of

Old Red Sandstone age with smaller patches of Silurian and Ordovician strata,
bounded on the N. by Carboniferous rocks. The igneous rocks may be roughly
divided into two groups : the first or northern group runs in a more or less E.

and W. direction, and marks the southern boundary of the Culm, while the second

(in the S.W.) occurs as isolated patches, associated principally with rocks of

Silurian age.

     II. Reference is given to the previous work of Kidd, De la Beche, Murchison,

Aveline, Rutley, Hicks, Davies, and Teall.

  -- --III. Detailed Descriptio7i of the Igneous Hocks. (A) Northern group. Sub-

divided into three distinct patches: (a) In S.E. running from Benton Castle

N. W. to Rosemarket, and from Benton Wood to Waterless. Practically all the

rocks of this patch are quartz felsites or rhyolites ; several of them show good
flow structure and spherulites ; much alteration has occurred in places, and the
rocks have become brecciated. At Waterless is a rock (marked as granite on the
Survey map), composed of quartz and felspar, whose connection with the felsites
is not very clear. (6) To N. .and E. of the last, stretching from near Llangwm
to beyond Tier's Cross. The rocks of this patch show great alteration, readily
weathering down to a felspathic gravel. On the Survey map the patch is
marked partly as syenite and partly as greenstone. Dr. Hicks describes the de-
composed form of the rock seen in the railway cuttings at Johnstone as a

granitoid rock, very similar to the Dimetian. Two large quarries at Annikell

atod Targate give the only good exposures of the unweathered rock, chiefly a coarsely

crystalline aggregate of quartz and hornblende, with a gneissose structure.
Microscopically some portions might be described as typical hornblende schist,
others as quartz diorite, granitic in aspect. Mr. Watts suggests that this rock
may possibly be allied to the soda granites of Leiuster, described by Professor
Sollas. Another rock, a highly quartzose granite with microcline, appears to be

Alater than the diorite : it shows much evidence of crushing and straining.

greenish black fine-grained rock (macroscopically appearing to be an ordinary
dolerite, microscopically showing fresh stumpy plagioclase set in large plates of
hornblende, apparently of primary origin) seems to be intrusive into the quartz
diorite. It is doubtless the rock referred to by Dr. Hicks as diabase ; it should
perhaps be called an epidiorite, or proterobase. {c) The third portion of group

A runs from Romans Castle on a narrow strip past AValwyns Castle up to

Talbenny, where the outcrop broadens and forms the cliffs of Goultrop Head.

As described by Dr. Hicks, Mr. Davies, and Mr. Teall, the main rock appears to

be an altered quartz diorite penetrated by a whiter granite ; besides which there
seem to be basic dykes, all more or less altered, some epidiorite, others hornblende

schists. The rock at Walwyns Castle appears, however, to be afelsife.

  --(B) Southern group. This group consists of a number of patches, which
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                         767

 appear on the Survey map as greenstone, between St. Isbmael's on the E., Dale
 on the S., Wooltack Park on the W., and Musclewick Bay on the N., including
 also Midland Island and part of Skomer. The rock seen in a small quarry at Crah-
 hall was described by Mr. Teall as a somewhat basic porphyrite. What appears

 to be the same rock is found exposed in several places on the opposite side of the

 Mullock stream. At Marloes Sands the continuation of the Crabhall rock appears
 in the cliff as a black dense rock much traversed by quartz and epidote. Micro-

 scopically it is a perfect dolerite, generally ophitic in structure with plagio-
 clase in augite plates, but sometimes granular ; there seems to be some hypersthene,

 and serpentine is present, probably after the same mineral. From Marloes

 Beacon this rock seems to continue, until it appears in contact with Llandeilo rocks
 in Musclewick Bay. The rock found here, however, is shown by the microscope to
 be a felsite (probably a soda felsite), and not a variety of the dolerite.

     At Martins Haven the same ophitic hypersthene dolerite is found which occurs

at Marloes Beacon and in Marloes Bay.

   --IV. Age of the Igneous Rocks. The age of these rocks appears to have been

regarded by the Survey as post-Carboniferous, while some of them at any rate have
been claimed by Dr. Hicks as pre-Cambrian. The felsites in the Benton area are
almost entirely associated with beds of Old Bed Sandstone, and there does not seem
to be any satisfactory evidence of intrusion. Such a continuous mass of quartz
felsite, with well-marked spherulitic and fluxion structure, seems to suggest

rather a flow than an intruded mass. On this supposition the beds must be at

least post-Silurian.

     The rocks from Llangwm to Talbenny are in almost every instance associated

with Llandovery beds on the one hand and Carboniferous strata on the other.
The Carboniferous strata are reversed in dip, and the line of junction is in our
opinion a line of thrust. The evidence seems to indicate that the rocks are not
post-Carboniferous, the Culm measures being apparently unaltered near the junc-
tion, and that, judging by lithological character, they did not occupy their present

position as a ridge in Llandovery, Old Bed, or Carboniferous times. With regard to
the southern area we could not find clear evidence of intrusion, all the chief

junctions appearing to be faulted ones ; still there seems to be little doubt that
rocks microscopically similar rest on diilerent measures of Silurian age.

     Grassholme, a small island about seven miles from the mainland, but rarely
visited, appears to be the continuation of the ridge from Wooltack Park and
Skomer towards the S.E. corner of Ireland.

    No clastic rocks were found, the main rocks being ophitic dolerite, with

corroded augite and some bands of secondary epidote and quartz.

7. Notes on a Hornblende Pikrite frovi Greijstones, Co. Wicldow.

                  By W. W. Watts, M.A., F.G.8.

[Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

In this paper the author gave a description of a rock which forms a dyke in the

Cambrian slates and grits of Greystones, in Co. W^icklow. It is a dark, dense,

coarsely crystalline rock, showing large crystals of hornblende with lustre-mottling,

owing to the weathering-out of olivine crystals. It becomes finer-grained at the

margins. An analysis by Dr. Sullivan was added.

     The hornblende is of the usual gi-een type, and occurs in large crystals

enclosing pseudomorphs of olivine, now made up of magnetite and probably a

Acolourless amphibole.  colourless hornblende also occurs either as cores or

Aborders to the green crystals.  third type of hornblende present shows few

cleavage cracks and much magnetite dust. Apatite is a constituent, but there is

no felspar in the rock. The margin of the dyke is much sheared and phacoidal

in structure.

                      By Rev. A. Ieving, D.Sc, B.A., F.G.8.

The author reviews the work done by himself and in collaboration with other

.geologists on the Permian and Trias since he commenced the study of them in the

North Midlands more than twenty years ago. He shows why the use of the term

' Poikilitic ' and its connotation was given up by him after further work in Britain

and in Germany : that it is necessary to recognise (as the earlier writers had done)
two distinct systems in these rocks ; that the strata called ' Bunterschiefer ' by
Murchison are really the base of the Trias of Central Germany, and are sharply
cut off from the Zechstein : that there is a distinct differentiation of the two systems

from each other on physical as well as stratigraphieal grounds, on account of the

-great difference as to the derivation of their materials in the relation the Permian

and Trias bear to the adjacent older land.
    The chief results of the author's work on the Red Rocks of Devon in the years

1887-1892 are then summarised ; further evidence of the contemporaneity of the
volcanic rocks and the breccia-sandstone series is given ; and attention is drawn to

the new edition of the 1-inch map of the Geological Survey, on which the
Permians of Devon, as described by himself, are delineated. He regrets that he is

not able to accept (for reasons given in his published papers) the delimitation of

the Keuper, at the expense of the Bunter, which is adopted on that map, the base

of the Keuper having been traced in the valleys of the Otter and the Sid.

4. On the Occurrence of Fossils in the Magnesian Limestone of Bulwell, near

    At Bulwell, near Nottingham, good sections are exposed in stone and brick
pits. The stone pits exhibit from 5 to 20 feet of yellowish brown Magnesian
limestones, in beds of from 3 inches to 1 foot, with rather irregular surfaces. The

limestone is very occasionally compact and sub-crystalline. It consists for the
most part of an aggregate of recrystallised materials, giving it the appearance of a
sandstone. Very occasionally quartz pebbles of small size are met with in the
denser portion. Certain markings on the irregular bed surfaces, which resembled
the rude internal casts of molluscs, led us to make a closer investigation, which,
from feeble casts and cavities, as if resulting from the solution of shell matter,

introduced us to certain proofs of the presence of organisms. These are in a very
imperfect state of preservation, but enough of the form remains to confidendy
assert the presence of Schizodus and of Aucella Hausmanni, forms which
characterise the Upper Magnesian limestone.

     The fossil casts are plentiful, sometimes occurring through the stone for a
thickness of 2 or 3 feet. Through their imperfect condition one can only say

that the other casts suggested Schizodus Schlotheimii, IS. rotundatus, Edniondiit,
Gervillia antiqua. In brick pits near the stone pits, over a floor of Magnesian

limestone, we find a section of from 5 to 15 feet of red marly clay, with pale
brown and greenish arenaceous beds and bands in places apparently dolomitic and

resemblmg the Magnesian limestone below. These clays are immediately overlain
by the Red sandstone (lower mottled) of the Bunter. Proceeding towards
Nottingham sections of Bunter pebble beds are shown, exhibiting their false
bedded courses, and containing occasional lines of pebbles or scattered pebbles of

hard liver-coloured quartzite and other stones, amongst which we noticed fragments
of igneous rock, one quartz porphyry being of a type familiar in Germany and in
the Teignmouth breccias of the south-west of England. The marly clay with

intercalated sandstones recalls the passage beds of marl and sandstone on the coast

between Exmouth and Straight Point, though the latter are more than ten times

its thickness.

                        By Professor B. Hull, F.R.S., F.G.8.

      Professor F. Clowes having expressed his opinion at a previous meeting of the
Section ' that the Himlack stone had been formed artificially by quarrying out the
rock which formerly inclosed it, the author desired to controvert this statement, and

maintained that this remarkable rock was a monument of natural denuding agency,
either marine or atmospheric. Some thirty years since, when working on the
Geological Survey, he had sketched and described this rock, as will be seen on
reference to the Survey memoir ' On the Triassic and Permian Rocks of the
Midland Counties ' (1869), p. 34. The rock, which is 20 feet high, consists in its
upper part of the ' pebble beds,' and in its lower of the ' lower mottled sandstone,'
of the Bunter sandstone ; and at the time the memoir was written the author
considered the rock to be a remnant of marine denudation, an old sea-stack of the

post-Pliocene period.

     Its great antiquity is evinced by its name 'Himlack,' which is clearly a

Celtic word.

6. On the Junction of Permian and Triassic BocJcs at Stocliport.
      By J. W. Gray, F.G.8., and Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

     The Stockport section has for nearly thirty years been regarded as furnishing
the typical illustration of an unconformity between the Permian rocks and the
overlying Bunter. The Geological Survey memoir relating to the, district gives

the following three vertical sections :

             Heaton Mersey                Hope Hill                   Stockport

    By a fortunate chance toreholes have within the last ten years heen put down

at each of the localities named ; the authors have had opportunities of watching

the progress of the work, and the investigation has yielded results entirely
different from those previously recorded.

    At the most easterly exposure a good brook section displays a considerable
thickness of the marls. The details of the well sections are as follows :

West                          --Heaton Mersey    --Hope Hill  --Stockport East
         Bunter
                             143 feet 6 inches.   150 feet.       134 feet.
          Collyhurst marls.

     The authors consider that the close correspondence in thiclmess of the upper-
most member of the Permian series in all three sections justifies the opinion that,

whatever may be the case elsewhere, there is no evidence of unconformity at

Stockport. The facts brought to light have an important bearing upon the
question of water supply, and also encourage the expectation that coal may be
profitably worked beneath the newer rocks at long distances from the western

edge of the Cheshire coalfield.

7. Note on some Molluscan Remains lateli/ discovered in the English Keuper.

    By R. Bdllen Newton, F.G.S., British Museum (Natural History).

     This communication directs attention to the discovery, by the Rev. P. B. Brodie
and Mr. E. P. Richards, of some obscure impressions of lamellibranch shells in
the green gritty marls of the Upper Keuper Sandstone of Shrewley, Warwickshire,
which form the first evidence of a molluscan fauna from these beds as developed in
this country. The matrix appears to be so peculiarly unfavourable for the reten-
tion of shell structure that it is doubtful whether any better material than the
present will ever be forthcoming. The specimens indicate truly marine types,
though on account of bad preservation only three of them could be selected for
description as exhibiting certain characters in their contours and sculpturing, which
might be of service in ascertaining their probable generic positions. Estheria

mmwte is the one invertebrate form hitherto recorded from the British Keuper;

that is, excluding the Foraminifera described by Professor T. R. Jones and AV. K.
Parker,* which came from an alabaster pit at Chellaston, near Derby, and which
were doubtfully referred by the authors to an Upper Triassic age. The very
modern faciesof the Foraminifera has suggested the highly probable idea that they
were derived from superficial deposits.

      Associated in the matrix containing these molluscan impressions are fragments
of cestraciont spines and teeth {Acrodus Keuperinus) and a part of a carapace of
the small phyllopodous crustacean, Estheria minuta.

     The specimens described are identified as

                                          (1) Thrac-iaQ) Brodiei (n. sp.).

                                 (2) Gonwmya Keuperina (n. sp.).

                                      (3) Pholadomya (?) Ricliardsi (n. sp.).

     Such generic forms as are represented here have not apparently been reported
from rocks of a similar period on the Continent or elsewhere.

8. Ohservations on the Skiddaw Slates of the North of the Isle of Man. By
   Herbert Bolton, Assistant Keeper, the Manchester Museum, Owens

     College.

    The Skiddaw slate group of the north of the Isle of Man consists of alterna-

tions of quartzites, schists, slates, and bedded volcanic ash, penetrated by intrusive
sheets and dykes and ramifying qiiartz veins.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.              77

     North of a line drawn from Port Mooar through Snaefell to Peel, the general
dip of the slate is to the north-north-west at an angle varying from thirty degrees

to nearly vertical.

     The lowest beds exposed in this area crop at Port Mooar along the axes of a
series of anticlinal folds, which occupy the whole of the bay and extend south to
Gob-ny-Garvain. These beds consist of massive iron-stained quartzites and schists
overlaid by well-bedded slates. Northwards, by St. Maughold's Head and thence
to Ramsey, the slates dip steadily to the north-north-west, the angle of dip varying
between fifty and sixty degrees. Several dykes cut through the slate, whilst
quartz veins run in all directions. The dykes run very nearly in the line of strike,
and at first sight appear bedded and not intrusive.

     That the quartz veins originated subsequent to the dykes is seen by their pene-

trating the latter.

     Interbedded with the slates are thick sheets of volcanic ash much resembling

quartzites.

     The slates of St. Maughold's Head have yielded Valceochorda and certain oval
structures which are evidently organic.

     In the neighbourhood of Ballure Glen and Ballastowel Hill, the slates are
badly bedded, and full of irregular pebble-like inclusions, which give to the rock

a brecciated appearance. These have yielded the cast of a trilobite much resembling
Asaphus or yEglina, and also certain other structures which may possibly prove
organic. North and nortli-west from Ballastowell, the Skiddaw slates consist of

irregularly bedded iron-stained slates with interbedded volcanic ash, the latter often

of considerable thickness.

     Near Sully Glen Station occurs the singular and isolated hill of Cronk Lumark,
made up of a ' shivery ' slate. In a quarry on the north side of the hill specimens
were discovered of Dictyonema sociale and of a new species not yet described.

   A series of dip observations taken along Sully Glen, Tholt-e-Will, and over

the summit of Snaefell, shows that the dip changes round towards the west,
causing axes of the anticlinal folds to emerge on the west coast, a little
to the south of Peel, where the cliffs exhibit a series of contortions and folds not
unlike those of Gob-ny-Garvaia and Port Mooar.

     The conclusions deduced from these observations are as follows :

    (1) That the Skiddaw slates of the north of the Isle of Man dip north-north-

west from an axis of folding which runs from Gob-ny-Garvain and Port Mooar on

the east to a little south of Peel on the west.
     (2) That there exists a series of contemporaneous beds of volcanic ash.

     (3) That the Skiddaw slates are fossiliferous, and by their fossils show a relation
with the Lingula Flags of the Cambrian.

9. On the Volcanic Phenomena of Jaimn.

        10. On the Badiolarian Cherts of Cornwall. By Howard Fox, F.G.S.

            The Mullion Island radiolarian cherts were first recognised by Mr. J. J. II.
      Teall, F.R.S., in rocks sent to him by the author last autumn, and a joint paper was
      read at the Geological Society's meeting, February 8 last, describing the manner
      in which they occur. Dr. Hinde accompanied the paper with a description of the
       species recognised and with micro-photogi-aphs of the individual organisms.

             Last Easter Mr. Teall, Professor Lapworth, and the author traced these cherts
       for about 650 yards in the cliffs and on the foreshore from the south end of Nelly's
       Cove, near Porthallow, Meneage, to near Ligarath Point, south of the Nore Point.
       Subsequently the author has examined the coast and some inland districts between
       Ilelford River and Fowey, and has found other exposures in the following

         places :

      --Pendoner Beach, Veryan (for about 1,000 yards). Beds many feet thick at the

       ·west end of this beach, on which the raised beach rests. Angular fragments of

                                                                                                                      3D2

chert are enclosed in the raised beach, and in one place a mass of chert and slate
cliff has been thrust over it, and thus the chert appears both above and below as
well as in the raised beach. Towards the eastern end of this beach the chert beds
become thinner and more impure and ferruginous, and the limestone beds become

--thicker and more numerous.
     Portloe Point, Veryan. Here several beds, varying from one to six inches in
thickness, are seen for 20 yards in the volcanic breccia (or ' trappean conglomerate
of De la Beche) associated with some small amount of shale and grit, more or less

decomposing from the presence of iron. Two small exposures are traced inland,

one of which is 600 yards west of Portloe Point.

   --Pecunnen Cove, Gorran. N.W. of the Dodman beds of chert are seen in

perpendicular thinly laminated crushed dark slates for 60 yards, accompanied by
numerous lenticles and bands of black quartzite and yellowish grey limestone.

      Inland exposures are traced at intervals in a line extending for five miles
inland from Pendoner Beach in a N.E. direction through the village of Veryan
to Tolcarne Mill, north of St. Michael Caerhays. These cherts on the mainland
are less pure than those in Mullion Island, and the structure of the individual

organism is destroyed. Some specimens show signs of great shearing and
crushing, and have no traces of radiolaria ; others show shearing with slight
traces of radiolaria, whilst others show no signs of crushing, and haAe clear round
spaces, evidently due to radiolaria. In many of the specimens examined a
considerable amount of ferric oxide has been formed by the decomposition and
oxidation of pyrites, and possibly also of feniferous carbonate. At Portloe Point

the chert appears to pass into quartz.

     The Meneage and Veryan cherts are associated with the well-known Ordovician
quartzites of those districts, and appear to lie immediately under them ; but the

sequence is not absolutely clear, and no typical fossils have yet been found in
the shales and slates with which the cherts are interbanded.

                                   Geology in Secondary Education.

             By Professor Grenville A. J. Cole, M.E.I.A., F.0.8.

      This paper is intended to be introductory to a discussion of the methods of
teaching geology, with a view to making the general results of research in that
science more accessible as a branch of education.

     The need for selection of subjects in modern education is fully admitted ; but
it is urged that, following on the study of elementary chemistry and physics,

geology forms a subject of such far-reaching importance that it should be included
in the general curriculum for boys and girls about the age of sixteen or seventeen.

     The utility, in a technical sense, of such knowledge is not here insisted on.
But everyone upon this earth should be capable of appreciating his surroundings,
and particularly the past history of life upon the globe, if he is to be able to pass
judgment upon current affairs, and to play his part as an individual organism.

      It is urged that geology is as fundamentally important as history, and tends to
modify very largely our conceptions of the relations between what is called

' antiquity ' and ourselves. Besides this, in common with other natural sciences,

it encourages a love of truth where statements can be safely made, and of reserve
where assertions would be merely dogmatic.

     The course suggested for all pupils is one in which mineral details are eubor-
                                                  ;

dinated, except where they are important in explaining the origin of certain broad
features, such as familiar and local landscapes. It is proposed to avoid the use
of microscopic sections, and rather to rely upon powdered specimens for the deter-
mination of the constituents of such simple rocks as are dealt with. The greatest
stress for general purposes is to be laid upon an outline of stratigraphical geology,

and its illustration by such beds, unconformities, &c., as may be exhibited in the
environs of the school. The outdoor character of the study should be insisted on
And the fact that the broader generalisations of the science are based on the colla-
tion of local observations will not be among the least valuable results of the intro-

djictioa of the subject into our educational systems.

On Geologif ill Professional Education. Bi/ Professor G. A. Leboue,
 AI.A., F.G.S., of the Durham College of Science, Neivcastle-upon-Tyne.

    The author has for many years been engaged in teaching geology in a Univer-

sity college situated in a centre of great mining and manufacturing activity.

The students with whom he had to deal were many of them, therefore,^ being

educated for some branch or other of engineering, and took up the subject of
geology with a view to its future utility rather than as an academic subject
merely. For professional students of this type he thought that the ordinary
geological courses in colleges of this kind were, as a rule, too long. In hisown
college, for instance, geology comprised two or three annual series of about ninety

lectures each, with a field-day every week and a field-week every year, besides
(for second and third year men) at least eight hours per week of laboratory work.

This was not too long for men going up for title or degree examinations in geology,
and still leas was it too much for those, necessarily few in number, who intended

to become professional geologists; but for future mining or civil engineers and

managers of works he contended that it was excessive. Such men need not be

trained into experts in geology. It was enough that they should leave their

college with so clear a grasp of the principles of the science and such an insight

into its methods that they should be enabled to understand the reports of the

geological experts whom they might employ, and to distinguish between the real

expert and the quack. At present the coinclusions of a report are often all that

appears practical to and all that is really read by the interested parties. This would

be otherwise had they been taught to understand the reasons on which the con-

Aclusions are based.  sound knowledge of principles could alone give this com-

petence, and this could be obtained in at most a single year's course of the length

previously referred to.

     But if he advocated shorter courses for professional students it must not be

supposed that he was therefore in any way in favour of special courses for special

men. There was but one geology, whatever be the future career of the learner.
There was no more a ' geology for engineers ' or a ' geology for agriculturists ' than
there was (as had been suggested years ago in ' Exeter Change ') a ' geology for the
blind 'or a ' geology for rural postmen.' The principles were the same for all,

though in the time "to be spent and in the number and selection of the illustrative
facts brought under the notice of students there was ample room for judicious

adjustment.

     In attempting to carry out those views he had been overwhelmingly impressed
by the value of practical work. If, as Professor Cole had well urged, outdoor
work was useful for schoolboys, it was doubly useful for older students. The field

was to the geologist what the laboratory was to the chemist, and for petrology

and palaeontology geologists now needed laboratories of their own.
     As regards field-work, he had found it useful to adopt a scheme in which the

region examined by his students was treated as an unknown bit of country would
be in the limited time at the disposal of the class; maps and reports were

drawn up exclusively from the observations actually made, leaving out of

consideration all points of which the knowledge had been derived from other
                                     ----

sources. This method gave a sense of the reality of the work scarcely attainable

otherwise.

   --Practical petrological work he had found generally popular with professional

students much more so than palaeontological museum work, some of which must,

however, of course, be done.

    He thought that much more use than is commonly the case might be made of
the experimental method in teaching students of this class. He found, for instance,

that a machine designed by himself for the reproduction on the lecture-table of
most of the phenomena connected with folds, faults, and thrusts gave great
definiteness to the ideas of his pupils, and at the same time added very much to

the interest taken in the lectures. This was the ease also with many of Daubr^e's

experiments on lamination and foliation, and on joints produced by torsion, which
could easily be adapted for demonstration purposes. The fact that sediment is
deposited more rapidly in salt than in fresh water once seen is never forgotten
if only mentioned it is seldom remembered. The production of tinstone (cassiterite)
in a porcelain tube from chloride of tin and water vapour can be managed within
an hour's lecture, and impresses upon the student's mind one method of vein-filling
from below in a manner uneqiialled by any amount of talk. The synthesis of
several minerals can also, with a little trouble, be carried out with the best effects
where a friendly chemical or metallurgical laboratory is at hand.

     Added to experiments such as these, actual measurements with goniometers,
observations of specific gravity by various methods, testings of hardness, streak,
fusibility, and the like, should be made ; and now that we had the benefit of
Professor Cole's most excellent * Aids in Practical Geology,' they could be made with
much greater ease than formerly.

     Time precluded the author from entering into further detail, but he trusted
that enough had been said to show that in teaching professional students of the
University College order he was inchned to rely very largely upon general
principles, illustrated as far as possible by lecture experiments and by actual work
done by the students themselves in the field and geological laboratory.

                2. The Glaciation of Asia. By Prince Keopotken.

      There has lately been a good deal of discussion about the glaciation of Asia^
and especially of Siberia.

     To speak of the glaciation or non-glaciation of an immense continent, without
taking into account its orographic structure, is evidently utterly misleading. One
must have first a clear idea of what Asia is from the orographer's point of view.

     I have, therefore, marked what is known about the glaciation of Siberia upon
a map, in which Petermann has embodied the ideas I advocate about the oro-
graphy of Siberia. The different tints with which it is coloured will show at a

 glance the structure of that part of the continent.
      Lilac represents the plateau (12,000 to 16,000 feet high in the south, 4,000 ta

--.5,000 feet high in the north), with a depression the lower plateau--coloured in

a lighter shade of lilac. Deep and broad valleys penetrate into it from the west.
They have been its drainage valleys. The high plateau has never been submerged
since the Devonian age.

      Broivn colour represents the border-ridge of the plateau and the Alpine tracts,.
indented by deep valleys, which fringe the plateau and consist of chains rimning
 north-east (the older ones) and north-west (the younger ones).

      Orange-yellow represents the high steppes and prairies, 1,000 to 2,000 feet

 high.

      Green shows the lowlands under 1,000 feet, and mostly under 500 feet, above

 the sea.

     Now, taking into consideration all that is known about the old glaciers of
Siberia, we may, I think, sum it up as follows :

      The lowlands, in all probability, have not been glaciated. Immense portions of
them were under the sea, perhaps during the Glacial age, and most certainly
----

during the post-Glacial period, up to what is now the 150 feet level, which

means a great portion of the green space of the map.

    Neither have the steppes, under 2,000 feet, been glaciated ; but many moun-
tain-ridges which lise over them (all under 6,000 feet) were covered with extensive

glaciers.

     The whole of the border-ridge has been glaciated. Immense glaciers in the
Tian-Shan, and immense caps of ice further north, covered it, the ice being dis-
charged into the typical longitudinal valleys which fringe the border-ridge, and
descending there to a very low level (about 1,000 feet).

     Ice also covered large part3 and tilled many valleys of the Alpine tracts which
fringe the plateau. The secondary smaller plateaux, rising amidst these Alpine
tracts (such as the Patom plateau, 58° north latitude, 11-5° east longitude, now

5,000 to 6,000 feet high), were totally buried under the ice. This suggestion of

mine has now been confirmed by Obruchefl:".
    As to the plateau itself, I am very much inclined to think that the whole of

the Vitim plateau and the north-west Mongolia plateau, east and south-west of
Lake Baikal, were totally covered with an ice cap. So also the highlands further

north.

     There is reason to believe that the Pamirs were ice-bound in the same way,
and the great extension of formidable glaciers in the Himalayas is fully proved in

my opinion.

   --I also consider that the eastern border-ridge of the plateau the Great Khin-
--gan has been ice-bound. Where I have crossed it (50° north latitude) it bears

traces of extensive glaciation.

   --As to the southern portion of the High Plateau Tibet, Ordos, and highlands of
--the Hoang-ho, as also the highlands on the Amur in Manchuria and China so far

as my information goes, we must suspend judgment, and are sorry that we have
no reliable information either in favour of or against glaciation. In fact, we know

nothing in this respect as regards these countries.

     But I must mention that the portions of North and Middle Asia which have
bee7i glaciated are, like the glaciated areas of Em-ope, always surrounded by a
girdle of Loess. In Turkestan and on the Lena, as well as in South Russia or on
the Ehine, a fringe of Loess marks the outer limits of glaciation; and those
geologists who consider Loess intimately connected with glaciation, and as having
been formed on the outer borders of large glaciers and ice caps, as it undoubtedly
has been in the case of Europe, will see in the Loess of China an indication,
though not yet a proof, of the probable extension of immense glaciers in the
southern part of the Great Khingan, north and west of Peking, as well as in the
Hoang-ho highlands.

      I leave it to persons better acquainted than myself with the geology of Persia,

Asia Minor, and Armenia to decide how far the south-western plateau of Asia has

been invaded by ice.

    My conclusion for Siberia and the adjoining parts of Mongolia might thus be

provisionally expressed as follows :

      All regions 7iow over 3,000 feet of altitude have been covered either with ice caps
on the plateaux, or luith large glaciers in the Alpine tracts, the glaciers descending.

in the valleys to levels of about 1,000 /eei above the sea. Regions below 2,000 feet
have probably 'SOT been glaciated.

                     3. On some Assumptions in Glacial Geology.
                     By Professor T. G. Bonnet, D.Sc, F.B.S.

     Three assumptions, often treated as axiomatic by modern glacialists, were

discussed :

     (1) That boulder clays are ground moraines. The modes of transport of
d6bris by ice were described. It was admitted that, the more extensive the glacier,
the greater the amount (in proportion) of sub-glacial debris ; but it was denied
that there was any proof that such a deposit (ground moraine) ever attained s

considerable thickness.

--770 EEPOET 1893,

     (2) That glaciers were potent excavators. It was shown that all the evidence
pointed in the opposite direction, and that this dogma was irreconcilable with the

former one.
     (3) That ice can scoop loose material from a sea-bed, carry it overland, and

deposit it unharmed far from and high above the water level. Instances were
given from the Swiss lowlands to show the improbability of this hypothesis.

     The deposits in this region differ from the British boulder clays (among other
things) in the absence of lenticular intercalations of sand and gravel. These
boulder clays are probably of more than one origin. They are not likely to be
understood until there is more attention to facts and abstention from hypotheses.

     4. On the Glacial Period, its Origin and Effects, and the Possibility
              of its Eeczirrence. By C. A. Lindvall, of Stockholm.

     The author in this paper recalls the various explanations of the phenomena
of the Quaternary period offered by different observers. Linne supposed the
kames to contain the history of the first emergence of Sweden ; Sepstrom (1836),
Berzelius, Von Buch, and to a certain extent Sir A. Geikie, attributed the phe-
nomena to a mighty current of water sweeping from north to south ; Dr. Siljestrom
(1838) says that, even admitting the current, the upper valleys of Norway must
have been marked by glaciers. Sir C. Lyell refers to geographical changes;
Sir R. Ball calls in astronomical changes ; but most modern geologists call in the

action of inland ice.

     The author's theory is that the phenomena are due to the continued action of
ocean currents and loose drift ice. In Pleistocene times the Gulf Stream must
Lave swept over Lapland and back through the archipelago of Northern Europe
laden with drift ice. This ice, aided by tidal action and the gradual uplift of the
land, is considered capable of moving and carrying large blocks of stone, masses
of gravel and sand along the bottom of the sea, and of accounting for the denudation
and striation of rocks and many other phenomena of the Glacial period in Sweden,
Switzerland, Ireland, Norway, and North America.

                   By P. VV. Abbott and P. F. Kendall, F.G.S.

     The authors describe the occurrence of many well-preserved examples of
Cardium edule and other species of edible mollusca exposed in a bank of earthy
clay on the slopes of Penmaenmawr, about 200 yards from a farmhouse, ' the
Quinta,' on the old road from Llanfairfechan to Conway. They regard them as

kitchen-midden refuse, as they were associated with bones of birds, bits of charcoal,
and a sheep's tooth. Traces of the foundations of huts were observed, but there
was no remembrance remaining in the neighbourhood of any dwellings on the

epot.

   A second bed, in which the shells were extremely numerous, was observed in

the Aber Valley, about 50 yards above the Bridge. It was exposed beneath the
roots of a large tree which clung to the breached side of a fine terminal moraine,
and the shell-bed presented- the deceptive appearance of being overlaid by the
materials of the moraine. The whole of the marine shells were of edible species,
but it was remarked that the interior of a valve of Ostrea was encrusted with
Polyzoa. The authors consider that both accumulations were brought together by
human agency, and are of comparatively modern date.

                A8. Map of the Eslcer Systems of Ireland.
                By Professor W. J. Sollas, D.Sc, F.R.S.

[Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey."]

Nowhere probably can the study of Karnes or Eskers be more profitably under-

taken than on the Central Plain of Ireland, over which they are strewn in count-

less numbers. Hitherto they have been investigated rather individually than

collectively, though, thanks to the careful mapping of the officers of the Geological

Survey, the material for establishing their connection as members of great groups

or systems lies ready to hand.

Much, however, is to be learnt from the individual Esker. The current bedding

of the masses of well-rounded pebbles and sand of which it is composed is such as

to point to rapid accumulation in running water, while the numerous instances of

irregular disturbance and ' caving in ' can be most feasibly explained by the melt-

ing of enclosed masses of ice. One of the most striking peculiarities of form is the

steepness of the sides, which frequently approaches the angle of repose of the con-

stituent material, and forces upon one the idea of the existence during deposition

of a sustaining wall, by which the running water was prevented from distributing

its load far and wide over the surrounding plains. Such a wall might conceivably

have been furnished by a previous lateral extension of the Esker itself, since removed

Aby river action, but such a supposition is unsupported by evidence.  more

probable suggestion is that the support was furnished by ice, and that the Esker

may represent a ' cast,' as it were, of a glacier tunnel in gravel and sand. On this

hypothesis all the known characters of Eskers find an explanation, and many inci-

dental details, such as the long lakelet or shallow streams by which they are not

unfrequently flanked.

All explanations of Eskers depending on marine action may be summarily dis-

missed, for not only do they fail to afford a single parallel instance to the point,

but they are directly negatived by the universal absence of marine shells; of the

thousands of existing Irish Eskers, not one has aflbrded a fragment of a contempo-

raneous marine fossil, in spite of most persistent and careful search. Either, then,

we must admit, on the hypothesis of an Esker sea, that marine shells were absent

from its floor over the whole breadth of Ireland, and through a bathymetrical

range of 300 feet, or that having once existed they have since entirely disappeared.

One alternative is not more improbable than the other, as is shown by the frequent

occurrence of fragmentary marine shells in the sands and gravels of the Middle

Glacial Drift, as on Ballyedmonduff" and elsewhere at elevations of over 1,000 feet.
     The fluviatile origin of Eskers, so ably advocated by the American geologists,

Chamberlin, Lewis, and Wright, finds its strongest support in their relations to

one another as parts of a system. In the map exhibited Eskers may be traced

pursuing their winding, serpentine path for miles together, but at the same time

with a convergence which ends frequently in their joining one by one together, like

the tributaries of a river, to form a main stream. As with tributary rivers so

here, the apices of the angles at the places of junction point in one general direc-

tion, that of the general convergence. From individual ridges also small spurs are

frequently given off, usually including an acute angle, which points in the same

direction as those made by the main bi'anches. When, as sometimes happens, the

direction is reversed, signs are not wanting that this is the result of a ' loop,' such

as is so common in the course of imdulating streams, and of which the Shannon, as
it winds among the Eskers, affords instructive examples for comparison.

Accepting the fluviatile origin of Eskers, one may deduce from their present

distribution that of the ancient drainage systems of the Irish glaciers. From the
map two systems are clearly discernible, a smaller, corresponding to the glacier of

.Sligo and Roscommon, and the other vastly larger, embracing the whole Central

Plain, with a general flow from west to east and a discharge probably by the basin

of the Liffey.

                           9. On some Shelly Clay and Gravel in North-east Aberdeenshire.
                                                    By DuGALD Bell, F.G.S.

This paper referred chiefly to a remarkable deposit of red clay, containing frag-

ments of marine shells, which Mr. Jamieson, of Ellon, had described some years

ago as occurring on the eastern border of Aberdeenshire, from sea-level up to about

300 feet.^ This clay seems to be derived, not from the rocks of the district,

but from rocks farther south, viz., in the Old Red Sandstone of Kincardine and

Forfarshire. In short, land-ice from the southward appears to have come along

the coast, bringing vs^ith it this red clay and other debris from the Old Red forma-

tion                       and this conclusion is confirmed by the strife on                                                                                                                                                                         the  projecting  points  along
                        ;

the coast.

The cause of this remarkable movement of the ice was, of course, the ice-

blocked condition of the North Sea, as suggested by the late Dr. Croll in connec-

tion -with Messrs. Peach and Home's admirable paper on the boulder clay of

Caithness.

But the difficulty with regard to this ' fine red mud ' is that it seems to imply

' deep or at least quiet veater ' for its deposition. There is no evidence at tlie

bottom of it of littoral moUusca, or of beach- sand and gravel between it and the

underlying grey boulder clay of the district, so that 'it looks as if still water of

some depth had at once taken the place of the glacier.'

This Mr. Jamieson accounts ibr by supposing that ' the ice did not break up till

a considerable amount of submergence had occurred,' that deep-sea water at once

took the place of the glacier, and received from it the red mud with fragments of

shells taken up by it from some part of the sea-bed over which it had passed ; and
that these settled down immediately on the surface of the grey boulder clay ; and

this process he imagines to have begun at the extremity of the northward-

moving glacier, in the neighbourhood of Peterhead, and to have crept southward

along the coast as the ice gi'adually broke up.

     To this there appear several weighty objections; but the one to be specially

--urged at present is this : It was the ice-blocked condition of the North Sea that

compelled the ice from the Old Red district to move northward along the coast
from Stonehaven to Peterhead. As soon as this gave way the ice would un-
doubtedly pass on eastward out to sea. Where would it most likely give way

-- -- --first^ if not to the south ? So that before probably long before it was open sea

at Peterhead, it would be more free and open at Stonehaven. What, then, could
make the ice go northward, hugging the coast to Peterhead? The dominating

factor in the case was the ice-blocked condition of the North Sea. While this

continued, there could not be the deep still water there to receive the clay ; when

this ceased, there could not be the northward-movLng glacier to bring the clay.

    There seems to be but one way out of this dilemma. If deep and compara-

tively still water be required for the deposition of the clay, is it necessary to have

recourse to a ' great submergence ' in order to obtain it ? Must it be sea-water f

May it not have been accumulations of fresh-water caused by the ice passing across

the transverse valleys and hollows, and so forming lakes along its margin wherein

such sediments would accumulate ? Mr. Jamieson has in the kindest and most

candid way expressed his acceptance of this modification of his theory.

This is exactly parallel to what has lately been made out by Mr. Lamplugh in

the neighbourhood of Flamborough Head -                                                                                                                                                                                                 and  it  is  confirmed  by the sagacious
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

inference of the late Dr. Fleming, who, some fifty years ago, without knowing how

such lakes could be formed, surmised that the clay had been deposited 'in some
immense lake into which the sea only made a temporary irruption.' The author

concluded by suggesting that this explanation might yet be found applicable to

other localities, which had recently been the subject of investigation.

  10. On the pre-Glacial Form of the Ground in Lancashire and Cheshire.
               By C. E. De Range, F.G.S.,of H.M. Geol. Siavey.

     The author arrived at the following conclusions :
     1. The carving out of rock valleys has been mainly due to fluviatile action,
operating before the Glacial period, when the land stood at least 300 feet higher

above the sea-level than it does at present.
     2. The valleys which lie below sea-level are entirely choked up by glacial

drift, and absolutely concealed, and but for extensive boring operations their
presence would never have been suspected.

     3. The materials and irregular alternation of sequence of glacial material in
the infra-sea-level valleys are identical with the character of the deposits above the

sea-level.

     4. There is now ample proof that these ' choked-up ' valleys extend a con-

siderable distance under the Irish Sea.
     6. The glacial deposits extend up to 1,260 feet on the slopes of the Cumberland,

Lancashire, Cheshire, and Carnarvonshire hills, margined by erratic blocks of large
size that extend further and rise higher than the drift, and form a ' fringe ' deposit,
such as has been described in the United States, marking the limit of the margin
of the ice-sheet, the highest boulder in Cheshire occurring at 1,364 feet.

     6. The glacial deposits consist of (a) tough dark till with local fragments in
the neighbourhood of shales, especially of Coal-measure age {b) clay with local

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

angular fragments of sandstone and a few erratic pebbles (c) boulder clay, a red
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

or reddish-brown clay passing into marl, which when washed contains rounded and
glaciated grains of sand, of erratic origin, which are microscopic specimens of like
shape and like origin to the boulders that occur in the clay, and which range in
size up to 12 feet (d) sands and gravels : these contain fragments of marine shells,

                                                                       ;

up to 1,260 feet : these fragments are water-worn, often striated, and are themselves
erratics. The author has never found two valves of a bivalve united ; the species are
representative of different * depth zones,' and univalves contain sand or silt of a dif-
ferent character from the sand by which they are surrounded. The sands also contain
fragments of all sizes of boulder clay, often angular and ragged, as if torn off ; the
sands are generally current-bedded, but often show distinct signs of ' fluxion struc-
ture,' and have been apparently formed partly in freshwater lakes and partly xinder

land-ice.

     7. Deep borings and sinkings invariably give a series of these clays and sands,
often repeated eight or ten times over ; consequently it is obvious that, though a

bed of sand in one area may divide a bed of clay into an ' upper ' and a ' lower

boulder clay,' it is not only not certain that such upper boulder clay is on the same

horizon as the local upper boulder clay in an adjacent area, but it is exceedingly
improbable that it shoidd be so.

     8. The average thickness of the alternations of boulder clay and sands is
such that, as a rule, the deepest Lancashire and Cheshire drift valleys of 80 to 150
feet disclose sections of the first three members of the series, and fully justify
Professor Hull's classification of an upper and lower boulder clay, divided by a

middle sand and gravel, often called the 'middle drift.' Had the beds been

thinner, the true succession would have at once been recognised as far more
numerous than the three-fold sequence observed by Professor Hull.

     9. The interior composition of a glacial drift mound, or of a drift plateau
between two valleys, is nearly always delusive as regards the surface indications.

A constant arrangement of the surface deposit in a drift mound is a base of boulder

clay, a strip of sand, a wide slope of boiilder clay, and a crest or ridge of sands
and gravels. As a rule it is at once obvious that the clay on the upper slope i.s
overlying the sand and gravel of the ridge, but as a ride it is far less obvious that
the clay at the foot of the slope is really not underlying, as at first sight seems
apparent, but overlying the upper boulder clay, and is ' plastered ' over the sands

--and gravels of the mounds, which resemble in section the coats of an onion beds

of variable thickness of boulder clay surrounding and washing an internal core of
fiand and gravel.
                                      --

780 iiEPOET-- 1893.

      10. In upland valleys filled with ordinary boulder clay the surface of the clay
is often obscurely terraced with descending gradients, corresponding to the floor of
the bottom of the rock valley, and is apparently due to gigantic flood-waters, which
at lower levels deposited glacio-fluviatile gravels, 100 feet above the level of existing
streams.

     11. The irregular original deposition of drift mounds upon a plain (also formed
of drift) encloses what the late Mr. Mackintosh, F.G.S., called ' mere-basins,' and
the American * kettle-holes ' : they are areas in which the natural drainage is ob-
structed, and formerly only flowed away by percolation through sand-banks at the
sides. They were originally probably all tilled with more or less water. Many of
these meres still remain in Lancashire and Cheshire, and vary in size from a few
yards to more than a mile across. They are now all more or less artificially
drained. The sites of a very large number are indicated by thick peat mosses.
These constantly are found resting directly on sand, showing that the outfall of the
water in the sands, at the time of the growth of the peat, was closed.

     12. The more closely the surface of the drift-covered ground in relation to its
origin is studied, the more recent does the termination of the glacial episode

appear to be.

       1. On the Distribution of Granite Bo'iilders in the Clyde Valley.
                                 By DuGALD Bell, F.G.S.

The object of this paper was to connect the granite boulders which are found

in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, Helensburgh, Gonrock, &c., with a granitic

tract recently described by Messrs. Teall and Dakyns, of the Geological Survey, as

occurring in the mountainous region which lies between the head of Loch Fyne on

the one hand and of Loch Lomond on the other (' Quar. Jour. Geol. Soc.,' May,

1892). This tract, which occupies about twelve square miles, contains at least two

varieties of granite : a porphyritic variety, with large crystals of orthoclase, easily

recog^sable, and a non-porphyritic variety                                                                                                                                                                                                     also, near its margin or junction with

the mica schist, bands of tonalite and diorite. These varieties correspond with

boulders found in the Clyde valley, especially ia its western part, and along the

shores of the various lochs that open out from it. The supposition put forth many

years ago by Mr. Smith, of Jordanhill,' that these boulders had been transported

from the Ben Cruachan district, was not borne out by the characteristics of the

rocks, and was opposed to all that was now known regarding the general glacia-

tion of the district. In harmony with that glaciation, however, boulders from the

Glen Fyne tract referred to, dispersed by Loch Fyne, Loch Eck, and the Holy

Loch;  by Loch Sloy, Loch Long, and the Gareloch                                                                                                                                                                                                               and  in  a  much  smaller  pro-

watershed of that loch), could, it was evident, reach the various localities where

they are now found. The author showed specimens of the granite referred to.

 2. On the Derbyshire Toadstone. By H. Arnold-Bemrose, M.A., F.G.S.

    Toadetone is a local name for the igneous rocks interbedded with the Carboni-
ferous limestones of Derbyshire. It occurs in a district of 25 by 20 miles. The
upper and lower portions of a bed are sometimes amygdaloidal. The spheroidal
structure is often well marked, the columnar more seldom and less perfectly.
Toadstone varies very much in the amount of weathering it has undergone. It

often decomposes to a sort of clay containing nodules of less altered rock, so that
it has been supposed that toadstone in some localities * replaces ' a bed of clay in

others. For this reason, and also because of the loose way in which the word is
used by miners, statements as to the number of beds of toadstone and of the

presence or absence of ore in it must be accepted with reserve. Careful mapping-

over the whole district will be necessary to ascertain the actual number of beds.

Two at least may be seen exposed in several places, and there may be three or even

four beds. The Black Hillock shaft has been supposed to be one of the vents
through which the toadstone came up to the surface, because the bottom of the
rock was not reached. Farey, however, maintains that this bed was sunk through,
and a careful examination of the mine heap and shaft shows that the dolerite is

Annot coarse-grained, and that there is no trace of agglomerate or of tuff.

occurrence of lead ore in the toadstone of the Wakebridge mine was next de-
scribed. The rock in which the ore occurred when examined under the microscope
proved to be a decomposed olivine-dolerite. The ore was as good in the toadstone
as in the limestone. That the toadstone is contemporaneous with the limestone i»
proved by it being interbedded with the latter, by the occurrence of stratified tuffs
in various parts of the district, and by the non-alteration of the beds immediately
above the igneous rock, though in one or two places a clay bed below it has been
caused to assume a columnar structure.

     Very many specimens have been collected from all the outcrops of toadstone,
which are some fifty in number, and many of them have been examined under the
microscope. The lavas consist mainly of olivine-dolerite, the augite being both
in ophitic plates and in irregularly shaped grains. The rock is much more fresh
and less amygdaloidal than has been generally supposed. The tuffs are in some
cases well preserved, and the outlines of the lapilli very clearly defined. The

author hopes shortly to finish the examination of these rocks, and to offer the

details to the Geological Society.

                                                                    By W. W. Watts, M.A., F.G.S.

[Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

The author exhibited specimens of that variety of the Sandy Braes Rhyolite

Afrom County Antrim which was formerly called Perlite.                                                    microscopical exami-

nation of the rock shows crystals of sanidine and grains of quartz embedded in a

brown glass. The latter shows perlitic structure in great perfection. In addition,

however, the grains of quartz exhibit a series of cracks, which are distinctly per-

litic in character. Thus a structure which was supposed to be confined to glasses

that have cooled rather rapidly is shown to occur rarely, but occasionally, in crys-

tals. Hitherto only one case has been observed in which the cracks entered from

the crystals to the matrix ; the perlitic cracks in the two constituents for the most

part are independent.

 4. On the Minute Structure of the Skeleton of ' Monograptus Priodon.*

                  By Professor W. J. Sollas, B.Sc, F.B.S.

[Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

Remains of Monograptus priodon in an exceptionally perfect state of preserva-

tion occur in the Silurian limestone of Barnham Hill, Co. Tipperary, and are ex-

hibited in the official collection of the Geological Survey in Dublin. These have

been examined in thin slices under the microscope, and as a preliminary result the

author describes the structure of the wall.

Most of the sections are transverse and display the ccenosarcal canal and one

carbonaceous material in a more or less fragmentary condition, but sufficiently
continuous to enable the existence of three layers to be determined : an outer

and inner, which are very thin, separated by a space, now filled with calcite, from
a thicker middle layer, which measures from 0-005 to 001 mm. across. The

middle layer sometimes breaks up into threads, and the superficial films have a
reticular appearance, which may, however, be due to post-mortem changes. In
the region of the virgula and also along the free edges of the thec£e the wall
thickens, partly by an enlargement of the space between the layers, and partly by
a thickening of the middle layer. Thus, in one example the torn thickness of the
wall in the virgular region is 0075 mm., and of the virgula itself, which represents

the middle layer, 0'037 mm. ; similarly at the margin of the theca the total thick-
ness was found to be 0'085 mm., the included middle layer measuring 0'045 mm.

Thin threads of carbonaceous material extend from the middle to the superficial
layers, and are particularly obvious in the thickened regions. The virgula would
appear to possess no independent existence ; it seems to be merely a thickening of
the middle layer.

     The following Reports and Papers were read :^

 --1. Report on the Zoology of the Sandwich Islands. See Reports, p. 523.

      2. On the Zoology of the Sandwich Islands. By D. Sharp, F.B.S.

     The islands were formerly supposed to be rich in plant and comparatively poor
in animal life. But the progress of knowledge is modifying this latter view. In
1880 Wallace in ' Island Life ' furnished the following statistics as to this archi-

--pelago viz. : birds, 43 species, 24 of them peculiar to the islands ; land and fresh-

water mollusca, 300 or 400 species, all peculiar ; insects, scarcely anything known

plants, 689 species, 377 peculiar.
      After one year's investigation by the committees of the British Association and

of the Royal Society, and incorporating the recent results of the work of private
naturalists, the figures are : birds, 78 species, 57 of them peculiar ; land and fresh-
water mollusca, 475 species, all peculiar ; insects, 1,000 species, 700 of then* peculiar ;
plants (according to Hillebrand), 999 species, 653 peculiar (many of those not
peculiar being introduced by man).

     But the investigations of the committees show that these results are very in-
complete, at any rate in the case of the insects, which cannot be estimated at less
than 3,000 species, 2,500 or 2,600 of the number being peculiar.

     These numbers in the case of the fauna are less than those of approximately
similar areas in less insular parts. Devonshire has 84 resident species of birds and
30 summer migrants. The insects amount to about 6,000 species, and the land and
fresh-water mollusca to 97 species, the vascular plants being about the same in
number as those of the Sandwich Islands.

     But there has already been very great extinction in this latter area, much of it

probably even before the discovery and appropriation of the islands by civilised
man.

     The working of the British Association and of the Royal Society committees
seems to oflPer the only chance of investigating the fauna. The native creatures
are extremely difficult to find, and the usual inducements to sportsmen and collectors
are wanting ; while the small population and the absence of great centres of intel-
lectual activity in the islands render it very improbable that the work will be
accomplished by residents in the archipelago, though these might give very valuable

assistance.

6. The following Address, by Rev. H. B. Tkistram, F.R.8., President of the

      Section, loho was not able to attendj the Meeting, was read by Sir W. H.

       Flower, K.C.B., F.B.S.

      Address :

It is difficult for the mind to grasp the advance in biological science (I use the term
biology in its wide etymological, not its recently restricted sense) which has taken
place since I first attended the meetings of the British Association, some fortv
years ago. In those days, the now familiar expressions of ' natural selection,'
' isolation/ ' the struggle for existence,' ' the survival of the fittest,' were unheard of
and unknown, though many an observer was busied in culling the facts which

were being poured into the lap of the philosopher who should mould the first

great epoch in natural science since the days of Linnfeus.
     It is to the importance and value of field observation that I would venture in

the first place to direct your attention.

    My predecessors in this chair have been, of recent years, distinguished men who

have searched deeply into the abstrusest mysteries of physiology. Thither I do
not presume to follow them. I rather come before you as a survivor of the old-
world naturalist, as one whose researches have been, not in the laboratory or
with the microscope, but on the wide desert, the mountain side, and the isles of
the sea.

    This year is the centenary of the death of Gilbert White, whom we may look

upon as the father of field naturalists. It is true that Sir T. Browne, WiUughbv,
and Ray had each, in the middle of the seventeenth century, committed various ob-
servations to print ; but though Willughby, at least, recognised the Importance of
the soft parts as well as the osteology, in affording a key to classification, as may

be seen from his observation of the peculiar formation, in the Divers (Colymhidce)
of the tibia, with its prolonged procnemial process, of which he has given a figure,
or his description of the elongation of the posterior branches of the woodpecker's
tongue, as well as by his careful description of the intestines of all specimens which
came under his notice in the flesh, none of these systematically noted the habits
of birds, apart from an occasional mention of their nidification, and very rarely do

they even describe the eggs. But White was the first observer to recognise how
much may be learnt from the life habits of birds. He is generally content with
recording his observations, leaving to others to speculate. Fond of Virgilian
quotations (he was a fellow of Oriel of the last century), his quotations are
often made with a view to prove the scrupulous accuracy of the Roman poet, as
tested by his (White's) own observations.

     In an age, incredulous as to that which appears to break the uniformity of
nature, but quick to recognise all the phenomena of life, a contrast arises before the
mind's eve between the abiding strength of the objective method, which brings
Gilbert White in touch with the great writers whose works are for all time, and
the transient feebleness of the modern introspective philosophies, vexed with the

problems of psychology. The modern psychologist propounds his theory of man

   and tlie universe, and we read him, and go on our way, and straightway forget.

   Herodotus and Thucydides tell a plain tale in plain language, or the Curate of

   Selborne shows us the hawk on the wing, or the snake in the grass, as he saw them
   day by day, and, somehow, the simple story lives and moves him who reads it

   long after the subtleties of this or that philosophical theory have had their day and

   passed into the limbo of oblivion. But, invaluable as has been the example of

   Gilbert "White in teaching us how to observe, his field was a very narrow one,

   circumscribed for the most part by the boundaries of a single parish, and on the

   subject of geographical distribution (as we know it now) he could contribute

   nothing, a subject on which even the best explorers of that day were strangely

   Ainobservant and inexact.  century and a half ago, it had not come to be recog-

   nised that distribution is (along, of course, with morphology and physiology), a

   most important factor in determining the facts of biology. It is difficult to esti-

   mate what might have been gained in the case of many species, now irreparably

   lost, had Forster and the other companions of Captain Cook, to say nothing of

   many previous voyagers, had the slightest conception of the importance of noting

   the exact locality of each specimen they collected. They seem scarcely to have

   recognised the specific distinctions of the characteristic genera of the Pacific

   Islands at all, or, if they did, to have dismissed them with the remark, ' On this

   Newisland was found a flycatcher, a pigeon, or a parrot similar to those found in

   Holland, but with white tail-feathers instead of black, an orange instead of a

   scarlet breast, or red shoulders instead of yellow.' As we turn over the pages of
   Latham or Shaw, how often do we find for locality ' one of the islands of the South

   Sea,' and, even where the locality is given, subsequent research has proved it

   erroneous, as though the specimens had been subsequently ticketed ; as Le Vaillant
   described many of his South African birds from memory. Thus Latham, after

   describing very accurately Wiipidiira Jlabellifera, from the south island of New

   Zealand, remarks, apparently on Forster's authority, that it is subject to variation
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

   that in the island of Tanna another was met with, with a diff"erent tail, &c., and

   that there was another variety in the collection of Sir Joseph Banks. Endless per-

   plexity has been caused by the Psittaciis pygmcens of Gmelin (of which Latham's

   type is at Vienna) being stated in the inventory as from Botany Bay, by Latham

   from Otaheite, and in his book as inhabiting several of the islands of the South Seas,

   and now it proves to be the female Psittncus palmarnm from the New Hebrides.

   These are but samples of the confusion caused by the inaccuracies of the old

   voyagers. Had there been in the first crew who landed on the Island of Bourbon,

   I will not say a naturalist, but even a simple-hearted Leguat, to tell the artless tale

   of what he saw, or had there been among the Portuguese discoverers of Mauritius

   one who could note and describe the habits of its birds with the accuracy with

   which a Poulton could record the ways and doings of our Lepidoptera, how vastly

   would our knowledge of a|perished fauna have been enriched ! It is only since we

   learned from Darwin and Wallace the power of isolation in the differentiation of

   species that special attention has been paid to the peculiarities of insular forms.

   Here the field naturalist comes in as the helpful servant of the philosopher and

   the systematist by illustrating the operation of isolation in the difl^ereatiation of

   species. I may take the typical examples of two groups of oceanic islands, differ-

   --ing as widely as possible in their position on the globe the Sandwich Islands in the

   centre of the Pacific, thousands of miles from the nearest continent, and the Canaries,

   --within sight of the African coast but agreeing in this, that both are truly oceanic

   groups, of purely volcanic origin, the ocean depths close to the Canaries, and be-

   tween the different islands, varying from 1,500 to 2,000 fathoms. In the one we
   may study the expiring relics of an avifauna completely differentiated by isolation

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

   in the other we have the opportunity of tracing the incipient stages of the same

   process.

       The Sandwich Islands have long been known as possessing an avifauna not

   surpassed in interesting peculiarity by that of New Zealand or Madagascar ; in

   fact, it seems as though their vast distance from the continent had intensified the

   inffuences of isolation. There is scarcely a passerine bird in its indigenous fauna

   which can be referred to any genus known elsewhere. But, until the very recent

   1893.                                 3E

786 EEPOBT-- 1893.

researches of Mr. Scott Wilson, and the explorations of the Honourable W. Roth-

schild's collectors, it was not known that almost every island of the group possessed

one or more representatives of each of these peculiar genera. Thus, every island
which has been thoroughly explored, and in which any extent of the primeval

forest remains, possesses, or has possessed, its own peculiar species of Hemignathus,

Mimatione, Phceornis, Acrulocercics, Lo.rops, Drepanis, as well as of the massive-

beaked finches, which emulate the Geospiza of the Galapagos. Professor Newton
has shown that while the greater number of these are, probably, of American
origin, yet the South Pacific has contributed its quota to this museum of ornitho-
logical rarities, which Mr. Clarke very justly proposes to make a distinct biological

sub-region.

     That each of the islands of this group, however small, should possess a flora

specifically distinct suggests thoughts of the vast periods occupied in their diSeren-

tiation.

In the Canary Islands, either because they are geologically more recent, or

because of their proximity to the African coast, which has facilitated frequent

immigrations from the continent, the process of differentiation is only partially

accomplished. Yet there is scarcely a resident species which is not more or less

modified, and this modification is yet further advanced in the westernmost islands

than in those nearest to Africa. In Fuertaventura and Lanzarote, waterless and

treeless, there is little change, and the fauna is almost identical with that of the

neighbouring Sahara. There is a whin-chat, Pratincola dacotia, discovered by my

companion, Mr. Meade-Waldo, peculiar to Fuertaventura, which may possibly

be found on the opposite coast, though it has not yet been met with by any collectors
there. Now, our whin-chat is a common winter visitant all down the West African

coast, and it seems probable that isolation has produced the very marked characters

of the Canarian form, while the continental individuals have been restrained from

Avariation by their frequent association with their migratory relations.  similar

cause may explain why the blackbird, an extremely common resident in all the

Canary Islands, has not been modified in the least, since many migratory indi-

viduals of the same species sojourn every winter in the islands. Or take the blue

titmouse. Our familiar resident is replaced along the coast of North Africa by a

representative species, Paiics ultramajinus, differentiated chiefly by a black instead

of a blue cap, and a slate-coloured instead of a green back. The titmouse of Lan-

zarote and Fuertaventura is barely separable from that of Algeria, but is much

smaller and paler, probably owing to scarcity of food and a dry desert climate

Passing, 100 miles further to sea, to Grand Canary, we find in the woods and forests

a bird in all respects similar to the Algerian in colour and dimensions, with one ex-

--ception the greater wing coverts of the Algerian are tipped with white, forming a

broad bar when the wing is closed. This, present in the Fuertaventura form, is re-

presented in the Canarian by the faintest white tips, and in the birds from the next

islands, Tenerife and Gomera, this is altogether absent. This form has been recog-

nised as Parus tenerifce. Proceeding to the north-west outermost island, Palma,

we find a very distinct species, with different proportions, a longer tail, and white

abdomen instead of yellow. In the Ultima Thule, Hierro, we find a second very

distinct species, resembling that of Tenerife in the absence of the wing bar and in

all other respects, except that the back is green like the European, instead of slate

as in all the other species. Thus we find in this group a uniform graduation of
variation as we proceed further from the cradle of the race.

   A similar series of modifications may be traced in the chaSinch {Fringilla),

which has been in like manner derived from the North African F. spodiogena, and
in which the extreme variation is to be found in the westernmost islands of Palma
and Ilierro. The willow wren {Phylloscopus trochilns), extremely numerous and
j-esident, has entirely changed its habits, though not its plumage, and I have felt

justified in distinguishing it as Ph. fortunntm. In note and habits it is entirely
different from our bird, and though it builds a domed nest it is always near the top
of lofty trees, most frequently in palm-trees. The only external difference from
our bird consists in its paler tarsi and more rounded wing, so that its power of
flight is weaker, but, were it not for the marked difference in its habits and voice,

I should have hesitated to difterentiate it. la the kestrel and the great spotted
woodpecker there are differences which suggest incipient species, while the forests
of the wooded western islands yield two very peculiar pigeons, differing entirely
from each other in their habits, both probably derived from our wood-pigeon, but
even further removed from it than the Columha trocaz of Madeira, and, by their dark

--chestnut coloration, suggesting that peculiar food in this case the berries of the tree
--laurel has its full share in the differentiation of isolated forms. If we remember

the variability of the pigments in the food of birds, and the amount absorbed and
transferred to the skin and plumage, the variability in the tints and patterns of

many animals can be more readily understood.

     One other bird deserves notice, the Caccabis, or red-legged partridge, for here,
and here alone, we have chronological data. The Spaniards introduced Caccabis
rufa into Canary, and C. 2)etrosa into Tenerife and Gomera, and they have never
spread from their respective localities. Now, both species, after a residence of only
400 years, have become distinctly modified. C. rufa was introduced into the Azores
also, and changed exactly in the same manner, so much so that Mr. Godman, some
years ago, would have described it as distinct, but that the only specimen he
procured was in moult and mutilated, and his specimen proves identical with the
Cauarian bird. Besides minor differences, the beak is one-fourth stouter and longer
than in the European bird, the tarsus very much stouter and longer, and the
back is grey rather than russet. The grey back harmonises with the volcanic dark

soil of the rocks of the Canaries, as the russet does with the clay of the plains of

England and France. In the Canaries the bird lives under ditferent conditions

from those of Europe. It is on the mountain sides and among rocks that the

stouter beak and stronger legs are indispensable to its vigorous existence. It is

Wecenturies ?
               have the result of peculiar food in the pigeons, and of isolation in

all the cases I have mentioned. Such facts can only be supplied to the generaliser

and the systematist through the accurate and minute observations of the field

naturalist.

     The character of the avifauna of the Comoro Islands, to take another insular
group, seems to stand midway in the differentiating process between the Canaries
and the Sandwich Islands. From the researches of M. Humblot, worked out by

MM. Milne-Edwards and Oustalet, we find that there are twenty-nine species

acknowledged as peculiar ; two species from South Africa and twenty-two from
Madagascar in process of specification, called by M. Milne-Edwards secondary or

derived species.

     The little Christmas Island, an isolated rock 200 miles south of Java, only 12

miles in length, has been shown by Mr. Lister to produce distinct and peculiar

forms of every class of life, vegetable and animal. Though the species are few
in number, yet every mammal and land bird is endemic ; but, as Darwin remarks,

to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent,

has been more favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to
make the comparison between equal times, and this we are incapable of doing.

My own attention was first directed to this subject when, in the year 1857-58,

spent many months in the Algerian Sahara, and noticed the remarkable variations

in different groups, according to elevation from thesea, and the difference of soil and

vegetation.  The  ' Origin of  Species ' had not  then   appeared                                      but on  my return

my attention was called to the communication of Darwin and Wallace to the

ILinnean Society on the tendencies of species to form varieties, and on the perpetua-

tion of varieties and species by means of natural selection. I then wrote : ' ' It is

hardly possible, I should think, to illustrate this theory better than by the larks

and chats of North Africa. In all these, in the congeners of the wheatear, of the

rock chat, of the crested lark, we trace gradual modifications of coloration and

of anatomical structure, deflecting by very gentle gradations from the ordinary

which shall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country, is absolutely-

--necessary. Hence, without exception, the upper plumage of every bird whethea*

lark, chat, sylviad or sand-grouse --and also the fur of all the small mammals, and

the skin of all the snakes and lizards, is of the uniform isahelline or sand-colour. It

is very possible that some further purpose may be served by the prevailing colours,

hut this appears of itself a sufficient explanation. There are individual varieties

of depth of hue among all creatures. In the struggle for life which we know to
be going on among all species, a very slight change for the better, such as im-
proved means of escape from its natural enemies (which would be the effect of an

alteration from a conspicuous colour to one resembling the hue of the surrounding

objects), would give the variety that possessed it a decided advantage over the
tvpical or other forms of the species. ... To apply the theory to the case of the

likely to be of a darker complexion than tlip, others. These, and such of their offspring

enemies, hawks and carnivorous beasts. The lighter-coloured ones would enjoy

more or less immunity from such attacks. Let this state of things continue for a
few hundred years, and the dark-coloured individuals would be exterminated, the

light-coloured remain and inherit the land. This process, aided by the above-

mentioned tendency of the climate to bleach the coloration still more, would in a

few centuries  produce  the  Galerita abyssinica  as the                                                                      typical form                                                             and  it  must

that of colour.

    ' But when we turn to Galerita isabellina, G. arenic.ola, and G. macrorhyncha,

marked in tlie form of the bill. Now, to take the two ibrmer first, G. arenicola has

the deep, loose, sandy tracts, the latter haunts the hard and rocky districts. It is

manifest that a bird whose food has to be sought for in deep sand derives a great

advantage from any elongation, however slight, of its bill. The otlier, who feeds

Weamong stones and rocks, requires strengtli rather than length.                                                                                                                                       know that
--even in the type species the size of the bill varies in individuals in the lark

as well as in the snipe. Now, in the desert, the shorter-billed varieties would

undergo comparative difficulty in finding food where it was not abundant, and con-

sequently would not be in such vigorous condition as their longer-billed relations.

In the breeding season, therefore, they would have fewer eggs and a weaker

progeny. Often, as we know, a weakly bird will abstain from matrimony alto-

gether. The natural result of these causes would be that in course of time the

longest-billed variety would steadily predominate over the shorter, and, in a few

centuries, they would be the sole existing race ; their shorter-billed fellows dying
out until that race was extinct. The converse will still hold good of the stout-

billed and weaker-billed varieties in a rocky district.

' Here are only two causes enumerated which might serve to create, as it were,

a new species from an old one. Yet they are perfectly natural causes, and such
Weas I think must have occurred, and are possibly occurring still.
                                                                                                                                                                                                            know so

very little of the causes which, in the majority of cases, make species rare or

common that there may be hundreds of others at work, some even moi'e powerfnl

than these, which go to perpetuate and eliminate certain forms " according to

natural means of selection."'

     It would appear that those species in continental areas are equally liable to

variation with those which are isolated in limited areas, yet that there are many

counteracting influences which operate to check this tendencj'. It is often assumed,

where we find closely allied species apparently interbreeding at the centre of their
area, that the blending of forms is caused by the two races commingling. Judging

from insular experience I should be inclined to believe that the theory of inter-

breeding is beginning at the wrong end, but rather that while the generalised forms
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  789

remain in the centre of distribution -we find tlie more decidedly distinct species at
tlie extremes of the range, caused not by interbreeding, but by differentiation.
To illustrate this by the group of the blue titmouse. AVe find in Central Russia,
in the centre of distribution of the family, the most generalised form. Partis pleskii,
partaking of the characters of the various species east, west, and south. In the
north-east and north it becomes differentiated as P. cyanevs ; to the south-west
and west into P. Cfcruleiis and its various sub-species, while a branch extending
due east has assumed the form of P. Jlnvipectus, bearing traces of affinity to its
Keiglibour P. cyaneus in the north, which seems evidently to have been derived

from it.
     But the scope of field observation does not cease with geographical distribu-

tion and modification of form. The closet systematist is very apt to overlook or
to take no count of habits, voice, modification, and other features of life which
have an important bearing on the modification of species. To take one instance, the

short-toed lark {Calandrella hrachydacfyla) is spread over the countries border-
ing on the Mediterranean ; but, along with it, in Andalusia alone is found another
species, C. bcvtica, of a rather darker colour, and with the secondaries generally

somewhat shorter. "Without further knowledge than that obtained from a com-
parison of skins, it might be put down as an accidental variety. But the field
naturalist soon recognises it as a most distinct species. It has a different voice, a
differently shaped nest ; and, while the common species breeds in the plains, this
one always resorts to the hills. The Spanish shepherds on the spot recognise their
distinctness, and have a name for each species. Take, again, the eastern form of
the common song-thrush. The bird of North China, Turdiis auritus, closely
resembles our familiar species, but is slightly larger, and there is a minute differ-
ence in the wing formula. But the field naturalist has ascertained that it lays

eggs like those of the missel-thrush, and it is the only species closely allied to our
bird which does not lay eggs of a blue ground colour. The hedge accentor of
Japan (Accentor rubtdus) is distinguished from our most familiar friend. Accentor
modularis, by delicate differences of hue. But, though in gait and manner it
closely resembles it, I was surprised to find the Japanese bird strikingly distinct in
habits and lile, being found only in forest and brushwood several thousand feet

-- --above the sea. I met with it first at Chiusenze 6,000 feet before the snow had

left the ground, and in summer it goes higher still, but never descends to the
cultivated laud. If both species are derived, as seems probable, from Accentor
immaculatus of the Himalayas, then the contrast in habits is easily explained. The

lofty mountain ranges of Japan have enabled th.e settlers there to retain their
original habits, i'or which our humbler elevations have afforded no scope.

     On the solution of the problem of the migration of birds, the most remarkable
of all the phenomena of animal life, much less aid has been contributed by the
observations of field naturalists than might reasonably have been expected. The

facts of migration have, of course, been recognised from the earliest times, and
have afforded a theme for Hebrew and Greek poets 3,000 years ago. Theories
which would explain it are rife enough, but it is only of late years that any
systematic eff'ort has been made to classify and summarise the thousands of data
and notes which are needed in order to draw any satisfactory conclusion. The

observable facts may be classified as to their bearing on the Whither, When, and

How of migration, and after this we may possibly arrive at a true answer to the

"Why ? Observation has sufficiently answered the first question, Whither ?
     There are scarcely any feathered denizens of earth or sea to the summer and

winter ranges of which we cannot now point. Of almost all the birds of the holo-

Nowarctic fauna, we have ascertained the breeding-places and the winter resorts.

Land, there remains but the curlew sandpiper (Tringa S2tbarqt(atci), of all the

known European birds, whose breeding ground is a virgin soil, to be trodden, let

us hope, in a successful exploration by Nanaen, on one side or other of the North
Pole. EquaUy clearly ascertained are the winter quarters of all the migrants.
The most casual observer cannot fail to notice in any part of Africa, north or
eouth, west coast or interior, the myriads of familiar species which winter there.
--790 KEPOET 1893.

As to the time of migratiou, the earliest notes of field naturalists have been the

Werecords of the dates of arrival of the feathered visitors.                              possess them for

some localities, as for Norfolk by the Marsham family, so far back as 1736. In

recent years these observations have been carried out on a larger and more

systematic scale by 3Iiddendorff, who, forty years ago, devoted himself to the

study of the lines of migration in the Russian Empire, tracing what he called the

isopipteses, the lines of simidtaneous arrival of particular species ; and by Professor

Palmc^n, of Finland, who, twenty years later, pursued a similar course of investiga-

tion                       by  Professor  Baird  on  the  migration  of  North  American  birds ;  and  sub-
                        ;

sequently by Severtzofl' as regards Central Asia, and Meuzbier as regards Eastern

Europe. As respects our own coasts, a vast mass of statistics has been collected

by the labours of the Migration Committee appointed by the British Association

in 1880, for which our thanks are due to the indefatigable zeal of Mr. John

Cordeaux, and his colleague Mr. John Harvie Brown, the originators of the scheme

by which the lighthouses were for nine years used as posts of observation on
migration. The reports of that Committee are familiar to us, but the inferences

are not yet worked out. I cannot but regret that the Committee has been allowed

to drop. Professor W. W. Cooke has been carrying on similar observations in the

Mississippi valley, and others, too numerous to mention, have done the same else-

where. But, as Professor Newton has truly said, All these etibrts may be said to

pale before the stupendous amount of information amassed during more than tifty

years by the venerable Herr Giitke of Heligoland, whose work we earnestly
desire may soon appear in an English version.

   We have, through the labours of the writers I have named, and many others,

arrived at a fair knowledge of the When ? of migi-ation. Of the How P "we have

ascertained a little, but very little. The lines of migration vary widely in different

species, and in ditlerent longitudes. The theory of migration being directed

towards the magnetic pole, first started by Middendorfl", seems to be refuted by

Baird, who has shown that in North America the theory will not hold. Yet, in

some instances, there is evidently a converging tendency in northward migrations.

The fine, according to Middendorff, in Middle Siberia is due north, in Eastern

Siberia S.E. to N.W., and in Western Siberia from S.W. to N.E. In European

ARussia Menzbier traces four northward routes: (1) coast line coming up from

Norway round the North Cape to Nova Zembla. {2) The Baltic line with bifur-

cation, one proceeding by the Gulf of Bothnia, and the other by the Gulf of Finland,

Awhich is afterwards again subdivided. (3)                               Black Sea line, reaching nearly

as far north as the valley of the Petchora. (4) The Caspian line, passing up the
Volga and reaching as far east as the valley of the Obi by other anastomosing

streams.

Palm^n has endeavoured to trace the lines of migration on the return autumnal

journey in the eastern hemisphere, and has arranged them in nine routes:
(1) From Nova Zembla, round the west of Norway, to the British Isles. (2) From

Spitzbergen, by Norway, to Britain, France, Portugal, and West Africa.
(3) From North Russia, by the Gulf of Finland, Holstein, and Holland, and then

bifurcating to the west coast of France on the one side, and on the other up

the Rhine to Italy and North Africa. (4 a) Down the Volga by the Sea of Azof,

Asia Minor, and Egypt, while the other portion (4 b), trending east, passes by

the Caspian and Tigris to the Persian Gulf. (5) By the Yenesei to Lake Baika"li
and Slongolia. (6) By the Lena on to the Amoor and Japan. (7) From East

Siberia to the Corea and Japan. (8) Kamschatka to Japan and the Chinese
coast. (9) From Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroes to Britain, where it ioin&

line 2.

All courses of rivers of importance form minor routes, and consideration of

these lines of migration might serve to explain the fact of North American

stragglers, the waifs and strays which have fallen in with great flights of the

regular migrants having been more frequently shot on the east coast of England
and Scotland than on the west coast or in Ireland. They have not crossed the

Atlantic, but have come from the far north, where a very slight deflection east

or west might alter their whole course, and in that case they, would.naturally
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  791

strike either Iceland or the west coast of Norway, and in either case would
reach the east coast of Britain. But if, by storms and the prevailing winds of
the North Atlantic comino- from the west, they had heen driven out of their

usual course, they would strike the coast of Norway, and so find their way hither
in the company of their congeners.

     As to the elevation at which migratory flights are carried on, Herr Gatke, as
well as many American observers, holds that it is generally far above our ken, at

least in normal conditions of the atmosphere, and that the opportunities of observa-
tion, apart from seasons and unusual atmospheric disturbance, are confined chiefly
to unsuccessful and abortive attempts. It is maintained that the height of flight
is some 1,500 to 15,000 feet, and if this be so, as there seems every reason to
admit, the aid of land bridges and river valleys becomes of very shght importance.

A trivial instance will illustrate this. There are two species of blue-throat,

 Ci/anecula suecica and C. leucocyana : the former with its red-breast patch is abun-
dant in Sweden in summer, but is never found in Germany, except most acciden-

tally, and the other is the common form of Central Europe. Yet both are abundant
in Egypt and Syria, where they winter, and I have, on several occasions, obtained
both species out of the same flock. Hence we infer that the Swedish bird makes

its journey from its winter quarters with scarcely a halt, while the other proceeds

leisurely to its nearer summer quarters. On the other hand, I have more than

once seen myriads of swallows, martins, sand-martins, and, later in the season,

swifts passing up the Jordan Valley and along the Bukaa of Central Syria at so
slight an elevation that I was able to distinguish at once whether the flight consisted
of swallows or of house-martins. This was in perfectly calm clear weather. One

stream of swallows, certainly not less than a quarter of a mile wide, occupied
more than half an hour in passing over one spot, and flights of house-martins,
and then of sand-martins, the next day were scarcely less numerous. These

flights must have been straight up from the Eed Sea, and may have been the

general assembly of all those which had wintered in East Africa. I cannot think

that these flights were more than 1,000 feet high. On the other hand, when

standing on the highest peak in the Island of Palma, 6,500 feet, with a dense mass
of clouds beneath us, leaving nothing of land or sea visible, save the distant Peak
of Tenerife, 13,000 feet, I have watched a flock of Cornish choughs soaring above
us, till at length they were absolutely undistinguishable by us except with field-

glasses.

     As to the speed with which the migration flights are accomplished, they
require much further observation. Herr Gatke maintains that godwits and
plovers can fly at the rate of 240 miles an hour (!), and the late Dr. Jerdon stated
that the spine-tailed swift (^Acanthylis caudacutus), roosting in Ceylon, would

reach the Himalayas (1,200 miles) before sunset. Certainly in their ordinary

flight the swift is the only bii'd I have ever noticed to outstrip an express train on
the Great Northern Railway.

     Observation has shown us that, while there is a regular and uniform migration
In the case of some species, yet that, beyond these, there comes a partial migration
of some species, immigrants and emigrants simultaneously, and this, besides the

familiar vertical emigration from higher to lower altitudes and vice versa, as in the

familiar instances of the lapwing and golden plover. There is still much scope for

the field naturalist in observation of these partial migrations. There are also
species in which some individuals migrate and some are sedentary. E.{/., in the few
primeval forests which still remain in the Canary Islands, and which are en-
shrouded in almost perpetual mist, the woodcock is sedentary, and not uncommon.
I have often put up the bird and seen the eggs ; but in winter the number is
vastly increased, and the visitors are easily to be distinguished from the residents
by their lighter colour and larger size. The resident never leaves the cover of
the dense forest, where the growth of ferns and shrubs is perpetual, and fosters a
moist, rich, semi-peaty soil, in which the woodcock finds abundant food all the
year, and has thus lost its migratory instincts.

    But why do birds migrate ? Observation has brought to light many facts

which seem to increase the difficulties of a satisfactory answer to the question.. The

autuuiDal retreat from the 'breeding quarters might be explained by a want of

sufficient sustenance as winter approaches in the higher latitudes, but this will not

account for the return migration in spring, since there is no perceptible diminution
Aof supplies in the winter quarters.
                                      friend of mine, who was for some time

stationed as a missionary at Kikombo, on the high plateau south-east of Victoria '

Nyanza Lake, almost under the equator, where there is no variation in the

seasons, wrote to me that from November to March the country swarmed with

swallows and martins, which seemed to the casual observer to consist almost

wholly of our three species, though occasionally a few birds of different type

might be noticed in the larger flocks. Towards the end of March, without any

observable change in climatic or atmospheric conditions, nine-tenths of the
birds suddenly disappeared, and only a sprinkling remained. These, which had
previously been lost amid the myriad of winter visitants, seemed to consist of four

species, of which T received specimens of two, Hirundo puella and H. senegalensis.

One, described as white underneath, is probably !/. cethiojnca; and the fourth, very
small, and qiiite black, must be a PsalichjJrocne. All these remained through
spring and summer. The northward movement of all the others must be

through some impulse not yet ascertained. In many other instances observa-
tion has shown that the impulse of movement is not dependent on the weather
at the moment. This is especially the case with sea birds. Professor Newton

observes thev can b3 trusted as the almanack itself. Foul weather or fair, heat

or cold, the f)utfins, Fratercula arctica, repair to some of their stations punctually
on a given day, as if their movements were regulated by clockwork. In like
manner, whether the summer be cold or hot, the swifts leave their summer

home in England about the first week in August, only occasional stragglers

ever being seen after that date. So in three different years in Syria I noticed the

appearance of the common swift {Cypselus ajim) in myriads on one day in the

first week in April. In the case of almost all the land birds, it has been ascer-
tained by repeated observations that the male birds arrive some days before the

hens. 1 do not think it is proved that they start earlier; but, being generally

stronger than the females, it is very natural that they should outstrip their
weaker mates. I think, too, that there is evidence that those species which

have the most extended southerly have also the most e.xtended northerlj^ range.

The same may hold good of individuals of the same species, and may be accounted

for by, or account for, the fact that, e.g., the individuals of the wheatear or of
the willow wren which penetrate furthest north have longer and stronger wings
than those individuals which terminate their journey in more southern latitudes.

The length of wing of two specimens of Sa.ricola ananthe in my collection from

Greenland and Labrador exceeds by -6 inch the length of British and Syrian
specimens, and the next longest, exceeding them by '5 inch, is from the Gambia.

So the sedentary Phjlloscopus trochilus of the Canaries has a perceptibly shorter

wing than European specimens.
     To say that migration is performed by instinct is no explanation of the mar-

vellous faculty, it is an evasion of the difficulty. Professor Mobius holds that

birds crossing the ocean may be guided by observing the rolling of the waves, but

this will not hold good in the varying storms of the Atlantic, still less in the vast

stretch of stormy and landless ocean crossed by the bronze cuckoo ( Chrysococcyx

lucidus) in its passage from New Guinea to New Zealand. Professor Palra^n ascribes

the due performance of the flight to experience, but this is not confirmed by field

observers. He assumes that the flights are led by the oldest and strongest, but

observation by Herr Giitke has shown that among migrants, as the young and old

journey apart and by different routes, the former can have had no experience. All

ornithologists are aware that the parent cuckoos leave this country long before
their young ones are hatched by their foster-parents. The sense of sight cannot

guide birds which travel by night, or span oceans or continents in a single flight.

In noticing all the phenomena of migration, there yet remains a vast untilled

region for the field naturalist.

    What Professor Newton terms ' the sense of direction, unconsciously exercised,'
is the nearest approach jet made to a solution of the problem. He remarks
                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                 793

how vastly the sense of direction varies in human beings, contrasting its absence

in the dwellers in towns compared with the power of the shepherd and the

countryman, and, infinitely more, with the power of the savage or the Arab, fie

adduces the experience of Middendorff among the Samojeds, who know how to
reach their goal by the shortest way through places wholly strange to them. He

had known it among dogs and horses (as we may constantly perceive), but was

surprised to find the same incomprehensible animal faculty unweakened among

uncivilised men. Nor could the Samojeds understand his inquiry how they did

it. They disarmed him by the question, How now does the arctic fox find its way

aright on the Tundra, and never go astray ? and Middendorff adds : ' I was thrown

back on the unconscious performance of an inherited animal faculty;' and so are we !
    There is one more kind of migration, on which we know nothing, and where

the field naturalist has still abundant scope for the exercise of observation. I

mean what is called exceptional migration, not the mere wanderings of waifs

and strays, nor yet the uncertain travels of some species, as the crossbill in search

of food, but the colonising parties of many gregarious species, which generally,

so far as we know in our own hemisphere, travel from east to west, or from

south-east to north-west. Such are the waxwing (A^npelis garrula), the pastor

starling {Pastor roseus) and Pallas's sandgrouse, after intervals sometimes of

many years, or sometimes for two or three years in succession. The waxwing

will overspread Western Europe in winter for a short time. It appears to be

equally inconstant in its choice of summer quarters, as was shown by J. Wolley in

Lapland. The rose pastor regularly winters in India, but never remains to breed.

For this purpose the whole race seems to collect and travel north-west, but

rarely, or after intervals of many years, returns to the same quarters. Verona,

Broussa, Smyrna, Odessa, the Dobrudscha, have all during the last half-century been

visited for one summer by tens of thousands, who are attracted by the visitations

of locusts, on which they feed, rear their young, and go. These irruptions, how-

ever, cannot be classed under the laws of ordinary migration. Not less inexpli-

cable are such migrations as those of the African darter, which, though never yet

observed to the north of the African lakes, contrives to pass, every spring, unob-

served to the lake of Antioch in North Syria, where I found a large colony rearing

their young                                                          and which, so soon  as  their progeny was  able to fly, disappeared to
                                                                  ;

the south-east as suddenly as they had arrived.

There is one possible explanation of the sense of direction unconsciously exer-

Wecised, which I submit as a working hypothesis.                                             are all aware of the instinct,

stroug both in mammals and birds without exception, which attracts them to the

place of their nativity. When the increasing cold of the northern regions, in

which they all had their origin, drove the mammals southward, they could not

retrace their steps, because the increasing polar sea, as the arctic continent sank,

barred their way. The birds reluctantly left their homes as winter came on, and

followed the supply of food. But as the season in their new residence became

hotter in summer, they instinctively returned to their birthplaces, and there

reared their young, retiring with them when the recurring winter impelled

them to seek a warmer climate. Those species which, unfitted for a greater

amount of heat by their more protracted sojourn in the northern regions, per-

sisted in revisiting their ancestral homes, or getting as near to them as they

could, retained a capacity for enjoying a temperate climate, which, very gra-

dually, was lost by the species which settled down more permanently in their
new quarters, and thus a law of migration became established on the one side, and

sedentary habits on the other.

    If there be one question on which the field naturalist may contribute, as lion's
provider to the philosopher, more than another, it is on the now much disputed

topic of ' mimicry,' whether protective or aggressive. As Mr. Beddard has re-

--marked on this subject, ' The field of hypothesis has no limits, and what we need

is more study' and may we not add, more accurate observation of facts P The

theory of protective mimicry was first propounded by Mr. H. W, Bates, from his
observations on the Amazon. He found that the group of butterflies, Heliconiidce,

conspicuously banded with yellow and black, were provided with certain glands
794 EEPORT-- 1893.

which secrete a nauseating fluid, supposed to render them unpalatable to birds. In

the same districts he found also similarly coloured butterflies, belonging to the

family Pierid(e, which so closely resembled the others in shape and markings as to

be easily mistaken for them, but which, unprovided with such secreting glands,

were unprotected from the attacks of birds. This resemblance, he thought, was

brought about by natural selection for the protection of the edible butterflies,

through the birds mistaking them for the inedible kinds. Other cases of mimicry

among a great variety of insects have since been pointed out, and the theory of

protective mimicry has gained many adherents. Among birds, many instances

have been adduced. Mr. Wallace has described the extraordinary similarity be-

tween birds of very different families, Oriolus bouruensis and Philemo7i moluc-

censis, both peculiar to the island of Bouru. Mr. H. 0. Forbes has discovered a

similar brown oriole, Oriolus decipiens, as closely imitating the appearance of the

APhilemon timorlautensis of Timor-laut.  similar instance occurs in Ceram. But

Mr. Wallace observes that, while usually the mimicking species is less numerous

than tlie mimicked, the contrary appears to be the case in Bouru, and it is difficult

to see what advantage has been gained by the mimicry. Now, all the species of

Philemoti are remarkably sombre-coloured birds, and the mimicry cannot be on

their side. But there are other brown orioles, very closely resembling those

named, in other IMoluccan islands, and yet having no resemblance to the Philemon of

the same island, as may be seen in the case of the Oriolus phceochromus and

Philemon gilolensis from Gilolo. Yet the oriole has adopted the same livery which

elsewhere is a perfect mimicry. May it not therefore be that we have," in this

group of brown orioles, the original type of the family, undifferentiated ? As they
spread east and south we may trace the gradation, through the brown striation of

the New Guinea bird, to the brighter, green-tinged form of the West Australian

and the green plumage of the Southern Australian, while westward the brilliant

yellows of the numerous Indian and African species were developed, and another

group, preferring high elevations, passing through the mountain ranges of Java,

Sumatra, and Borneo, intensified the aboriginal brown into black, and hence were

evolved the deep reds of the various species which culminate in the crimson of

Formosa, Oriolus ardens, and the still deeper crimson of O. trailli of the

Himalayas.

It is possible that there may be similarity without mimicry, and, by the five

laws of mimicry as laid down by Wallace, very many suggested cases must be
Weeliminated.
               all know that it is quite possible to find between species of very

different genera extraordinary similarity which is not mimetic. Take, for instance,

the remarkable identity of coloration in the case of some of the African species

Macronyx and the American Sturnella, or, again, of some of the African Cam-

pophaga and the American Agelaus. The outward resemblance occurs in both

cases in the red as well as in the yellow-coloured species of all four groups.

But we find that the Macronyx of America and the Campophagct of Africa, in

acquiring this coloration, have departed widely from the plain colour found in

their immediate relatives. If we applied Mr. Scudder's theory on insects, we must

imagine that the prototype form has become extinct, while the mimicker has

established its position. This is an hypothesis which is easier to suggest than

either to prove or to disprove. Similar cases may frequently be found in botany.

The strawberry is not indigenous in Japan, but in the mountams there I found a

potentilla in fruit which absolutely mimicked the Alpine strawberry in the minutest

particulars, in its runners, its blossoms, and fruit ; but the fruit was simply dry

--pith, supporting the seeds and retaining its colour without shrinking or falling

from the stalk for weeks a remarkable case, we cannot say of unconscious

mimicry, but of unconscious resemblance. Mimicry in birds is comparatively rare,

and still rarer in mammals, which is not surprising when we consider how small is

the total number of the mammalia, and even of birds, compared with the countless

species of invertebl-ates. Out of the vast assemblage of insects, with their varied

colours and patterns, it would be strange if there were not many cases of accidental
Aresemblance.
               strict application of Wallace's five laws would, perhaps, if all the

circumstances were knovra, eliminate many accepted instances.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  795

    As to cases of edible insects mimickiDg inedible, Mr. Poulton admits that even

unpalatable animals have their special enemies, and that the enemies of palatable

animals are not indetinitely numerous.

     Mr. Beddard gives tables of the results obtained by Weismann, Poulton, and
others, which show that it is impossible to lay down any definite law upon the
subject, and that the likes and dislikes of insect-eating animals are purely relative.

     One of the most interesting cases of mimicry is that of the Volucella, a genus
of Dijptera, whose larviE live on the larvas of Hymeyioptera, and of which the
perfect insect closely resembles some species of humble-bee. Though this fact is
unquestioned, yet it has recently given rise to a controversy, which, so far as one

who has no claim to be an entomologist can judge, proves that, while there is much

that can be explained by mimicry, there is, nevertheless, a danger of its advocates
pressing it too far. Volucella bomhylans occurs in two varieties, which prey upon
the humble-bees, Bomhus muscoruvi and B. lajndarius, which they respectively
resemble. Mr. Bateson does not question the behaviour of the Volucella, but states
that neither variety specially represents B. muscorum, and yet that they deposit
their eggs more frequently in their nests than in the nests of other species which

they resemble more closely. He also states that in a show-case in the Royal College

of Surgeons, to illustrate mimicry, two specimens of another species, B. st/lvarum,
were placed alongside of the Volucella, which they do resemble, but were labelled

B. muscoruyn.

    But Mr. Hart explains the parasitism in another way. He states that a nest

of B. 7nuscorum is made on the surface, without much attempt at concealment, and

that the bee is a peculiarly gentle species, with a very feeble sting ; but that the
species which the Volucella most resemble are irascible, and therefore more dangerous

to intruders. If this be so, it is difficult to see why the Volucella should mimic the

bee, which it does not affect, more closely than the one which is generally its

victim. I do not presume to express any opinion further than this, that the in-

stances I have cited show that there is much reason for further careful observation
by the field naturalist, and much yet to be discovered by the physiologist and the

chemist, as to the composition and nature of animal pigments.

    I had proposed to occupy a considerable portion of my address with a statement

of the present position of the controversy on heredity, by far the most difficult and

important of all those subjects which at present attract the attention of the biolo-

gist ; but an attack of ilbiess has compelled me to abandon my purpose. Not that
I proposed to venture to express any opinions of my own, for, with such protago-

nists in the field as Weismann, Wallace, Romanes, and Poulton on the one side,
and Herbert Spencer and Hartog on the other, ' Non nostruyn inter vos tantas

componere litest

     So far as I can understand Weismann's theory, he assumes the separation of
germ cells and somatic cells, and that each germ cell contains in its nucleus a
number of ' ids,' each ' id ' representing the personality of an ancestral member of
the species, or of an antecedent species. 'The first multicellular organism was
probably a cluster of similar cells, but these units soon lost their original homo-

geneity. As the result of mere relative position, some of the cells were especially
fitted to provide for the nutrition of the colony, while others undertook" the work
of reproduction.' The latter, or germ-plasm, he assumes to possess an unlimited

power of continuance, and that life is endowed with a fixed duration, not because
it is contrary to its nature to be unlimited, but because the unlimited existence of
individuals would be a luxury without any corresponding advantage.

     Herbert Spencer remarks upon this : ' The changes of every aggregate, no matter
of what kind, inevitably end in a state of equilibrium. Suns and planets die, as
well as organisms.' But has the theory been proved, either by the histologist, the
microscopist, or the chemist ^ Spencer presses the point that the immortality of
the protozoa has not been proved. And, after all, when Weismann makes the con-
tinuity of the germ-plasm the foundation of a theory of heredity, he is building
upon a pure hypothesis.

     From the continuity of the germ-plasm, and its relative segregation from the
body at large, save with respect to nutrition, he deduces, d, ·priori, the impossibility
796 REPOET-- 1893.

of characters acquired by the body being transmitted through the germ-plasm to

the offspring. From this he implies that where we find no intelligible mechanism

to convey an imprint from the body to the germ, there no imprint can be conveyed.

Romanes has brought forward many instances which seem to contradict this theory,

--and Herbert Spencer remarks that ' a recognised principle of reasoning " the law
--of parsimony " forbids the assumption of more causes than are needful for the
Weexplanation of phenomena.
                             have evident causes which arrest the cell mul-

tiplication, therefore it is illegitimate to ascribe this arrest to some property

inherent in the cells.'

    With regard to the reduction or disappearance of an organ, he states 'that
when natural selection, either direct or reversed, is set aside, why the mere cessation

of selection should cause decrease of an organ, irrespective of the direct effects of

disease, I am unable to see. Beyond the production of changes in the size of parts,

by the selection of fortuitously arising variation, I can see but one other cause for

--the production of them the competition among the parts for nutriment. . . . The

active parts are well supplied, while the inactive parts are ill supplied and dwindle,

as does the arm of the Hindu fakir. This competition is the cause of economy of

--growth this is the cause of decrease from disease.'

    I may illustrate Mr. Herbert Spencer's remarks by the familiar instance of the

--pinions of the Kakapo (Strinffops) still remaining, but powerless for flight.

    As for acquired habits, such as the modification of bird architecture by the

same species under changed circumstances, how they can be better accounted for than

by hereditary transmitted instinct, I do not see. I mean such cases as the ground-

nesting Diduncidus in Samoa having saved itself from extinction since the intro-

duction of cats, by roosting and nesting in trees ; or the extraordinary acquired

habit of the black-cap in the Canaries, observed by Dr. Lowe, of piercing the

-- --calyx of Hibiscus rosa- sinensis an introduced plant to attract insects, for which

he quietly sits waiting. So the lying low of a covey of partridges under an

artificial kite would seem to be a transmitted instinct from a far-off ancestry not

yet lost ; for many generations of partridges, I fear, must have passed since the

last kite hovered over the forefathers of an English partridge, save in very few

parts of the island.

I cannot conclude without recalling that the past year has witnessed the

severance of the last link with the pre-Darwinian naturalists in the death of Sir

Richard Owen. Though never himself a field-worker, or the discoverer of a single

tinimal living or extinct, his career extends over the whole hi.story of paleonto-

logy. I say palaeontology, for he was not a geologist in the sense of studying

the order, succession, area, structure, and disturbance of strata. But he accumu-
lated facts on the fossil remains that came to his hands, till he won the fame of
being the greatest comparative anatomist of the age. To him we owe the building

tip of the skeletons of the giant Dinornithidcp. and many other of the perished forms

of the gigantic sloths, armadilloes, and mastodons of South America, Australia,

and Europe. He was himself a colossal worker, and he never worked for popu-
larity. He had lived and worked too long before the Victorian age to accept

readily the doctrines which have revolutionised that science, though none

has had a larger share in accumulating the facts, the combination of which of

necessity produced that transformation. But, though he clung fondly to his old

idea of the archetype, no man did more than Owen to explode the rival theories of

both Wernerians and Huttonians, till the controversies of Plutonians and Nep-

tunians come to us from the far past with as little to move our interest as the blue

and green factions of Constantinople.

    Nor can we forget that it is to Sir Richard's indomitable perseverance that we
owe the magnificent palace which contains the national collections in Cromwell

Road. For many years he fought the battle almost alone. His demand for a build-
ing of two stories, covering five acres, was denounced as audacious. The scheme

was pronounced foolish, crazy, and extravagant; but, after twenty years' struggle,
he was victorious, and in 1872 the Act was passed which gave not five, but more
than seven acres for the purpose. Owen retired from its direction in 1883, having

achieved the crowning victory of his life. Looking back in his old age on the

advances, and observed, * The known is very small compared with the knowable,

and we may trust in the Author of all truth, who, I think, will not let that

truth remain for ever hidden.'

I have endeavoured to show that there is still room for all workers, that the

naturalist has his place, though the morphologist and the physiologist have rightly

come into far greater prominence, and we need not yet abandon the- field-glass
and the lens for the microscope and the scalpel. The studies of the laboratory

still leave room for the observations of the field. The investigation of muscles,

the analysis of brain tissue, the research into the chemical properties of pigment,

have not rendered worthless the study and observation of life and habits. As you

cannot diagnose the Red Indian and the Anglo-Saxon by a comparison of their

respective skeletons or researches into their muscular structure, but require to

know the habits, the  language, the  modes  of thought  of each                                                              so the mammal,

the bird, and even the invertebrate, has his character, his voice, his impulses, aye,

I will add, his ideas, to be taken into account in order to discriminate him. There

is something beyond matter in life, even in its lowest forms. I may quote on thi&

the caution uttered by a predecessor of mine in this chair (Professor Milnes

Marshall) : ' One thing above all is apparent, that erabryologists must not work

single-handed ; must not be satisfied with an acquaintance, however exact, with

animals from the side of development only ; for embryos have this in common with

maps, that too close and too exclusive a study of them is apt to disturb a man's

reasoning power.'

faculty of the philosopher, who draws his conclusions from facts and observations.

The older naturalists lost much from lack of the records of previous observa-

tions ; their difficulties were not ours, but thej' went to nature for their teachings

rather than to books. Now we find it hard to avoid being smothered with the

literature of the subject, and being choked with the dust of libraries. The danger

against which Professor Marshall warns the embryologist is not confined to him

alone ; the observer of facts is equally exposed to it, and he must beware of the

danger, else he may become a mere materialist. The poetic, the imaginative, the

emotional, the spiritual, all go to make up the man ; and if one of these is missing,

he is incomplete.

I cannot but feel that the danger of this concentration upon one side only of

nature is painfully illustrated in the life of our great master, Darwin. In his early

days he was a lover of literature, he delighted in Shakespeare and other poets
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

but after years of scientific activity and interest, he found on taking them up

again that he had not only grown indifferent to them, but that they were even

distasteful to him. He had suffered a sort of atrophy on that side of his nature,

--as the disused pinions of the Kakapo have become powerless the spiritual, the

imaginative, the emotional, we may call it.

-- --· The case of Darwin illustrates a law a principle we may call it namely, that

the spiritual faculty lives or dies by exercise or the want of it even as does the bodily.

Yet the atrophy was unconscious. Far was it from Darwin to ignore or depreciate

studies not his own. He has shown us this when heprefixed to the title-page of his great

--work the following extract from Lord Chancellor Bacon: ' To conclude, there-

fore, let no man, out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an ill-applied moderation,,

think or maintain that a man can search too far, or be too well studied in the book

of God's word, or in the book of God's works, divinity or philosophy, but rather

let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both.' In true harmony

is this with the spirit of the father of natural history, concluding with the words,

' Lord, how manifold are Thy works ! in wisdom hast Thou made them all : the
earth is full of Thv riches.'

  -- --In a letter to ' Nature ' (August 24) on ' Pre-natal Influences on Character,' I

stated rather hastily, as it now appears that physiologists rejected the notion of

physical peculiarities being thus caused, both on account of the total absence of
trustworthy evidence and also on theoretical grounds. In the article ' Deformities

--in the new edition of * Chambers's Encyclopaedia ' (by Professor A. Hare) I find the

following statement : ' In an increasing proportion of cases which are carefully
investigated it appears that maternal impressions, the result of shock or unpleasant

experiences, may have a considerable influence in producing deformities in the

ofispring. This has long been a popular theory, and it is one that recent scientific

observation is tending to confirm.'

    In consequence of my letter in ' Nature ' several alleged cases of the kind above

referred to have been sent me, one of which, being illustrated by a photograph and
attested by a perfectly competent observer, will, I think, interest all biologists.

The account was sent me by Dr. Richard Budd, M.D., F.R.C.P., Physician to the

--North Devon Infirmary. The following is a copy of his statement:

    ' In the year 18G1 a gamekeeper named Croucher was admitted to the North
Devon Infirmary in consequence of a gunshot wound of the right forearm. The

arm was amputated just below the elbow. Croucher left the infirmary before the
wound was quite healed, in the belief that his wife would be able to dress it. In
this lie was mistaken ; but a young woman, the wife of a neighbouring farmer,
volunteered her services, and continued to dress the wound till it was healed.
Some six or seven months after this young woman was confined, and her child was
born minus the right forearm, and the stump was a facsimile of Croucher's. The

gamekeeper's arm became somewhat wasted by the pressure induced by an artificial
arm, and therefore the resemblance of the two arms (in the photograph taken some

years later) is not so exact as it was at first. The photographs were taken by

    In a letter Dr. Budd adds : * With regard to the Croucher case, I am not aware

that the facts have been published in any of the medical periodicals, but I exhibited
and explained the photographs at a grand meeting at the College of Physicians (in

November 1876), when most of the celebrated physicians of the world were present,

and they created the deepest interest.'
     1 presume that the birth of a child with an arm exactly resembling that in the

photograph is an exceedingly rare occurrence in England, and that the probability

of one being thus born in the same place where there was a man with a similar

arm is exceedingly slight. When we add to this the further improbability of such

a child being born within nine months after the accident, and the mother being the

particular woman who repeatedly dressed the wounded arm, it seems impossible to

avoid accepting a causal connection between the two events.

     Should such a connection be established, both on the physical and mental side,

we have evidently a new cause of modification distinct from normal heredity.

It has more analogy with the supposed inheritance of acquired variations, but
is quite distinct from it. It seems not unlikely that some of the cases of supposed

heredity of mutilations may be really due to this mental effect on the mother. It

therefore becomes very important that the whole subject should be thoroughly in-

vestigated.

     The following letter has also been received from Dr. Budd :

My' dear Sir,--Some years ago the late Sir Frederick Williams, Bart., sent a
hrood mare, that had just been covered by a thorough-bred stallion, from his seat

in Cornwall, Tregullo, to his shooting-cottage at Heanton Puncharden, near

Barnstaple. When the groom entered the stable the following mornino- he

found that one of the mare's eyes was hanging by a nail in the wall. "The
mare was then placed for a run in the Braunton marshes. In due time she
produced a foal minus an eye on the same side as the mare's. The year following

this mare again had a foal with one eye ; but the third year she had a foal with two
good eyes, the impression on her brain having worn out.

        4. On Calorimetnj hy Surface Thermometry and Eygrometry.
                      By Augustus D. Wallee, M.D., F.B.S.

     This is in continuation of a communication made at the Lieo-e Cono'ress of
Physiology (1892). Of the conclusions then published the only one needino- to be
quoted for the present purpose is that the alteration of temperature of a Umb in
consequence of the exercise of its muscles is mainly a vascular effect. Which signifies
that the measurements given below are of muscular and vascular phenomena, not
of muscular phenomena alone.

To form an approximate estimate of the calorimetric value of surface thermo-
        readings I proceeded
metric                        as follows                                                  Headings were taken  at intervals of an
                                                                                       :

internal and of an external thei-mometer in connection with an indiarubber sphere

of known surface, containing a known weight of warm water, allowed to cool in
still au\ Eeadmgs of a third thermometer gave the temperature of the air. The
internal thermometer indicated the heat loss in calories ; the external thermometer
gave indications that were proportional with the temperature-difference (hereafter

referred to as the T.D.) between the surface of the sphere and the surroundino- air

In this way it was estimated that each degree of indicated T.D. signified a heat-
emission of approximately 12-5 calories per 1,000 cm.^ per minute.

The T.D. observed on the naked forearm was, under ordinary conditions, found
to be between 10° and 15° C. Assuming that, ceteris paribus, the radiation from
the skin was equal to that from the indiarubber, and taking the superficial area of
the forearm (not including the hand) at 500 cm.^, the heat-emission within the
above range of T.D. is 62-5 to 94 cals. per minute.

Theoretically there are two obvious weak links in this argument, but for
practical purposes it maybe acted upon ; it affords a more tangible series of expres-

sions for variations of heat-emission under various conditions than is aflbrded by
merely thermometric terms, and the calorimetric values thus obtained possess at
least an equal degree of accuracy with those obtained by partial calorimetry.
The weak links are (1) that Newton's law of cooling is not absolutely correct ·
(2) that the coefficient of radiation varies with the nature of the coolino- surface '

1. Neivton's lazv is not absoluteli/ correct ; the heat-emission by radiation and
Weconduction per 1° T.D. is a diminishing value with diminishing T.D.

not therefore, strictly speaking-, give the value of heat-emission as constant per

degree T.D., nor make, as above, the assumption that cal. = T.D. x k. But the dis-

crepancy is not very serious within a range of 5° or even of 10°, and it is easily

eliminated. Thus we may treat the discharge at 10° T.D. as a constant, and give

the variations per degree above this value. Or, better, we may draw up a table

of the values T.D.'''^^^ x k. The following table gives in three parallel columns the

calorimetric values per minute per 1,000 cm.- of temperature-differences such as

are ordinarily observed on the human forearm ; 1° on the least accurate assumption

cal. = T.D. X K ; 2° on the more accurate assumption cal. = C + (T.D. -- 10) k ; 3° on

the least inaccurate assumption cal. = k T.D.  Variations of barometric pressure

this end I used a simple bygrotneter, consisting of a shallow glass capsule, in the
flat bottom of which some calcium chloride solution had been evaporated to dryness.

The amount of water vapour discharged was ascertained by weighing the capsule
before and after it had been left inverted for a given period over the skin or other

surface of evaporation ; the corresponding quantity of heat emitted was taken as

equal to the weight of water x by the latent heat of evaporation. By preliminary

trials it was found that the water discharge varied from 2 to 20 mgrms. per
20 cm.- per 10 min. at various parts of the skin under ordinary varying conditions,
and that a capsule inverted over a wet surface can absorb between 80 and 90
mgrms. per 20 cm.- per 10 min.^ It was also found by trial on a wet cooling
sphere that the amoimt of heat ascertained by means of the internal thermometer
to be lost was approximately found by calculations fi'om the data furnished by the
external thermometer and the hygrometer conjointly. Thus, e.ff., against a loss
of 400 cals. per min. indicated by the internal thermometer there were
found 150 cals. by the surface thermometer (the T.D. being 12°, and taking out
from the calorimetric values tabulated above the corresponding number) plus 240
to 270 cals. by the evaporation of 400 to 450 milligrammes of water.

     Assuming that the graduation is not grossly inaccurate, and that the argument
upon which it rests is not grossly incorrect, the following numbers represent the
state of heat-emission from a human forearm, with a superficial area of 500 cm.-,

      In carrying out investigations of this character, it is of great advantage to

employ the graphic method. Amount and rhythm of muscular exercise are
recorded by a dynamograph, as described in my ' Introduction to Human Phy-

siology'; surface-temperature by an air-thermograph, the essential part of which
is a thin metal box strapped to the limb, and connected with a piston-recorder in
contact with a slowly revolving cylinder, as will be described in a future com-
munication : the area of the thermographic curve thus recorded represents a calori-
metric value, and its ordinate a rate of heat-emission.

     The method is easily carried out ; the surface thermometer (or thermograph)
and the calcium chloride hygrometer are well adapted to the clinical investigation
of the heat and water emission of the skin under various pathological conditions.

collecting: the mud and levigating off the fine silt, the organisms are collected by

sucking them up from among the coarser debris, treated with 95 per cent, spirit,
picked out singly with a mounted needle from the debris which had necessarily
been sucked up with them, dried over oil of vitriol, and pounded. The impalpable
powder (moistened with alcohol, as water wets it with difficulty) is extracted
with water.

     The watery extract shows the following properties :
     1. It hydrolyses starch paste in a neutral solution, but much less readily in

presence of dilute mineral acids. It converts the starch rapidly into erythro-dextrin,

but the formation of a sugar which will reduce alkaline copper solution is somewhat

tardy.

     2. It has no action whatever on thymolised milk in two days.

      3. It liquefies fibrin rapidly iu presence of dilute acids, but it is only after
prolonged action that a distinct biuret reaction reveals the presence of pepsin.

     4. It only attacks fibrin very slowly, and partially in neutral solution, and
indol and skatol are not formed.

     The enzymes present, therefore, resemble ptyalin and pepsin ; tri/psin, rennin,
and steapsin (or pialyn) appear to be absent.

    About 1,000 individuals furnish one grain of dry substance. Two series of

experiments were made with about this quantity of material each time. It is
proposed to repeat and complete the research in the autumn.

1. On the Luminous Organs of Ce;phalopoda. By William E. Hotle.

It was recorded by Verany so long ago as 1851 that certain spots on the body and

arms of the rare and beautiful cuttlefish {Histioteuthis Bonelliana) gave out a phos-

phorescent light in the dark, but no subsequent observer has been fortunate enough

to have the opportunity of confirming his observation, or indeed of procuring a

specimen of the species. The allied form {Histioteuthis Hiippellii), which has spots

of precisely similar appearance, has been several times examined, though never

in the living condition. During the early part of the present year Professor

Joubin, of Eennes, published an account of his examination of the structure of

Mythese organs.  own investigations have been made upon Histioteuthis Hiippellii,

upon another rare species, Calliteuthis reversa, and upon two species of Enoplo-

teuthis, a genus remarkable for having a number of the suckers developed into for-

midable hooks.

    As regards the first, the specimen at my disposal was not in a very satisfactory
state of preservation, so that I can say no more than that my results on the whole

agree with those of Joubin.

In Calliteuthis, a genus not far removed systematically from Histioteuthis, the

organs are essentially similar iu distribution and in appearance to the naked eye,

and, as might therefore be expected, they are very similar in structure. The most

noticeable differences are that the distinction between the lens and the transparent

cone of Joubin is scarcely marked, and that the mirror situated anteriorly to the
main part of the organ is scarcely marked. These points may, however, be due to

the sections having been made from a very young specimen.

     In Enoploteuthis the appearance and structure of the organ are very different.

When the surface of the body is examined under a pocket-lens there are seen

among the ordinary chromatophores larger roimd spots, each having a pearly centre

surrounded by a ring of pigment, and usually somewhat raised above the general

level of the epithelium. These spots are confined to the ventral aspect of the

animal, but are found on the mantle, funnel and arms, as well as roimd the eyes.

TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                803

In one species I found three or four isolated ones in the centre of the dorsal
surface of each fin.

     In section it is seen that each organ is a spheroidal hody embedded in the sub-
cutaneous cellular tissue, and consisting of the following- parts : (1) an outer pig-
mented cup with a considerable aperture (a quarter of its circumference) in front.

A(2) lining within the cup, consisting of a single layer of cuboidal ceUs, with

spherical nuclei, easily stained. (3) The anterior aperture of the pigment cup is
filled by a lenticular body, composed of masses of a structureless yellowish
material, to all appearance cuticular in nature, with small deeply-stained cells
between the masses. (4) From the back of the lens there projects into the centre
of the organ a conical plug, composed of deeply-stained cells. These are seen in

transverse sections to be disposed concentrically round the axis of the cone, pro-

ducing the efi'ect of the well-known ' cell nests ' of an epithelioma. (5) The space
between this plug and the cells lining the pigment cup is filled with a clear trans-
parent mass. In its peripheral portions this seems to be made up of thin layers
arranged concentrically like the coats of an onion ; whilst nearer the centre it has
the form of curved rods, wider in front than behind, amongst which nuclei are

sparsely scattered.

     In most cases a space, most likely a blood lacuna, was seen around the organ
no nerve supply could be traced out.

      It is impossible without an opportunity of examining the living animal to say
what part of this apparatus is the active agent in producing the light ; indeed, it
must be remembered that positive proof of its being a luminous organ at all is
still wanting.

     Of similar structures as yet described in other animals it seems to resemble
most nearly the photospheria of Nyctiphanes norvegica, a schizopod crustacean
examined by Messrs. Vallentine and Cunningham. As regards origin, these organs

are probably to be regarded as highly modified chromatophores ; an analogous
modification would be found in the thermoscopic spots recently described by
Joubin in another cephalopod.

        4. The Origin of Organic Colour. By F. T. Mott, F.B.0.8.

     In a complete plant of the higher orders there are three distinct schemes of

--colour viz., the browns, olives, and maroons of the stem and branches, the greens

of the foliage, and the reds, yellows, and blues of the blossom.
     These indicate a successive decrease in the amount of light absorbed, which

miist be the result of changes in the absorbing capacity of the molecules. It is

suggested that the cause of these changes may be found in the specially organic

phenomenon of food assimilation, and the concentration of energy in the molecular
structure which this implies. If such energy is stored in the form of increased

molecular vibration, sets of molecules will successively reach the maximum limit

of vibration possible to them, and will lose the power of further absorption.
Thus the amount of reflected light will increase as the plant attains maturity ; and
as the arrest of growth which accompanies the formation of blossom throws upon
the vibration of the molecules the energy otherwise expended upon growth, a
marked increase of reflected light from the flower is the natural resiUt.

comparison of their forms will sliow certain distinct, albeit slight, differences,

sufficiently marked to make it possible to identify a plant by means of the root

alone.

    One of the objects of this paper was to point out those differences by means of
diagrams in which the respective roots of Lemna minor, tvisulca, gihha, and

polyrhiza were represented side by side.

Besides a considerable variety in the length of the various root-fibres, a

microscopic examination of the sheaths which protect the apex shows that neither

are they uniform in shape, but, ranging from the comparatively blunt and straight

ampulla of Lemna minor to the slightly pointed sheath of Lemna gibba, they

become blade-like in Lemna polyrhiza, and, finally, sharply pointed and with a

tendency to curve in Lemna trisulcn.
    As the plant matures the sheath becomes a ruddy brown colour, and is seen

under the microscope to be freckled with brown blotches, probably the decaying

outer cells of the case. This hardening of the ampulla is a very necessary security

against the attacks of water insects, which feed upon the delicate root fibres, often

commencing at the extremity of the root and working their way upwards.

It is interesting to speculate as to possible other uses for this rather phenomenal

root-cap. The functions of the root-caps of terrestrial plants are easily recognised

in their adaptability to the purpose of forcing a way for the fibre through soil or
pebbles, but here we have plants suspended in the water, and yet furnished with

something very similar. This difficulty has been met by the suggestion that the

sheath of the Lemna is not a root-cap, but really a persistent digestive pouch ; but,

even without this explanation, one has only to take into consideration the

characteristics of the habitat of the duckweed to see that the ampulla is continu-
ally required to do the work of any ordinary root-cap of terrestrial plants. Owing

to the stagnant nature of the ponds and dykes where it flourishes the plant is

subjected to violent alternations of drought and plenty, and in the dry season

myi'iads of perishing Lemnre are left high and dry on the banks. The more
fortunate individuals, growing where the water is deeper, are gradually let down

as it becomes more shallow, until at last, striking their roots on the soil at the

bottom, they are embedded in the mire, and there await the return of rain.

   A curious hooked appearance which is occasionally seen in the ampulla oi Lemna

trisulca was also represented in the diagrams.
    In the long chains formed by a number of connected fronds of Lemna trisulca

it will not infrequently be found that the ]-oot-fibres spring sometimes from below

the frond and hang downwards, and sometimes from what appears to be the

Asurface of the frond, reaching upwards.  careful observation of the tendency of

this submerged duckweed under certain circumstances to twist into an almost spiral

form led the author to the conclusion that in such cases the fronds had completely

revolved in their sockets, so that what had at first been underneath was now

uppermost, throvnng the root attached to it up to the surface. Further observa-

tions seemed to point to the fact that this habit is confined to cases where the

submerged Lemna trisulca is covered from light and air by a thick overgrowth of

other weeds, such as Lemna minor, with which it is often associated ; for in a pond

where this was not the case the uncovered chains of Leinna trisulca were lying
almost flat, but after being placed in a basin already containing Lemna minor

they also assumed an irregular spiral form in the course of a few weeks. Should

this change be found to be attributable to a want of air it may possibly point to a

respiratory function in the root-fibre.

    3. Ow the .Etiology and Life-history of some Vegetal Galls and their
                           Inhabitants.^ By G. B. Rothera.

     In tte restricted sense in which the term is here applied, galls are defined as
complex organisms resulting from the co-operation of a plant and an animal; and
to determine the extent and modus operandi of these two factors in their produc-

tion is one of the many interesting problems which this study presents. Though

abnormal with regard to the plant, inasmuch as their presence is exceptional and
foreign to the performance of its proper functions, galls are in themselves as normal

as any other organisms. Each has its own characteristic form, its special habitat,

and its proper office. Hence, after referring to the great diversity of these
organisms and their wide distribution, the writer proceeds to trace out the life-
history of certain typical galls, those of Cynips Kollari, Ttras tenuinaiis, and

Biorhiza aptera being specially dealt with.

    What is there, he asks, in the casual presence of the ovum of the gall-producing

insect, in the action of the developing larva, in the mechanical puncture of the

--parent cj^nips, or in the deposit of a tiny drop of irritating fluid by which it is said

the ovipositing is accompanied what is there in any one, or more, or all of these,
or, it may be, in the action of some other factor yet to be discovered, that impels
these wonder-working changes by which the gall itself is initiated and its future
growth and development accompanied ? Reviewing the various attempts made to
answer this and cognate questions, as also the arguments by which the generally
accepted view of the deposit by the parent cynips of a special virus is supported,
the author denies the alleged analogy upon which the conclusion thence arrived at
rests. The presence of the ovum Cnot found in any of the cases stated) may be, he

suggests, as necessary a factor in the production of the gall as is the deposit of a

specific virus ; while in many cases galls are found to result from the action of

--other animals than terebrant hymenoptera as, for example, of kermes, cecydomiae,
--and acari where no such poison-glaud as that referred to exists. Very early in

his investigations (now extending over a period of five-and-twenty years) the
writer arrived at the conclusion that another agent, as potent as that of this hypo-
thetical virus, was essential to the production of, at least, some species of vegetal
galls, such agent being the presence and action of a living larva. In illustration

--of this the ' oak-apple ' may be taken. Here the parent cynips {Biorhiza aptera

tory to ovipositing, makes a cut across the axis of a winter bud of the oak, above
the circlet of scales by which it is surrounded, so as to separate the cone-like
aper with its appendages. In the space thus prepared a variable number of

--eggs is laid at times as many as two hundred and fifty or more. Should these,

however, notwithstanding the incision, fail to be deposited, or, if laid, perish
during the winter, no growth, normal or abnormal, takes place from the divided
axis. This remains brown, dry, and inactive. If, on the other hand, healthy ova
are present, and these hatch out their living embryos, then, by the action of these

upon the dormant tissues, new and peculiar powers of growth are manifested
powers which result in the production, not of a normal branch, but of an abnormal,
tumour-like gall. Here, then, we have a series of facts, positive and negative,
which point to the action of the embryo, and not to the deposit of a special virus
by the parent cynips, as the direct and necessary agent in the production of the

gall. Granting, for the sake of illustration, the existence and potency of such

Tirus, ought we not in such case to expect that, even in the absence of living Uirvte,
the normal energies of the fluid would be exerted, and a gall, destitute though it

might be of normal occupants, of necessity result ? In the author's long experience
DO facts confirmatory of this view have been met with, nor is it probable that any

such barren galls exist. Are we not, then, justified in discarding the hype

--806 REPOBT 1893.

a specific virus deposited by the parent cynips, and in attributing to the activities
of the living embryos, combined with the normal forces of the plant, the genesis
and metamorphoses of the gall ?

     This view has since been emphasised by Dr. Beyerinck, of Utrecht, who, as a
deduction from the same facts, holds that in the action of the cynipidae larvae, and
not in the injection of a specific virus by the parent cynips, the cause of gall forma-

tion is solely to be found. Whether so or not, however, this, at least, may safely

be concluded, namely, that while, on the one hand, in those chemical and other
forces which produce growth greater activity is induced by the stimulus of the

-- --injected fluid assuming this to be actually present so, on the other, those

mechanical conditions which determine form in organic beings are furnished to a
large extent by the contact of the included ovum and by the activities of the
embryonic larva.

      Resting in this solution cf the problem, the author proceeds to deal with the
facts of parthenogenesis ana metagenesis, as exhibited in the gall-producing
cynipidae, and then to trace the operations of phytophagous and entomophagous
iuquilines and parasites,

                          ' The unbidden crew of graceless guests ' ( VirgiV),

which, season by season, decimate the cynips' larvae, the legitimate possessors of
the gall, living on their fatty juices, or so robbing them of their food that they die of
poverty and inanition. But here, again, as if to punish wrong and work retributive
justice, these inquiline and parasitic enemies in turn are preyed upon by other
parasites lower in the scale of creation than themselves, which thin their ranks, and
 thus, in a rude and barbarous way, maintain the necessary balance of organic life.

     4. On some New Features in Nuclear Division in Lilium martagon.
                              By Professor J. B, Farmek.

    A careful examination of the course of development of the pollen in Lilium

 inartago7i shows the presence of a varying number of bodies which seem to have
 escaped the observation of those who have hitherto investigated this plant. To
 these bodies the general term ' granule ' has been given, as one which involves no
 assumption as to their real nature. These granules are not easily made clear except
 by the careful use of selective stains. One of the best methods, though by no
 means the only one, of sharply differentiating them is that of double staining with
  haematoxylin and orange G. The great importance of the granules lies in the
 fact that a variable number of them may become converging points for the achro-
  matic spindle fibres, and the whole spindle thus becomes multipolar and irregular.
  This does not, at any rate in the earlier stages of karyokinesis, terminate in any
  definite granule which may be regarded as a ' centrosome.' This behaviour on the
  part of the granules obviously affects deeply the whole question of the individuality

   of the centrosome.

       As to the origin of the granules, it is of extreme interest to find that they

   appear suddenly in the cytoplasm, which had hitherto been perfectly free from
   them. Their appearance is immediately subsequent to the fragmentation of the
  large nucleolus during the preparatory stages of division, and moreover in their

 Astaining reactions they exactly coincide with those presented by this structure.

  possible connection between the nucleolus and the granules is thus indicated.
        During the later period of division the granules become fewer and larger, but

   their ultimate fate is not as yet quite clear.

       The above points were illustrated by photomicrographs.

S. Afeiu Notes on Seals and Whales seen during the Voyage to the Antarctic,

                          1892-93. By Wm. S. Bruce.

During the recent Antarctic cruise at least three kinds of seals were seen. These

were all true seals ; no fur seals were seen. They were the sea-leopard (Steno-

rhijnckus leptony.r), Weddell's false sea-leopard {Leptonyx WeddelUi), and a

creamy-white seal, probably the crab-eating seal {Lobodon carcinophaga). There

were two others, which were possibly younger forms of sea-leopard and crab-eating

seals respectively. The latter, instead of being white, was mottled pale grey, but

similar in form and size to, and often found among, the white seals. In December aU

the seals were in very bad condition, thinly blubbered and grievously scarred. The

females were scarred as freely as the males. There was no marked preponderance

in the number of the females. During January their condition improved, and by

February they were heavily blubbered and free from scars. Loving the sun, they

lie on the pack ice all day digesting their meal of the previous night, which con-

sists chiefly of  fish  or small crustaceans, or both                                                                                                                                     the penguin  is  also occasionally

their victim, and I have found stones in their stomachs.

By February the embryo is well developed, gestation probably beginning in

December, It is extremely regrettable that it was during this period the indis-

criminate slaughter took place, almost all the females towards the end of January

and February being with young.

     All the seals were found on the pack ice ; the sea-leopard was on the outer-
most streams, and was most frequently to be found singly, though two or three
might be on one piece of ice, but seldom more. Weddell's false sea-leopard was
very rare, only four of them having been seen. The creamy-white seal and the

pale mottled grey were in greatest abundance : these are found in fours, fives, or

even tens---the greatest number I have seen on one piece was forty-seven. On

one occasion we found some seals on a tilted berg ; so high was the ledge above the
water-level that our men with difficulty clambered up and secured their prey.
This illustrates their great power of jumping from the water on to the ice. I bave
seen them rising about 9 feet above water, and cover distances of fully 20 feet in

length.

     It is of interest to note that we saw no trace of any whale resembling the bow-

bead or Greenland black whale (Balance mysticetus) wbich Ross reported to have

seen in very great numbers. There were, "however, hunchbacks, finbacks, bottle-
noses, and grampuses.

6. On the Penguins of the Antarctic Ocean. By C. W. Donald, M.B.

The penguin is one of the most interesting' of living birds. Its shape, erect

posture, rigid flippers, its feathers, anatomy, and habits are all characteristic. The

most common form in this region is the black-throated species Dasyrhamphus

& Aadelias (H. J.).                                                                    large rookery of this species, situated on the south shore of

JoinviUe Island, was visited. On one occasion they were seen in large schools,

--each directed by an individual of larger species probably an Emperor. On the
ice he usually progresses in the erect posture. In the water he generally proceeds

--like a porpoise in a prolonged dive broken at intervals of about thirty yards as
--he rises for breath leaping clean out of the water, and immediately disappearing

with scarcely a ripple, after clearing a space of two to two and a half feet. Ex-

perimenting on them, one was found to survive being held under water for six

minutes. Their food consists chiefly of a large shrimp-like crustacean of the genus

Euphausia. Their stomachs generally contain a number of angular pebbles. Large

flocks of a white-throated penguin of the type described as D. Herculis (Finsch)

were seen in February. I am of opinion that these are the young of D. adelice.

-- --The Emperor Vengum Aiitenodijtes Fosteri was met with on several occasions.
-- --One of these of great size and beautiful plumage was 4 feet 10 inches from tip of

-- -- Abeak to extremity of tail. It weighed 74 lb. One specimen of the Kinged Penguin
Pygosculis antarctica was obtained.                                                    rookery occupied by the white-headed
--penguin Pygosculis papua was visited. The nests here were lined by feathers

from the parents' breasts. I saw no crested penguins nor any specimen of the

King Ajitenodytes longirostris. "What I believe to be a new species of crested

penguin was seen on the S. Orkneys by Captain Sarsen.

7. On the Development of the Molar Teeth of the Elephant, with BemarJcs on
                Dental Series. By Professor J. Cleland, F.E.S.

A specimen was exhibited from the lower jaw of an Indian elephant of a molar

tooth enclosed in its sac, and consisting of a series of seventeen transverse laminae,,

each surmounted by comparatively elongated cusps. As yet only the cusps of

the hindermost lamina were covered with caps of dentine, and the laminae were

separated one from another by projections of the saccular wall. It was pointed

out that the cusps became afterwards less distinct by the growth of enamel taking

place on the surface, and that the laminae by remaining uncovered with dentine for

a considerable period were enabled to enlarge to three or four times the breadth

that they exhibited in the specimen. The elephant's molars may be said to be

doubly compound                                                                        the cusps, originally sepai-ate, being  united  by the  laminae  on
                                                                                    ;

which they are placed, and the laminae being joined together afterwards by a com-

mon base on which the dentine is at a later period continued down, to be prolonged

finally into fangs. It is doubtful if any hard distinction can be drawn between a

transverse row of cusps conjoined together and a transverse series of separate teeth.

Teeth ought to be recognised as occurring in the jaws in longitudinal and

transverse series. The temporary and permanent teeth of mammals are in point

of fact derived from papillae forming respectively an outer and an inner range,

while the additional teeth occurring occasionally in the human subject are

instances of a third papilla being developed internal to the inner range; just as in

sharks many teeth may lie in one transverse line. But this arrangement is disguised

by each tooth being temporarily included in a sac, and has escaped notice.
    The specimen has been presented to the British Museum.

The following Papers were read :

1. On Certain Gregarinidce, and the possible connection of Allied Forms
    with Tissue Changes in Man. By Charles H. Cattle, M.D., Al.B.G.P.,

     and James Millar, M.D.

After giving a general review of the classification of the protozoa, the writers

pointed out that they were chiefly interested in the sporozoa, and that because of

their parasitic habits, especially in the bodies of the higher vertebrates. There

was much still unknown of the habits, life-history, and distribution of these

organisms, and the co-operation of biologists with medical men was invited for

the elucidation of many unsettled questions. One of these was how far certain

of the sporozoa, at present classified as distinct species and genera, were to be

properly so considered, and how far some of them were really alternative forms

of the same organism modified by change of host and other external influences.

   A detailed description was given of tfie authors' own observations on the

development of the coccidium oviforme of the rabbit. On the authority of

L. Pfeifler ' it was stated that in the body of its host, the coccidium multiplies

by means of a most prolific zoospore formation, while in external media it forms

lasting spores. The authors took some material derived from the rabbit's gall-

bladder, containing coccidia, and watched the development of the parasite under

different external conditions. When the specimens were first observed, the

granular protoplasm, contained in the coccidium capsule, had already contracted

into a rounded mass, lying either in the centi-e, or somewhat to one end. The

first specimen to show further change was one kept in ordinary water at the

temperature of the air, and imsealed so that there was free access of air to it.

"Within a .space of two days the granular ball had divided into two, and in some

instances into four portions. Sometimes the final division was into three portions

instead of four. As an ultimate result of the segmentation the parent coccidium

came to contain three or four sporoblasts, each containing one or two (generally

two) refractile translucent bodies (spores) and some granular matter, the so-called

nucleus de reliquat. The authors entirely failed to see the C-shaped rod with

thickened ends, which has been described - as lying within the sporoblasts. At a

later stage individuals were met with in which the sporoblasts could be seen

making their way out of the containing capsule and floating free in the surround-

ing fluid. The authors believe this is the first time this phenomenon has been

actually observed                                                                      but  they feel  some  doubt  as  to whether what  they saw was
                                                                                    ;

entirely sponianeous, or had been assisted by the pressure of the cover-glass used

in mounting the specimen on the slide. Probably under ordinary circumstances

the spores remain unchanged for an indefinite time, and only undergo further

change when they reach the interior of a new host. Ultimately they give origin

to amoeboid germs which penetrate into epithelial cells. The authors regard

the interior of the tissue-cells as the necessary abode of tlie young forms of all

sporozoa ; and if this opinion is correct, they see great difficulties in the way of

artificial cultivation of coccidia or any other true ceU-parasite.

The tissue-changes in the rabbit's liver due to a known parasite (the coccidium)

were stated to bear a close resemblance to those which constitute cancer in the

human subject. In the latter bodies have of late years been described and which
by many observers are considered as protozoa. The authors showed by means of

lantern slides the structure of these latter bodies as they had found them in their

preparations. The reasons for looking upon them as parasites were briefly

1. The cell-growth, which is the fundamental change in cancer, is quite ana-

logous to the changes produced in animal tissues by known parasites. 2. They

                                                                                       ' UntersucTixm/jen iiher den Krehs, Jena, 1893.

have a clearly defined outline and structure, which difler from those of tissue-cells
and their nuclei; they are differently affected by stains. 3. Several observers,
and among them one of the present authors (Dr. Cattle *), have pubUshed descrip-
tions of what they consider to be a sporing process on the part of the ' parasite.'
4. They are found most abundantly where the disease is active and spreading
not where it has died out, and been replaced by scar-like connective tissue.
5. Drs. Ruffer and Soudakewitch report they have seen the parasite moving and

dividing on the warm stage.

     The authors concluded by expressing the opinion that by further observation
and experiment, the protozoon of cancer might in time become an established
fact. The Paper was illustrated by lantern slides.

2. On the Wings cf Arch^opteryx and of other Birds.
                   By C. Herbert Hurst.

The slender hind limbs, the small pelvis, the weak vertebral column made up

of amphicoelous vertebrae, and the presence in the fore limb of long, slender,

clawed fingers, admirably adapted for climbing in trees, justify the view that

Archceopteryx was a quadruped using the free fingers of the fore limb much as

the corresponding free fingers of the Pterosauria may have been used, and as the

fingers of the ' flying ' squirrels and phalangers, and of Galeopithecus, and as the

thumbs of a bat, are undoubtedly used.

These three slender digits of the wing of Archceopteryx would, however, be

useless for such a purpose if the seven large primary quills were attached to them

as usually described, and the quills themselves would be useless if so attached ; for

the three slender fingers are far too weak, especially at the joints, to withstand the

torsional stress to which they would be exposed in flight if the quills were attached

Ato them.  single stroke of the wing would twist those fingers off" at the joints.

Such an attachment, indeed, would render both the fingers and the wings useless.

Comparison of the wing of ArcJueopteryx with the dissected wing of an

ordinary bird suggests the position and size and form of bones which would be

adequate to support the primary quills of Arehmopteryx, Of these bones Owen

figured two metacarpals and a very large carpal bone, and their equivalents have

never been exposed in the Berlin specimen.

In the Berlin specimen, however, the presence of those bones is indicated, and

they may even be made out in part in a photograph. The anterior (or preaxial)

border of the wing from the carpal angle to the tip of the primary quills forms a

Abold curve which passes under the three slender fingers.  faint depression

behind and parallel to the same fingers indicates roughly the hinder border of the

group of bones and ligaments. The slender fingers not only do not contribute to

the support of the wing, they do not even lie in the wing at all, but upon its

feather-clad surface. The position of the three fingers and the numbers of

phalanges (2, 3, and 4 respectively) which they possess show these to be the
digits I., II., and III. of the normal pentadactyle limb, and there is hardly room for

--doubt that two fingers still lie buried in the Berlin slab fingers which supported

the primary quills, which were the equivalents of the two large digits partially

exposed in the London specimen, and were also the homologues of the two large

digits of an ordinary bird's wing. These were of course IV. and V., and therefore

the two large digits of an ordinary bird's wing are IV. and V., and the 'ala

spuria ' is all that remains of the other three.

Well-known arguments against the descent of birds from pterodactyls rest

upon the assumption that the two large digits are II. and III., and hence collapse

if the interpretation above suggested be accepted.

   3. On the Sensory Canal System of Fishes. By Walter E. Collinge.

    The importance of that system of sensoiy organs in fishes known as the sensory

canal, lateral lines, &c., system has not yet been sufficiently estimated, and the

absence of any recent systematic investigation has led me to give some attention

to the same.

    Its important bearing upon general morphology may be grouped under three

headings :

     (i.) The important modifications that its presence has effected in the cranial and

other bones of the skull.

     (ii.) The modifications in the cranial nerves.
     (iii.) The evidence of the evolution of a series of sensory organs.

    My investigations have been chiefly carried out upon Ganoids, the more important

--results of which are summarised below.
      In Polypterits
     1. There is a complete absence of dendriform branches, and also of any openings
corresponding to primitive pores. In these two features it agrees with the more

highly specialised Ganoids.

     2. The connection of the operculo-mandibular branch with the main canal is
established contrary to the statements of Traquair, Allis, and Pollard, though not
in the manner figured by Wiedersheim.

     3. The presence of a canal traversing the series of lateral canal bones, and of

another running across the cheek-plate, also a rudimentary one in the preoper-

culum.

     4. The distinctness of the preoperculum hitherto considered as doubtful by both
Huxley and Traquair.

  --In Lepidosteus

     1. The presence of a system of dendritic branches which, passing ofi'from the

main canal, anastomose and form a dense network, which resembles in many points

that found in the Selachia.

     2. The absence of any branching on the lateral canal.
     3. The presence of a preorbital commissure, not previously described as occur-

ring in the Ganoids, and a prenasal commissure.
     4. The distinctness of the preoperculum, termed by Parker interoperculum.

    From further investigations, not yet completed, we may state that
     1. The canal system in the Elasmobranchs approaches in many points the

condition found in the Selachoid Ganoids, both in the course of the canals,
branches, sensory organs, &c., and in the branching of the lateral canal and in the

distribution of the cranial nerves.

     2. It seems very probable that the numerous sensory organs that have been
described can be reduced to three or four, which are really only stages in the

evolution of a sense-capsule.

4. On the Starch of the Chlorophyll-granule, and the Chemical Processes
    involved in its Dissolution and Translocation. By Horace T. Brown,

     F.B.S.

     Important advances have been made of late years in our knowledge of the
carbohydrates and of the transformations which some of them undergo when they
are acted upon by various enzymes or soluble ferments. The work described in
this paper was an attempt by the author and his colleague, Dr. G. H. Morris, to
apply the experience gained by a long acquaintance with the carbohydrates to the
elucidation of some of the metabolic processes at work in green leaves.

     They have been able to throw some new light upon the chemical and physio-

logical processes involved in the formation of autochthonous starch, the first visible

product of assimilation in the chloroplasts, have succeeded in explaining the mode
of dissolution of this starch within the plant cell, and have demonstrated the nature
of the wandering metabolites intermediate between the starch and the formation of
new tissue. Full details of most of the results and of the methods employed will be
found in the ' Journal of the Chemical Society,' 1893, p. 604. (See also ' Annals

of Botany,' vol. vii. p. 271.)

In applying this method to a critical examination of the intiuence of surrounding

conditions on the formation of leaf-starch, precautions have to be taken to arrest

the vitality of the leaf at the moment of its separation from the plant.
    The results of many varied experiments point consistently to the conclusion

that starch is not an essential link in the chain of chemical products begiuDing with
the inorganic materials, carbon dioxide and water, and ending with the form in

which the assimilated material passes out of the leaf. No proof, direct or indirect,
could be obtained of that rapid building up and breaking down of the starch which

must be going on in every assimilating cell of starch-producing plants, if all the

metabolites of a carbohj'drate nature have to pass through the form of starch.

It appears almost certain that the deposition of starch within the chloroplast is

governed by the same laws as those which regulate its deposition in the amyloplast

of non-assimilating cells, and that this is primarily conditioned by the rate at which

the soluble carbohydrates are supplied to the cell. Starch is only deposited in the

chloroplasts or amyloplasts when the supply of this soluble material is greater than

the local requirements of the individual cell, or its immediate powers of trans-

location.

"When leaves are placed under conditions favourable for the depletion of their

starch, the starch grains which are embedded in the chloroplast of the stomatic
guard-cells are very much more stable than those of the palisade-cells or of the

spongy parenchyma. This is due to the comparative physiological isolation of the

guard-cells, an isolation brought about by the more or less complete cuticularisa-

tion of their walls, by their slight lateral attachment to the cells of the epidermis,

and by the fact that they have no immediate connection with the mesophyll and

the conducting sheaths surrounding the vascular bundles. The guard-cells, in fact,

do not belong to the general republic of the assimilating cells of the parenchyma,

but are autonomous. By the aid of their chloroplasts, which are always present,

they assimilate only for themselves ; and, on the other hand, when the conditions

of illumination render assimilation no longer possible, the carbohydrate which they

have stored up in the form of starch is only drawn upon for their own individual

requirements, and is not passed into the stem, as are the products of dissolution of

the starch formed in the parenchyma.

    When it is considered how important it is to the plant that these guard-

cells should be kept in a high state of working efficiency, and no matter what the

variations in illumination maj' be, the advantages derived from the isolation and

autonomous nature of these cells are very apparent.

   A great number of experiments were made in order to determine the mechanism

by which the starch is redissolved in the living cell of the leaf parenchyma, and

rendered available for the requirements of the plant. It was found, notwithstand-

ing the statements of AVortmaun to the contrary, that leaves always contain far

more diastase within their tissue than is necessary for the complete dissolution of

Athe starch at any time present.  method was devised for the relative determina-

tion of the amount of this enzyme in the leaf, and the results of a great number of

such determinations were given.

The leaves of the leguminosse are pre-eminently rich in this enzyme, those of

Fisian sativum having a diastatic activity equal to from one-half to one-third that

of an average barley-malt.

The full diastatic efl'ect of leaves is onlv apparent when the tissue, previously

dried at a low temperature, is brought into actual contact with the starch solution.
Mere infusions of the leaf are not \ ery active, and if it contains any considerable
amount of tannin, which is sometimes the case (e.ff., Hop, and Hydrocharis
mvvsus-rancB), the leaf infusion has no hydrolytic action at all on starch, owing to
the enzyme having been prevented from going into solution by the tannin.

     The products of the hydrolysis of starch under the action of leaf-diastase have
been carefully studied, and ai-e found to be identical with those formed under simi-

lar conditions by malt-diastase.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                  813

In a living plant, placed under favourable conditions, the starch of the chloro-

plasts disappears with much greater rapidity than it does if the leaf has been

previously treated by some method which arrests the vitality of its cells, but does

not affect the activity of the contained diastase. At first sight this fact, upon

which Wortmann lays great stress, seems to negative the idea that the dissolution

of the starch is due to hydrolysis by diastase. Recent experiments carried out by

the author and his colleague have, however, convinced them that the action on

the starch is really conditioned by the diastase, but that the action is enhanced

and rendered continuous by the ability of the living elements of a cell to seize

upon the chemical products of hydrolysis, and to remove them from the sphere of

action by passing them into adjoining cells.

The amount of diastase present in leaf-cells is found to be subject to periodic

fluctuations. Like the fluctuations in the amount of starch, those of diastase

appear to be governed by the intensity of illumination. The conditions, however,

which are favourable to a decrease of starch are just those which are favourable

to an increase of diastase, and vice versa ; so that we find more diastase

in a leaf during the night than during the day. This variation really appears

to depend upon the rate of nutrition of the cells. Whilst these are sup-

plied with an abundance of material in the form of freshly assimilated

sugars they elaborate little or no diastase, but when the supply of these sugars

falls oft' diastase is secreted for the purpose of dissolving the excess of carbohydrate

which has been stored up as starch. The secretion of diastase by the leaf-cell, and,

in fact, by every starch-containing cell, is a phenomenon of partial starvation, and
AIS necessary for the autophagy of the cell.
                                              precisely similar phenomenon had

been previously observed during the germination of certain endospermous seeds.^

This is a principle which will probably be found of general application to all cases
of secretion of enzymes both by animal and vegetable organisms.

     Certain experiments are then discussed which were planned with a view to
ascertain the nature of the sugars existing in the leaf, their variations in amount
at difierent periods, and the relation which each sugar bears on the one hand to
the first product of assimilation, and on the other to the starch deposited within
the chloroplasts. The leaves of Tropmolum inajus were selected for this portion

of the inquiry.

     The only sugars which could be detected in any quantity were cane-sugar,

dextrose, levulose, and maltose. Only mere traces of the pentoses could be found.
     The results yielded by a study of the quantitative variations in the amount of

the sugars and starch of leaves, when these have been placed under determinate
conditions, are decidedly opposed to the view that either dextrose or levulose is the

first sugar formed in the assimilative processes. Cane-sugar appears to be the first

distinctly recognisable carbohydrate which is formed. There is every reason to

believe that this cane-sugar, which may be regarded as the starting-point of all

the metabolic changes taking place in the leaf, accumulates in the cell-sap of the

leaf parenchyma when assimilation is proceeding vigorously. When the concen-

tration passes beyond a certain point starch commences to be elaborated by the
chloroplasts at the expense of the cane-sugar. This starch forms a more stable
reserve substance than the cane-sugar itself, and is drawn upon when the more

readily metabolised cane-sugar has been partially used up.

             5. On Ci/tological Differences in Momologous Organs.
                         By Professor G. GiLSON, of Louvain.

    Remarkable differences may be detected in the minute structure of certain
organs which are considered as unquestionably homologous ; and it would not be
without interest to know to what extent these differences may lead the morphologist

to modify his views as to this homology.

   A striking instance of such differences is found amongst the nephridia or

segmental organs.

                ' Cf. Brown and Morris, Jour, of Chem. Sac, 57 (1890), p. 458.
814 REPOET-- 1893.

The nepbridium of certain beings is an epithelial tube, the lumen of which

owes its origin to the disjunction of the cells. This is the case with the vertebrate

and other forms.

     In other beings, as for instance the leeches, the organ is not really epithelial, if

we give this word its original and etymological signification. It consists of an
aggregation of cells with no disjunctive cavity whatever. All the lumma it

possesses run through the body of the cells, and thus are wz)!;-acellular ductules,
as Professor Lang was the first to remark long ago. In Clepsine, for instance, the
whole organ consists of a single row of cells, with three separate canals running

through it. These canals end in the upper part of this row of cells by spreading

into a bunch of tiny ramifications creeping in the cytoplasm (fig. 1, i.d.).
     In Hirudo the structure is a little more complicated by the fact that a sheath

of cells surrounds the central canal. Tlie cytoplasm of these cells contains a

number of ramified ductules uniting from cell to cell, and opening at certain places

into the central duct. The wall of this latter always shows in a transverse section,

only as one single cell ; that is to say, that its lumen is also an intracellular cavity.

    It may be remarked that I do not take the usual diagrams of the nephridium

as ordinarily given according to the observations of Bourne, Schultze, and others,

but the somewhat different one lately given by Bolsius. I know that Bolsius's

diagrams have been criticised by Mr. Bourne, of Madras. Nevertheless, I cannot
help considering his views as much more nearly correct than those generally

accepted. It is to be hoped that Bolsius will soon give some explanations about

his disagreement from Mr. Bourne's descriptions.

    Besides, be these diagrams accepted or not, we may remarlc that, whilst in

vertebrates and other forms the nephridium is epithelial, and its lumen inter-

cellular, i.e., disjunctive, in the leeches, on the contrary, the organ is not epithelial,

and its lumen is not disjunctive, but always intracelhdar.

    It seems to me that differences of this character have a certain importance,

at least for the evolutionist, for they imply coiTesponding differences in the pro-

cesses of histogenesis.

The homology of the excretory organs of the different groups of animal forms

Weis, indeed, still uncertain.  do not exactly know which are homogenetic and which

simply hoitioplastic, to use two excellent terms proposed by Professor Ray Lankester.

Every kind of information about them should be taken into consideration, and it is

desirable that a minute cytological survey of the nephridia should be canied out

through all groups.

But whatever may be the residts of these investigations, I do not believe that

such differences as those I have been speaking of could ever be regarded as a real

objection against the homology, nor even against the homogeny, between the

nephridia belonging to various animal groups.

    If we admit, as I believe we must in the hypothesis of evolution, that the non-

epithelial state was primary, there is no theoretical difficulty in considering the

passage to the epithelial state as the result of a cellular division, which took place
at a given moment of the phylogenetic evolution. The vanishing, or better the

non-developing, of the internal ductules must then be considered as a second stage

of the evolution.

    An interesting confirmation of this opinion lies in the fact that two stages of a

similar evolution are found as actual dispositions in other organs, which are, I

believe, undoubtedly homogenetic, i.e., the silk glands of insects. I have been

engaged in the study of these organs for some time, and found them built on the

same plan in four orders, viz., neuroptera, lepidoptera, diptera, and hymenoptera.
They consist of two tubes uniting in the head, to form a single canal opening on

the inferior lip of the larva. Each of these glandular tubes ordinarily consists of a
small number of cells ; it is quite common to find only two cells in a transverse

section (fig. 3').

    But if we examine a similar section of the gland in a peculiar family of
hymenoptera, the tenthredinida, we observe a very remarkable difference the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

addition to that, two series of spheroidal cells are attached to the sides. Each

   of these cells contains a system of tiny canals running ttrough their cytoplasm
   (fig. 2', i.d.). These cells are the secreting elements ; they continually cast the silk

   substance into the tuhe.

       If we suppose that the silk gland was originally composed of a single row of
   cells, like the nephridium of the leeches, these two difterent structures of the silk
   glands may be regarded as corresponding to the two stages of the evolution which

   I have hypothetically indicated for the nephridium.
        (a.) In the case of tenthredinida, the primary cells, after having divided several

   times in the course of evolution, have been disjoined from one another in such a

   way that some of them compose the wall of an epithelial excretory canal, and some
   others remain as appendages to that wall. The first have lost their mternal

   ductules, the second keep them still, and are the silk-producing elements.

         (b.) In the case of a simple tubular gland, as that of lepidoptera, the cells hove
   not only divided and separated from one another, but have all lost their internal
   ductules, and secrete through their inner face only.

       Now, although I give all this as mere supposition, it is desirable to know
   whether there exists or not among the uephridia any disposition corresponding to

--816 REPOET 1893.

the tenthredinian type of silk glands, -which is composed of a central epithelial duct,

together with several elements containing still intracellular ductules.

It seems to me that the existence of these two types of structure in organs so

undoubtedly homogenetic as the silk glands of insects shows that there is no

argument against the homology of the nephridia of the leeches with those of other

forms, either lower or higher, in the fact that the cavities of one set are intra-

cellular, those of the other intercellular.

     At all events, the chief object of this communication is to show : (1) that
cytological and histological diiferences, radical as they may be, must not always

be considered as a final objection to the homogenetic relations between homologous

organs                                   (2) that  these ditferences deserve, however, to be taken into consideration,
                                      ;

and that some interesting researches might be undertaken in that direction.

        6. On Karyokinesis in the Fungi. By Hakold Wager, F.L.S.

     Numerous observations have been made on nuclear division in the fungi which
tend to show that in this group, as in the higher plants, it is indirect. In most
cases, however, the observations seem to indicate that the division is very much

simpler than in the higher plants.
     Sadebeck and Fisch in Exoascus, and IJartog in Saprolegnia, have described a

simple nuclear division in which the chi'oniatic portion of the nucleus divides into
two more or less equal parts. The author has described, in Peronospora, the

division of the nucleus as taking place byj the production, in the first place, of

a number of chromosomes, which divide intlo two groups, each of which becomes
a daughter nucleus. The division of the nucjleus in these cases is certainly simpler,

so far as the observations at present are con(|erned, than those in the higher plants.

     At the Cardiff" Meeting of the Association, however, the author described the

structure of the nucleus, and the process of nuclear division in Agaricus stercorarius,
and pointed out that not only had the nucleus p structure closely resembling that
of the higher plants, but also that the nuclear division more nearly resembles that
of the latter, inasmuch as a distinct equatorial plate and apparent spindle figure
were formed.

     More recently Rosen has described nuclear division among the Hymenomycetes
in species other than those examined by the author. It wUl be useful to summarise
briefly his results. According to him the nucleus possesses a distinct membrane,
nucleolus, and homogeneous nuclear thread or threads. In the process of division
the thread or threads divide up into a number of short pieces ; then a separation
of these into two groups takes place, both nucleolus and nuclear membrane persist-
ing. The nucleus then divides into two halves ; the nucleolus disappears, and two
new nucleoli appear, one in each nucleus. Rosen concludes therefore that the
division is a very simple one, and generalises thus for all the fungi. His results
do not agree with the author's described prior to the appearance of his paper,

except in the fact that the nucleolus persists for a long time.

     Lister's beautiful observations on division of the nucleus in the Myxomycetes
do not support Rosen's generalisation, for according to the former a distinct spindle
figure is formed, and the process of division closely resembles that which takes place

in the higher plants, except, perhaps, in the longitudinal splitting of the threads,

which has not yet been seen,
      Gjurasin has very recently published a paper on nuclear division in the Asci of

Peziza vesiculosa, in which he shows that not only is a spindle figure produced,
but that even the protoplasmic radiations at the poles of the spindle are visible.

He notes here, also, the extraordinary persistence of the nucleolus.

     The observations recently made by the author on certain species of the Agari-
cinese, Agaricus {Stropharia) stercoranus and A7nanita muscarius all tend to show
that we are dealing with precisely the same changes in the indirect division of the
nucleus as in those of the higher plants. The nucleus consists of a membrane,
nuclear network, and nucleolus ; the network is composed either of a single thread
or more than one : it consists of a ground substance, which stains light blue, in
which more deeply stained granules are embedded. The nucleus takes up a con-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

granules run together and give these pieces a homogeneous appearance. The mem-

brane gradually becomes more and more indistinct, especially at the upper end of

the nucleus ; the nuclear threads group themselves at this point and form an equatorial

plate, they become shorter and thicker and now stain bright red instead of blue

the nucleolus persists all this time, but has been gradually getting fainter ; the

Achromosomes at the same time becoming bright red.  nuclear spindle now

appears ; it consists of a few threads, the exact number of which could not be made
out ; and in Stropharia stercorarius, but not so clearly in Amanita muscarim, a

deeply stained dot (centrosome ?) can be made out at each pole of the spindle.
The chromosomes now divide into two groups, which begin to move along the

spindle to the poles. The nucleolus has by this time almost entirely disappeared.

When the chromosomes reach the poles of the spindle they become condensed into

Atwo irregular masses which stain red.  nuclear membrane then appears around

each, and from these red masses threads apparently radiate more or less regularly.

The nuclei then increase in size, a new nucleolus appears in each, and a distinct
network is formed, so that the nuclei now resemble the original nucleus of the

basidium. Then these two nuclei begin to divide, the process being exactly

similar to the original division, and four nuclei are produced, one for each spore of

the basidium.

    7. On Variation of Fecundity in Trifolium pratense and its varieties

                    and Trifolium medium. Bij William Wilson.

   --Trifolium pratense. Purple Clover is known as heing prolific in seeds. While

there exist several varieties of it, caused perhaps by the peculiar conditions under
which each exists, such as the soil, none of these varieties is so good a seed-
producer as the normal type, as far as is known.

     The most important variety, supposed by some to be a hybrid between Purple
Clover and Zigzag Clover, and known as Trifolium perenne, Perennial Red, and
as the Cowgrass of commerce, has the commercial value of its seeds higher than
those of Purple Clover on account of the weakness in seed-producing. Although
the plants may yield as many flowers, the seed is deficient, while it has a more

penetrating root.

     Touching next upon Trifolium medium, Zigzag Clover or Cowgrass of botany,
I find from observations on plants in an endigenous state, and by transplanting,
that the seeds are very few in number.

     There is a form of Trifolium, which diifers in characters from all the forms

mentioned, which I call Perennial Meadow Clover, which is an abundant seed-

producer in its endigenous condition.

                       By R. J. Hauvky Gibson, M.A., F.L.S.

     After reference to the existing literature on the subject, the author drew
attention to the difference of opinion on the nature and mode of deposit of the
brown substance contained in the cells of the inner cortex of Tynesipteris tannen^is

(Bernh.) and other species. He supports the view held by Bertrand and Dangeard

that the substance is deposited in the cell wall, not in the cell cavity, and showed
that by means of suitable reagents and care in manipulation, the presence of both

tannin and iron could be demonstrated in the deposit. He suggested the possi-

bility of the tannate of iron having been absorbed from the roots of the tree ferns
on which Tmesipteris is probably not an epiphyte but a parasite. Evidence was
also adduced that there exists in the stem and rhizome of Tmesipteris a true

9. Cn Idme Salts in relation to some Physiological Processes in the Plant.
                                     By Dr. J. Clakk.

     The seeds of many Alpine and other plants when germinating at a low tempe-

rature are incapable of utilising their reserve food-supplies to any great extent,
unless there be 1 to 15 per cent, of carbonate of lime present in the soil, the

quantity varying with different species. When germination takes place at a low

temperature, say 5° C, on a soil where the carbonate of lime falls below the

necessary minimum, the seedlings perish. When seeds of the same species

germinate at a temperature varying from 15° 0. to 30° C. in a soil poor in lime,
nearly the whole of the reserve food-supply is utilised, and if subsequently removed
to a more congenial temperature, the seedlings continue to grow in a normal
manner. Either lime or a high temperature is therefore necessary for the trans-
 location of material from the seed to the growing parts of the seedling. The
varyiiig amount of carbonate of lime present in the soil must consequently be a
 powerful factor in determining the local distribution of plants.

      In connection with the occurrence and distribution of lime salts in the living
 plant, the author has been led to the conclusion that the disappearance in the

spring of the calcium oxalate accumulated in the bark of many trees during the
previous autumn is probably due to the activity of certain bacteria. These bacteria

 are capable under favourable conditions of converting calcium oxalate into calcium
 carbonate, and are found in the early spring associated with the cells in which the
 oxalate is stored.

 10. On the development of the ' Ovipositor ' in the Cockroach (Periplaueta
                        orientaiis). By Professor A. Denny.

      It is well known that in the adult female of this familiar insect the abdomen
 is possessed of only seven sterna, while in the male we find nine well developed.
 That the two missing sterna in the female are represented by the ' ovipositor ' has
 long been known, but up to the present time their development does not appear to

have been completely worked out. An examination of a complete series of prepara-

tions has brought to light several new facts which necessitate a revision of the

 usually accepted views concerning the morphology of this organ. In the first
 stage (recently hatched) the abdomen presents nine sterna similarly developed in
 both sexes, and in each case the terminal sternum is characterised by a pair of
 unjointed ' styles ' (a ieature peculiar to the male in the adult). The ninth sternum
 at this stage shows a posterior median cleft, which in subsequent stages deepens
 and widens until the body of the sternum is almost divided into separate halves.
 In an early stage of development tvro pairs of simple unjointed appendages (the
 gouapophyses) appear in connection with the eighth and ninth sterna. The ap-
 pendages of the ninth sternum at first lie upon its dorsal surface and are not visible
 from the exterior, but are afterwards brought into view by tlie division of the
 sternum. The separated halves of the ninth sternum by degrees assume an appen-
 dage-like outline, and eventually become the so-called outer pair of 'posterior
 gouapophyses.' Thus, in the ovipositor of the adult the three pairs of appendages
 are not homologous (as generally supposed), there being a pair of anterior gona-
 pophyses and a pair of posterior (inner) gouapophyses which originate as appen-
 dages of the eighth and ninth sterna respectively, while the so-called 'outer' posterior
 gouapophyses have a diiferent origin, being formed by metamorpliosis of the ninth
 sternum. The eighth sternum gradually diminishes in size up to the final stage,
 where it is represented by little more than the small median plate which supports
  the spermatheca (which has hitherto been regarded as representing the ninth
  sternum), and a pair of plates upon which rest the anterior gouapophyses,
  generally described as basal joints of these appendages. Further, the thin plate
  which carries the aperture of the uterus is not the eighth sternum (as usually
  supposed), but originates as a fold of the intersternal membrane between segments
  seven and eight.

                     Section E.-- GEOGRAPHY.

President of the Sectioh---Henry Seebohst, Sec.E.G.S., F.L.S., F.Z.S.

                          TRVRSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

The President delivered the following Address :

                                                                      [PLATE v.]

Geography, the child of Mathematics and Astronomy, stands in the relation of
mother to half a dozen other sciences, which have long- ago left the parental roof to

establish sections of their own. Like every other science, geography is so closely

connected with, and dependent on, its allied sciences that it is impossible to treat

of the one without invading the province of the others. No one supposes that

the making of maps is the whole duty of the geographer. The accurate delineation

of the trend of coast-lmes, the courses of rivers, the heights of mountains, the
depths of seas, or the position of towns is only the skeleton which underlies the

real science of geography.

    The study of geography may be divided into various section.^, but it must always

be remembered that they dovetail into each otlier, as well as into the allied sciences,

to such an extent that no hard-and-fast line can be drawn between them. The

object of dividing so comprehensive a section as that of geography into sub-sections
is more practical than scientific. The classification of facts is an important aid to
memory, and introduces order into what might otherwise seem to be a chaos of
knowledge.

The foundation of all geography is exploration ; but before the traveller can do
good geographical work he must acquire the necessary knowledge embraced in the

science of cartography. This includes a practical acqtiaintance with the various

instruments used in making a survey, the necessary mathematical and astronomical

knowledge required for their use, and a familiarity with the accepted mode of

expressing the geographical facts that may be acquhed on a chart or map.
Exploration may then be undertaken with some chance of ultimate success, but

the object of exploration must be something more than the filling up of blanks in
            Many
our maps.                                            other  subjects  must  receive  attention,  subjects which  are
           _

collectively mcluded in the term physical geography, but which require treatment

under different heads. Of these the most obvious is the geographical distribution

of light and heat, as well as the more fitful alternations of wind and rain with
calm
      and  drought                                   in  other words, the   numerous  causes     which  combine  to
                                                  ;

produce climate. Meteorology or climatology, the geography of the air, is a most

important branch of geography in general ; and when we come to inquire into the

changes which have taken place in the climate of different parts of the earth's

surface, especially those which have afiected the Polar Basin, we enter upon a
subject which has claimed a large share of the attention of geologists, who have
also made a profound study of the geographical distribution of the various kinds
of rock which are found on the crust of the earth. Another sub-section of great

importance is the geographical distribution of organic life. The geographical

ranges of the species and genera, both of plants and animals, have become a subject

of vastly increased importance since so much attention has been directed to the

                                                                                                        3G2

theory of evolution, and the paramount importance of the human race is so great
that ethnological geography may fairly claim to be treated as a sub-section apart
from the study of the rest of the fauna of a country. Inasmuch as a map with,

the towns left out is onl}' half a map, the geographer cannot afford to neglect the-

races of men with which he comes in contact, nor the remains (architectural or

otherwise) which existing nations have produced or past races have left behind
them.

     I propose on the present occasion to elaborate these subjects at greater detail,
and, with your permission, to take the Polar Basin as an example.

     There is only one Polar Basin ; the relative distribution of land and water and
the geographical distribution of light and heat in the Arctic region is absolutelv"

unique. In no other part of the world is a similar climate to be found. The-
distribution of land and water round the South Pole is almost the converse of that

round the North Pole. In the one we have a mountain of snow and ice cover-

--ing it may be a continent, it may be an archipelago, but in any case a lofty

mass of congealed water surrounded by an ocean stretching away with very little
interruption from land to the confines of the tropics. In the other we have a
basin of water surrounding a comparatively flat plain of pack ice, some of which
is probably permanent (the so-called palneocrystic sea), but most of which is
driven hither and thither in summer by winds and currents, and is walled in by
continental and island barriers broken only by the narrow outlets of Behring Strart
and Baffin's Bay and the broader gulf which leads to the Atlantic Ocean, and
even that interrupted by Iceland, Spitzbergen, and Franz Josef Land. AVben ws
further remember that this gulf is constantly conveying the hot water of the
tropics to the Arctic Ocean, and that every summer gigantic rivers are pouring
volumes of comparatively warm water into this ocean, we cannot but admit that
the climatic conditions near the two poles differ widely from each other.

    In looking at a map of the Polar Basin one cannot help remarking the curious

fact that the North Pole is so very nearly central, and a glance at the southern
hemisphere also shows a rough sort of symmetry in the distribution of land and
water round the South Pole. It is a curious coincidence if this be only accident.

     The history of the

                                                     EXPLORATION

of the Polar Basin is a very long and a very tragic story. Mucli has been done,

but much remains to do. The unexplored regions of the Polar Basin may be

estimated at a million square miles. No part of the world presents greater

difficulties to the explorer. Many brave men have perished in the enterprise, and

more have only just succeeded in passing through the ordeal of hunger and cold

with their lives. For the most part the heroic endurance of the tortures of famine

has shown a marvel of discipline, though occasionally the commanders of thfr

expeditions have had to enforce obedience to the verge of cruelty, both in the case

of men and of dogs. There are, indeed, a few ghastly stories of mutinous men

who have been shot, and of cases where it has been found necessary to resort
to human food to save the lives of the survivors, but the records of Arctic

exploration are records of which any nation might be proud.

Of recent years there has been but little done to explore the unknown parts of

the Polar Basin. Adventurous journeys in Central Africa and Central Asia have

somewhat eclipsed the exploration of the Arctic regions. Two visits to Greenland

cannot, however, be entirely passed by in silence. In the summer of last year an

expedition went to the north of Greenland under the command of Lieutenant

Peary, succeeded in reaching latitude 82°, and added material evidence to prove

that Greenland is an island. The expedition sailed on June 6, 1891, steamed up

Baffin's Bay and Smith's Sound, and on July 25 dismissed the ship and established

themselves in winter quartecs in McCormick Bay, on the north side of Murchison

Sound, in latitude 78°. They laid in a stock of game for the winter, guillemots and

Areindeer.  most interesting proof of the successful organisation of the expedition

is the fact that Mrs. Peary was one of the party, and was able to accompany her

husband on his sledge trip which started on the 18th of the following April.

     It took them a week in their dog sledges to round Inglefield Gulf, during
which they discovered thirty glaciers, teu of them of tlie first magnitude. During

the next three months they explored the north coast of Greenland, as far east as
longitude 34° W., when a great bay was reached which they named Independence

Bay, as they discovered it on July 4. The northern shore of this bay was free
from snow and ice. On August 6 they regained their winter quarters in McCormick
Bay. On the 8th the steamer arrived, and on the 24th they started for home,

reaching Philadelphia on September ti3. During the sledge journey they travelled

 for a fortnight at an average elevation of 8,000 feet above the sea. Besides their

important additions to the map of Greenland, the suggestive fact that the

thermometer can rise to 41° F., and torrents of rain can fall in the middle of
February as far north as latitude 78°, must be regarded as a valuable discovery.

      It was hardly to be expected that so successful a journey should not be followed
by a second attempt in order to follow up the discoveries of the first. Peary has
already started for the north of Greenland with a more carefully organised stafi'

for a longer expedition. They expect to be absent two years or more. It has

been arranged to spend the coming winter not far from their previous quarters.
In March they hope to start for Independence Bay, which was discovered on the

previous expedition, and there the party will divide, with the object of completing

the survey of the coast line of Greenland by reaching Cape Bismarck if possible,
a'ad at the same time to explore the northern coast line of Independence Bay,

hoping that it may land them further north than the highest point yet reached by

any Arctic traveller.

     In the summer of 1888 Dr. Nansen was bold enough to cross the continent of

Greenland about latitude 64°, reaching an altitude of 9,000 feet, and he told his

story to this Section in his own simple words on his return. The distance across
was about ten degrees, and the highest point was about one-third of the way across
from the east coast. If the scientific results were necessarily somewhat meaore, Dr.
Nansen established a reputation for bravery and physical endurance which he hopes
to increase by an attempt to reach the North Pole. The ' Fram ' has already

started from Hammerfest, and was telegraphed a few weeks ago from the east
coast of Norway. The intention is to enter the Kara Sea and to push northwards

and eastwards, hoping that the warm currents caused by the great Siberian rivers

will enable them to get well into the ice before winter begins. Once frozen into
the pack ice, Nansen hopes to be carried by the currenTs somewhere near the
North Pole, and, after drifting for two or three years, he hopes finally to emerge
from his ice prison somewhere on the east coast of Greenland. Foolhardy as the

·expedition appears, it is nevertheless planned with great skill, and its chances of

success are supposed to be based upon a sufiiciently accurate knowledge of the
ocean currents of the Polar Basin.

     Thebe currents, so far as they are known, are very interesting. The Mackenzie
and the great Siberian rivers fiow into the Polar Basin, and the current through
Behring Strait is supposed to do the same ; but both these sources of supply can

only be regarded as of minor importance. Between Spitzbersen and Finmark,
however, the Gulf Stream enters the Polar Basin 300 or 400 miles wide. To
compensate for these inward currents there are two outward currents, one on
each side of Greenland, which, coming from the centre of cold, do their best to

intensify the rigours of that mountainous island.

Nansen hopes that the current which carried the ' Jeannette ' from Herald

Island, north of Behring Strait, in a north-westerly direction, for 500 or 600 miles is

the same current that flows down the east coast ofGreenland, and he bases his hopes

upon three facts. First, that many articles from the wreck of the 'Jeannette' were

found on an ice floe oft" the south coast of Greenland three years afterwards
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

    We can only hope that Nansen will find the currents as favourable to his needs,

and that so much bravery may be supported by good luck.

Basin, includinof the area drained by all rivers flowing; into the Arctic Sea, may be

roughly estimated to contain about 14,000,000 square miles, of which half is land
and half water. In the coldest part of the basin the land is either glacier or tundra,
and in the warmer parts it is either forest or steppe.

and the mother of the icebergs of the Northern Atlantic, rises 9,000 or 10,000
feet above sea level, whilst the sea between that lofty plateau and Scandinavia is

the deepest known in the Polar Basin, though it is separated from the rest of the

Atlantic by a broad belt or submarine plateau connecting Greenland across Iceland
and the Faroes with the British Islands and Europe. Iceland, Spitzbergen, and
Novaya-Zemlia, the latter a continuation of the Urals, are all mountainous and full
of glaciers. The glaciers of Southern Alaska are some of the largest in the world.

The glaciers and the icebergs have a literature of their own, and we must pass
thein by to say a word or two about

                                                 THE TTTNDEA,

     The Arctic Sea, which lies at the bottom of the Polar Basin, is fringed with a
belt of bare country, sometimes steep and rocky, abruptly descending in more or
less abrupt cliff's and piles of precipices to the sea, but more often sloping gently

down in mud banks and .sand hills representing the accumulated spoils of countless

ages of annual floods, which tear up the banks of the rivers and deposit shoals of
detritus at their mouths, compelling them to make deltas in their efforts to force a

passage to the sea. In Norway this belt of bare country is called the Fjeld, in
Russia it is known as the Tundra, and in America its technical name is the Barren

Grounds. In the language of science it is the country beyond the limit of forest
growth.

      In exposed situations, especially in the higher latitudes, the tundra does really

merit its American name of barren ground, being little else than gravel beds
interspersed with bare patches of peat or clay, and with scarcely a rush or a sedge to

break the monotony. In Siberia at least this is very exceptional. By far the

greater part of the tundra, both east and west of the Ural Mountains, is a gently
undulating plain, full of lakes, rivers, swamps, and bogs. The lakes are diversified
with patches of green water plants, amongst which ducks and swans float and dive ;
the little rivers flow between banks of rush and sedge ; the swamps are masses of
tall rushes and sedges of various species, where phalaropes and ruffs breed, and the
bogs are brilliant with the white fluffy seeds of the cotton grass. The groundwork

--of all this variegated scenery is more beautiful and varied still lichens and moss of

 almost every conceivable colour, from the cream-coloured reindeer moss to the scarlet-
cupped trumpet moss, interspersed with a brilliant alpine flora, gentians, anemones,
 saxifrages, and hundreds of plants, each a picture in itself, the tall aconites, both
the blue and yellow species, the beautiful cloudberry, with its gay white blossom

and amber fruit, the fragrant Ledum paludre and the delicate "pink Andromeda

polifolia. In the sheltered valleys and deep watercourses a few stunted birches,
 and sometimes large patches of Avillow scrub, survive the long severe winter, and
serve as cover for willow grouse or ptarmigan. The Lapland bunting and red-
 throated pipit are everywhere to be seen, and certain favoured places are the

breeding grounds of snipe, plover, and sandpipers of many species. So far
from meriting the name of barren ground, the tundra is for the most part ^i

--veritable paradise in summer. But it has one almost fatal drawback it swarms

with millions of mosquitoes.
     The tundra melts away insensibly into the

but isolated trees are rare, and in Siberia there is an absence of young wood on
the confines of the tundra. The limit of forest growth appears to be retiring south-

he a temporary or local variation caused hy exceptionally severe winters. The

limit of forest growth does not coincide with the isotherms of mean annual tem-

perature, nor with the mean temperature for January nearly so closely as it does

with the mean temperature for July. It may be said to approximate very nearly

Weto the July isotherm of 53° F.  may therefore assume that a six-foot blanket

of snow prevents the winter frosts from killing the trees so long as they can be

revivified by a couple of months of summer heat above 50° F.

The limit of forest growth is thus directly determined by geographical causes.

In Alaska and in the Mackenzie Basin it extends about 300 miles above the Arctic

Circle, but in Eastern Canada the depression of Hudson's Bay acts as a vast ice-

house and the forest line falls 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, whilst on the east

coast of Labrador the Arctic current from Baffin's Bay sends it down nearly as far
again. On the other side of the Atlantic the limit of forest growth begins on tho

Norwegian coast on tke Arctic Circle, gradually lises until it reaches 200 miles

farther north in Lapland, is depressed again by the ice-house of the White Sea, but

has recovered its position in the valley of the Pechora, which is rather more than

maintained until a second vast ice-house, the Sea of Okotsk, combined with Arctic

currents, repeats the depi-ession of Labrador in Chuski Land and Kamchatka.

There are no trees on Novaya-Zemlia. Two or three species of willow grow

there, but they are dwarfs, seldom attaining a height of three inches. Novaya-

Zemlia enjoys a comparatively mild winter, the mean temperature of January,

thanks to the influence of the Gulf Stream, being 15° F. above zero in the south,

and only 5° F. below zero in the north. The absence of trees is due to the cold

summers, the mean temperature of July not reaching higher than 45° F. in the

south, whilst in the north it only reaches 38° F.

The Indians of Canada have discovered that when they want to find water in

winter it is easiest reached under thick snow, the thinnest ice on the river or lake

being found under the thickest blanket of snow. On the same principle the tree

roots defy the severe winters protected by their snow shields, but they must have

a certain temperature (above 50° F.) to hold tlieir own in summer.

The influence of the snow blanket is very marked in determining the depths to

which the frost penetrates beneath it. Thus we find that a Norwegian writer,

alluding to latitude 62°, remarks ' that the ground is frozen from one to two and a

half feet in whiter, but this depends upon how soon the snow falls. Higher up

the mountains the ground is scarcely frozen at all, owing to the snow falling sooner,

and, in fact, if the snow falls very early lower down it is scarcely frozen to any
depth.' Similar facts have been recorded from Canada in latitude 63°. ' On

this prairie land, when there is a good fall of snow when the winter sets in, the

frost does not penetrate so deep as when there is no snow till late.' Another

writer a little further south, in latitude 51°, says: ' I am safe in saying that the

frost penetrates here to an average of five feet, except when we have had a great

depth of suow in the beginning of winter, in which case it does not penetrate

nearly so far.'

It is not so easy to explain the boundary line between the forest and the

                                  STEPPE.

There are two great steppe regions in the Polar Basin, one in Asia and the other

in America. The great Barabinski steppe in South-west Siberia stretches with

but slight interruptions across Southern Russia into Bulgaria. The great prairie

region of Minnesota and Manitoba reaches the Mackenzie IJasin, and outlying plains

are found almost up to the Great Slave Lake. The cause of the treeless condition

Myof the steppes or prairies has given rise to much controversy.    own experience

in Siberia convinced me that the forests were rocky, and the steppes covered

with a deep layer of loose earth, and I came to the conclusion that on the rocky

ground the roots of the trees were able to establish themselves firmly so as to

defy the strongest gales, which tore them up when they were planted in light soil.

Other travellers have formed other opinions. Some suppose that the prairies were

once covered with trees which have been gradually destroyed by fires. Others
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  825

 suggest that tlie earth on the treeless plains contains too much salt or too little
 organic matter to be favourable to the growth of trees. No one, so far as I know,
 has suggested a climatic explanation of the circumstance. Want of drainage may
 produce a swamp and the deficiency of rainfall may cause a desert, both conditions

  being fatal to forest growth, but no one can mistake either of these treeless dis-
 tricts for a steppe or prairie. The

                                                   ANTHROPOLOGY

 of the Polar Basin presents many points of interest. On the American coasts of
 the Arctic Ocean the Eskimo lives a very similar life to the Lapp in Norway and
 the Samoyede in the tundras of Siberia. These races of men resemble each other
 very much in their personal appearance, and still more so in their habits. Their

 straight black hair, with little or no beard, their dark and obliquely set eyes, their
 high cheek bones and flat noses, and their small hands and feet testify to their
 3Iongoloid origin. They are all indebted to the reindeer for their winter dress

 and for much of their food, and they all have dogs ; but the Eskimo travel only with
 dogs, and the Lapp only with reindeer, whilst the Samoyede uses both dog sledges
 and reindeer sledges. They all lead a nomadic life, trapping fur-bearing animals
 in winter and fishing in summer ; they resemble each other in many other customs
 and beliefs, but they are nevertheless supposed to have emigrated to the Arctic
 regions from independent sources, and many characters in which they resemble

 each other are supposed to have been independently acquired.
      The various races which inhabit the Polar Basin below the limit of forest

 growth are too numerous to be considered in detail.

      Most zoologists divide the Polar Basin into two zoological regions, or, to be
 strictly accurate, they include the Old World half of the Polar Basin in what

 they call the Palsearctic region, and the New World half in the Nearctic region

 but recent investigations have shown that these divisions are unnatural and can-
 not be maintained. Some writers unite the two regions together under the name
 of the Holarctic region, whilst others recognise a circumpolar Arctic region above
 the limit of forest growth, and unite in a second region the temperate portions of
 the northern hemisphere. In the opinion of the last-mentioned writers the circum-
 polar Arctic region differs more from tlie temperate regions of the northern hemi-
sphere than the American portion of the latter does from the Eurasian portion.

      The fact is that

                                                            LIFE AEEAS,

or zoo-geographical regions, are more or less fanciful generalisations. The geo-
graphical distribution of animals, and probably also that of plants, is almost entirely
dependent upon two factors, climate and isolation, the one playing quite as im-
portant a part as the other. The climate varies in respect of rainfall and temper-
ature, and species are isolated from each other by seas and mountain ranges. The
geographical facts which govern the zoological provinces consequently range
themselves under these four heads. It is at once obvious that the influences which
determine the geographical distribution of fishes must be quite different from those
which determine the distribution of mammals, since the geographical features which
isolate the species in the one case are totally different from those which form im-

passable barriers in the other. It is equally obvious that the climatic conditions

which influence the geographical range of mammals must include the winter cold as
well as the summer heat, whilst those which determine the geographical distribution

of birds, most of which are migratory in the Arctic regions, is entirely independent

of any amount of cold which may descend upon their breeding grounds during the

months which they spend in their tropic or sub-tropic winter quarters.
     Hence all attempts to divide the Polar Basin into zoological regions or pro-

vinces are futile. Nearly every group of animals has zoological regions of its own,
determined by geographical features peculiar to itself, and any generalisations
from these different regions can be little more than a curiosity of science. The
mean temperature or distribution of heat can be easily ascertained. It is easy to
generalise so as to arrive at an average between the summer heat and the winter

cold, because they can be both expressed in the same terms. When, however, we

seek to generalise upon the distribution of animal or vegetatle life, how is it

Howpossible to arrive at a mean geographical distribution of animals ?                                                                                       many

genera of mollusks are equal to a genus of mammals, or how many butterflies are

equal to a bird ?

If there be any region of the world with any claim to be a life area, it is that

part of the Polar Basin which lies between the July isotherm of 50° or 53° F.

and the northern limit of organic life. The former corresponds very nearly with

the northern limit of forest growth, and they comprise between them the barren

grounds of America and the tundras of Arctic Europe and Siberia.

The fauna and flora of this circumpolar belt are practically homogeneous ; many

species of both plants and animals range throughout its whole extent. It consti-

tutes a circumpolar Arctic region, and cannot consistently be separated at Behring

Strait into two parts of suflicient importance to rank even as sub-regions.

Animals recognise facts, and are governed by them in the extension of their

ranges                               they care little or nothing                                                        about generalisations.  The mean temperature
                                ;

of a province is a matter of indift'ereuce to some plants and to most animals. The

facts which govern their distribution are various, and vary according to the needs

of the plant or animal concerned. To a migratory bird the mean aunual temper-

ature is a matter of supreme indiflerence. To a resident bird the question is

equally beside the mark. The facts which govern the geographical distribution of

birds are the extremes of temperature, not the means. Arctic birds are nearly

all migratory. Their distribution during the breeding season depends primarily

on the temperature of July, which must range between 53° and 35° F. It is very

important, however, to remember that it is actual temperature that governs them,

not isotherms corrected to sea level. If an Arctic bird can find a correct isotherm

below the Arctic Circle by ascending to an elevation of 5,000 or 6,000 feet

above the level of the sea, it avails itself of the opportunity. Then the region of

the Dovrefeld above the limit of forest growth is the breeding plan of many abso-

lutely Arctic birds                                                                                          but this is not nearly  so much the case  on the Alps, because
                                                                                                          ;

the cold nights vary too much from the hot days to come within the range of the

birds' breeding grounds. Here, again, the mean daily temperature is of no import-

ance. It is the extreme of cold which is the most potent factor in this case, and

no extreme of heat can counterbalance its effect.

  In estimating the                                                                                          influence  of elevation  upon  temperature  it  has been ascer-

_

tained that it is necessary to deduct about 3° F. for every thousand feet. The

are very eccentric in the Polar Basin. The mean temperature of summer is quite

independent of that of winter. The isothermal lines of July are regulated by geo-

graphical causes which do not afl'ect those of December, or operate in a contrary

direction. The Gulf Stream raises the mean temperature of Iceland during winter

mto the highest point which it reaches in the I'olar Basin, viz., 30° to 35° F., whilst

   summer it prevents it from rising above 45° and 50° F., a range of only 15°. In

the valley of the Lena in the same latitude the mean temperature of January is 55°

to 50° F. below zero, whilst that of July is C0° to 65° F. above zero, a range of 115°.

     The close proximity of the Pacific Ocean has a much less efiect on the mean

temperature at Behring Strait, which is in the same latitude as the north of Iceland.
The mean temperature for January is zero, whilst that for July is 40° F. The
mean temperature for January in the same latitude in the valley of the Mackenzie

IS 25° below zero, whilst that for July is 55° F. In this case the contrast of the

ranges is 40 and 80, which compared with 15 and 115 is small, but the geo-

graphicalconditions are not the same. Behring Sea is so protected by the Aleutian

chain of islands that very little of the warm current from Japan reaches the

straits.                             It is deflected southwards, so the Aleutian Islands form a better basis for

                                  _

comparison. Their mean temperature for January is 35° F., whilst that for July

is 50° F., precisely the same difierence as that to be found in Iceland.

The influence of geographical causes upon climate being at present so great, it

is easy to imagine that changes in the distribution of land and water may have

had an equally important influence upon the climate of the Polar Basin during the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  827

recent cold age, which p:eo]ogists call the Pleistocene period. It is impossible for

the traveller to overlook the evidences of this so-called Glacial period in the Polar

Basin, and whether we seek an explanation of the geographical phenomena from

the astronomer or the geologist, or both, it is impossible to ignore the geographical

 interest of the subject.

     No sciences can be more intimately connected than geography and

                                                            GEOLOGY.

    A knowledge of geography is absolutely essential to the geologist. To dis-

criminate between one kind of rock and another is a comparatively small part of
the work of the geologist. To ascertain the geographical distribution of the

various rocks is a study of profound interest. If the geologist owes much to the

geographer, the latter is also largely indebted to the labours of the former. The
geology of a mountain range or an extended plain is as important to the physical
geographer as the knowledge of anatomy is to the figure painter.

     The geology of the Polar Basin is not very accurately known, and the subject
 is one too vast to be more than mentioned on an occasion like the present ; "but

the evidences of a comparatively recent ice age in eastern America and western
Europe are too important to be passed by without a vrord.

     In the sub-Arctic regions of the world there is much evidence to show that the
climate has in comparatively recent times been Arctic. The present glaciers of
Central Europe were once much greater than they are now, and even in the

British Islands glaciers existed during what has been called the ice age, and the
evidence of their existence in the form of rocks, upon which they have left their
scratches and heaps of stones, which they have deposited in their retreat,

are so obvious that he who runs may read. Similar evidence of an ice age is

found in North America, and to a limited extent in the Himalayas, but in the
alluvial plains of Siberia and North Alaska, as might be expected, no trace of an
ice age can be found.

     Croll's hypothesis that an ice age is produced when the eccentricity of the

earth's orbit is unusually great has been generally accepted as the most plausible
explanation of the facts. It is assumed that during the months of perihelion
evaporation is extreme, and that during the months of aphelion the snowfall is
considerably increased. The effect of the last period of high eccentricity is supposed

to have been much increased by geographical changes. The elevation of the shallow
sea which connects Iceland with Greenland on the one hand, and the south of
Norway and the British Islands on the other, would greatly increase the accumu-
lation of snow and ice in those parts of the Polar Basin where evidence of a
recent ice age is now to be found ; whilst the depression of the lowlands on either

side of the Ural Mountains, so as to admit the waters of the Mediterranean through
the Black and Caspian Seas, might prevent any glaciation in those parts of tlie

Polar Basin where no evidence of such a condition is now discoverable. But this

is a question that must be left to the geologist to decide.
     The extreme views of the early advocates of the theory of an ice age have

been to a large extent abandoned. No one now believes in the former existence of
a Polar ice cap, and possibly when the irresistible force of ice-dammed rivers has
been fully realised, the estimated area of glaciation may be considerably reduced.
The so-called great ice age may have been a great snow age, with local centres of

glaciation on the higher grounds.

     The zoological evidence as to the nature, extent, and duration of the ice age
has never been carefully collected. The attention of zoologists has unfortunately
been too exclusively devoted to the almost hopeless task of theorising upon the

causes of evolution, instead of patiently cataloguing its effects.

     There is a mass of evidence bearing directly upon the recent changes in the
climate of the Polar Basin to be found in the study of the present geographical
distribution of birds. The absence of certain common British forest birds (some of
them of circumpolar range sub-generically, if not specifically) from Ireland and the
North of Scotland is strong confirmation of the theory that the latter countries
were not very long ago outside the limit of forest growth.
328 KEPORT-- 1893.

     The presence of species belonging to Arctic and sub-Arctic genera on many of

tte South Pacific Islands is strong evidence that they were compelled to emigrate
in search of food by some great catastrophe, such as an abnormally heavy snowfall,
and the fact that no island contains more than one species is strong evidence that
this great catastrophe has only occurred once in recent times. The occurrence of
a well-recognised line of migration from Greenland across Iceland, the Faroes,
and the British Islands to Europe is strongly suggestive of a recent elevation of

the land where the more shallow sea now extends in this locality. The extraordi-

nury similarity of the fauna and flora of the Arctic regions of the Old and New

Worlds can only be found elsewhere in continuous areas, and, had it not been for
the unfortunate division of the Arctic region into two halves, Palsearctic and
Nearctic, would have attracted much more attention than it has hitherto received.

                               THE RAINFALL

of the Polar Basin is small compared to that with which we are familiar, but its

visible efl'ects are enormous. In Arctic Europe and Siberia it is supposed to

average about thirteen inches  per annum                                                        in  Arctic America not more than nine
                                                                                             ;

inches. The secret of its power is that about a third of the rainfall descends in

the form of snow, which melts with great suddenness.

The stealthy approach of winter on the confines of the Polar Basin is in strong

contrast to the catastrophe which accompanies the sudden onrush of summer.

One by one the flowers fade, and go to seed if they have been fortunate enough to

attract by their brilliancy a bee or other suitable pollen-bearing visitor. The

birds gradually collect into flocks, and prepare to wing their way to southern

climes. Strange to say. it is the young birds of each species that set the example.

They are not many weeks old. They have no personal experience of migration,

but Nature has endowed them with an inherited impulse to leave the land of their

birth before their parents. Probably they inherit the impulse to migrate without

inheriting any knowledge of where their winter quarters are to be found, and by

what route they are to be sought. They are sometimes, if not always, accom-

panied by one or two adults, it may be barren birds, or birds whose eggs or young

have been destroyed, and who may therefore get over their autumn moult earlier

than usual, or moult slowly as they travel southwards. Of most species the adult

males are the next to leave, to be followed perhaps a week later by the adult

females. One by one the various migratory species disappear until only the few

resident birds are left, and the Arctic forest and tundra resume the silence so con-

spicuous in winter. As the nights get longer the frosts bring down the leaves

from the birch and the larch trees. Summer gently falls asleep, and winter as

gently steals a march upon her, with no wind and no snow, until the frost silently

lays its iron grip upon the river, which, after a few impotent struggles, yields to

its fate. The first and mayhap the second ice is broken up, and when the starrester

of the village sallies forth to peg out with rows of birch trees the winter road

down the river to the next village for which he is responsible, he has frequently to

deviate widely from the direct course in his eflbrts to choose the smoothest ice

and find a channel between the hummocks that continually block the way.

The date upon which winter resumes his sway varies greatly in different

localities, and probably the margin between an early and a late season is consider-

able. In 1876 Captain AViggins was frozen up in winter quarters on the Yenisei,

in latitude 6Qk°, on October 17. In 1878 Captain Palander was frozen up on the

coast 120 miles west of Behring Strait, in latitude 67 f°, on September 28.
     The sudden arrival of summer on the Arctic Circle appears to occur nearly at

the same date in all the great river basins, but the number of recorded observations

is so small that the slight variation may possibly be seasonal and not local. The

ice on the Mackenzie River is stated by one authoiity to have broken up on May 13

in latitude 62°, and by another on May 9 in latitude 67°. If the Mackenzie breaks

-- --up as fast as the Yenisei that is to say, at the rate of a degree a day an assump-
--tion which is supported by what little evidence can be found then the difference

between these two seasons would be nine days. My own experience has been that
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  829

the ice of the Pechora breaks up ten days before that of the Yenisei, but as I

have only witnessed one such event in each valley too much importance must not

be attached to the dates.

     According to the ' Challenger ' tables of isothermal lines the mean temperatures
of January and July on the Arctic Circle in the valleys of the Mackenzie and the
Yenisei scarcely ditfer, the summer temperature in each case being about 55° F.^
and that of winter -25° F., a difference of 80° F.

     On the American side of the Polar Basin summer comes almost as suddenly as

it does on the Asiatic side, but the change appears to be less of the nature of a

catastrophe. The geographical causes which produce this result are the smaller
area of the river basins and the less amount of rainfall. There is only one large
river which empties itself into the Arctic Ocean on the American side, the
Mackenzie, with which may be associated the Saskatchewan, which discharges into
Hudson Bay far away to the south. The basin of the Mackenzie is estimated at

690,000 square miles, whilst that of the Yenisei is supposed to be exactly twice

that area. The comparative dimensions of the two summer floods are still more
diminished by the difference in the quantity of snow.

     The snow in the Mackenzie basin is said to be from 2 to 3 feet deep, whilst that

in the Yenisei basin is from 5 to 6 feet deep, so that the spring flood in the latter
river must be about five times as large as that of the former.

     Another feature in which the basin of the Mackenzie differs from those of the

rivers in the Arctic regions of the Old World is the number of rapids and lakes-
contained in it. The ice in the large lakes attains a thickness at least twice as-
great as that of the rapid stream, and consequently breaks up much later. In the
Great Slave Lake the ice attains a depth of 6 to 7 feet, and even in the Athabaska
Lake, in latitude 58°, it reaches 4 feet. The rapids between these two lakes
extend for 15 miles. The ice on the river breaks up a month before that on.
the lakes, so that the drainage area of the first summer flood is much restricted.

     The arrival of summer in the Arctic regions happens so late that the inex-
perienced traveller may be excused for sometimes doubting whether it really i*

going to come at all. When continuous night has become continuous day without

any perceptible approach to spring an alpine traveller naturally asks whether he
has not reached the limit of perpetual snow. It is true that here and there a few
bare patches are to be found on the steepest slopes, where most of the snow has
been blown away by the wind, especially if these slopes face the south, where
even an Arctic sun has more potency than it has elsewhere. It is also true that

--small flocks of little birds at first snow-buntings and mealy redpoles, and later
--shore larks and Lapland buntings may be observed to flit from one of these bare

places to another looking for seeds or some other kind of food, but after all evi-
dently finding most of it in the droppings of the peasants' horses on the hard
snow-covered roads. The appearance of these little birds does not, however, give
the same confidence in the eventual coming of summer to the Arctic naturalist as
the arrival of the swallow or the cuckoo does to his brethren in sub-Arctic and sub-
tropic climates. The four little birds just mentioned are only gipsy migranta

that are perpetually flitting to and fro on the confines of the frost, continually
being driven south by snowstorms, but ever ready to take advantage of the
slightest thaw to press northwards again to their favourite Arctic home.

They are all circumpolar in their distributions, are as common in Siberia as
in Lapland, and range across Canada to Alaska as well as to Greenland. In sub-
Arctic climates we only see them in winter, so that their appearance does not in the
least degree suggest the arrival of summer to the traveller from the south.

     The gradual rise in the level of the river inspires no more confidence in the
final melting away of the snow and the disruption of the ice which supports it.
In Siberia the rivers are so enormous that a rise of 5 or 6 feet is scarcely per-
ceptible. The Yenisei is three miles wide at the Arctic Circle, and as fast as it
rises the open water at the margin freezes up again and is soon covered with
the drifting snow. During the summer which I spent in the valley of the Yenisei

we had 6 feet of snow on the ground until the first of June. To all intents

and purposes it was mid-winter, illuminated for the nonce with what amounted
--830 KEPORT 1893.

to continuous daylight. The li^ht was a little duller at midnight, but not so much

80 as duriug the occasional snowstorms that swept through the forest and drifted

up the broad river bed. During the month of May there were a few signs of the

Nowpossibility of some mitigation of the rigours of winter.  and then there

was a little rain, but it was always followed by frost. If it thawed one day

it froze the next, and little or no impression was made on the snow. Tiie
most tangible signs of coming summer was an increase in the number of birds,

but they were nearly all forest birds, which could enjoy the sunshine in the

pines and birches, and which were by no means dependent on the melting

away of the snow for their supply of food. Between May 16 and 30 we had

more definite evidence of our being within bird flight of bare grass or open

water. Migratory flocks of wild geese passed over our winter quarters, hut if

they were flying north one day they were flying south the next, proving beyond

all doubt that their migration was premature. The geese evidently agreed with

us that it ought to be summer, but it was as clear to the geese as to us that

it really was winter.

   We afterwards learnt that during the last ten days of May a tremendous

battle had been raging 600 miles as the crow flies to the southward of our

position on the Arctic Circle. Summer in league with the sun had been fighting

winter and the north wind all along the line, and had been as hopelessly beaten

everywhere as we were witnesses that it had been in our part of the river. At

length, when the final -victory of summer looked the most hopeless, a change was
made in the command of the forces. Summer entered into an alliance with the

south wind. The eiin retired in dudgeon to his tent behind the clouds, mists

obscured the landscape, a soft south wind played gently on the snow, which melted

under its all-powerful influence like butter upon hot toast, the tide of battle was

suddenly turned, the armies of winter soon vanished into thin water and beat a

hasty retreat towards the pole. The effect on the great river was magical. Its

thick armour of ice cracked with a loud noise like the rattling of thunder, every

twenty-four hours it was lifted up a fathom above its former level, broken up, first

into ice floes and then into pack ice, and marched down stream at least a hundred

miles. Even at this great speed it was more than a fortnight before the last strag-

gling ice-blocks passed our post of observation on the Arctic Circle, but during

that time the river had risen 70 feet above its winter level, although it was three

miles wide, and we were in the middle of a blazing hot summer, picking flowers of

a hundred different kinds, and feasting upon wild ducks' eggs of various species.

Birds abounded to an incredible extent. Between May 29 and June 18 I identified

sixty-four species which I had cot seen before the break up of the ice. Some of

them stopped to breed and already had eggs, but many of them followed the
retreating ice to the tundra, and we saw them no more until, many weeks after-

wards, we had sailed down the river beyond the limit of forest growth.

The victory of the south wind was absolute, but not entirely uninterrupted.

Occasionally the winter made a desperate stand against the sudden onrush of

summer. The north wind rallied its beaten forces for days together, the clouds

and the rain were driven back, and the half-melted snow frozen on the surface.

But it was too late ; there were many large patches of dark ground which rapidly
absorbed the sun's heat ; the snow melted under the frozen crust, and its final

collapse was as rapid as it was complete.

In the basin of the Yenisei the average thickness of the snow at the end of

winter is about 5 feet. The sudden transformation of this immense continent of

snow, which lies as gently on the earth as an eider-down quilt upon a bed, into an
ocean of water rushing madly down to the sea, tearing everj'thing up that comes

into its way, is a gigantic display of power compared with which an earthquake

sinks into insignificance. It is diflicult to imagine the chaos of water which must

have deluged the country before the river beds were worn wide enough and deep

enough to carry the water away as quickly as is the case now. If we take the
Lower Yenisei as an example it may be possible to form some conception of the

work which has already been done. At Yeniseisk the channel is about a mde

wide; 800 miles lower down (measuring the windings of the river), at the

village of Kureika, it is about 3 miles wide, and, following the mighty stream

for about another 800 miles down to the Brekoffsky Islands, it is nearly
6 miles wide. The depth of the channel varies from 50 to 100 feet above the

winter level of the ice. This ice is about 3 feet thick, covered with 6 feet of snow,

which becomes flooded shortly before the break up and converted into about 3 feet

of ice, white as marble, which lies above the winter blue ice. When the final crash

comes this field of thick ice is shatttered like glass. The irresistible force of
the flood behind tears it up at an average rate of 4 miles an hour, or about a
hundred miles a day, and drives it down to the sea in the form of ice floes and pack
ice. Occasionally a narrow part of the channel or a sharp bend of the river

causes a temporary check ; but the pressure from behind is irresistible, the pack ice

is piled into heaps, and the ice floes are doubled up into little mountains, which
rapidly freeze together into icebergs, which float oft' the banks as the water rises.
Meanwhile, other ice floes come up behind: some are driren into the forests, where

the largest trees are mown down by them like grass, whilst others press on until

the barrier gives way, and the waters, suddenly let loose, rush along at double speed,

carrying the icebergs with them with irresistible force, the pent-up dam which

has accumulated in the rear often covering hundreds of square miles. In very
little more than a week the ice on the 800 miles from Yeniseisk to the
Kureika is completely broken up, and in litrle more than another week the
second 800 miles from the Kureika to the Brekofisky Islands is in the same

condition.

During the Glacial epoch the annual fight between winter and the sun nearly

always ended in the victory of the former. Even now the fight is a very desperate

one within the Polar Circle, and is subject; to much geographical variation. The sun

alone has little or no chance. The armies of winter are clad in white armour

absolutely proof against the sun's darts, which glance harmlessly on six feet of

snow. In these high latitudes the angle of incidence is very small, even at mid-
day in midsummer. The sun's rays are reflected back into the dry air with as

little eff"ect as a shell which strikes obliquely against an armour plate. But the

sun does not fight his battle alone. He has allies which, Hke the arrival of the

Prussians on the field of Waterloo, finally determine the issue of the battle in his
favour. The tide of victory turns earliest in Norway, although the Scandinavian

Fjeld formsa magnificent fortress in which the forces of winter entrench themselves

in vain. This fortress looks as impregnable as that on the opposite coast, and
would doubtless prove so were it not for the fact that in this part of the Polar

Basin the sun has a most potent ally in the Gulf Stream, wliich soon routs the

armies of winter and compels the fortress to capitulate.

The suddenness of the arrival of summer in Siberia is probably largely due to

the geographical features of the country. In consequence of the vastness of the
area which is drained by the great rivers, and the immense volume of water which

they have to carry to the sea, the break up of the ice in their lower valleys precedes,

instead of being caused by, the melting of the snow towards the lim'it of forest
growth. The ice on the affluents either breaks up after that ou the main river, or

is broken up by irresistible currents from it which flow up stream ; an anomaly for
which the pioneer voyager is seldom prepared
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;  and  when the captain has escaped

the danger of battling against an attack of pack ice and ice floes from a quarter

whence it was entirely unexpected, he may be suddenly called upon to face a
second army of more formidable ice floes and pack ice from the great river itself,

and if his ship survive the second attack a third danger awaits him in the alternate
rise and fall of the tributary as each successive barrier where the ice gets jammed
in its march down the main stream Ijelow the junction of the river accumulates

until the pressure from behind becomes irresistible, when it suddenly gives wav.

This alternate advance and retreat of the beaten armies of winter continued for
about ten days during the battle between summer and winter of which I was a

witness in the valley of the Yenisei. On one occasion I calculated that at least
50,000 acres of pack ice and ice floes had been marched up the Kureika. The
marvel is what became of it. To all appearance half of it never came back. " Some
of it no doubt melted away during the ten days' marches and counter-marches
                             --

some drifted away from the river on tlie flooded places, -which are often many
square miles in extent, some got lost in the adjoining^ forests, and was doubtless
stranded amongst the trees when the flood subsided, and some was piled up in

layers one upon the top of the other, which more or less imperfectly froze together

and formed icebergs of various shapes and sizes. Some of the icebergs which we
saw going down the main stream were of great size, and as nearly as we

could estimate stood from 20 to 30 feet above the surface of the water. These
immense blocks appeared to be moving at the rate of from 10 to 20 miles an
hour. The grinding together of the sharp edges of the innumerable masses of ice

as they were driven down stream by the irresistible pressure from behind produced
a shrill rustling sound that could be heard a mile from the river.

     The alternate marching of this immense quantity of ice up and down the
Kureika was a most curious phenomenon. To see a strong current up stream for
many hours is so contrary to all previous experience of the behaviour of rivers that
one cannot help feeling continuous astonishment at the novel sight. The monotony
which might otherwise have intervened in a ten-days' march-past of ice wa»
continually broken by complete changes^n the scene. Sometimes the current wa»
up stream, sometimes it was down, and occasionally there was no current at all.
Frequently the pack ice and ice floes wens so closely jammed together that there
was no apparent difficulty in scrambling across them, and occasionally the river
was free from ice for a short time. At other times the river was thinly sprinkled

over with ice blocks and little icebergs, whicli occasionally ' calved ' as they travelled

on, with much commotion and splashing. The phenomenon technically called
' calving ' is curious, and sometimes quite startling. It takes place when a number
of scattered ice blocks are quietly floating down stream. All at once a loud splash
is heard as a huge lump of ice rises out of the water, evidently from a considerable
depth, like a young whale coming up to breathe, noisily beats back the waves that

the sudden upheaval has caused, and roclcs to and fro for some time before it finally

settles down to its floating level. There can be little doubt that what looks like a

comparatively small ice block floating innocently along is really the top of a
formidable iceberg, the greater part of Avhich is a submerged mass of layers of ice

piled one on the top of the other, and in many places very imperfectly frozen
together. By some accident, perhaps by grounding on a hidden sandbank, perhaps
by the water getting between the layers and thawing the few places where they

are frozen together, the bottom layer becomes detached, escapes to the surface, and
loudly asserts its commencement of an independent existence with the commotion
in the water which generally proclaims the fact that an iceberg has calved.

     Finally comes the last march-past of the beaten forces of winter, the ragtag and

--bobtail of the great Arctic army that comes straggling down the river when the

campaign is all over worn and weather-beaten little icebergs, dirty ice floes that
look like floating sandbanks, and straggling pack ice in the last stages of consump-
tion that looks strangely out of place under a burning sun between banks gay with
the gayest flowers, amidst the buzz of mosquitoes, the music of song birds, and the
harsh cries of gulls, divers, ducks, and sandpipers of various species.

     I have been thus difl"u3e in describing these scenes, in the first place, because
they are very grand; in the second place, because they have so important a bearing-
upon climate, one of the great factors which determine the geographical distribu-
tion of animals and plants ; and in the third place, because they have never been
sufficiently emphasised.

              A1. Journey across Australia. By Guy Boothbt.

     Leaving Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, the author and one companion
sailed to Townsville. From Townsville they passed by land, through Charters
Towers, the Gilberton, Etheridge, and Croydon goldfields, to Normanton, on the

Norman River, Gulf of Carpentaria. Here saddle and pack-horses were obtained,
etores laid in, and the transcontinental journey to Adelaide commenced. The

route followed wa? almost due south as fax- as the Oloncurry mineral fields, thence
due east to Hug-henden, south-west to Winton, due west to Boulia, only to ba
driven back ajjain by drought as far as the Thomson River. In a futile attempt

to reach the South Australian border at Haddon's Corner, Windorah was reached,
but at this stage scarcity of water and horse feed compelled the travellers to
abandon their intention, and, after losing- two horses from thirst and starvation,

to retrace their steps as far as the Barcoo River. This river was eventually fol-
lowed down, and the Cheviot and Grey ranges crossed to Adavale, where a course
was steered along the Bulloo River, and ultimately along the Paroo. CunnamuUa,
on the Warrego, was reached, and the river followed down across the Queensland

border into New South Wales. Arriving in the town of Bourke, on the Darling

River, the remaining horses were disposed of and a rowing boat purchased, in
which a distance of 800 miles was traversed to the small town of Menindee,
whence a river steamer conveyed them on to Wentworth, whence by the'
Murray and by train Adelaide was reached, exactly a year and a month after
leaving Normanton.

        2. Oil the Islands of Ghiloii. Bj Mrs. Lilly Grove, F.B.G.S.

    The Archipelago of Chiloe, lying between 41° and 43" S. lat., is only 25 miles

distant from the mainland at its nearest point. The principal island, Chiloe,

·can be reached by steamer or by one of the native sailing-vessels, which are well
managed by the hardy and dexterous ' Chilotes.' These vessels form the chief

means of communication, as the postal service is irregular. The island is peaceful
and prosperous, and crime is rare among its gentle and hospitable inhabitants.

Education is improving. Agriculture and wood-cutting are the chief emploj--

jnents both of men and women.

          1. On the Limits letween Physical Geography and Geology}
                      By Clements R. Markham, C.B., F.B.S.

            2. On the Helations of Geology to Physical Geography.
          By W. ToPLET, F.B.8., Geological Survey of England.

    Professor Lapworth in tis address to the Geological Section last year at
Edinburgh showed clearly the close relationship of geology to physical geography

--as regards the larger features of the earth's surface the structure and distributioa

of mountain chaius, the great folds which traverse the earth's crust, and the wider

areas of uplift and depression.

I propose to refer mainly to the minor features of the surface, and to show that

the nature and 'lie 'of the rocks determine these surface features. From this

point of view geology forms the basis of physical geography, and a geographer

must necessarily be to some extent a geologist.

   AThere is no need to point out that the converse of this is equally true.

geologist who would understand in ^hat way existing geological conditions have

--been brought about how strata have been deposited, volcanic rocks erupted, and
--how denudation has carved the surface into its present shape must study similar

phenomena now in progress.

   A comparison of geological and physical maps of any area at once shows that

different rock-groups and formations present different types of land, the hills and

mountain chains coinciding with the outcrop of certain rocks or strata, whilst other

formations are characterised by plains or by lowlands. It is thus clear that the

geological structure of any district determines its physical geography. This relation

is equally apparent when we compare the structure and surface features in detail.
The older masses of rock frequently form mountainous land ; the newer Palaeozoic

and the Secondary rocks occur mainly as a succession of plains and escarpments,

each determined by the outcrops of certain beds.

The history of valleys, plains, and gorges can only be understood by reference
Weto their geology.
                     then see why rivers, after for a while running over wide open

plains, suddenly break through hill ranges, cutting the escarpments at right angles,

the explanation being that the streams began their work when the whole formed

a comparatively even surface, the existing features being due to long-continued

erosion.

     The escarpments, plains, and transverse river valleys of central and southern
England and of eastern France form excellent examples of this structure. Here

the geology is simple, a fairly continuous dip in one direction and different beds

cropping out beneath each other in definite order.

     On the flanks of mountain chains this simple structure does not hold good

there the beds are frequently contorted, inverted, and thrust over each other, so

that a superficial reading of the geology would give erroneous results as to the

order of succession. But even here the present ' lie ' of the beds has determined

the physical geography, the disturbances of the rocks having been produced when

they were deeply covered by other strata now removed by denudation.

Some igneous rocks weather into conical hills resembling volcanic cones. The

same thing often occurs in the weathering of loose sands, whilst sand is frequently

Ablown into conical and crater-shaped hills.  hasty glance at the outward shape

of such hills might mislead a traveller. Many conical hills in the south of Scotland

are old volcanic vents, up which molten lava once came ; but the volcanic cones

have been long since removed by denudation, and what we now see are only the

once deeply-seated necks of the old volcanoes, the softer parts having been worn
away.

Caution is necessary in interpreting the apparent dip of strata as a means of
determining geological structure
                                                                                                                                                          ;  besides  folding and  inversions, already referred

to, we have to guard against being deceived by cleavage, false-bedding, and the
fan-shaped structure of mountain chains.
A_ knowledge of the geological structure of certain rocks in any one area may
mislead when appUed to distant districts. The soft clays, the limestones, and
sandstones of the Jurassic rocks of England are represented in the south and east
of Europe by thick masses of limestone, forming prominent mountain ranges ; whilst
the soft Triassic rocks of England are represented in the Alpine area by huo-e
masses of limestone and dolomite, with intermediate soft
                                                                                                                                                                                   bands and  with la'yers ot
volcanic rock,

     Even within so small an area as England we have differences in geolo"-icaI
coniposition, making differences in physical geography. The high and barren i^oor-

lands of north-east Yorkshire and the fertile districts of the Cotteswold Hills are
both composed of Lower Oolitic rocks: in the former they are sandstones and
shales, in the latter they are in great part soft limestones and clays.

     The nature of the rock determines the character of the soils and veo-etation,

the soils being due to the decomposition of the underlying rocks. Th?s is not
however, the case where the solid rocks are covered by drift deposits : here the
soils are formed by the decomposition of the drifts.

     The sites of early settlements and villages are generally determined by geological
surface conditions, water and a dry and fairly fertile soil being required. '

     The land divisions resulting from these early settlements are in like manner
dependent on the physical features, which, however, are not usually the actual

boundaries of the parishes, townships, &c.

_ But where the hills are exceptionally high the summit or the local water part-

ing is often the boundary.

they have been discussed, extend the results obtained by Dr. H. R. Mill to the

west of Lewis in 1887 ; a warm layer, temperature 5.3° to 56° F., varying in thickness

from fifteen to twenty-five fathoms, lies upon the main body of water, the surface of

which is some 3° to 4° colder, while its temperature decreases with the depth. At

400 fathoms in the Fsero Channel the temperature recorded was 30°'9 F.

              7. The Clyde Sea Area : a Sluchj in Physical Geography

                      By Hugh Robert Mill, B.Sc, F.B.S.E.

     This paper deals comprehensively with the results of the investisrations carried
out by the author for the Scottish Marine Station and the Fishery Board for Scot-
land on the Clyde Sea Area.

     The relations of salinity and temperature throughout the mass of the water
are shown to be conditioned almost entirely by the configuration of the various
basins of which the Clyde Sea Area is composed.

     The influence of water temperature on the air is also discussed, the effects
of the Gulf Stream plainly visible at the entrance to the Area being entirely
neutralised in its landward reaches.

     The complete paper, with numerous illustrations, will be published iu the
' Transactions ' of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

                             8. Configuration of tlie English Lakes.

                     By Hugh Robert Mill, B.Sc, F.B.S.E.

     This is a preliminary note describing the soundings taken by the author
and Mr. E. Heawood during June, July, and September, 1893, on Windermere,
Ullswater, Coniston Water, Wastwater, Derwentwater, and Bassenthwaite.

From the observations made profiles across the lake beds were drawn, and the
contour lines of depth laid down on maps. Specimens of the deposits on the

floors of the lakes were collected, and will be described. This is the only sys-
tematic survey of the lakes made with a view to delineating the configuration of
the basins, and the work will be utilised on the Ordnance Survey maps as soon
as it has been fully discussed.

     The complete discussion will be presented to the Royal Geographical Society,

                          SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16.

                        By Rev. Charles H. Robinson, M.A.

     Mr. Robinson began by explaining the sources from which the facts referred to

in bis paper were derived. He had just returned from a preliminary journey

along part of the north border of the Sahara, which had been made with a view to
ascertain the possibility of crossing the Great Sahara from Tripoli in order to visit
the Hausa States which lie to the west of Lake Chad, and to the north of the
rivers Niger and Binue. This journey he proposes to attempt during the coming

year.

     His intercourse with Hausa-speaking natives in North Africa served to reveal
the enormous extent to which the pilgrimage to Mecca is affecting the life and

habits of the people in the far interior. Many thousands of pilgrims find their
way thence to Mecca, some by crossing the Great Sahara, and going by sea
from Tripoli, others by way of Wadai, Darfur, Khartum, and Suakim. He read
an account given by a Hausa pilgrim of the capture of Khartum and the death of

General Gordon.

  6. On Environment in relation to the Native Tribes of the Congo Basin.
                                     By Herbert Ward.

     Throughout the vast and densely populated area of the Congo basin the native
tribes are without history and without a written language. The tribal charac-
teristics and the mental condition of the natives differ widely in tribes inhabiting
different localities. It is an accepted fact that the Congo population is allied to
the Great Bantu group, one of the most extensive of the African racial divisions,
and it is but natural to infer that the phenomena of environment represent the
main element of influence to which these variations of character are to be
attributed. The tribes of the Lower Congo, which is a well-favoured country, with
fertile soil and well-defined seasons, are represented as being mild, peaceful, and

superstitious. The tribes of the Upper Congo, who reside in the great forest
swamp, a region where all is sunless gloom and damp decay, where torrential rains

and the tropical sun produce a fermenting hotbed of exuberant foliage, are, on the
citKerhand, typical savages, indulging in cannibalism and waging perpetual petty
warfare upon their neighbours. It would appear obvious that the Bantu tribes,

f ow inhabiting this great forest "country through which the Upper Congo River

and its affluents flow, have degenerated, through stress of unfavourable environ-
fiaent, since the unknown tirne wh'en the Vai'ious tribes' of this race travelled
towards the south and the west.

        7. On the Vertical Belief of Africa. By Dr. H. G. Schlichter.

      The author submitted a series of ten sections of the vertical relief of Northern
and Central Africa. These sections were drawn from east to west at intervals of
4° of latitude northward from 8° S. The vertical scale is exaggerated eighty
times compared with the horizontal. These sections are .of value, not only in
showing the relations of vertical relief, but also in indicating by dotted lines the
regions where observations are wanting ; they vividly present the gaps which remain
 in our knowledge of the configuration of Africa.

                     8. The Distribution of Disease in Africa.

                     Bij R. W. Felkin, M.D., F.B.S.E., ^e.

    There are not many maps existent which show at a glance the distribution of

·disease in any country. An attempt is made in the map shown by the author to

illustrate the grouping of the principal diseases occurring in Africa, so that not

only the existence of the disease may be seen, but its comparative prevalence or

eeverity appreciated. This is done by using a symbol for each disease dealt with,

which appears at those districts where the disease exists. The symbol is doubled

if- the disease  is  very   prevalent,  and in cases where it  is  exceedingly severe three

                           '

symbols are placed together. The climatology of various areas has also been

introduced, and if this map is referred to one showing the altitude, it is compara-

tively easy to see why dift'erent diseases should be present or absent in any given

region.

    On looking at the map it can at once be noted that there are three distinct

areas in Africa in which the distribution of malaria is widely different. It is most in*

tense at the coastal regions and the long banks of the great rivers, it decreases with

altitude and, as will be noticed, it does not obtain at all after a certain altitude,

over 3,500 feet. It is not found in the Sahara, as will be at once seen, except in

isolated areas ; again, in the extreme south of the continent it is at once apparent

how altitude and climatology limit its production.

The distribution of phthisis is also seen at a^lance to be limited in its incidence

by altitude and climatology, and probably also to a certain extent by malaria, for
where malaria is most severe phthisis hardly if ever occurs. Again we notice that

·diarrhoea and dysentery are most frequent in those places where malaria is chiefly
met with, showing generally that the climatological factors producing the one

disease markedly influence the incidence of the others.

     It is impossible to give briefly further details with regard to the paper in any
other way than in tabular form. In the table, p. 838, where one* appears the
disease is present, where two appear it is very prevalent, and where there are

three it is exceedingly severe.

          9. Middle Egypt from Ptolemaic Maps and Recent Surveys.
                        By Cope Whitehouse, M.A., F.B.A.S.

    The question whether the maps which accompany the text of CI. Ptolemy,
A.D. 150, were copied from originals extant in the eleventh century, or were
draughted by the copyists of the manuscripts, by plotting the positions given in

the text, is of great importance. If there were original maps, contemporary with
the Alexandrian geographer, or not later than the fifth century, then these copies
furnish independent and trustworthy information as to those facts stated on them
which are not found in Ptolemy's lists of positions. This view has been maintained
by the author of this paper since 1882.

    The map of Middle Egypt, 1892, by the Ministry of Public Works, Cairo, and
the line of levels given by Slajor Brown, ' The Fayoum and Lake Moeris ' (1892),
run under his direction by Messrs. Joseph and Pini, furnish a crucial test. The

section of fifty-two miles from Beni-Suef to the furthest trace of habitation in the

--N.W. Fayoum is nowhere above the level of the Nile, except in crossing the

promontory of Dimeh the island-pyramid in Moeris of Herodotus and Diodorus.
It would be an island if the water in the Fayoum stood at the level of + 6 metres

high Nile being taken at about + 30, and the present Birket el-Korun at -- 48

metres.

     Noting the successive changes through which this region passed, as shown by
its physical conditions, history, and archaeological remains, it may be established
with certainty that the positions of the places mentioned by CI. Ptolemy could not
have been plotted on a map of the middle ages, nor on a map of ancient Egypt,
reconstructed from the historical and geographical data of Herodotus (b.c. 454),
Diodorus (B.C. 20), of Strabo (b.c. 24). Such attempted reconstructions by Linant
and others were shown ; and the differences between them and Ptolemaic maps
                            --;

840 KEPORT-- 1893.

from manuscripts in Mount Athos, the Vatican, Milan, and Venice, and of
Clirysanthus and Berlingbieri, and from tlie printed editions of CI. Ptolemy, were
pointed out. The maps of CI. Ptolemy represent his positions plotted upon a region
·whose relative areas of land and water only existed, as depicted, after the middle
of the first century, and before the end of the third, of our era. The paper was-
further illustrated by views on the line from Beni-Suef to that Temple, north of
Pimeh, whose existence was first pointed out by the author of this paper in 1882.

     The conclusion is that some, at least, of the maps accompanying the text of
CI. Ptolemy in medieval manuscripts are copies, more or less faithful, of maps-
drawn not later than the end of the third century, and that they are probably
contemporaneous with the Alexandrian geographer's text, a.d. 150.

Year's Day, 184-3. Until the middle of February we remained roughly between

G2° S. and 64° 40' S. and 62° and 57° AV., the western limit being Terre Louis

Philippe and Joinville Island.

All the land seen was entirely snowclad except on the steepest slopes, which

were of black, apparently igneous, rocks. The few specimens of rocks obtained

from the ice and from the stomachs of penguins bear this out ; Professor James
Geikie finding olivine, basalt, basalt lava, and possibly gabbro among them. Rock

fragments and earthy matter were seen on some of the bergs and ice. On

January 12 we saw what appeared to he high mountainous land and glaciers stretch-

ing from about 54° 25' S., 59° 10' W. to about 65° 30' S., 58° 0' W., and which

I believe may have been the eastern coast of Graham's Land, which has not

been seen before.

     The whole of this district south of 60° S. is strewn with bergs, and south of

62° S. they become very numerous. No entire day can be recorded when bergs

were not seen ; as many as 65, all of great size, to say nothing of smaller ones,
were counted at one time from deck. The longest we met was about 30 miles

long, one was about 10 miles long, and several from 1 to 4 miles in length. The

highest the 'Balfena ' sighted could not have been over 250 feet high, and many

were not over 70 to 80 feet high. All the bergs were tabular, or weather-worn

varieties of that form. The base of the bergs was coloured brown by marine

organisms.

The pack ice is said not to be heavier than that of the north, and is similar

in natui'e. It is frequently coloured brown by Corythnm cri<phyllmn, a very

Weabundant diatom.  W.first m<^t pack ice, on December io, in 62° 20' S., 52° 20'

it was dense, and ran east and west. In January we met the pack edge running-

east and we<!t in 64° 37' S. from about 54° to 56° W.

   A few observations for the freezing- and melting-point of ice were made, ami

some sea-temperatures recorded. The lead was cast in the vicinity of Danger

Islets and some bottom samples obtained, the depth varying from 70 to over 300

fathoms.

Periods of fine calm weather alternated with very severe gales, usually accom-

panied by fog and snow. The lowest air temperature recorded was 20°'8 F. on

February 17, and the highest 37°-60 F. on January 15. December showed an

average of 31°-14 F., January 31°']0 F., and February 29°-65 F. The baro-

meter never rose above 29 804 inches.

    No "wliale tesemWing Balccna niysticetus, i.e., the Bowbead or Greenland black
whale, was seen ; but many finbacks, some buncbbacks, bottlencses, grampuses,

and several kinds of seals, the hunting of which in default of whales was the

object of the voyage.

2. On the Antarctic Expedition of 1892-93. By C. W. Donald, M.B.

Originally proposed as a commercial undertaking, the object of which was ta

discover a true whalebone whale living under similar conditions to the black or

Greenland whale of the north, the idea of combining with it some scientific

Weresearch originated with the Eoyal Geographical Society.                                                     made the ice on

December 18, sighting the South Shetlands on the same day. The bergs differ

greatly from those of the north, being flat-topped and having perpendicular cliffs.

This characteristic shape I believe to be due to the conformation of the land,,

which is almost wholly of a volcanic nature. On Christmas Day we lay anchored

to an ice floe in lat. 64° 23' S., long. 60° 14' AV. The scenery was marvellous.

From our position on that day the mountains of Palmer's Land lay to the west,

culminating in the peak of Mount Haddington (7,050 feet). The ice floe stretched

to the south as far as the eye could reach. To the east lay a long chain of bergs,

their  perpendicular  faces  tinged  a  bright  red  by  the  low sun                                          to the north, the
                                                                                                            ;

loose scattered ice, small bergs, and dark water channels through which we had

just steamed. "VVe discovered a channel running from east to west through

Joinville Island, cutting oft' its southern portion as a separate island, which our

captain called Dundee Island. Along the shores of this channel were four

penguin rookeries, two of which were visited. Near the southern shore lies a

sunken reef on which we had the misfortune to run aground. Happily we got

Aoft' without accident.      number of geological specimens, fossils, and photographs

Wewere obtained.      arrived at Dundee early in June, having been absent a little

over nine months.

          4. Recent Exploration in Tihet. By E. Delmar Morgan.

     While the general features of Tibet have been known from very early times it
has been reserved for modern explorers to acquaint us more closely with the leading

characteristics of this marvellous region. Especially is this the case with the
northern and central parts of this country, left blank on our maps. The list of
these explorations begins with the Brothers Schlagintweit and ends witli Captain

Bower and Dr. Thorold's and Mr. llockhill's recent journeys. Their discoveries
have opened out new fields of research in hitherto inaccessible parts. They have
ascertained the continuity of the Kuen Luen system through twenty degrees of
longitude, and made known the direction and structure of its principal chains.
They have shown the lacustrine character of the central plateaus, and traced
almost to their sources some of the mightiest rivers of Asia. They have thrown
light on the climatic conditions of these lofty deserts, and seen an extraordinary
abundance of animal life on them. Their researches have proved the existence in,
former times of a line of flourishing oases along the northern foot of the Kuen
Luen, by which the Chinese silk trade passed in the middle ages, and have brought
to light the rich gold-fields of Northern Tibet. The leading features of this terra
incognita are well described in Captain Bower's diary, and the whole subject of
Tibetan exploration has been treated in the most thorough and admirable manner
by M. Dutreuil de Rhins in his ' Asie Centrale.'

      5. On the Bengal Duars. By Edward Heawood, M.A., F.E.G.S.

     The term 'Duars' is applied to a tract of country lying along the foot of the
Himalayas of Bhutan, and including the ' doors ' or passes into that country.
The first ranges here rise like a wall, wooded to their summits, from an undulating
842 REPORT-- 1893.

plain of slight elevation, which emhracea a strip of forest-clad ' Tsrai ' and a more
open country further south. Over a great part savannahs of gigantic grass
alternate with patches of forest, sal on the higher and lighter soils, and mixed
forest fringing the streams. The grass is burnt down annually, and the trees with
which it is dotted are usually quick growing and shed their leaves annually, and
are thus less affected by the burnings. The tiger, leopard, bear, elephant, rhinoceros,
buffalo, bison (so called), pig, and several kinds of deer inhabit the jungles.
The peacock, jungle-fowl, florikan, parrots, and a handsome pigeon are the most
prominent birds. The rainfall is very great, and the climate unhealthy, though
this improves with clearing. The tract is sparsely inhabited, except in the

southern and newly-settled parts, by Mechs, a tribe of Mongolian affinities who

can thrive in spite of the malaria. They are of wandering habits, cultivating by

burning patches of jungle, and moving on to new spots after a few years. Much

of the land is very fertile, and well suited for both early and late rice crops.
Channels, often of great length, are dug by the Mechs from the numerous streams
for the irrigation of the late rice crops, though the tendency of the rivers to deepen
their beds in the friable soil is a difficulty to more permanent settlers. The
climate and the exposure to raids from Bhutan have kept the country in a
backward state. It became British territory as a result of the war of 1864.

Much land has since then been settled and tea-gardens opened, especially in the

--western part ; while within the last three years a large tract of jungle has been

provisionally set apart by Government at the instance of the Rev. A. J. Shields,
C.M.S. missionary to the Santals, warmly supported by Mr. D. Sunder, settlement

--officer at Jalpiguri for settlement by Santals, who in their hill country south of

the Ganges are often unable to obtain sufficient land for cultivation. Forty
families were taken up in 1891, the author assisting in their settlement, and still
larger numbers have followed since. Although the partial failure of the rains in

the first season caused unforeseen difficulties at first, these, it is hoped, are now in a
fair way to be overcome. It should be mentioned that a similar experiment has
been tried with success in Assam by a Norwegian mission.

                  6. The Use of tJie Lantern in Geographical Teaching.
                              Jjij B. Bentham Dickenson, M.A.

      There has been for some years past a growing conviction amongst teachers
that they have in the optical lantern a very important auxiliary. In the hope

that by united action much valuable time might be saved, a meeting of public
schoolmasters was held at Oxford in May of this year, at the invitation of
Mr. H. J. Mackinder.

     At this meeting an association for the promotion of geographical teaching
 was formed and some of its functions discussed. It was hoped that it might
' serve as a medium for disseminating ideas and suggestions for improved methods

 of teaching geography,' ' that it might approach examining bodies with a view to

 pointing out how greatly many of the examination papers set lead to keeping the
 subject at the "cram " level,' that it would naturally take in hand the manage-
 ment and preparation of geographical lantern-slides, and in time, perhaps, arrange

 for geographical museums.
      It was agreed that, for the present, the work of the association should be

 limited to the preparation of lantern-slides for such schools as might wish to use

 the optical lantern in class teaching.

      At a subsequent meeting held in August at University College School, London,
 a method of teaching by lantern-slides was discussed, and the character of the

 slides to be prepared determined.

      The object of this paper is to bring the newly formed association under the
 notice of those interested in the teaching of geography, to give some account of
 the work upon which it is now engaged, and to exhibit a few of the slides

  prepared under its auspices.

 Section F.--ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

--PSESIDENT OF THE SECTIOIf ProfeSSOr J. SHIELD NiCHOLSON, M.A.

                        THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

The President delivered the following Address :

         The Reaction in favour of the Classical Political Economy.

It may naturally be expected in the address which, as President of this Section, I

have the honour to deliver that some attempt should be made at originality, or at

any rate at novelty. Accordingly, I hope that I shall fall in with the traditions

of my office by defending a series of paradoxes and by running counter to a variety of

popular opinions. I will only premise that however paradoxical I may appear,

and however much I may seem to strain at singularity, I shall speak always to the
best of my ability with the utmost good faith, and I shall endeavour to give only

the results of my most deliberate convictions.

   -- --The central paradox which I propose to defend the root of the whole series is

that the so-called orthodox, or classical, political economy, so far from being dead,

is in full vigour, and that there is every siga of a marked reaction in favour of its

principles and methods. The singularity of my position may be indicated by a

word and a phrase. The word is Saturn, the phrase ' we are all socialists now.' I

shall try to show that the traditional English political economy has neither been

banished to Saturn nor stifled by socialism, and that in fact it is stronger than ever.

This renewed vigour is no doubt largely due to the attacks made upon it on all

sides in increasing force for the last twenty years. The dogmatic slumber induced

by popular approval has been rudely shattered, and although some of the more

timid followers of the orthodox camp thought they had been killed when they

were only frightened and awakened, the central positions are more secure than

before.

Consider, in the first place, the question of scientific method and the closely

allied question of the relation of political economy to allied sciences. The method

practically adopted by Adam Smith and Ricardo, and reduced to scientific form

by Mill and Cairnes, and quite recently and still more etfectively by Dr. Keynes,
must still be regarded as fundamental. It has survived and been strengthened by

two distinct attacks. In the first place, the extreme advocates of the historical
method attempted to reduce political economy to a branch of history and statistics.
They were concerned to pile up facts and add up figures, and they seemed to think

that no guiding principles were necessary. But compilations of this kind are, properly

speaking, not even history, still less are they political economy. History does not

consist simply in collecting facts ; the facts must be grouped, arranged, and connected
Ain an orderly manner.
                        room-full of old newspapers is not history, though it may

contain much material for history. There was really nothing new in this extreme

form of the historical method. It was a reversion to a primitive type. The plan

had been adopted by chroniclers time out of mind ; they embedded facts, signs,
844 BEPORT-- 1893.

·wonders, and traditions, as the mud of a river embeds what happens to fall in it.

The facts are the fossils of the historian, and he has to make a very few go a long-

way. In economic literature we have an example of this method in the ' Annals

of Commerce ' of Anderson and Macpherson. The simple device is to collect all the

facts and opinions about Commerce all the world over, and arrange them under

the year in which they happened. The basis of classification is time pure and

simple, and at the best we have an imperfect collection of materials which must

be sifted and weighed to be of any service.

  --Now compare this method of simple accumulation this attempt to write a
--biography of Father Time as a man of business with the historical method

adopted by Adam Smith                                                                                                   at least two-thirds of the  ' Wealth of Nations ' is history,
                                                                                                                     ;

and it is history of the first rank, and it is so because it is history that is introduced

for the illustration, confirmation, or qualification, as ths case may be, of principles. It

does not follow because the principles are fundamental that the facts are warped

and  distorted                                                        it  simply means                                  that  the  facts       are  made  intelligible.  Take, for
                                                                   ;

example, his account of the economic aspects of the feudal system. He brushes

away the technicalities and looks into the inner life as easily as William the Con-

queror f»t the Council of Salisbury. Or, to take a modern instance, he is like a

naturalist who puts aside the parts of the creature he does not want in order that

lie may see what he does want more clearly. This is a very difierent matter from

suppressing truth and warping facts to suit preconceived opinions. It is needless to

say that Adam Smith made some mistakes, e.(/., in the treatment of the mercantilists
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

it ought to be equally needless to say that he made some remarkable discoveries of

the processes of economic development. Adam Smith also made large use of the

comparative  method                                                       he                                            literally ranged from  China to   Peru  in his   survey  of
                                                        ;

mankind. AVhat is the underlying assumption in this procedure ? It is simply

that in economic affairs, in matters of buying and selling in the widest sense of the

terms, in satisfying wants by labour, in the accumulation of wealth, there are certain

characteristics of human nature that may be regarded as fundamental. These are

no doubt subject to modifications by other influences, but modification is not total

Howsuppression or eradication.                                                                                          long would it take tlie Ethiopian to change his

skin under a different climate? And is it not proverbial that human nature is

more than skin-deep ? I think the Ethiopian might become very pale in complexiori

long before he would learn to prefer low wages to high wages, and much labour to

Whylittle labour. Economists may learn something from the poets.                                                                                                         do the

Whycreations of the greatest poets live and move ?                                                                                                  do we assent at once to their

reality? Simply because they are like ourselves, and we feel with Goethe that
we ourselves could commit the same crimes in debasement, and achieve the same

glory in exaltation, of spirit. The gods and goddesses, the sylphs and fairies, are

--only shadows. Can any man read Shakespeare or Homer to say nothing of un-

--doubted historical records and deny that a large part of human nature, especially

that part with whicli economists have to deal, is subject to but little variation"?

Knowledge grows and is handed on from age to age, and the power of man over

nature steadily increases, but the feelings are renewed with every generation. The

children of the nineteenth century may be precocious and priggish, but they are not

nineteen centuries old. Let me remind you, though I am anticipating my argument,

--that the latest and most advanced scientitic economics that which the Austrian
--economists have evolved out of the conception of utility in reality lays more

stress than Adam Smith did on the universality of the feelings of mankind. The only

difference is that he knew that he was speaking plain prose, and they sometimes

think they are only speaking subjective philosophy. In consequence, Adam Smith's
men and women are more real and less uniform than the offspring of the new

analysis. But the point of importance is the recognition of certain characteristics

of human nature as fundamental ; there is no other justification for the use of the

comparative and historical methods in the broad manner of Adam Smith.

     There are, however, still evidences in recent writers of the influence of that

narrow view of history which tries to avoid principles, in order to make an im-

pressionist record of facts. Impressionism may be good art, but it is bad science. Too
much stress, for example, is laid on the mere enumeration of statutes and preambles.

Howand too little attention is given to tlie far more difHcult question,                                                                                               far was the

law operative, and how far was the preamble a just description ? But signs are

not wanting that the broader method of Adam Smith is gaining ground. The

work of Mr. Seebohm on the 'English Village Community' is a splendid

example, worthy to be placed on a level with the best chapters of the ' Wealth of

Nations'; and Dr. Cunningham throughout his excellent history has informed

facts with principles.

     But it is time to observe that the traditional method of English political eco-

nomy was more recently attacked, or rather warped, in another direction. The

hypothetical or deductive side was pushed to an extreme by the adoption of

mathematical devices. I have nothing to say against the use of mathematics,

provided always that the essential character of mathematics is borne in mind.

Mathematics is a formal science that must get its materials from other sciences.

It is essentially as formal as formal logic. The mathematician is an architect who
must be provided with stones and wood and labour by the contractor. It is one
thing to draw a plan, another to erect a building. In economics there are cer-

tain relations which are most easily expressed in mathematical form. One of

my greatest obligations to Professor Marshall is that when I began the study of

political economy at Cambridge, some twenty years ago, he advised me to read
             And
Cournot.          before going further I                                                     should "like to say                                         that I think  one  of the
            _

greatest_ signs of power in Professor Marshall's ' Principles ' is that he has trans-

ferred his mathematical researches and illustrations to appendices and foot-notes,

and in his preface also he has admirably stated the limits and functions of mathe-

matics in economic reasoning. I also gladly avail myself of this opportunity of

expressing my concurrence with the views of Professor Edgeworth in his excellent

address on this topic as President of this Section in 1889. But less able mathe-

maticians have had less restraint and less insight ; they have mistaken form for

substance, and the expansion of a series of hypotheses for the linking together of a

series of facts. This appears to me to be especially true of the mathematical theory

of utility. I venture to think that a large part of it will have to be abandoned. It

savours too much of the domestic hearth and the desert island. I announced my

intention at the beginning of running counter to some popular opinions. I ask for

your patience and forbearance when I say that in my opinion the value of tlie work

of Jevons as regards the main body of economic doctrine has been much exag-
gerated. I am ready to admit that much of his work in finance and currency and
in many special problems is excellent. But he was, I think, too deficient in philo-

sophical grasp and intellectual sympathy to give the proper place to a new concep-

tion: witness his treatment of Mill and Eicardo. Again, Jevons was not a

mathematician of the first rank ; he struggles with the differential calculus as a

good man struggles with adversity. The older economists maintained that price

was the measure, not of utility, but of value, and value could not be reduced

simply to utility. Things, they said, might have a liigh value in use and but little

value in exchange. Jevons, by making the distinction between final and total

utility, thought that he had discovered a method by which utility might be

measured by price. No doubt, if we make adequate hypotheses, qualifications, and
explanations this may be done ; and, in the same way, if we introduce enough cycles
and epicycles we may explain or describe the motions of the stars. But price is

essentially the expression of objective and not of subjective relations-- that is the

older  view in  modern  phraseology                                                          the attempt to make a kind of pre-established
                                                                                          ;

harmony between the two leads to unreality. Price depends upon demand and

supply, and the degree of utility is one element affecting demand. In my view

the distinction between final and total utilitv is of qualitative importance ; it is

of service  in explaining the  real advantage                                                of  exchange                                                although  the  essential
                                                                                                                                                      ;

character of this advantage has been explained by Adam Smith and his successors.

The precision of the new phraseology, especially when translated into curves, gives

definiteness and sharpness to the conceptions. The subject is too intricate for

more detailed consideration in this place. I will only add that in my view Pro-

fessor Marshall's criticism of Jevons may be carried much further, with a still

further rehabilitation of Ricardo.
846 BEPOET-- 1893.

There is another direction in which I think the mathematical economists have

wandered far from reality. I allude to the stress laid upon what are called mar-

ginal increments. There is a tendency to magnify the eifects of the last portion

of supply or the last expression of demand. I will only say that this doctrine is

--very apt to run into the fallacy which may he popularly described as the tail

of the dog fallacy the idea heing that the tail wags the dog and the tip of the tail

wags the tail.

To resume in a sentence : the method of the so-called orthodox English econo-

mists has only been modified and supplemented, not revolutionised and supplanted,

myby the historical and mathematical methods of recent writers, and this, in

opinion, is being recognised more and more.

  --I pass on to consider a closely allied question the question, namely, of the

mylimitation of the boundaries of the subject-matter of political economy. In

view one of the greatest merits of the orthodox economists was the careful dis-

tinction they drew between economic and other social sciences. They refused to

merge it in the misty regions of general sociologj', and they excluded from its

borders the rocks and quicksands as well as the green pastures of ethics and reli-

gions. This specialisation, they ai-gued, was necessary if any real advance was to

be made beyond the expression of platitudes and sentiments. They allowed that

in practical social problems tliere were in general other considerations besides the

purely economic ; but these they left to the jurist, the moralist, or the politician.

For a time, however, especially under German influences, attempts were made to

break down these boundaries, and the economist was elevated to the position of

universal philanthropist and general provider of panaceas. Mill himself was

partly to blame for the excursions which he made into the applications of social

philosophy to practice. It is to these excursions we are indebted for the fantas-

tical notion of the unearned increment, and the curious idea that it is the duty

of people to leave the bulk of their money to the State, or rather the duty of the

State to take it. Fortunately, however, for the progress of economics, this ideal of

breadth without depth has not become dominant, and any force it had is already

spent. The advances made in other social or less vaguely human sciences have

been so great that the economist is obliged to exclude them from his domain.

Still to some extent the view prevails, especially in Germany, that it is the

business of the economist to discover the general conditions of social well-being,

and to show how they may be realised. If such an attempt were seriously made

it could only end in the projection of the personality of the writer into an ideal, and

one ideal would succeed another like a set of dissolving views. Suppose, for example,

that I personally were to attempt to set up an ideal, and, not having imagination

enough to create a new one, I were to turn to ancient Greece. There is something

very fascinating about the life of the typical Athenian in the best days of Athens.

Physical beauty and vigour were considered as essential as keenness of intellect,

appreciation of the fine arts, and skill in oratory ; and this intense self-realisation
was tempered by ardent patriotism and a strong sense of tbe duties of citizenship.

The principal blot, from the modern point of view, was the institution of slavery

and the relegation of most industrial functions to slaves. I might as an economist,

if this breadth of view were justified, take it on myself to show how modern life

might be Hellenised, and by leaving out slavery and introducing a little Christian

charity a very pleasing ideal might be made, and then I might go on to show what

steps Government should take to realise this ideal.

    In the meantime, however, my friend Dr. Cunningham might take as his type

one of the equally fascinating religious communities of the Middle Ages, and, by

leaving out some of the superstitions and inserting a few Hegelian contradictions,

he might construct an equally attractive ideal and proceed to direct the statesmen

how it might be carried into practice. But when all the other economists had

--worked out similar projects Professor Sidgwick, for example, on the lines of

Bentham, and Professor Edgeworth, with his love of measurements, on the lines
-- Whoof Pythagoras the difficulty would arise,
                                                 was to be the ultimate arbiter ?

And to this question no one would accept the answer of the rest.

Perhaps  it     may seem  mythat  illustration  goes  beyond  the  argument ;  let me,
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                847

then, state the position in general terms. According to the traditional English

view it is not the business of the economist to decide all the disputes that may

arise even regarding fundamental questions in ethics, religion, fine art, education,

--public law, administration to decide, in a word, the first duty of man and the

last duty of Governments. His sphere is much more limited, and the limits have

been indicated with tolerable precision by the classical English economists. Even

in England, however, there has been a tendency in recent j'ears to remove the old

landmarks, and I do not mean simply on the part of socialists, but by those who

in the main profess to accept the English traditions.

Just as the German idealists think it is the business of the economist to discover

the way to the perfectibility of the species, the English realists impose upon him

the duty of finding the road to the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In

technical language political economy is the economy of utility. No doubt, at first

sight, this aim seems to be both definite and practical. From the old inquiry,

' How nations are made wealthy,' to the new inquiry, ' How nations are made

happy,' it seems a natural and easy transition. For the essence of wealth is to

possess utility, to satisfy desires, to create happiness. It is obvious also that the

happiness of a people depends largely on its economic conditions in the narrowest

sense of the term ; it depends, that is to say, on the amount and distribution of its
material wealth. Accordingly it seems plausible to maintain that the economist

ought to discover by his calculus of utility those principles of production and

distribution that will lead to most happiness.

     Plausible and natural, however, as this transition from wealth to happiness

may seem, it may readily lead to the abandonment of the central position of the

classical economists. The steps are worth tracing. The first deduction made

from the general principle of utility is that it obeys a law of diminishing return.

Every additional portion consumed or acquired of any commodity gives a decreas-

ing satisfaction, and passing through the point of satiety Ave reach the negative

utility of being a nuisance. Illustrated by tlie usual curve this law assumes the

character of a mathematical axiom.

The next step is to show that the rich man derives very little utility (or happiness)

from his superfluity, whilst if his abundance were divided amongst the poor a

great amount of happiness would be created. It seems to follow at once that,

assuming an average capacity for happiness, the more equal the distribution of

wealth the greater will be the happiness of the people. Never did any theory

of equality assume such a simple and scientific form ; it is like the advent of

primitive Christianity in the guise of a new philosophy.

HowThe practical question remains, *  is this ideal to be carried out ? ' Obviously

it is too much to expect that the principle of natural liberty and the policy of

laisser-faire may be left to work out this latter-day salvation. Competition may

be well enough for the strong, but is the destruction of the poor and weak.

Accordingly it seems easy to prove, or at least to presume, that great powers must

be given to the State. It only remains to bring in the principle which Mill
flattered himself was his chief contribution to economic theory, viz., that the

distribution of wealth depends entirely on the opinions of mankind, that these

opinions are indefinitely pliable, and that, therefore, no schemes of distribution can

be called impracticable, and we arrive at the conclusion of the whole matter.
And practically that conclusion is nothing less than State Socialism.

     It needs no demonstration, however, that nothing could be more opposed to the

traditional English political economy. AVhat, then, becomes of my contention that

it remains unshaken, and that there are signs of a strong reaction in its favour ?

The truth is that this conclusion has again brought into prominence other portions

Weof the old doctrine that had been allowed to fall into the background.  are

confronted with the limited power of the State and the infinite variety of
individual enterprise. To the older economists the diff'erence seemed so great that

they considered the presumption against State interference to be established. The

rule, it is true, was never absolute and unqualified. Adam Smith himself indicated

some of the most important of these exceptions, and the list has been extended by

his successors. But these exceptions were all based upon reasoned principles, such
848 EEPORT-- 1893.'

as tlie incapacity of the persons concerned, e.g., children to make fair contracts,

the lack of individual interest in public works, e.g., the maintenance of roads, and

the importance of tlie highest security, as in the regulation of the issues of bank-

--notes. And in spite of all these exceptions strengthened and puritied by these
--exceptions the presumption remained undisturbed. Recently, however, some

writers, under the influence of the ideal of maximum happiness and impressed by

the power of the State, have sought to extend its interference far beyond these
admitted principles. But I venture to say, so far as this movement had any

theoretical support, the reaction has already begun.

The fundamental importance of freedom of contract has become more apparent

"than ever through the application of the comparative and historical methods to

jurisprudence ; the proposition that the progress of society has been from status
to contract has almost acquired the force of an axiom. The analysis, too, of
modern industrial systems, in which division of labour has become more and more

intricate and interdependent, has shown the hopelessness of the attempt to transfer

the management and control to the State. Changes in the methods of production,

in the diftusion of knowledge, and in the transport of material commodities have

been so rapid and so great that no executive government could have overtaken
them. In the most advanced communities even that legislation which is neces-

sary for the new conditions lags behind ; even those elementary forms which
simply aim at giving an interpretation to contracts in doubtful cases, or which are

necessary for the adjustment of responsibility (as in bankruptcy and partnership),
are behind the times. The growth of joint-stock enterprise has outstripped the

development of the law of companies, and there is a crop of new frauds without

corresponding penalties.

     Turning to the executive and administrative functions of government, the

analysis of existing conditions shows that we have not yet overtaken those excep-

tions admitted by the strongest supporters of laisspr-faire. The British Govern-

ment has, it is true, wasted its enei-gies in devising temporary expedients of various

kinds, but it has not yet accomplished the programme of Adam Smith. Not only

are there privileges and restrictions that ought to have been abolished long ago,

Webut on the positive side the programme Is not complete.  have just begun

universal education on the lines laid down by Adam Smith, but his scheme for

WeImperial federation is not yet within the range of practical politics.  have

effected great iinancial reforms, but we still fall far short of the full development

--of his principle.^. Even in matters of currency and banking In relation to which
--the function of the State has always been recognised we are lamentably in need

of reform.

But if the State cannot overtake those duties which are so necessary and per-

sistent that they were forced on the attention of the strongest supporters of

laisser-faire, how can we possibly justify the assumption of new functions which

rest upon no better principle than the vague idea that the State ought to do

something ?

    This leads me to observe that not only theoretically but practically signs of a
reaction in favour of the old position are rapidly increasing. The experiments

already made at playing the rule of omnipotence and omniscience, against which

Governments were so emphatically warned by Adam Smith, have begun to bring

forth fruit after their kind ; thorns that were carefully nursed by the legislature,

instead of producing grapes, liave produced more thorns and worse thorns.

   A principle of the widest application in ethics and politics as well as in

economics, which may be described as the principle of formal justice, has

Abegun to operate in a remarkable manner.  Government which lends its power

and assistance to one set of people must be prepared to act in a similar manner

in all similar cases. If once this principle is abandoned, governmental action

becomes either a matter of chance or depends upon clamour and jobbery. It is

wonderful how quickly the human mind discovers analogies in grievances, and

how soon one cry leads to another. Microbes are not more rapid and relent-

Aless in their multiplication.  plain man may have his doubts about the simi-

larity of triangles and consent to arbitration on the question, but he has no doubt
                                                                                     ;

tliat foi' the purpose of goverumental grants and aids his needs are similar to his

Howneighbour's. And the plain man is right.  can we justify the use of State

credit for the purchase of lands in Ireland and fishing boats in Scotland if we are

  not prepared to give similar aid to the poor of England who are similarly situated ?
 If we grant judicial rents in the country why not in the towns, and if we fix by
· law one set of prices why not all prices ?

     We must not be content with looking at the immediate effects of legislation

 we must consider also the secondary and more remote consequences. If a legis-

 --lator thinks that there are none of importance, let him read a chapter of Adam

 Smith in the original and not in the stale pemmican of popular dogmatism.

 And if he still thinks that every law must be considered in isolation on its own

merits, that it is a temporary remedy for a passing emergency, then let him resign

his seat in Parliament ; he has mistaken his vocation ; in the name of common

sense and the happiness of the greatest number let him cease to be a legislator and

become a policeman.

     There is an old fable about the gradual entrance, little by little, of the camel

--into the tent of the Arab. The British Government I speak irrespectively of

parties, for with the frankness of my old masters in political economy I make

--bold to say both are equally to blame the British Government is beginning to

·find that the camel is getting too far into the tent. The admission of a single ear

is nothing to the admission of the hump, and the knees, and the rest of the beast.

Now the ear may be interpreted to mean the grant of a few thousand pounds to

Scottish fishers, the hump is universal old-age pensions at a cost of some fifteen

OT twenty millions a year, and for the knees you may take the nationalisation of

land at a cost of some two thousand millions, and for the whole beast you have

the complete Socialist programme. The conclusion that when the beast was in

the Arab was out needs no interpretation.

Let us leave fables for something the exact opposite, namely taxes. It was a

favourite doctrine of the old economists that taxes are a burden and the visits of

the tax-gatherer are odious. This doctrine also is beginning to reassert itself.

The State can do nothing without money, and it generally does things in the most

expensive manner. Fortunately in this country we have not yet reached the

limits of tolerable taxation, but at the present rate of growth of Imperial and

local expenditure we are rapidly approaching those limits. Now, if there is one

position that has been firmly established in theory and confirmed by the abundant

experience of many nations, it is that excessive taxation is ruinous to a country.

We have to consider not only the net proceeds but the indirect cost in all its

forms, not only the mere cost of collection but the efiects on industry and on the

energies of the people.

It may, of course, be replied that those who demand a large increase of ex-

penditure for public purposes do not propose to tax the poor, but only to take the

--superfluities of the rich to take, as is sometimes said, twenty shillings in the

pound from that part of every income which extends above 400/. a year. The

certain efiect of this kind of taxation would be that in a very short time nobody
would have more than 400^. a year, and the sources of taxation would dry up just

as people had become used to and dependent on governmental assistance.

     The general argument may be summarised in the favourite phraseology of the

·day. The utility of every increment of governmental work rapidly diminishes,

·and the disutility of every increment of taxation rapidly increases. Both proposi-

tions, I may add, were abundantly proved before the language I have just em-

ployed was invented, and the old language, if less scientific, conveyed a more

·emphatic condemnation.

I will conclude by calling your attention to one more position of the classical

economists, and one that is the foundation of their whole system so far as they
<[eal with the principles of governmental action. They maintain that even if the

State could do something for individuals as cheaply and effectively as they could
do it for themselves, it is in general better to trust to individual effort. The

decisive consideration is the effect on the character and energies of the people.

--Self-reliance, independence, liberty--those were the old watchwords not State

reliance, dependence, and obedience. In the matter of pauperism, for example,

they teach us to distinguish between the immediate effects of relief ·which may
be beneficial, and the effects of reliance on that relief which may be disastrous.

They are bold enough to maintain that the condition of life of the dependent
pauper should not be made by aids and allowances better than that of the inde-
pendent labourer. They insist on the great historical distinction between the

-- --sturdy rogues and vagabonds who can work and will not and the impotent

poor, the poor in very deed, who cannot support themselves. They look upon

the payment of poor rates as they look upon other forms of taxation, namely, aa
the lesser of two evils ; they do not try to persuade themselves and other people

that it is a duty which is essentially pleasant. And I confess that I never
yet met a man who had the audacity to assert that he enjoyed paying poor rates.
But I have known many men who have given of their substance to a far greater extent

with a cheerful spirit. It is the compulsion that sticks in the throat, and there is
no more instructive chapter in economic history than that which describes the
slow, painful processes by which Englishmen gradually adopted compulsory assess-
ment for the relief of the poor. I shall be told that these old economic doctrines
are cold and hard and opposed to the principles of Christian charity. The retort is
easy : If Christian charity realised a tithe of its ideal there would be no need for

relief on the part of the State. If I, too, may quote Scripture for my purpose I
would say : Go to the ant, thou sluggard ! It does not take ten ants to relieve

another ant, and in this land of ours there are more than ten professed Christians

to every pauper.
     It is time, however, to bring this discourse to an end and not to begin a sermon ;

·which, moreover, according to my masters the old economists, is beyond our

domain. Yet I shall be bold enough to end -with these words of advice: To the
student I would say : Political economy has a vast literature, and you will not
find all the good concentrated in the last marginal increment; you must master
the old before you can appreciate the new; a portion of truth just rediscovered
for the hundredth time by some amateur is not of such value as a body of
doctrines that have been developed for more than a century by economists of repute.

And to the legislator I would say : Vaster than the literature of political economy

is the economic experience of nations ; the lessons to be learned from the multi-
tudinous experiments of the past can never become antiquated, for they have

revealed certain broad features of human character that you can no more disregard
than the vital functions of the human body. Just as Harvey did not invent but

discovered the circulation of the blood, so Adam Smith did not invent but dis-
covered the system of natural liberty. And nothing has been better established

than the position that legislation which neglects to take account of the liberties of
individuals is foredoomed to failure. If they cannot break through the law they
will get behind the law. The first duty of the legislator is to take account of the
natural forces with which he must contend, and the classical economists have made

a survey and estimate of these forces which, based as it is on the facts of human
nature and the experience of nations, it would be wilful folly to overlook.

               1. On Agricultural Depression. By H. H. Scott.

    The business of farming is so popular that in all ages up to recent times meu

were inclined to drift into it, but the uninitiated find out to their cost that it
is not without its full share of troubles and disappointments.

     The decline in prices and the market value of agricultural products are

now less than the cost of production, turning farming, which was never very

money-making, into a money-losing process.
     The causes of the decline :

    The danger that farmers stiU having some money may come to realise that
capital invested in the pursuit is no longer either profit-giving or safe, and may
consequently withdraw both the money and themselves from the industry.

    The alleviations suggested by theorists, and why they fail

     Alleviations which would tend to stay the rapid decline in agriculture, but
although favourable in this direction might be construed by some people as un-
favourable to those having no connection with land.

     Alleviations which are practicable without doubt, because, although advan-
tageous to agriculture, could not be construed as being correspondingly dis-
advantageous to the non-agricultural classes of this country.

districts of Bromley, Dartford, Gravesend, Romford, and West Ham, the difference
between the actual increase of population and the excess of births over deaths was

271,648 in the decade 1851 to 1860, 271,155 from 1861 to 1870,304,918 from 1871
to 1880, and only 171,442_from 1881 to 1890. For fifteen other great xirban dis-
tricts, with a total population of six millions in 1891, the corresponding figures were
253,492, 215,342, 1 70,726, and 4,261.

     The theory, verified in the case of the animal organism, presumably extends to
social phenomena. For in the latter as well as in the former case there pre-
sumably exists the condition from which the properties of correlation flow, viz., the
agency of a number of independent causes. The theory of correlation is required
to justify the method of ascertaining typical family budgets. The theory may be
extended to cases where the attributes are not numerically measurable, such as

  5. On the Lessons of the Australian Banking Collapse. By C. Gairdner.

      Conditions of deposit-banking in the colonies essentially difl^erent from those
at home. Proportion borne by indebtedness to capital greater in the colonies than
at home. Depositors at home not in touch with the management in the colonies.

No means of sustaining confidence when once disturbed. Stipulation for notice

prior to withdrawal of deposits of little avail in a time of discredit. Need for
convertible reserves, and lor a market where they can be converted. High rales
of interest on deposits incompatible with maintenance of large reserves. Suggestion
that deposits should be invited for longer periods, or in form of debenture stock
criticised. Statistics relating to suspended banks. Liquidation being impracticable.
Eeconstruction inevitable. Necessity for rigid economy in management of re-
constructed companies. Reduction of their number. Suppression of branches.
Difficulties of the banks greatly aggravated by excessive borrowing through other
channels. General inflation and subsequent collapse. Need for suppressing all

extravagance and waste. Work and thrift sole means of surmounting financial
difficulties. With favourable seasons recuperation may be rapid.

                 6. On Bishop Hugh Latimer as an Economist.
                        By the Rev. W. Cunninghaji, D.D.

    The ' Examination of Common Complaints,' which was issued by ' W. S.' in 1581,

is the most remarkable English Economic tract of the sixteenth century, as is shown
by the frequency with which it has been reprinted. Fresh interest has been given
to it, however, since the discovery by the late Miss Lamond of two MSS. of this

dialogue. She has proved that the text given by ' W. S.' is corrupt, and that the

dialogue was written as early as 1549. She has also furnished good grounds for

believing that Hugh Latimer is the original of the Doctor who takes such a lead-
ing part in the discussion. Her edition, which has just been issued by the Cam-
bridge University Press under its proper title as a Discourse of the Common Weal
of this Realm of England, not only fixes the date, but gives us a text which has

not been tampered with, and which aft'ords a sound basis for critical investigations
as to the authorship and place of writing, as well as to the originals of the persons
represented in the dialogue. The argument by which Latimer is identified is too
detailed to summarise ; but the case is a strong one, and if this view comes to be
accepted, it wiU give a fresh interest to the economic principles which the Doctor
advocates. These principles are remarkable in many ways. The general position
which is taken is completely modern. The system of finance which is assumed is
of a modern type, since taxation forms the ordinary source of revenue. But a more
remarkable departure from the mediteval standpoint appears in the treatment of
Self-interest. The Doctor does not merely denounce ' private lucre ' as immoral,

he recognises that it is a powerful agent which the statesman may control, so that

it shall not be injurious at all, but shall tend to the advantage of the individual

          ' See F. Galton, Proc. Hot/. Soc, 1888.

and of the community also. In matters of economic doctrine the Doctor advo-
cates views both in regard to tlie effect of the debased currency on prices and to
the importance of the balance of trade which were not current in his time, though

they subsequently won general acceptance. He also anticipates the policy of a

later time by his practical suggestvms for agriculture and industry, as well as by
his recommendations for the amendment of the coinage. The Doctor, in the original
form of the dialogue, did not, however, recognise the effect on prices of the influx
of American silver. The remarkable passage in the printed copies which calls

attention to this phenomenon was interpolated by ' W. S.,' and does not appear in

the MSS. Miss Lamond's edition adds immensely to the value of the dialogue as
historical evidence, while it brings to light elements of personal interest which had
hitherto been obscured. By her work on this Discowse,e\en more than by her edi-
tion of ' Walter of Henley,' Miss Lamond has succeeded, despite the difficulties
with which she had to contend, in making additions of permanent value to our
knowledge of English Economic History.

     Nottingham no longer holds a complete monopoly of the lace trade, as she did
thirty years ago, but she still has a monopoly in the manufacture of fine cotton
lace, and it is upon the accident of this being in fashion that her prosperity depends.
The ordinary constant yearly trade in lace is not sufficient to keep one-half of her
lace machines employed ; and as, roughly speaking, lace only becomes the pre-
dominant fashion once in ten years, it follows that for the trade to be depressed is

--the rule, for it to be prosperous the exception. The history of the trade shows

that the fashion has usually lasted three seasons one in which it is coming to its
height, another in which it is paramount, and a third in which it gradually dies
away. During these three years the manufacture of lace has been enormously
profitable, and fortunes have been piled up with almost a dangerous ease ; and
they have dwindled away with the same ease during the periods of seven years'

depression which have always followed the shorter bursts of prosperity. What is
true of the profits of the master is also true of the wages of the workman ; and the

consequence has been that Xottingham has been forced to introduce other and

more constant industries into the town to provide work for the men who are
inevitably thrown out of employment by the bad times of the lace trade. The

conditions of the industry are thus radically unsound, although they cannot be
altered because the control of the fashion-books does not lie in the lace manufac-

turer's hands. He has to keep up his manufactory as if the normal condition of

the trade were prosperity and not depression, for he never can be certain when the
change will come, and he has to devote himself to precipitating the change by the

beauty of his designs. Lace being a luxury, the taste of the public being capricious,
the lace-making machines being excessively costly, and the processes of its manu-

facture necessitating its passage through so many hands, the result is that the
flush of good trade is only obtained after years of patient loss, in which the manu-
facturers' energies are devoted to keeping down their losses rather than makmg

profits ; and the influence on the town has been both good and bad : good because
the artistic properties of lace have insensibly improved the taste of all connected
with its manufacture ; bad because the character of the industry, dependent for
IBANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  855

^irosperity upon caprice, is directly opposed to thrift. Nor does it seem likely that
the future of the Nottingham lace trade will be more stable than it has been in the
past. Fashion is beginning to change more rapidly than it did, but, on the other
hand, more things become fashionable in a single season, and the choice for the
public is greater. There may be a greater volume of trade done as lace becomes
increasingly popular with the million, but there are more rivals springing up to
share that trade. Prices will never reach the fabulous height that the Nottingham
monopolists used to obtain ; and thus, while there is no diminution in the expensive-

mesa of the manufacture, the profits will be seriously lessened.

           2. On Agricidtural Depression. By W. J. Allsebrook.

  --3. On Home Work The Share of the Woman in Family Maintenance.

                              By Miss Ada Heather-Bigg.

   A little while ago it was generally believed that excessive toil, starvation

wages, and insanitary surroundings were due to the action of sub-contract. The

painstaking inquiries of Mr. 0. Booth, Mr. David Schloss, and Mrs. S. Webb soon
showed that sub-contract was not responsible for these evils. It is now asserted

that home work is. The outcry against sub-contract had been swelled by the

--antagonism of labour to capital by the dislike of the man who works for wages

to the man who works for profit.

      The outcry against home work is being swelled by the hostility of the working
anan to the woman wage-earner.

     Common sense and a fear of alienating public sympathy prevent the working-
«lass leaders from too openly condemning the employment of women altogether,

but special classes of women-workers are being constantly singled out for attack.

     The wage-earning of married women (albeit in their own homes) is particularly
·denounced. It is alleged that this makes women joint earners with their husbands,
and tends to substitute the wife for the husband as bread-winner.

     As a matter of fact, however, women of the working classes always have been
joint bread-winners with their husbands. At no time in the world's history has

the man's labour alone sufficed for the maintenance of his wife and children. So
far from keeping his wife, the true account of the matter is that he and she have
iept themselves and the children.

      This truth has long been admitted and acted upon in France. It was affirmed
of England before the Ind. Remun. Conference. ' Not more than half the whole
number of working-class families,' said Miss Simcox, are maintained by the labour
of the father assisted only by the elder children.'

      It has been shown to apply even to the United States, where, though the total
family income is higher than in Europe, and the husband's contribution to it is
also larger, there are only a few industries in which, unaided, he can support his
family. Even in the bar-iron industry one-tenth has to be made up.

      In Belgium it is calculated that the husband earns three-fifths and the wife

two-fifths.

     Talk about the gradual substitution of the woman for the man as bread-earner

is absurd. The woman's share in household maintenance is no more than it ever
was. The facts have not altered, but the conditions of modern industry enable us
to see what the facts are.

      In short, a revelation is going on, not a substitution.

     Formerly, a woman working for a family in her home had to pick up faggots,

fetch water, bake bread, spin flax and wool, cure, pickle, preserve, churn, wash,

knit, &c.

      To-day, at any rate in big cities, the wife's household work means only mend-
 ing, washing, cleaning, cooking, care of children being the same in both cases.

     Even amongst working men there are some enlightened enough to see that
the ideal to be aimed at is not that the man should be the sole bread-winner, but

that bread-winning should go on under circumstances which secure the most com-
fortable life for the men, women, and children of the family, which permit the
fullest development of all powers, and openly substitute economic co-operation on
the part of the wife for economic dependence.

     Such people ground their objections to home work on
     (1) Danger to public health.
     (2) The low rate of pay in industries where home work prevails.
    As to (1), if existing sanitary laws, properly enforced, do not safeguard the
public, then no prohibition of home work would either.
    As to (2), the smaller sum earned by a woman in her home may place her in
as good a pecuniary position as the larger sum earned in a factory.
     The advantages of home work outweigh all the drawbacks, because it enables
married women to contribute their quota lo household maintenance in the way
most congenial to them, and most consistent with home life.

4. On the Progress of the Newspaper Press, and the Need of Eeform and
    Consolidation of the Laws affecting it. By Professor J. A. Steahan,

     M.A., LL.B.

  --Statistics shoiving the progress of the newspajJer press. In 1695 the first daily
--started in England. In 1712 when the stamp tax on newspapers was first im-
--posed the yearly circulation of newspapers in England was about 2,000,000. In
--1755 it was about 7,400,000; in 1801, about 16,000,000; in 183G, aboat

39,400,000; in 1837 when the stamp tax was reduced from 3|rf. net to 1^.
about 54,000,000; in 1854--the last year of the stamp tax--about 122,000,000.

--Since 1854 estimates of circulation must be conjectural, but the great increase in

the number of newspapers from 493 in 1840 to 2,200 in 1893, of persons

--connected with journalism, e.g., of ' reporters,' from 636 in 1861 to 2,677 ia

1881 shows that newspaper production must have increased enormously.
The yearly circulation of the twenty-nine London daily papers must approach

1,000,000,000, of the 170 provincial dailies must pass that number. Jiesides

these there are now 2,000 weeklies in the United Kingdom, some of which have a

weekly circulation approaching a million.

   --Legislation affecting newsj)apers. For the first 150 years after the first daily was

started there was practically no legislation specially afiecting newspapers ; during

the last fifty years there has been plenty, but most of it has been haphasard and ill-

considered.

    Advantages which toould result from codifying law.-- (a) The law would be
made more intelligible. This is very necessarj-, as the law has frequently to be

applied by the editor without the opportunity of legal advice, {b) It would be

made less cumbersome, (c) It would be made more efiective. At present it

frequently fails to carry out the intentions of the legislature, {d) It would be

made more just. At present the journalist has too good grounds of complaint

(1) his liability to  vexatious  actions  for  merely  technical libels                                                                                           (2) his sols

liability for defamation appearing in reports of speeches publicly delivered.

Suggestions for dealing with these.

   --Suggestions for establishing a legally qtialijied profession of journalism. One
--probable result of recasting law of the press an enactment that henceforth no

newspaper should be started without a legally qualified editor to conduct it, such

editor to be liable to expulsion fiom the profession if shown to be guilty of

unprofessional conduct.

ness found in town slums and elsewhere are largely due to inherited taint ; so

that individuals cannot properly be dealt with as if each was solely responsible.

It is quite impossible amongst the living at some particular time to say on whom

the responsibility should faU. Some national effort is therefore required, and

must be directed to the removal of those who have proved themselves incapable of

dealing with the difficulties of life, viz., the criminal and the helpless.

The remedy proposed is to found national compulsory colonies of two kinds,

which might be called relief colonies for the helpless and retreat colonies for

criminals. All the great national colonies have risen on the wealth derived from

the soil ; and under good superintendence it might be assumed that agricultural

village colonies established and conducted under strict rule would be successful.

For the relief colonies such discipline would be sufficient as has been ascertained to

produce good results in the parish poorhouses of Scotland. The criminal colonies

would require a firmer control, but both might easily be made more than self-

supporting from the intelligent prosecution of cultivation, planting, pasture, and

tillage appropriate to the particular localities selected.

Colonies might consist of family colonies of 100 persons, each on two square

miles of land ; and fifty family colonies would form a grand colony of convenient

size, being ten miles square.

The criminals to be compulsorily emigrated would be least and at first

those sentenced to penal servitude, and they would be astricted to their colonies

for life. Individuals with a criminal taint would in this way have a better

chance of leading useful lives than they could have in open competition and the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

hereditary taint would gradually be eliminated from society.

  --The relief colonies would be for the submerged those worsted in the battle of

life, families and individuals found living without sufficient food, clothing, and

lodging to assure permanent good health. These would not be astricted to their

colonies for life, but would have an opportunity of working themselves free by

their own self-denial and exertions.

AThe system would be established gradually.  single colony of each kind in

different and suitable localities would first be settled, and others added as previous

ones became self-supporting, the responsibility and expense to be undertaken by

some existing Government department ; and after the system had proved success-

ful a separate Government department could be established.

    By these or like means it is thought that the population of our islands could

be gradually purified, strengthened, and elevated ; and a new era of prosperity
would thus become possible for the United Kingdom.

        1. On the Currency Problem. By Prof. H. S. Foxwell, M.A.

   2. Ow the Currency Question practically considered from a Commercial
            and Financial Faint of View. By W. E. Doreington.

     Currency is an international question. It is the keystone of the commercial

arch, and, unless we revert to barter, a well-regulated system of currency is the

only means whereby wholesale production can be adjusted to retail consumption.
     Gold monometallism is a barrier to the development of free trade, The present

position of the Customs tariffs in foreign countries, necessitated by the various
nations endeavouring to keep their gold, and also induced by the efforts of foreign
Governments to help their manufacturers against constantly falling prices, has

fostered protection.

858 EEPOBT-- 1893.

As tlie standard of value in a portion of the world is in silver, and in the other

part in gold, commerce require3 a stable par of exchange hetween gold and silver

moneys                                        and,  as  the exigencies of                                              business           necessitate contracts for prolonged
                                           ;

periods, the industrial and commercial world requires a stable standard of value

for the equitable settlement of such contracts.

It is also most important to industrial and commercial Britain that foreign

--debtor nations shall not suffer by having to send to their foreign bondholders

English or otherwise on account of an alteration in the standard, an unfair and

unexpected increased amount of produce in discharge of external debts, to tlie

impoverishment of such debtor countries, and their consequent and corresponding

inability to purchase our goods.

     Gold alone does not furnish a stable measure of value ; silver is much more
stable. Having regard to the existing standards and currencies of the world, a

joint standard of the two metals, as of old, but on a broader international basis,

would afford the best promise of stability. It is a fallacy to suppose that if prices

of commodities fall producers or manufacturers get an immediate pro rata reduction

of their costs of production. Many adjustments are only slowly eSected ; some

elements of cost cannot be adjusted.

The industrial capitalist therefore suffers, and labour must sooner or later share

the loss.

   A silver-standard country with products or manufactures competing with those

of gold-standard Britain has an unfair advantage over the producers or manufac-

turers of this country.

The increasing scramble for gold throughout the world must, imless relieved

by a broadening of the monetary metallic base, increase and intensify and prolong

financial tension and panic. Great Britain, being practically the only country

whose monetary laws afford no means of protecting its gold, except the clumsy and

ofttimes slowly efficacious procedure of raising the Bank rate, must experience to

the fullest extent the evils of such financial disturbance. This affects credit,

checks trading facilities and trade and enterprise, and puts a tax upon productive

industry.

The only remedy which it is even suggested would give a stable par of exchange

between the various peoples on earth ; which would give a steady and permanent

measure of value between buyers and sellers who make prolonged contracts, and

between debtors and creditors, individual and national ; and the only remedy to

relieve the ' scramble for gold ' and provide a suitable expansion of ' international

legal tender ' from time to time is international bimetallism. Monetary history

proves that this would provide all these desiderata, and also proves that it is

practicable.

3. On some Objections to Bimetallism viewed in connection with the Beport
               of the Indian Currency Committee. By L. L. Price.

The publication of the Report of the Indian Currency Committee marks a

stage of great importance in the progress of the monetary crisis, and the report is

not devoid of instruction for the student of monetary affairs. The aim of the

present paper is to examine a few of the points on which such instruction may be

obtained. Bimetallism is frequently charged with being artificial, and the objection is

undeniably plausible. But the student will not dismiss the proposal on that ground

alone, for he is aware of the abuse which often attaches to the distinction between

what is natural and what is artificial. The layman, however, may be prejudicially

influenced by the charge                                                                                               but the review of  foreign  systems of currency contained
                                                                                                                    ;

in the Report of the Indian Currency Committee should suffice to convince him

that, compared with these complicated systems, which are in many cases the con-

sequence of the abandonment of bimetallism, or of the refusal to return to it, the

bimetallic scheme appears simple and natural. Another consideration raised by the

report is the fact that a currency change has now been sanctioned, which is

distinctly designed to meet e-vils occasioned by currency changes. The particular

phase of the malady with which the Indian Committee deal is that connected
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  859

with fluctuations of exchange, and they do not profess to effect a complete cure,
but to check the further inroads of the disease. In England and Europe the more
prominent phase is rather that of an 'appreciation' of gold. To deny the

existence of this is now hardly possible, in whatever sense the term ' appreciation

is used, and to ignore the evils which are consequent upon it is no less difficult,
while the Indian analogy renders inapplicable the plausible argument that

Governments should not '"tamper ' with the currency. And yet this argument,

together with that based on the supposed artificial character of bimetallism, not
improbably supplies a large part of the vis inertice which hinders its progress in

this country, and does so in the minds of candid practical men honestly desirous to
set aside prejudice. It is to them that the appeal must be made, and they may

fairly be asked at the present juncture to give their careful attention to the
question, for the action of the Indian Government is likely to accentuate the
monetary difficulties of the Western world. Directly and indirectly it can hardly

fail to increase the appreciation of gold. It may indeed so intensify the troubles

aa to compel attention to what was unheeded before, and thus out of present evil

future good may possibly issue. But, with a view of shortening the period of
suspense, the candid observer may be asked to contemplate the dilemmas to which
the refusal of bimetallism has brought those who are anxious to relieve by other
means the pressure of monetary difficulties, The Indian proposal illustrates some

of these dilemmas, and is at the best acknowledged to be but a pis aller. It affords a

fresh example of the dangers and difficulties of a policy of drift, and the practical

man may now be asked whether he is really willing that such a policy should

indefinitely continue. Happily there have of late been signs that the crust of

indiflference is being broken through, and to this beneficial process the Report of the

Indian Currency Committee promises to render material assistance.

              4. On India and the Currency. By F. C. Haekison.

   --India's action was dictated by political and financial considerations political

m that the import trade and the official were suffering, financial in that Govern-

ment found both the variation and the continuous decline in silver intolerable.
     As India has always possessed a favourable balance of trade whether gold was

dear as in 18ii5 or cheap as in 1866, whether silver was dear as in 1870 or cheap
as in 1893, so it will continue to have a favourable balance under altered conditions.
There is, therefore, no reason for supposing that the present experiment will fail

owing to changes in international trade.

    On other grounds India's action is also defensible. Europe is not at present
prepared to adopt bimetallism, and many think that it is possible to manage with

a gold standard and an extended use of silver and silver notes. India, therefore,
by adopting the gold standard and using the least possible quantity of that metal
in its circulation is doing the least injury that is practicable in changing from

silver to gold.

                Section G.--MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

  --Pbesibent op the Section Jekemiah Head, Esq., M.Inst. C.E., F.C.S.

                          THUBSDAT, SEPTEMBER 14.

     The Peesidext delivered the following Address :

This Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was
founded with the object of making more widely known, and more generally
appreciated, all well-ascertained facts and well-established principles having special

reference to mechanical science.

    As President of the Section for the year, it becomes my duty to inaugurate the

proceedings by addressing you upon some portion of the scientific domain to which
I have referred, and in which your presence here indicates that you are all more or

less interested.

                                             MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

     The founders of the British Association no doubt regarded the field of operations

Gwhich they awarded to Section as a not less purely scientific one than those

which they allotted to the other Sections. And, indeed, mechanical science studied,
say, by Watt was as free from suspicion of commercial bias as chemical science
studied, say, by Faraday.

    But whatever may have been the original idea, the practice of the Section has

recently been to expend most of its available time in the consideration of more or
less beneficial applications of mechanical science, rather than of the first principles
thereof. Our Section has become more and more one of applied rather than of
pure science. None of the other Sections is free from this fault, if fault it be

G(which I do not contend or admit), but Section seems to me to be beyond all

question, and beyond all others, the Section of applied science.
     The charter of the Institution of Civil Engineers commences by reciting that

the object of that society is ' the general advancement of mechanical science, and
more particularly for promoting the acquisition of that species of knowledge which
constitutes the profession of a civil engineer, being the art of directing the great
sources of power in nature for the use and convenience of man.'

     It seems that in 1828, when the Institution was incorporated, the term
'mechanical science' had a wider meaning than it is now usually imderstood to

have. For, according to the charter, the art of directing the great sources of

power in nature is only a particular species of knowledge which ' mechanical

science ' includes.

      In 1836, or eight years later, the founders of our Section adopted the term
without again defining it. Probably they accepted the careful definition of the
Great George Street Institution. Time has shown the wisdom of that decision.

GFor we civil engineers and other frequenters of Section in active practice need far

more knowledge than mechanical science can teach us in the ordinary or narrow
sense of the term. Our art in its multifarious branches requires, if success is to be
                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                        861

attained, the acquisition and application of almost all the other sciences which

belong to the fields of research relegated to the other Sections. For how could the
gigantic engineering structures of modem times he designed without recourse to

mathematics, or steam and other motors without a knowledge of physics, or modern

metallurgical operations be conducted without chemistry, or mining without geology,
or communications by rail, ship, and wire be established and carried on with all
parts of the world without attention to geography, or extensive manufacturing

enterprises be developed if the laws of economics were neglected ?

     As to biological studies, they seem at first sight to have but little to do with

mechanical science. It might even be thought that the civU engineer could afford

altogether to neglect this part of the work of the Association. But I trust I shall
be able to show you before I finish that any such view is absolutely untenable.

                             MECHANISMS IN NATTJEE.

     Indeed, I hope, in the course of this address, to satisfy you that mechanical

science is largely indebted to mechanisms as they exist in nature, if not for its

origin, at all events for much of its progress hitherto, and that nature must still

be our giiide.

      Mechanical science has been built up entirely upon observation and experiment,
and the natural laws which have been induced therefrom by man. The lower

animals in their wild condition work with tools or appliances external to their

bodies to but a very slight extent, and man in a primitive or savage state does the

same. But many, if not most, animals can be taught to use mechanisms if care-
fully trained from infancy. Thus, the well-known donkey at Carisbrooke Castle

draws water from a deep well by a treadmill arrangement just as well as a man
could do it. He watches the rope on the barrel till the full pail rises above the

parapet of the well, then slacks back a little to allow it to be rested thereon, and
only then leaves the drum and retreats to his stable. But, according to his

attendant, four years were needed for his education, and unless it had been
commenced early it would have been useless.

     I have seen a canary gradually lift from a little well, situated a foot below its
perch, a thimble full of water by pulling up with its beak, bit by bit, a little chain
attached to it, and securing each length lifted with its foot till it could take

another pull. When the thimble reached its perch level the bird took a drink, and

then let it fall back into the well. Numerous other examples will doubtless occur

to you.

frequent oyster-beds on the coast of India wait until the receding tide uncovers the

by tying to a, tree a hollow gourd containing rice, and having a hole large enough

for his hand, but too small for his clenched fist, to pass through. He cUmbs the

tree and grasps the rice, and remains there till taken, being too greedy, and not

baving sufficient sense, to let go the rice and withdraw his hand.

    This is on a par with the snuff-taking imbecUe, described by Hugh Miller,^
whom the boys used to tease by giving him a little snufi" at the bottom of a deep

tin box. The imbecile would try to get at it for hours without the idea ever

occurring to him that he might achieve his object by turning the box upside down.

and functions vrhich go on continuously therein, mechanisms of so elaborate a kind

that we can only look and wonder and strive to imitate them a little here and
there. The mechanism of their own bodily frames is that with which the lower

animals have to be content, and whilst they are in the prime of life and health,

and in their natural environment, it is generally sufficient for all their purposes.

Man has a still more perfect, or rather a still more versatile, bodily mechanism, and

one which in a limited environment would be equally sufficient for his needs. But
he has also an enterprising and powerful mind which impels him to strive after and
enables him to enjoy fields of conquest unknown to, and uncared for by, the

relatively brainless lower animals.

    Urged on by these superior mental powers, man must soon have perceived that

by the use of instruments he could more quickly and easily gain his ends, and he
would not be long in discovering that certain other animals, such as the ox and the
horse, were teachable and his willing slaves, provided only he fed and trained

them and treated them kindly.
    First in common with other animals, he would find out that stones and sticks

were of some use as weapons and tools ; then he would go further and utilise skins
and thongs for clothing and harness ; and by selecting and modifying his stones
and sticks he would form them into rough implements, which would enable him to
cut down trees and to make rude huts and boats. Animals caught and domesticated
would first be taught to haul light logs along the ground, then to move heavier

ones on rollers ; and later, in order to avoid the necessity for continual replacement

of the rollers, the wheel and axle would be gradually developed.

     The mechanical nomenclature of all languages is largely derived from the

bodies of men and other animals. From this it is clear that animals have always

been recoo-nised as mechanisms, or as closely related thereto. The names borrowed
from them generally indicate a resemblance in form rather than in function, though

not invariably so.

    Thus in our own langruage we have the 'head ' of a ship, a river, a lake, a jetty,
a bolt, a nail, a screw, a, rivet, a flight of stairs, and a column of water ; the brow

of an incline ; the crown of an arch ; the toe of a pier ; the foot of a wall ; the

forefoot, heel, ribs, waist, knees, skin,  nose,  and  dead  eyes  of a                       ship                       also  turtle

Not only has our mechanical nomenclatiu-e been largely taken from animals,

but many of our principal mechanical devices have pre-existed in them. Thus,

examples of levers of all three orders are to be found in the bodies of animals.

The human foot contains instances of the first and second, and the forearm of the

third order of lever. The patella, or knee-cap, is practically a part of a pulley.

There are several hinges and some baU-and-socket joints, with perfect lubricating

arrangements. Lungs are bellows, and the vocal ©rgans comprise every requisite

of a perfect musical instrument. The heart is a combination of four force-pumps

acting harmoniously together. The wrist, ankle, and spinal vertebrae form uni-

versal joints. The eyes maybe regarded as double-lens cameras, with power to

adjust focal length, and able, by their stereoscopic action, to gauge size, solidity,

and distance. The nerves form a complete telegraph system with separate up and

down lines and a central exchange. The circulation of the blood is a double-line

system of canals, in whicb the canal liquid and canal boats move together, making

tiie complete circuit twice a minute, distributing supplies to wherever reqiured, and

taking up return loads wherever ready without stopping. It is also a heat-

distributing apparatus, carrying heat from wherever it is generated or in excess to

wherever it is deficient, and establishing a general average, just as engineers en-
deavour, but with less success, to do in houses and public buildings. The respiratory

system may be looked upon as that whereby the internal ventilation of the bodily

structure is maintained. For by it oxygen is separated from the air and imparted

to the blood for conveyance and use where needed, whilst at the same time the

products of combustion are extracted therefrom and discharged into the atmo-

sphere.

Mastication, which is the first process in the alimentary system, is, or rather

should be, a perfect system of cutting up and grinding, and to assist and save
animal, and especially human, mastication is the chief aim and object of all the

gigantic milling establishments of modern times. The later alimentary processes

are rather chemical than mechanical, but still the successive muscular contractions,

whereby the contents of the canal are forced through their intricate course, are

distinctly mechanical, and may have suggested the action of various mechanisms

which are used in the arts to operate on plastic materials, and cause them to flow
into new forms and directions.

    The superiority of man to the lower animals can only have become conspicuous
and decided when he began to use his inventive faculties and to fashion weapons

and implements of a more eflicient kind than the sticks and stones which they also

occasionally use.

    But human races and individuals were never equally endowed by nature. Some
individuals would have greater inventive powers than others, and these and their
posterity would gradually become dominant races. Large masses of mankind are
still more or less in the position of primeval man, which, if we accept the conclu-
sions of Darwin, Lubbock, and other modern scientists, we must regard as one of

barbarism. For they are still without tools, appliances, and clothes, except of the
most elementary kinds, and mechanical science might almost be non- existent, so
far as they are concerned.*

It would obviously be impossible for me to treat of or call attention even to an

infinitesimal extent to the results of mechanical science which surround us now so

profusely, and which make our  life  so different  from  that of primeval  man                      and,
                                                                                                 ;

                        are so familiarised with artificial aids that we have come

to regard them as part of our natural environment, and their occasional absence

impresses us far more than their habitual presence.

    I propose, with your leave, to proceed to the consideration of how far man is,

in his natural condition, and has become by aid of mechanical science, able to

compete successfully with other and specially endowed animals, each in its own

sphere of action.

                      BODILY POVPEES OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS.

    The bodily frame of man is adapted for life and movement only on or near to
the surface of the earth. Without mechanical aids he can walk for several hours,
at a speed which is ordinarily from 3 to 4 miles per hour. Under exceptional cir-

cumstances he has accomplished over 8 miles- in one hour, and an average of 2f
miles per hour for 141 hours.^ In running he has covered about 11^ miles in
an hour. In water he has proved himself capable of swimming 100 yards at the

rate of 3 miles per hour, and 22 miles at rather over 1 mile per hour. He can
easily climb the most rugged mountain path and descend the same. He can swarm
up a bare pole or a rope, and when of suitable physique and trained from infancy
can perform those wonderful feats of strength and agility which we are accustomed
to expect from acrobats. He has shown himself able to jump as high as 6 feet

2J inches from the ground, and over a horizontal distance of 23 feet 3 inches, and
has thrown a cricket-ball as far as 382| feet before it struck the ground.'

     The attitude and action of a man in throwing a stone or a cricket-ball, where

he exerts a considerable force at several feet from the ground, to which the re-

action has to be transmitted and to which he is in no way fastened, are unequalled
in any artificial machine. The similar but contrary action of pulling a rope
horizontally, as in ' tug of war ' competitions, is equally remarkable.

states that he found the natives of both sexes and all ages absolutely nude.

    So also the power of the living human mechanism to withstand widely diverse

and excessive strains is altogether unapproachable in artificial constructions. Thus,

although fitted for an external atmospheric pressure of about 15 lb. per square inch,
he has been able, as exemplified by Messrs. Glaisher and Coxwell in 1862, to ascend
to a height of 7 miles, and breathe air at a pressure of only 3^ lb. per square inch,

and still live. And, on the other hand, divers have been down into water 80 feet

deep, entailing an extra pressure of about 36 lb. per square inch, and have

Teturned safely. One has even been to a depth of 150 feet, but the resulting
pressure of 67 lb. per square inch cost him his life.*

     Eecent fasting performances (if the published records are to be trusted) are not

less remarkable when we are comparing the human body as a piece of mechanism
with those of artificial construction. For what artificial motor could continue its
functions forty days and nights without fuel, or, if the material of which it was

constructed were gradually consumed to maintain the flow of energy, could after-

wards build itself up again to its original substance ?

     These and other performances are, when considered individually and separately,
often largely exceeded by other animals specially adapted to their own limited
spheres of activity. The marvel is not, therefore, that the human bodily

mechanism is capable of any one kind of action, but that, in its various develop-
ments, it can do all or any of them, and also carry a mind endowed with far

wider powers than any other animal.

    Animals other than man are also adapted for life and movement on or about

the surface of the earth. This includes a certain distance below the ground, as in
the case of earthworms ; under the water, as in the case of fish ; on the water, as

in the case of swimming birds ; and in the air, as with flying birds.
    As far as I know, no animal burrows downwards into the earth to a greater

depth than 8 feet,- and then only in dry ground. Man is naturally very ill-adapted

for boring into the earth as the earthworm does. Indeed, without mechanical
aids he would be helpless in excavating or in dealing with the accumulations of
water which are commonly met with underground. But by aid of the steam-

engine for pumping, for air-compressing, ventilating, hauling, rock-boring, electric
lighting, and so forth, and by the utilisation of explosives, he has obtained a com-

plete mastery over the crust of the earth and its mineral contents, down to the

depth where, owing to the increase of temperature, the conditions of existence

become difficult to maintain.

     1 have said that on land man, unaided by mechanism, has been able to cover

about 11|- miles in one hour. Two miles he has been able to run at the rate of

nearly 13 miles per hour, and 100 yards at the rate of over 20 miles per hour.*

But the horse, though he cannot walk faster than man, nor exceed him in jump-

ing heights or distances, can certainly beat him altogether when galloping or

Atrotting.  mile has been galloped in 103 seconds, equal to 35 miles per hour,

and has been trotted in 124 seconds, equal to 29 miles per hour.*
     There are many other animals, such as ostriches, greyhounds, antelopes, and

solves, which run at great speeds, but reliable records are difficult to obtain, and

are scarcely necessary for our present purpose.

                 MECHAmCAL AID WITHOUT EXTEANEOTJS MOTIVE-POWEE.

     Let us now consider how man's position as a competitor with other animals in

·epeed is aff'ected by his iise of mechanical aids, but without any extraneous motive-

--power.
      Locomotion on Zand. "Where there is a stretch of good ice, and he is able to
liind skates on his feet, he can thereby largely augment his running speed. This

     But the most wonderful increase to the locomotive power of man on land is

obtained by the use of the modei-n cycle. Cycling is easily performed only where

roads, wind, and weather are favourable. But similar conditions must also be

present to secure the best speed of horses, with which we have been making com-

parison. One mile has been cycled at the rate of 27*1 miles per hour,' 50 at 20,'^

100  at  16-6;-  383  at  12-5,3  ^nd  900  at  12-43                     miles  per  hour.
                                                                       '

     The recent race bstween German and Austrian cavalry officers on the high

road between Vienna and Berlin has afforded an excellent opportunity to judge

of the speed and endurance of horses as compared with men over long distances.

Count Starhemberg, the winner, performed the distance, about 388 miles, in 71-33

hours, equal to 5-4o miles per hour. He rested only one hour in twelve. His

horse, though successful, has since died.*

     Lawrence Fletcher cycled, also along the high roads, from Land's End to

John o' Groat's house, 900 miles, in 72-4 hours, equal to 12-43 miles per hour,

or more than double the distance that the Count rode, and at above double the

myspeed. To the best of           knowledge he still lives, and is no worse for his effort.

The horse in this case would have to carry extra weight equal to one-sixth of his

own, and the cyclist equal to a quarter of his own. But the horse carried him-

self and his rider on his own legs, while the cyclist made his machine bear the

weight of itself and rider. Herein was probably the secret of his easy victory.

     With the very remarkable exception of long-distance cycling, which is of
limited application, man, relying on his own bodily strength, cannot successfully

compete with other animals which, like the horse, are specially fitted for rapid

land locomotion. His only alternatives are either to utilise tlie horse and ride

or drive him, and so get the benefit of his superior strength and speed, or to use

his own inventive faculty and construct appliances altogether apart from animal

mechanisms. In either case he virtually gives up the contest as a self-moving

animal, and to a great extent abandons himself to be carried by others or by

inanimate machinery.

     Nearly seventy years ago mankind came to this conclusion, and the modern

railway system is the result. The locomotive will go at least double the speed of

the racehorse. It will carry not only itself but three or four times its own

weight in addition, and will go not 2 or 3, but 100 miles or more without

stopping, if only the road ahead be clear. And the iron horse is fed and controlled
without even so much exertion as that put forth by a man on a horse of flesh and

bone.

   --Locomotion in Water. Let us now consider the powers of man relatively to

other animals in moving upon and through the great waters with which three-

fourths of the earth's surface is covered. Here he is in competition with fishes,

aquatic mammals, and swimming birds.

     I have already stated that, unaided by mechanism, he has shown himself able

to swim for short distances at the rate of 3, and long distances (22 miles) at the

rate of I mile per hour. He has also given instances of being able to remain

under water for 44 minutes.^

     Credible eye-witnesses inform me that porpoises easily overtake and keep pace

with a steamer going 12i knots, or, say, over 14 miles per hour, for an indefinite

length of time. This is five and fifteen times the maximum swimming speed of a
man for short and long distances respectively. No doubt the form and surface of

a fish whose main business is swimming offer less resistance, and his muscular

power is more concentrated and better applied towards propulsion in water than

is the case with man, whose body is also adapted for so many other purposes.
    I am further informed by Mr. Nelson, of Redcar, a naturalist who has made

the experiment, that it is impossible for an ordinary sea-boat, rowed by two men

and going at 5 miles per hour, to overtake the aquatic bird called the Great

Northern Diver when endeavouring to make his escape by alternately swimming

on the surface and diving telow. IJis speed is therefore nearly double the short

and five times the long distance speed of unaided man in water. As regards le-r-

maining under -water, fishes properly so called have unlimited powers, and even

Haquatic mammals, such as whales, can remain under for hour.

     Using only his own strength, but assisting himself with mechanical devices^
man has been able to increase considerably his speed as a swimming animal. Mr..
John McCall, of "Walthamstow, informs me that in 18GS he constructed and re-

peatedly used an apparatus which acted like the tail of a fish. It consisted of a.
piece of whalebone, having a broad yet thin and elastic blade, tapering into a
shank hke the end of an oar. The blade was 15 inches wide and 4 feet long,
including the shank. To the end of the latter a horizontal cross-bar 13 inches

long was fitted, and leather pockets were provided at the ends for the feet. By

swimming on his back and striking out alternately with his legs, he was able, with
the assistance of this apparatus, to keep up with a sea-boat pulled by two men

at about 4 miles per hour.

    By means of boats, which he propels by oars or sculls, and notwithstanding^
the increased weight, and therefore displacement, involved by them, man has been
able to increase his speed on the surface of the water to a maximum of about

12 miles per hour for about 4 miles distance, under favourable circumstances.
So, by supplementing his bodily powers by means of mechanical aids, such as the
diving-bell and the diving-helmet, dress, and air-pump, or by the portable self-

acting apparatus used with such good efiect in the construction of the Severn

Tunnel, man has been able to approach very nearly to the natural diving powers of,
at all events, aquatic mammals, except that he cannot move about in subaqueous

regions with anything approaching their ease and celerity.

     Invariably on water, as almost invariably on land, man is quite unable tO'

compete in power of locomotion with other specially adapted animals, whether or

not he avails himself of mechanical aids, so long as his own bodily strength is the-
only motive-power he employs. He has gradually come to recognise this fact, and
to see that he must use his inventive faculties and find new and powerful motors-

external to himself if he would really claim to dominate the great waters of the

earth.

     The fastest mechanism of any size, animal or man-made, which, as far as I
know, has ever cut its way through the waters for any considerable distance is the

torpedo-boat ' Ariete,' made by Messrs. Thornycroft & Son, of London, in 1887.

It has a displacement or total weight of about 110 tons, and machinery capable of
exerting 1,290 effective horse-power, or 11'7 horse-power per ton of weight or dis-
placement ; or, to put it in another form, an effective horse-power is by it obtained
from a weight of 191 lb., which includes vessel, machinery, fuel, stores, and atten-
dants. The speed accomplished at the trials of this little craft, being the average

of six one-mile tests, was 26-18 knots, or 30-16 miles per hour.^ As might be-

expected, it resembles a fish, in that its interior is almost exclusively devoted to the
machinery and accessories necessary for propulsion. During the trials the water,

Tw»fuel, stores, and other ponderable substances carried amounted to 17-35 tons.

similar boats were able to make the voyage to South America by themselves,

though at much slower speed and replenishing their fuel on the way. No fish or
swimming bird can match this performance. And inasmuch as 191 lb. of dead

weio-ht produced 1 horse-power, as compared with from 150 to 250 lb. in certain
flying birds, it would seem that with suitable adaptations the ' Ariete ' might even
have been made to navigate the air instead of the water.- But I will revert to

this subject later on.

--"be the leading features of ocean-transit steamers if they are to attain commercial

success there I must refer you to those magnificent examples of naval archi-

tecture which are more or less familiar to you all, and of which we, as a maritime

nation, are so justly proud. If, for example, we turn our attention for a moment

to the new Cunard liners, the ' Campania' and ' Lucania,' having each a weight or

displacement of 18,000 tons and 24,000 effective horse-power, or 1'33 horse-power

per ton of displacement, we shall find that, with the commercial advantages alluded
to, they obtain a maximum speed of 22'5 knots, or ahout 26 miles per hour.

If, instead of 1'33 effective horse-power per ton of displacement, they were

provided with eight times that amount, or 10'64 horse-power per ton, thereby

sacrificing passenger and cargo accommodation, and making them nearly as full of

propelling machinery as the ' Ariete ' torpedo-boat, and if it were then found

possible to apply this enormous power effectively, then there is every reason to

believe they would accomplish for short distances double the speed, or, say, 45 knots,

or about 52 statute miles, per hour.

By inventing and utilising mechanical contrivances entirely independent of his

own bodily strength, man can now pass over the surface of the waters at the rate

of over 500 knots per day, and at the same time retain the comforts and con-

veniences of life as though he were on shore. He has in this way beaten the

natural and specially fitted denizens of the deep in their own element, as regards

Wespeed and continuity of effort. But he is still behind them as to safety.      do

not find that fishes or aquatic mammals often perish in numbers, as man does, by

collisions in fogs, or by being cast on lee shores and rocks by stress of weather.

Shall we ever arrive at the point of making ocean travelling absolutely safe ? The

Cunard Company is able to boast that from its commencement, fifty-three years

ago, it has never lost a passenger's life or a letter; a statement which gives ground

for hope that almost absolute safety is attainable. But, on the other hand, other

owners of almost equal repute (not excluding the British Admiralty) are ever and

anon losing magnificent vessels on rocks, in collisions, by fire, and even by stress of

weather, in a way which makes us doubt whether it is possible for Britannia or

any one else really to * rule the waves.'

In one way the chances of serious disaster have been of late largely diminished,

and here, again. Nature has been oiur teacher. The bodies of all animals except

the very lowest are symmetrically formed on either side of a central longitudinal

plane. Each important limb is in duplicate, and if one side is wounded the other

  --Locomotion in Air. I now come to consider what is the position of man as

regards locomotion in and through the great atmospheric envelope which surrounds

the earth, in comparison with animals specially fitted by Nature for such work.

Nature seems never to bestow all her gifts on one individual or class of

animals, and she never leaves any entirely destitute. For instance, the serpent,

having no limbs whatever, would seem at first sight to be terribly handicapped

yet, in the language of the late Professor Owen, 'it can outclimb the monkey,

outswim the fish, outlejip the jerboa, and, suddenly loosing the close coils of its

crouching spiral, it can spring into the air and seize the bird on the wing.' ' Here

we have the spiral spring in nature before it was devised by man.
    Flying animals seem to conform remarkably to this law. Thus we have birds,

like the penguin, which dive and swim, but cannot fly ; others, like the gannet,
which dive, swim, fly, and walk; others, like the ostrich, which run, but can

neither fly nor swim ; and numberless kinds which can fly well, but have only

slight pedestrian powers.

    Man, unaided by mechanisms, can, as we have seen, walk, run, swim, dive, and
jump, and perform many remarkable feats ; but for flying in the air he is absolutely

unfitted. All his attempts (and there have been many) have up to the present

been unsuccessful, whether or not he has availed himself of mechanical aids to his

own bodily powers. It is said that a certain man fitted himself with apparatus in

the time of James VI. of Scotland, and actually precipitated himself from the cliff
below Stirling Castle, in sight of the king and his courtiers ; but the apparatus
coUap.sed, and he broke his leg, and that was the end of the experiment.

     But why should not man fly ? It is not that he does not desire to do so. For
every denizen of our precarious British climate, when he has noticed the ease with

which swallows and other migratory birds fly off on the approach of winter,
hundreds and even thousands of miles to the sunny south, must have wished he

could do the same. One reason why we cannot fly, even with artificial aids, such

as wings, is that, as in the case of the penguin or the ostrich, our bodily mechanism

is specialised and our muscular power diffused in other directions, so that we
could not actuate wings of sufficient area to carry us even if we had them.

     M. de Lucy, a French naturalist, has shown that the wing-area of flying
animals varies from about 49 square feet per lb. of weight in the gnat, and 5 square

feet in the swallow, to half a square foot per lb. of weight in the Australian crane,
which weighs 21 lb. and yet flies well. If he were to adopt the last or smallest

proportion, a man weighing 12 stone would requii'e a pair of wings each of them

14 feet long by 3 feet broad, or double the area of an ordinary room door, to carry
him, without taking into account the weight of the wings themselves.

     In flying birds there is a strong tripod arrangement to secure firm points of
attachment for the wings, and a deep keel in the breast-bone, to which the large
pectoral muscles are secured. Think of the wings I have described and the

absence of pivots, keel, and muscles in man, and it will be tolerably obvious why

he cannot fly, even with artificial wings.
     But it might be contended that a man's strength is in his legs rather than in

his arms, and that it is conceivable that a successful flying-apparatus might be
made if adapted for the most, instead of the least, favourable application of his

bodily strength.
     According to D. K. Olark,^ a labourer working all day exerts on an average

·13 horse- power. The maximum power of a very strong man for a very short time

is "46 horse-power.

     According to Dr. Haughton,'^ the oarsmen in a boat-race of 1 mile, rowed in
7 minutes, exerted each '26 horse-power.

    Suppose we take the rowing case as the maximum maintainable for, say,
7 minutes by a man weighing 168 lb. Then in flight he would have to sustain

a weight of

                                              1*^=046 lb.

                                                                   ·26

per horse-power exerted, besides the weight of the apparatus.

Now, we shall find later (see p. 871) that no birds support even half that

weight per horse-power which they have the power to exert, and that recent aero-

plane experiments prove its impossibility. On the ground, therefore, that he is

too heavy in proportion to his strength, it is clear that man is unfitted for flight,

as well as because his limbs are not adapted for it.

     It does not follow, however, that by aid of mechanisms apart from his own body,
and worked by power independent of his own strength, man may not imitate, com-

pete with, and even outdo the fowls of the air.

ALet us consider a few facts showing what birds can do,                                                     gannet hovers in

the air above the sea. Suddenly he nearly closes his wings, swoops down, and

with a splash disappears below the surface. Shortly after he reappears with a

fish in his mouth, which he swallows in  a few gulps                                                        then, after swimming on the

surface a little, he reascends into the air to repeat the operation.

The swallow rises into the air with a few rapid movements of the wings, then

slides down as though on an aerial switchback, and then up again till he nearly

reaches his original height, or he circles round by raising one wing, like a runner

rounding a curve.

The condor vulture, which measures sometimes 15 feet across the wings, will

 fly upwards till quite out of sight.

    A flock of cranes have been seen migrating at a height of three miles, and pro-

 ceeding apparently without any movement of the wings.

.

     The peregrine falcon will swoop down upon a partridge, and, missing it by a

doubling movement of the latter, will slide upwards, thus converting his kinetic

into new potential energy. He will then turn and descend again, this time securing

his prey.

Mr. J. E. Harting, one of the principal British ornithological authorities, has,

after careful investigation, arrived at the conclusion that the speed of falcons in

full flight is about 60 miles per hour.^

    Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier, another well-known authority, gives ^ the results of a

number of experiments on the speed of homing pigeons, made under the auspices

of the United Counties Flying Club in 1883. The average speed of Ihe winner in

eighteen races was 36 miles, and the maximum 65 miles per hour. The greatest

distance flown was 309 miles.

The albatross, the largest web-footed bird, measuring sometimes 17 feet from

tip to tip of wing, and weighing up to 20 lb., frequently accompanies ocean steamers

from the Cape to Melbourne, a distance of 5,500 knots, without being seen to rest

on the way.

    An American naturalist, Mr. J. Lancaster, who spent no less than five years on

the west coast of Florida,^ in order to study the habits of aquatic and other birds

which frequent these shores, arrived at the following conclusions, viz.

    Though all birds move their wings sometimes, many can remain indefinitely in

the air, with wings extended and motionless, and either with or without forward

movement. This he calls ' soaring.'

The wing-area of soaring birds varies from 1 to above 2 square feet per lb. of

weight.

The larger the wings per lb. of weight, the greater the power to soar.

The heavier the bird, the steadier his movements.

Soaring birds always face the wind, which, if they do not move forward or

downward, must not blow at a less speed than 2 to 5 miles per hour.

Mr. Lancaster specially watched a flock of buzzards about 30 feet above his

head, waiting for him to leave the body of a dead porpoise. Their wings were

about 8 feet from tip to tip, and their average weight about 6 lb. During three

hours at mid- day, when the wind which they faced was very strong, they flapped
Their wings about twenty times each. Later, during two hours, when the wind
had subsided, they never moved them at all.

Mr. Lancaster timed frigate birds, and found them able to go at the rate of 100

miles per hour,  and that on fixed  wings                                 he  is of  opinion that at all events  up  to
                                                                       ;

that speed they can fly just as fast as they please. He says, further, that the

same birds can live in the air a week at a time, night and day, without touching

a roost, and that buzzards, cranes, and gannets can do the same for several hours

at a time.

     The observed facts relating to the phenomena of flight are still but very imper-
fectly understood. That a bird should be able to maintain a downward pressure
on the air sufiicient to counteract the efl'ect of its own weight, and a backward

pressure sufiicient to force itself forward at such speeds as I have named, seems

wonderful enough when it is known that it continuously operates its wings. But

that it should be able to do the same without any muscular movement at all is

almost incomprehensible. It seems to be an instance of the suspension of the laws

of gravity and of the existence of cause without effect, and of efl'ect without cause. It

is not a case of flotation, like a balloon, for any bird falls to the earth like a stone

when shot. Mr. Lancaster .suggests that the bird's own weight is the force which

enables him to counteract the effect thereof, but this explanation is, I confess,

beyond my comprehension.

    It, seems to me that for every pound of liis weight pressing downwards there must

be an equivalent force pressing upwards. This can he produced only by his giving
downward motion to the air previously at rest, or by his arresting previous motion
of air in an upward direction. The latter alternative involves the supposition that
the air-currents which soaring birds face are not, as Mr. Lancaster believes, always
horizontal, but must have, to some extent, an upward direction. If a parachute
were falling in a current of air, which was moving upwards at the same rate as
the parachute fell, it would obviously retain its level, yet gravity would be acting.
So, if a bird with extended wings were sliding down a stream of air which was
tending upwards at the same angle and same velocity, the phenomenon of soaring

--would be produced.
      Weight of Birds in Belation to their Bulk. It is generally believed that birds
are lighter, bulk for bulk, than other animals, and that to this lightness they owe,

in some degree, their power of flight and of floating on water. To account for
this it is said that their bone-cavities are filled with air, and that some, though

not even all, flj'ing birds have small air-sacs under the skin. It is clear, however,
that displacement of external air by air-filled cavities can only assist aerial
flotation to an infinitesimal extent, unless highly heated. Such cavities would,
however, help aquatic birds to swim, if situated under the immersed portion of
their bodies, which is not always the case.

     Some aquatic birds, such as swans, swim with head, neck, wings, tail,
and half their bodies out of the water. The specific gravity of fishes and land
animals is clearly about the same as water. For, when swimmmg, they can keep
only a small portion of their heads above the surface, and that by continued exer-

tion. Are, then, birds, in the substance of their bodies, less dense than other
animals, although also composed of flesh, blood, and bone, and these components
in similar proportions and of similar character and texture ? If they are, then

land animals might have been made lighter in proportion to their bulk or smaller
in proportion to their weight than they have been. If they are not, how is it
 that some of them can swim and float high out of the water ?

      Having an opportunity recently of inspecting a large wild, or whooper, swan,
 I ascertained its weight to be 14 lb. I noticed that the whole of the under-part
 of the body, which would be immersed when swimming, was covered with feathers

Hand underlined with down to an average depth of not less than inch, or, when

 closely pressed, say, 1\ inch. The immersed surface I estimated at \^ square
 foot. The weight oif water displaced by this feather and down jacket, and the
 consequent extra buoyancy produced thereby, was no less than 9*78 lb. This
 would account for twivthirds of the bird's body being out of water when swimming,
 even if the body were of the same specific gravity as water.

      I next procured a freshly-shot wild duck, which weighed 23- lb., and placed it
 in a tank of sea-water. It floated. I found the area of its immersed surface to

 be 54 square inches, and the average depth of its under-feathers and down to be
 f inch. The water displaced by this envelope would weigh 1'5 lb., and would

 support three-fifths of its entire weight. I then had it denuded of all its feathers
 and down, and again placed in the tank. It then slowly sank to the bottom.

      These experiments, so far as they go, seem to prove conclusively that birds
 are not lighter, bulk for bulk, than other animals, but, on the other hand, about
 the same specific gravity, and that their floating power lies entirely in the thick
jacket or life-belt with which nature has furnished those, and those only, which
 are intended to swim.

      Inasmuch, therefore, as the specific gi-avityof the actual bodies of all animals
 appears to be about the same, there is no reason to believe that any could have
 been constructed of lighter material or to lighter design.

   --Weight in Relation to their Energy. But notwithstanding this uniformity of

specific gravity, there remains the curious fact that flying birds can exert continu-

--ously about three times the horse-power per lb. of weight that man can and,

indeed, about three times what is possible for the horse.' This marvellous flow of
energy in proportion to weight is probably due to rapidity of limb-action rather

                                                ' See pp. 868 and 871.
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION 0.  871

than to increase of muscular stress. I have timed sea-gulla and found them to flap
their wings two hundred times per minute when flying at about 24 knots per
hour, and haye estimated eider-ducks, making about 3G knots per hour, to be
flapping their wings five hundred times in a minute. I say ' estimated,' for their
movements are too rapid for precise counting. This outpouring of energy, which

seems to me to be unequalled in terrestrial animals, is nevertheless maintained by

birds for indefinitely long periods of time.

   A proportionately increased rate of combustion and renovation of tissue as well

as of food-consumption are necessary consequences. The higher temperature of
the bodies of birds, as compared with other animals,' and the well-known voracity
of those which, like sea-birds, are almost continuously on the wing, are circum-

stances which seem to point to the same conclusion. It is confirmed by what we
know of steam and other motors. For instance, if a steamship were so built and

proportioned that a ton of coal per hour consumed in the boilers would maintain the
pressure at 100 lb. per square inch and produce 1,000 horse-power at the propeller;
and then if, without other alteration, tiring was slackened until the steam fell to
50 lb. per square inch, and there maintained, it is clear that the horse-power pro-
duced would be greatly lessened, and so would the temperature of the steam in
the boilers, steam-pipes, and cylinders. Thus, other things being equal, the tem-
perature of the steam would rise and fall with the energy given forth by the

mechanism.
     The suggestion is that the higher temperature of birds, as compared with other

animals, is similarly connected with their superior power of producing and main-

taining energetic efibrt.

                                                AERIAL NAVIGATION.

    Let us now consider what man has done, and may be able to do, in aerial

navigation by aid of contrivances which, as in the case of railway locomotives and
ocean steamers, are propelled by a power other than that of his own body.

     The scientific world is greatly indebted to Mr. Hiram S. Maxim, of London, for

recording in a clear and readable form the present position of aeronautic mechanisms,-*
So far, the only contrivances which have been fairly successful are balloons, which,
unlike birds, depend on atmospheric displacement for their power of sustaining

weight or rising or falling.
      In balloon experiments our French neighbours have led the way, from the

first attempt of the Montgolfier brothers in 1783. During the last twenty years
they have made numerous experiments and substantial improvements. Captain

Henard and other officers of the French Army have constructed a fish-shaped

apparatus, and inflated it with hydrogen. It is driven by an electric motor of
8i horse-power, and has sufficient buoyancy to carry two aeronauts and all neces-
«ary accessories. In fair weather Captain Renard has succeeded in travelling at
the rate of 12| miles per hour, in steering in any direction, and even in returning
to his point of departure. The balloon, it is said, always keeps level, and so far
there have not been any accidents ; but no expedition has been attempted in wet
or windy weather.

     Except that a more powerful motor, going at a higher speed, might be fitted

to such an apparatus, Mr. Maxim thinks that it is as near perfection as is ever likely
to be reached by a machine depending on aerial flotation. He proceeds to give an
account of some experiments made by Professor S. P. Langley, of the Smithsonian
Institute, Washington, and of others by himself, to ascertain how much power is
required to produce artificial flight by means of aero-planes, after the manner of

tirds, and whether such power can be obtained without exceeding the weight which
it would itself sustain.

    He says that heavy birds, with relatively small wings, carry about 150 lb. per

horse-power exerted, and birds such as the albatross and vulture probably about
250 lb. Professor Langley, with small slanting planes, was able to carry 250 lb>
per horse-power exerted ; and Mr. Maxim, using heavier weights in proportion to
plane-area, 133 lb. per horse-power, and using lighter ones, nearly the same as
Professor Langley.

     Mr. Maxim has lately devoted his energies to constructing a motor which

--should meet the requirements of the case, and has succeeded, he says, in producing

one a steam-engine burning naphtha and with atmospheric condenser, within a

total weight of 8 lb. per horse-power. He thinks, however," that by using light

naphtha and its vapour in the boiler instead of water, as well as in the furnace as

fuel, a weight as low as 5 lb. per horse-power may be reached.

     Meanwhile Professor Langley "s ideas have been embodied in an experimental
flying-machine, a drawing and description of which will be found in the ' Daily
Graphic ' for July 1, 1893. The body, which resembles that of a bird and is 15
feet long, contains the propelling machinery in duplicate. The wings, which
are 40 feet across, are of China silk spread on a tubular framework, stiffened with
wire trusses. The boilers use liquid fuel and contain a highly volatile fluid. The
capabilities of the machine have not yet been practically tested.

     Promising as are the results hitherto obtained, they are as yet far from placing
us on a level with birds in power to utilise the atmosphere as a navigating medium.
The absolutely necessary power of delicate guiding, in rising, falling, and turning,
whatever the direction or force of the wind, has yet to be considered and worked

out. What would happen in case of a temporary breakdown of the aero-plane
machinery we shudder to think of

    An important step has been efi'ected by the discovery that parachutes with

tubular orifices at the top are comparatively safe appliances for descending to the

earth from indefinitely high altitudes. Perhaps it may be arranged that each

aeronaut should be able, at a moment's warning, to gird himself with one of these
as witli a life-belt on board ship, and so descend in safety, or one or more auto-
matically opening in case of disaster might be fitted to the aero-plane as a whole.

EVENTTTAL EXHAUSTION OF FUEL-STJPPLT.

I have still to refer to one other question, the consideration of which must

Wealways give rise to very serious thoughts.  have seen that the decisive vic-

tories which, in modern times, man has gained over matter and over other animals

have been due to his use of power derived from other than animal sources. That

power has invariably proceeded from the combustion and the destruction of fuel,

the accumulations of which in the earth are necessarily limited.

Mechanical appliances, involving the consumption of fuel, have, for a century

at least, been multiplying with alarming rapidity. Our minds have been set
mainly on enlarging the uses and conveniences of man, and scarcely at all on

economising the great sources of power in nature, which are now for the most part

its fuels. Terrible waste of these valuable stores is daily going on in almost every

department of use. Once exhausted they can never be replaced. They have been
drawn upon to some extent for 1,000 years, and extensively for more than 100.

--Authorities say that another 1,000 years will pxhaust all the more accessible

supplies. But suppose they last 5,000 years what then? Why, then, as far as
we can at present see, our only motive-powers will be wind and water and animals,
and our only mode of transit, sailing and rowing, driving, cycling, riding, and

walking.

     Sir Eobert Ball has estimated that in not less than 5,000,000 and not more
than 10,000,000 years the sun will have become too cold to support life of any
kind on this planet. Between the 5,000 years when fuel will certainly be ex-
hausted and the 5,000,000 years when all life may be extinguished, there will still
be 4,995,000 years when, according to present appearances, man will have to give
up his hardly-earned victories over matter and other animals, and the latter will
again surpass him, each in its own element, because he has no fuel.

    Leaving to our posterity these more remote troubles, we may, I think, justly
draw from the entire discussion the conclusion that we have still a great deal tc\

learn from mechanisms as they exist in nature. Great as have been the achieve-

ments of man since he first began to study mechanical science, with a view to

directing the great sources of power in nature for his own use and convenience,

Wethe entire field of research is by no means yet fuUy exhausted.  must continue

to study the same science with undiminished ardour. In so doing we shall do well

to bear in mind that success can be achieved only by the patient, accurate, and

conscientious observation of the great facts of nature, which are equally open to

us all and waiting for our attention ; and by drawing correct inferences therefrom,
and by applying such inferences correctly to the fulfilment of the future needs and

destiny of our race.

2. On Lace Machinery. By B. Doughty.

The commencement of the machine for making lace may be dated about 1764,

when the old-fashioned stocking machine had been in existence about 200 year.=,

about which time certain discoveries and improvements were made which enabled

it to produce a net, at that time considered to be a great achievement, thus

making the stocking machine virtually the first lace uiacbine. In the course of

the next few years various other improvements by skilful mechanics were made,

which ultimately ended in producing a very useful net for embroidering purposes,

finding employment for a large number of machines, as well as women and girls.

Very slow progress was made          in  the  development of  invention                                                but this is,
                                                                                                                    ;

perhaps, not much to be surprised at, considering that the ordinary mechanical

tools in use were of the simplest description : tliere were no labour-saving self-act-

ing tools with a steam engine for motive power to be found in any workshop then,

and every tool, except files, had to be made by the workman himself, who also

had to make every screw, holt, and nut that he required.

The absolute necessity to supply himself with nearly every one of his require-

ments made the mechanic of that time a man of great resources, and contributed

very much to his inventive faculties. At that time nearly every part of the

machine was constructed of wrought iron, except the large framework, which was

made of wood, cast iron being almost unknown then in machine making.

Further developments of the stocking machine led to the making of the warp

machine, which had many details in common with its original, though very

different in some respects. At one time great numbers of warp machines were

employed in making a very useful cloth with which our sailors were clothed for

years. Similar cloth has come into use again the last ten years under the name

of Stockinette, being very elastic.

But a net was wanted, like that made by hand on the Continent, called

Brussels net. After many trials by inventors Ileathcote succeeded in making-

the exact net itself, and resulted in making his fortune, though it ruined hundreds

of machine-owners who made net that had previously been used for the same

purpose. Heathcote's machine was protected by patents, which many tried to

evade by making the net on other machines. One man named Leavers originated

a different machine, which after many alterations has come down to our time aa

the most useful lace machine we have.

curtains.

     The paper opens with historical references to the early forms of machinery for
knitting, and shows what enormous strides have been made in improving their
mechanical design and construction, what great progress in loop-forming capacity
advancing from 500 to 500,000 loops per minute--and how large and varied is the
present scope of the trade, embracing, as it does, not only all forms of knitted
underwear, but also stockinette cloth, astrachaus, Cardigan jackets, Tam-o'-
Shanter caps, down to bags in which to import foreign mutton. The new era in
the making of stockings is next specially dwelt on and the main reasons given for
the return to domestic machinery, among which are its cheapness, the low rate of
wages for which country people will work, the fact that the goods require so little
finishing that manufacturers have no factory expenses, and that much more com-
fortable socks and stockings are produced on these machines than on earlier types.
The attempts recently made to successfully compete with the domestic machinery
are next mentioned, the cosmopolitan spirit of jS ottingham machinists shown in
their introducing American machines into England, chief among which machines

are the ' Shaw,' ' Scott & Williams,' and ' Aiken ' machines, on which one girl will

knit from fifty to eighty dozen pairs of half-hose per week, but which, unlike their
rivals, are confined to the making of plain, i.e., not ribbed fabrics. The_ probable

--lines of future development, though somewhat difficult to forecast, are indicated,

and may be summarised thus : Machinery which will work either by foot-pedals

or steam power, and in which the narrowing, widening, changing of ribs, and
forming of heels, toes, &c., will be manipulated by hand in a similar manner to

that in which a typewriter is worked.

      4. On the Disposal of Refuse. By William Warner, A.M.I.C.E.

     The treatment of refuse upon scientific principles was commenced by Mr. Alfred
Fryer eighteen years ago.

     Dry house refuse, mixed refuse, excrementitious matter, and sewage refuse
treatment had been in the experimental stage for some time, but no one had shown
                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                              875

that it was possible to deal with these objectionable matters without creating a

nuisance. The appliances then introduced were only used at a yery heavy cost to

ratepayers.

Although most of Mr. Fryer's inventions dealt with refuse in a divided form, as

resulting from the introduction of the pail system, he also provided for the treat-

ment of refuse from middens.

The pail system was then believed to be the right thing by most sanitarians,

and Mr. Fryer's attention was turned to the pure excrementitious matter collected,

from pail closets.

The author referred to the crude and unsatisfactory methods in use. The mid-

dens were built above the ground level, and had only capacity to allow of small

accumulation of refuse. It was found by experiments that excrementitious matter,
when kept entirely separated, would produce a very valuable manure, which is
worth at the present time 6/. per ton, and those towns treating it in the best
apparatus had gained a fair revenue. Towns situated in agricultural districts are

able to dispose of their sewage sludge, after pressing it, at a price which covers the
cost of treatment ; but many towns find it difficult to dispose of it. Experiments

indicate that sewage sludge might be used successfully in the manufacture of bricks
with specially designed machmery and kilns.

    Koad refuse is now much reduced by the good condition of the roads. Road
sweepings when collected are not valuable as a fertiliser, and therefore are of little

value to land, and will not burn even in destructors unless mixed with a large

proportion of house refuse. Most authorities tip up the road sweepings upon waste

land at considerable expense, and at the risk of creating a nuisance. There is,
however, some value for this refuse, as the author has proved from a series of experi-

ments conducted by him for a special committee of the Kensington Vestry. As

to the disposal of house refuse for a town the size of Nottingham, producing

approximately 400 tons per day, if the greater portion of the refuse were sent to

farmers, and a small portion to a destructor, figures show that it is not possible to

look forward to a large amount of power for electric lighting ; it is even question-
able whether the power thus generated could be applied usefully for that purpose.

Supposing its refuse to have the average steam-producing qualities, about 300

horse-power will be obtained for an expenditure in labour of nearly 17/. per day,

equal to over 5,000Z. per annum.
     With coal the cost of labour would be only 150/. per annum, and the cost of

coal for fuel would be under 1,500/.; therefore, taking the refuse to cost nothing'

for delivery at a destructor works conveniently situated for producing electricity,

the actual loss would amount to no less than .3,350/. per annum over coal fuel, and

if they took into consideration the cost for repairs and interest on capital, this loss
would be greatly increased.

     Looking these facts into the face electric light produced by burning refuse could
only show economical results in very exceptional cases, and authorities should

consider the matter carefully before launching into a scheme of this kind.  »ai«r»

The author has estimated the cost of burning at 10^. per ton, but if the treat-

ment would cost l^., the increased loss would be 1,245/. per annum, making a total

loss of 4,590/. per annum.

Taking the comparison of burning refuse in different kinds of destructors, these

figures should be taken carefully into consideration, as Id. per ton more in the cost
of burning means over 600/. per annum in a town the size of Nottingham.

      5. On Warming and Ventilation. By Frank Ashwell, M.I.M.E.

     The subject of warming and ventilation has been chosen by the author, as he is
of opinion it is not yet so fully and generally studied as its importance demands,
and he trusts the remarks which he will have to offer, supported as they are by
very considerable practical experience, may prove of some interest. The principle
of mens sana in corpore sano is as true to-day as ever, and with improved condi-
tions of life the mind will have more chance to develop itself. The author contends
                                                                                                            --
                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

876 REPORT-- 1893.

that a great advance has heen made in the last year or two in the ventilation of

large public and private buildings, to which class of buildings he will more

--particularly confine himself, and that if only a sufficient by no means extrava-
--gant amount of money is provided for it, some really definite results can be

guaranteed.

It will not be necessary here to give an elaborate statement why it is necessary

to provide for a proper supply of heat and pure air to our schools and public

buildings ; this has to some extent been done in the paper itself, which has been

printed  for circulation, and which may  be  referred to                                                    but the author would  like,
                                                                                                         ;

to point out at once that, in his opinion, no scheme of ventilation is complete

which does not provide at the same time for the warming of the incoming air.

    The various methods of ventUation may be grouped under two heads, viz.,

ventilation by natural means and ventilation by artificial or mechanical means.
    Not much need be said here about natural ventilation, as it is now almost

generally admitted that it is not suited for the ventilation of large public or private

buildings, and in the future remarks attention will only be paid to mechanical

ventilation, which will be subdivided again into mechanical ventilation by extrac-
tion (Vacuum system) and mechanical ventilation by impulsion (Plenum sj'stem).

The author's firm has had the good fortune to carry out a large number of

ventilation schemes in various parts of the country, in which either the one or the

other system or combinations of the two have been employed, some of which have

been described in the paper at considerable length with the aid of eight diagrams

and he has come to the conclusion that, where the Plenum system can be employed,

it is the best and most reliable of all the schemes of ventilation. It is assumed

here that the scheme is well designed, well carried out, and M-ell superintended,

as no scheme whatsoever has a fair chance if these conditions have not been

complied with.

One of the chief drawbacks of the Vacuum system is the uncertainty as to the

purity of the incoming air, which will be drawn from that place that offers

the least resistance to the passage of the air, and if badly constructed drains and

sewers are near it may come from these.

Various objections have been raised against the Plenum system, and it is said

to have been a failure in several cases. Of course the author cannot attempt to

deal with installations put up by other gentlemen, but he would most emphatically

say that his experience, which he has given in the paper, does not bear out those

contentions, which not unfrequently have proceeded from quarters interested in

ventilation by natural means.

All the objections cannot be considered here, but one or two of the more

prominent ones will be dealt with shortly in the following remarks :

    1. As to breakdowns of the machinery.

It has been stated that if the engine breaks down no fresh air can be supplied

till it is repaired.

In this respect the system stands on the same basis as all other so-called

natural or mechanical schemes of ventilation, with this advantage, perhaps, that

an accident to the machinery is at once noticed, and can be remedied without

delay, whereas a breakdown in a patent cowl or some such appliance may not be

noticed for a considerable time, as nobody attends to it.

It would, however, not be true to say that during a breakdown no fresh air at

all will be supplied : this would only be the case during the warm weather, and

then the openings of the windows will soon remedy it. During a breakdown in

winter the hot air will still, to some extent, ventilate the rooms till the repairs are

complete. This would be the condition of things in cases where no duplicate

power is provided ; but where this has been done, either by an extraction-tower, as
at Nottingham, or a fan in the roof driven by an electric motor or by a duplicate

engine at the air inlet, then no inconvenience at all will be felt during repairs ;
and though this course will prove somewhat more expensive at first, yet in the long

run it will be the cheapest, and should be adopted in all cases where a temporarily

reduced supply of fresh air entails hardship or danger to life. If this is done, then

it may safely be asserted that the Plenum system is the most reliable system of

Tentilation.
                                                            TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                       877

2. As to sclietne being too complicated.

It is quite true that any scheme of mechanical ventilation is more complicated

than schemes of natural or so-called automatic ventilation; but Plenum schemes

are by no means too complicated for successful working, as is proved by the

experience gained in all parts of the globe.

     To say that a natural scheme of ventilation is uninterruptedly at work all the
year romid is, to say the least, very misleading. It may be true that the atmo-
sphere is always in motion ; but then this motion may be so infiuitesimally small at

--times as to cause no movement of air at all in our buildings a state of affairs

well known to all those who have to rely on this kind of ventilation.                                                     r

The addition of the machinery is a safeguard for the regular supply of air in

the proper quantities, and it is far better and wiser in all matters concerning so

immediately the health of countless thousands as ventilation does to have a special

man constantly attending to it, rather than leave it to itself, and all sorts of

mishaps.

3. As to cost of scheme.

     It is undoubtedly a most important matter to consider very carefully the cost

of any ventilation scheme ; but when comparing the expenses in connection with

two different modes of ventilation for one building, great care must be taken to

place the two schemes exactly, as far as this is possible, on the same basis as to the

purity of air supplied, the quantity, the regularity, the convenience of working

them, &c. If this is not done the results obtained will be utterly useless and mis-

leading                                      but  whenever  this  is  done,  and  all  the  circumstances  of  the  case  considered,
                                          ;

the author is confident that the expenses in connection with the Plenum system

wiU not be found excessive. He has not prepared any figures, as he is of opinion

general figures are frequently totally misleading, and for this reason he would

recommend the consideration of the question of cost afresh for each particular case.

Concerning the value of other methods of ventilation, one of which it may be

necessary to adopt where the Plenum system cannot be installed, the author wishes

it to be understood that he by no means' condemns them; that, on the contrarv,

each has its special advantages under certain conditions. In each individual case

the ventilating engineer will have to investigate first its special circumstances and

requirements, no two cases being alike, and then he will have to select his scheme

accordingly.

In concluding his remarks on warming and ventilation the author desires to

make it clear that his aim throughout has been to state his case fairly and fully,

and he trusts he has succeeded in this ; if, at the same time, he has been able to

increase the interest in this question of vital importance, then all his efforts will be

well repaid.

                                                  6. On Modern Watchmaking. By T. P. Hewitt.

         7. On Patent Percussive Tool for Calking, Chipping, Mining.
                                  By J. MacEwan Ross.

    The tool which the author now brings under notice is composed of few parts,

and those are of the most substantial character.
     The piston is a solid steel forging, truly turned and ground into the cylinder, so

as to work or float quite freely, and this is the only moving part in the tool. It is
about 3 in. long, slightly reduced at the centre where the actuating fluid is intro-
duced into the cylinder.

     The handle of the outer casing is cast hollow. One side is truly bored out and
fitted with a brass piston valve covering the outlet of exhaust.

    This valve is fitted with a trigger which when drawn back by the finger sets
the tool in motion by allowing the exhaust to escape.

    One man, by the use of this tool, can do as much work in a given time as five
to ten men can do when calking by hand.

     The principle upon which the tool works is as follows. The piston is turned
                              --

878 KEPOET-- 1893.

 as tefore stated, reduced at the centre, leaving a collar on each end. The inside
 edges of these collars form the cut-off edges for pressure, while the outside edges

govern the exhaust ports. When the piston is in its central position in the cylinder,

there is a dead point for pressure and exhaust. But when the piston rests on the
end of the chisel, and the tool is pressed up to its work, the inlet port is opened on
the front side, and the exhaust port at the hack end of the cylinder. Therefore, when
the exhaust trigger valve is opened, a load of about seventy times the piston's mass
 acts on the end of the piston, and sends it at an enormous velocity, which carries
it over the dead point until it is cushioned at the back end of the cylinder, and

similarly on its return stroke until it hits the chisel head.

     The tool also works equally well with steam, special provision being made to
prevent the heat of the steam from inconveniencing the workman. The tool is
now largely used for calking, and it has been applied with success to the operations
of chipping and dressing plates and castings.

      It is also capable of boring a 1-in. hole through sandstone at the rate of about
 12 in. per minute, and through whinstone at about 4^ in. per minute.

     It is largely used by many of the leading railway companies, engineers, and

shipbuilders throughout the country.

     The following Papers were read :

1. On the Relative Cost of Conductors with Different Systems of Electric
                       Poioer Transmission. By Gisbeet Kapp.

     Owing to difficulties of insulation and flashing at the commutator, long-distance
transmission of power by continuous current is not so practicable as by alternating
currents, where the generating and receiving apparatus can easily be insulated to
any desired degree. The working pressure is thus limited, not by the apparatus at
either end, but by the difficulties of insulating the line, and in comparing various
systems of power transmission it is necessary to place all on an equal footing as
regards stress on the insulation of the line. Taking a transmission plant with
continuous currents as the standard of comparison, and assuming in all cases the
same distance, total power, efficiency, and safety against breakdown of the insula-
tion, the author finds that the single-phase two-wire system of transmission by
alternating currents requires double the weight of copper as compared with con-
tinuous currents. The same ratio applies to the double-phase alternating current
sent over four wires, but if the system is worked with a common return (i.e., em-
ploying only three wires), the weight of copper is increased to 2'9 times that of
the equivalent continuous current system. This increase is due to the fact that by
tying two of the conductors together the absolute potential between the other two
and between either and earth is increased, and to get back to the original condition
of stress on the insulation the working pressure has to be lowered. With the three-

phase three-wire system the weight of copper is only 1'5 time that of the equi-
valent continuous current system, showing that as regards economy of copper the
three-phase system has an appreciable advantage over the single and the two-phase
systems.

  2. On the Utilisation of Waste Water-power for Generating Electricity.
                                 By Albion T. Snell.

    On the Continent water-power is extensively used for driving electric plants,

but in Great Britain, for a similar purpose, power is usually derived from the
combustion of coal.

     This difference in practice is partly the result, no doubt, of the relative supply
                                                                                       :

                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                879

of water-power in the neighbourhood of places where electric plants would prove

Wecommercially profitable ; but it is also largely due to the relative cost of fuel.

do not possess abundant natural sources of water-power in or near our large manu-
facturing districts, and even if we did it is not probable that with coal at the

average price of the last ten years water-power would prove much cheaper when

the capital invested, interest, and cost of maintenance of the electric plant were

taken into consideration. But we may with reason pause to ask two questions
Will coal at such a price be always obtainable ? And do we make the most of
such water-power as we have and can profitably use ? Let us look at the second

question first. Liverpool is supplied with water from Lake Vyrnwy, in North

Wales, the total difierence of head being about 500 feet. There must be a consider-

able quantity of power in the conduit. Is any of it utilised ? And if not, does the

3'eason lie in the fact that fuel at present is so cheap? Could the Manchester

Waterworks, which form a magnificent series of artificial lakes, be utilised to

drive turbines and give electric energy for lighting the various towns in their

vicinity ? Again, the watershed behind Greenock has a fall of many hundred

feet, and the water is only partly utilised to drive mills. These are only a few in-

stances in which water-power might perhaps be advantageously used for driving

turbine dynamos. There are, of course, numerous mountain streams which could
be dammed, and thus converted into reservoirs for feeding turbines.

There is still much misconception on the part of the responsible advisers of

manufacturers and mineral owners as to the possibilities of electricity for the

transmission of power. But the experience gained during the last decade is
gradually making itself felt, and the most conservative must admit it has given us

the means of iitilising natvu-al water-power in a far more efficient manner than was

formerly possible.

Various plants, typical of Continental practice, were then referred to by the

writer. They diflPer widely, both as regards size, method, and details ; but they

are all designed on the broad lines of utilising waste water-power, and transmitting

its energy electrically to towns where it can be usefully expended.

The writer says that alternate currents appear to be generally selected, perhaps,

because they ofi'er more advantages than direct currents for high pressures, and

are generally more easily managed; and in several cases it has been deemed

advisable to use a direct-current distribution with an alternate-current transmission,

as at Cassel.

The LaufFen-Heilbronn plant is at present the only important instance of a

rotary-current system, and there considerable difficulty is found in balancing the

load on the two circuits.

In England there are only a few installations which derive their power from

water, such as the small central station for lighting Lynmouth and Lynton, and a
Afew private installations.
                             scheme, on [a large scale, for electrically lighting

Worcester by means of power derived from the river Severn is in hand, and will,

no doubt, lead to similar plants.

One of the most important instances of the application of water-power for

electric power transmission in Great Britain is that at the Greenside Silver Lead

Mines in Cumberland, which was designed by the writer about three years ago.

    On the east slopes of Hellvelyn lies a small natural lake called the Red Tarn,

and on the north-east the impounded water of Keppel Cove. Between the
two waters rises the hill of Catstycam, at the base of which the two overflows

join, and near to which the Greenside Silver Lead Mining and Smelting Company

have erected their turbine-dynamo station. Tlie water is led from an elevation of

1,750 feet above sea-level, and flows through an open watercourse 1^ mile in

length to a large reservoir, from which it is conveyed down the hill-side for a dis-

tance of .360 yards in 15-inch cast-iron pipes. The fall at the station is equivalent

to a vertical head of 400 feet, and the effective horse-power is about 200.

    The generating station contains one of Gilkes & Co.'s vortex turbines of

100 horse-power, driving a four-pole compoimd dynamo.

The electric current is conveyed by two bare copper conductors on poles for

six furlongs, and then enters the mine at an elevation of 1,850 feet above the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

sea-level. The conductors from this point are insulated and covered with lead.
About three-quarters of a mile in the mine, or 1^ mile from the dynamo,
a 9-horse-power series motor is employed to wind ore from a set of sinkers.
Further into the mine another quarter of a mile, and down 120 yards at the bottom
level, is G.xed another 9-horse-power motor, working a three-throw pump, forcing
the water 360 feet in height.

     About midway between these motors there is fixed a dynamotor, which reduces
the pressure from 600 to 250 volts for working an electro-locomotive in the lowest
day level of the mine, through which runs the water ptimped from the 120-yard3
level and the whole of the water used by two hydraulic winding engines. Four
horses formerly worked this level. The locomotive runs with twelve waggons, the
total weight when loaded being eighteen tons, and does the work of the four
horses with the greatest ease. The conductors in the level are phosphor bronze
wire, and the current is fed to the locomotive by four contact pulleys.

     The chief difficulty attending the use of water-power is the irregular and some-
times intermittent character of the supply, and hence it is necessary to exercise
great care in judging the suitability of water for given work. This can be obviated
to a large extent by building reservoirs and regulating the output according to the
power required ; but when lighting forms an important part of the scheme,
secondary batteries maybe used most advantageously. Accumulators act not only
as reservoirs, but also as regulators, storing up excess of power, and giving it out
when the prime power is insufficient or the turbines ai'e stopped. They are there-
fore especially useful on installations for combined power and light when the

water-power varies intermittently. And they may be made a source of economy
when power is not required both by day and by night, and owing to the want of a

suitable reservoir the water runs to waste during the idle period ; then accumula-

tors may be used to store the major part of this energy for electric lighting,

metallurgical, or even power purposes.
      It will be gathered that the writer is fully aware the small water-power of

Great Britain can never show results equivalent to those obtained on the Continent
yet there is undoubtedly much water-power wasted here that is capable of being
profitably utilised. His object is simply to call attention to the improved means
 of utilising water-power by the turbine dynamos, and to suggest that prompt
measures be taken to conserve as much power as possible by a proper attention to

the building of dams and reservoirs wherever this may be feasible ; and that such

power should be used if convenient, to the exclusion of coal, and, if not so, as an
auxiliary power, the steam plant being used as a stand-by as much as possible.
 This proposal, if properly carried out, would decrease the total consumption of coal
to a greater extent than is generally supposed, and would make a number of manu-
 facturers less dependent upon it than they are to-day, even if it did not appreciably
 cheapen the cost of power. But in a number of favoured cases there can be no
 doubt that water-power properly applied would considerably decrease the cost of
  working, allowing a proportionate gain to both producer and consumer.

     3. On a new Form of Variable Power-gear for Electric Railways and
               Tramways. By W. Worbt Beaumont, M.Inst. G.E.

      It is a matter of great importance on electrical railways and tramways that the

 maximum steam-engine power at work in the generating station should be as little
 above the mean load as possible.

     It is found on electrical railways now at work that there is a great waste of

 power, and therefore of fuel, in consequence of the large consumption of current in

 getting the trains into motion by motors attached directly to the axles. On the
 South London Railway it is found that the power employed electrically in over-

 coming the inertia of the train is from 25 to 50 and 60 per cent, greater than that
 required to keep the train going.

      Mr. J. H. Greathead, M.I.O.E., the engineer of this railway, has shown that
 if this could be avoided from 20 to 30 per cent, of the engine power which must

under present conditions be kept running might be shut down. The author shows

this by diagrams representing the variation in the consumption of power in the

working of this railway, as given by Mr. Greathead.

For several reasons the employment of geared locomotives is undesirable on

railways, although single-reduction gearing is most generally adopted for tram-

ways, and probably will remain best for that purpose. The noise made by high-

speed gearing and the wear are both objectionable, otherwise a geared locomotive

offers the means of overcoming, to some extent, the losses referred to.

      In the paper the author shows how an intermediate course can be adopted,

which will entirely remove the loss of power at the generating station. The

electric motor is placed directly on the driving-axle, but is reduced in size and

power to more nearly that of the mean horse-power required on the road. This,

for the greater part of the journey of a train from station to station, drives the axle

upon which it is placed, at its own speed, just as those do which are now upon the

South London Railway. The motor is. however, on a hollow spindle, which drives
the axle, when starting a train, through the medium of a compact double clutch

containing one pair of epicycloidal reducing wheels. The clutches are operated ty

electro-magnets or by fluid pressure.

The train or locomotive may by this means be started at from one-fourth to

one-seventh of the speed of the motor. After a few seconds, the inertia of the

train having been overcome, the motor, the clutch-gear, and the driving-axle are

solidly coupled, and all move as one piece, the gearing only working during the

starting of the train.

The motor may thus run idle upon the axle, or may drive the latter at one-

Aseventh of its speed, or at its own speed.                                 breakdown leaves the locomotive in

the condition of a gearless engine.

For tramcars similar apparatus is described in the paper, which will drive the

car by a direct motor with starting ratio of gear of about six to one, or by single

reduction gearing will drive the car either at the usual gear ratio of about four t®

one, or, for starting, at a ratio of about twenty-four to one.

5. On a Mechanical System of Electrical Conductors. By E. Payne.

These conductors have been designed with the object of providing a system of

mechanical conductors, constructed without the use of vegetable substances, which

shall not be open to the objection sometimes urged against the wood-casing and

covered wires usually employed for interior wiring, viz., that they are not composed

of fireproof and imperishable materials like gaspipes, waterpipes, and other fixtures

and fittings.

The author began to work out the details of the system in the autumn of 1890,

in company with his partner, Mr. Carrington Smythe, and Mr. David Cook, wh©
is now the engineer and general manager of the City of London Electric Lighting

Company.

The conductors consist of tubes, strips, rods, or wires of copper separated from

one another by insulators fixed at intervals, and usually made of glazed earthen-

ware. It was our object to construct the conductors so that they could be mad'3
up in lengths in the workshop and sent out ready for erection.

The first experiments were made with tubes arranged on the concentric prin-

ciple, and consisted of a copper rod or a tube filled with bare wires placed inside

another tube                                                                when this was not used as an earthed return these were placed inside
                                                                         ;

a third tube which was used merely as a mechanical protection.

     The chief mechanical difliculties that had to be got over were (1) the fixing of
the insulators to the conductors, whether tubes, rods, or wires, so that they might be

sent  out in lengths or in coils                                            ready insulated                                                                           and (2)  the  designing of  suitable
                                                                                                                                                                   ;

    By using tubular strips of thin copper, not soldered or brazed along the edges,

the author was able to fix the ring-shaped separators in position by having them
made to fit tightly and forcing them over the tube, so that they were held by the
outward spring of the metal.

    He improved upon this method by making the inside or inner insulators to fit

lightly inside the tube, so that the insulators were held in position by their mutual
inward and outward pressure.

     He next subdivided the outer tube into two or more separate strips, kept apart

by projections on the insulators, so as to be able to run two or more circuits in one
tube, using the central wire as a common return. For fixing the insulators to
wires and strips two wires were passed through separate holes in insulators at

intervals, the wires being afterwards twisted to hold the insulators in position.

By employing a conductor or combination of conductors of non-circular section

and passing them through non-circular holes of suitable size made in the insulators,

and afterwards twisting the conductors, the insulators are fixed firmly in position.

In all cases other wires may be drawn through other holes to form leads or returns

for other circuits. Several circuits can thus be run in one tube, and a great deal
of jointing is thus done away with. For jointing the tubes L- and T-sbaped
castings or stampings are used, which can be fixed over or round the ends of the
tubes where they meet.

     The author and his coadjutors have also designed and used a large number of
junction-boxes made in parts and all interchangeable, so that they can be adapted

-- --to work with the fittings ceiling-roses, switches, &c. in daily use. Rows of

lamps fixed on a tube and arranged on one or more circuits are convenient for
lighting shop windows and showrooms, and for the footlights on the stage.

     The tubes can be erected round the walls of a room like picture rods.

     As the temperature of the interiors of buildings is usually higher than that of
the air outside we do not meet with the fall in the insulation owing to condensa-

tion in the tubes, which is sometimes said to occur in underground conduits where
bare conductors are run on insulators.

     These conductors can be erected in hot places and in hot countries, where they
are exposed to the heat of the sun without any fear of damage to the insulation.
They are proof against the attacks of rats and mice when laid under floors, and if a
conduit becomes red-hot there is nothing that will catch fire.

           1. On Flashing Lights for LiglitJionses. By Q. T. Olsen.

      In the interest of the nautical world the author proposes a system for the im-
provement in the distinguishing characters of coast-lights and light-vessels through-
out the world. Admiral Colomb introduced a system of flashing numerals for
signalling over thirty years ago, which still remains open for the mercantile
marine to adopt ; Lord Kelvin investigated the lights of the coast some years ago,
with a view to making them known by flashing the International Code letters :
this has not been adopted, as the Morse code, which it would be necessary for
every mariner to learn and remember, is too complicated. The author proposes
that the numerals only should be used, and not the alphabet.

      (1) All the principal lighthouses and light-vessels throughout the world should
be arranged in numerical order, beginning with, say, the oldest or British lights.
Allot to each light a number, beginning with 1,000, so that no less than four

figures may be flashed, these numbers to be inserted in the Admiralty list of

lights, and copied into all charts, sailing directions, almanacs, &c.

     (2) Make each light flash its allotted number, and no other, by means of an
automatic apparatus or clockwork as in use at present. The shortest and easiest

flashing system is that introduced by Admiral Colomb, which consists of ten
figures, represented by short and long flashes, thus :

           1.  2..       3 ...  4.. ..               5

The present flashing, occulting, intermittent, and revolving lights are capable

of performing the services required by a slight alteration in the clockwork to give

the necessary division of time, thus :

   A short flash, 1 second ; an interval between two figures, C seconds ; and an

eclipse of nine seconds after each complete signal, followed by a steady light for the

remainder of the 60 seconds.

  --Example. To flash a light the number of which is 3,724 would occupy

39 seconds, and leave a bright light 21 seconds, the whole to occupy one minute,

thus:

     This is the extreme range, and the whole can thus be performed in one minute,
and the light to repeat this revolution every minute during the night.

     In fog the author proposes that the numbers be given by a siren every minute,
such siren to be confined strictly to lighthouses and light-vessels, and prohibited
in the mercantile marine.

     In adopting this system the mariner will become acquainted with the flashing
system, and thus lay the foundation of an international flashing signal system for
the mercantile marine, so much needed. The author believes that 999 sentences
selected from the Commercial Code Book would be ample for all practical

purposes.

                         2. On an Automatic Gem- separator.
                  By William S. Lockhart, M.I.G.E., M.I.M.E.

     The separator described was devised for the purpose of selecting precious stones
from the worthless gravel with which they are associated without the intervention

of hand-picking as now practised, thus avoiding the danger of loss by theft and

other disadvantages. In South Africa, Burma, Siam, Ceylon, and other parts of
the world the systems of washing vary to some extent. The earlier stages of
these processes would take too loug to describe, but all systems resolve themselves
finally into the picking over of a concentrated deposit of clean washed gravel for

the gems it may contain, and it is at this point that the separator comes in to
perform what has hitherto been done by hand. When it is realised that the

                                                                                                                                          3 L2

 proportion of gems to worthless pieces of mineral is not a percentage mere!}', but
 of one to ruanj' tliousands, the utility of such a machine is obvious.

      The. concentrated gravel when washed is most carefully classified into sizes,
 beginning, for diamonds, at one-sixteenth of an inch, and increasing by sixteenths
 up to tive-eighths of an inch, or still further if desired. Each size of gravel is fed.

--into a separator adapted to suit it. The separator has no moving parts and takes

 advantage, by means of a stream of water running through it, of the slight varia-
 tion in specific gravity between the gems (3 5 to 4) and the worthless minerals
 (2-5 to 3). It is possible to .separate such substances by immersing them in a pre-

pared solution of high specific gravity, just as pebbles and chips may be separated
 in water ; but there are practical dithculties about such a process, and the gem-
 separator described substitutes a moving current of water for the heavier solution,

 with the advantage that the process is continuous, the separated materials beino-
 depo.sited in their proper receptacles, those for the gems being guarded by locks.

      The details of the machine are described, and a machine shown at work,
      The operations of the rnachine are not confined to gems. The separation cf
 any minerals from their gangue, provided always there is a slight difference in
 specific gravity^ may be efi'ected, and the machine will work on broken material
 in a dry or merely wetted state or on slimes run in with a stream of water.

     3. On some Experiments ivith Ventilating Ferns or Air-propellers.
                    By William Geokge Walker, M.Inst.M.E.

      These experiments have reference to those ventilating fans or air-propellers of
the screw-propeller type used for low-pressure ventilators.

     The primary object of the experiments was to test the efficiency of fans or air-
propellers, differing only from each other in the cross-section of their blades, which

section chiefly referred to_ the rearward or non-propelling face of the blades or
vanes.

     The first series of experiments were made with air-propellers 14 in. diameter
and 21 in. pitch, and of two, three, and six blades respectively. Each propeller
was tried at progressive revolutions, varying from 500 up to 2,000 per minute.
The blades were composed of sheet brass ^^ in. thick.

     The second series were made with the same propellers, but having a curved

convex protuberance fixed to the back surface of the blades, forming a section
which is a hollow plano-convex form, the convex surface constituting the non-
propelling surface, or backs of the blades.

      In all cases the efficiency of the blades was increased by the addition of the
convex surface ; in some cases the number of cubic feet per revolution was nearly
 doubled, the power being the same in each case.

      Some further comparative experiments were made with fans of 2 feet in dia-

 meter, and with blades of diflferent sectional form, viz., (I) flat blades, (2) curved
 blades, (3) helical blades, (4) flat blades with round protuberance fixed at back,.
 (5) curved blade with round protuberance fixed on, also other sections.

     The angle of the blades and the area were the same in each case. The experi-
ments most distinctly showed that a very great gain was obtained by the use of
the convex surface, and that the best results were obtained with a section of

concavo-convex form.

     The reason of the results may perhaps be explained from the ' Stream Line""

              _

principle. It seems that the convex surface at the back tends to fill up or destroy
the partial vacuum which exists at the back of each revolving blade. The existence
of an eddy in the wake of each blade must increase the rotary motion of the
air, caused by air passing through the propeller clinging or tending to rush into
the partial vacuum.

       Section H.--ANTHROPOLOGY.

--President of the Section R. Munko, M.A., M.D,

                          THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14.

The President delivered the following Address :

Tee science of Anthropology, in its widest sense, embraces all the materials

bearing on the origin and history of mankind. These materials are so compre-

hensive and diversified, both in their character and methods of .study, that they

become necessarily grouped into a number of subordinate departments. From a

bird's-eye point of view, however, one marked line of demarcation separates them

into two great divisions, according as they relate to the structure and functions

--of man's body, or to the works he has produced a classification well defined by

the words anthropology and nrchceology. The former, in its limited acceptation,

--deals more particularly with the development of man bis physical peculiarities,

racial distinctions, linguistic manifestations, mental endowments, and, in short,

every morphological or mental modification he has undergone amidst the ever-

changing phenomena of his environments. The latter, on the other hand, takes

cognisance of man merely as a handicraftsman. During his long journey in

past time he has left behind him, scattered on the highways and byways of

primeval life, numerous traces of his ways, his works, his culture, and his civilisa-

tion, all of which fall to be collected, sorted, and interpreted by the skilled

archoeologist. In their general aspects and relationship to each other most of the

leading subjects in both these branches of the science have already been ex-

pounded, in the presidential addresses of my predecessors, by men so distinguished

in their respective departments that they have left little to be said by anyone

who attempts to follow in their footsteps. There is, however, one phase in the

progressive career of man which has not hitherto been so fully illustrated as

the subject appears to me to merit. I refer to the direct and collateral advan-

tages which the erect position has conferred on him ; and to this I will now

mybriefly direct your attention, concentrating  observations successively on the

following propositions :

     (1) The mechanical and physical advantages of the erect position.
     (2) The difierentiation of the limbs into hands and feet.
     (3) The relation between the more perfect condition of these organs and the
development of the brain.

In the process of organic evolution it would almost appear as if nature acted

on teleological principles, because many of her products exhibit structures which

combine the most perfect adaptation of means to ends along with the greatest

economy of materials. This is well exemplified in some of the structural details

of the organs of locomotion in which many of the so-called mechanical powers may

be seen in actual use. The primary object of locomotion was to enable the organ-

ism to seek its food over a larger area than was attainable by a fixed position.

Tke acquisition of this power was manifestly so advantageous to animal life that
886 REPORT-- 1893.

the principles by whicb it could be effected became important factors in natural
selection. I need not here dwell on the various methods by which this has been
accomplished in the lower forms of hfe, but proceed at once to point out that in
the higher vertebrates the problem resolved itself into the well-known mechanism

of four movable limbs, capable of supporting and transporting the animal. As

these quadrupedal animals became more highly differentiated, in virtue of the
necessities of the struggle for life and the different and ever- varying conditions of
their surroundings, it followed that the limbs became also modified so as to make
them suitable, not only for locomotion in various circumstances, but also useful
to the animal economy in other ways. Hence they were subjected to an endless
variety of secondary influences, which finally adapted them for such diverse pur-
poses as swimming, flying, climbing, grasping, &c. The anterior limbs, owing to
 their proximity to the head, were more frequently selected for such transformations

as may be seen, for instance, in the wings of a bird. But whatever modifications
tha fore limbs may have undergone, no animal, with the exception of man, has
ever succeeded in divesting them altogether of their primary function. This
exceptional result was due to the erect position, which necessitated a complete

--division of labour as regards the functions of the limbs the two anterior being

entirely restricted to manipulative and prehensile purposes, and the two posterior
 exclusively devoted to locomotion. Coincident with this notable specialisation of
 their function a new field for advancement was opened up to man, in which intel-
ligence and mechanical skill became the leading factors in his further development.

     Man is thus distinguished from all other animals by the fact ihat, in the-

 normal position of walking or running, he carries his body upright, i.e., with
 the axis of the vertebral column perpendicular, instead of horizontal or oblique.
In this position all its parts are so arranged as to require a minimum amount of
 exertion in the performance of their functions. If any of the other higher ver-
 tebrates should ever assume an erect attitude it can only be maintained tempo-
 rarily, and its maintenance involves an additional expenditure of force. In a

 certain sense a bird may be looked upon as a biped, but there is this distinction

 to be drawn between it and man, viz., that the former has not only its body
 balanced obliquely on its two legs, but also its fore limbs converted into special
 organs for motion in the air. The anthropoid apes hold an intermediate posi-
 tion, and so carry their body in a semi-erect attitude. But this shortcoming in

reaching the perfectly upright position, however slight it may be in some of these

 animals, represents a wide gap which can only be fully appreciated by a careful
study of the physiological and psychological phenomena manifested in their respec-

tive life-functions.

     Everyone acquainted with the ordinary operations of daily life knows how
much labour can be saved by attention to the mere mechanical principles in-

volved in their execution. In carrying a heavy load the great object is to adjust
it so that its centre of gravity comes as nearly as possible to the vertical axis of
the body, as otherwise force is uselessly expended in the effort to keep the entire-

--moving mass in stable equilibrium a principle well exemplified by the Italian

peasant girl when she poises her basket of oranges on her head. Once upon a
time a powerful waterman, accustomed to use buckets double the size of those
of his fellow-watermen, had the misfortune to have one of them broken. As he^
could not, then and there, get another bucket to match the remaining one, and
wishing to make the best possible use of the appliances at hand, he replaced

the broken vessel by one half its size. He then filled both with water and

 attempted to carry them, as formerly, attached to a yoke, one on each side of him.

But to his astonishment this arrangement would not work. The yoke became un-
even, and the effort to keep it balanced on his shoulders was so troiiblesome that
he could not proceed. This emergency led to serious reflection, but, after some
experimental trials, he ascertained that, by merely making the arm of the yoke
on which the small bucket was suspended double the length of the other, he could'

carry both buckets without inconvenience.

    But let me take one other illustration. Suppose that two burglars have con-

cocted a plan to rob a richly-stored mansion by getting access to its rooms throughi

the windows of an upper story. In order to carry out this design they secure a
ladder, easily transported by the two together though too heavy for one. So,
bearing the ladder between them one at each end, they come to the house. After
a considerable amount of exertion they succeed in placing the ladder in an upright
position against the wall, and then one of the men mounts its steps and enters the

house. The man left outside soon realised that, once the ladder was balanced per-
pendicularly, he himself could then easily control it. Moreover, he made the dis-

covery that by resting its weight on each leg alternately, he could gradually shift

its position from one window to another. Thus there was no interruption or

limit to the extent of their depredations. Experience quickened their perceptions,

--and ultimately they became adepts in their respective departments the one in the

art of moving the ladder, and the other in the science of the nimble-fingered

gentry. The division of labour thus practised by these two men accurately repre-
sents what the attainment of the erect attitude has accomplished for man by setting

free his upper limbs from any further participation in the locomotion of liis body.
     The continued maintenance of this unique position necessitated great changes

in the general structure of the body. The solution of the problem involved the

turning of the ordinary quadruped a quarter of a circle in the vertical plane, thus
placing the axis of tlie spine perpendicular, and consequently in line with the

direction of the posterior limbs ; and to efi'ect this the osseous walls of the pelvis
underwent certain modifications, so as to bear the additional strain put upon them.

Stability was given to the trunk in its new position by the development of special
groups of muscles, whose powerful and combined actions render to the movements
of the human body their characteristic freedom and gracefulness. The lower limbs

were placed as widely apart as possible at their juncture with the pelvis, and the
thigh- and leg-bones were lengthened and strengthened so as to be capable of
supporting the entire weight of the body and of transporting it with due efficiency

when required. The spinal column assumed its well-known curves, and the skull,
which formerly had to be supported by a powerful muscle attached to the spinous
processes of the cervical vertebrse {ligamentwn nuchce), moved backwards until it
became nearly equipoised on the top of the vertebral column. The upper limbs,
instead of taking part in their original function of locomotion, were now them-
selves carried as flail-like appendages, in order to give them as much freedom and
range of action as possible. The shoulder-blades receded to the posterior aspect of

the trunk, having their axes at right angles to that of the spine. Further, like the

haimch-bones, they underwent certain modifications, so as to aflbrd points of
attachment to the muscles required in the complex movements of the arms. In
the pendulous position each arm has its axis at right angles to that of the shoulder,

but by a common muscular effort the two axes can be readily brought into line.
The elbow-joint became capable of performing the movements of complete exten-

--sion, flexion, pronation, and supination in which respects the upper limb of man is

differentiated from that of all other vertebrates.
     But it is in the distal extremities of the limbs that the most remarkable

anatomical changes have to be noted. The foot is virtually a tripod, the heel and

the ball of the great toe being the terminal ends of an arch, while the four outer

digital columns group themselves together to form the third, or steadying, point.
The outer toes thus play but a subordinate part in locomotion, and, as their pre-

hensile function is no longer of use, they may be said to be fast approaching to the
condition of rudimentary organs. The three osseous prominences which form this

tripod are each covered with a soft elastic pad, which both facilitates progression
and acts as a buffer for deadening any possible shock which might arise in the
course of running or leaping. The chief movement in the act of progression is
performed by an enormously developed group of muscles known as the calf of the
leg, so characteristic of man. The walker is thereby enabled to use the heel and the
ball of the great toe as successive fulcrums from which the forward spring is made,

the action being greatly facilitated by that of the trunk muscles in simultaneously
bending the body forwards. The human foot is thus admirably adapted to be both
a pillar for supporting the weight of the body and a lever for mechanically im-
pelling it forwards. Hence the amount of energy expended in progression is
888 REPORT-- 1893.

reduced to a minimum, and when estimated proportionally to the size of the body

it is believed to be considerably less than that requisite for the corresponding act

in quadrupeds.

The anatomical changes effected in the extremity of the upper limb are

equally radical, but of a totally different character and scope. Here we have to

contemplate the transformation of the same homologous parts into an apparatus

for performing a series of prehensile actions of the most intricate character, but
among which neither locomotion nor support of the body forms any part whatever.

This apparatus is the human hand, the most complete and perfect mechanical

organ nature has yet produced. The fingers have become highly developed, and

can be opposed singly or in groups to the thumb, so as to form a "hook, a clasp, or

a pair of pincers ; and the palm can be made into a cup-shaped hollow, capable of

grasping a sphere. Nor is there any limit to the direction in which many of these

manipulations can be performed without any movement of the rest of the body.

For example, a pencil held by the thumb aiid the two forefingers, as in the act of

writing, can be placed in all the directions of space by a mere act of volition.

The position of such a perfect piece of mechanism, at the extremity of a

movable arm attached to the upper part of the trunk, gives to man a superiority

in attack and defence over all other animals, on the same principle as a soldier

finds it advantageous to fight from higher ground. Moreover, he possesses the

power to perform a variety of quick movements, and to assume attitudes and posi-

tions eminently adapted for the exercise of that manipulative skill with which he

counteracts the supeiior brute force of many of his antagonists. He can readily

balance his body on one or both legs, can turn on his heels as if they were pivots,

and can prostrate himself comfortably in the prone or supine positions. As the

centre of gravity of the whole body is nearly in line with the spinal axis, stable

equilibrium is easily maintained by the lumbar muscles. Altogether we have in

his physical constitution a combination of structures and functions sufficiently

unique in its tout-eyxsemble to place man in a category by himself. But at the
same time we must not forget that all his morphological peculiarities have been

brought about without the destruction of any of the primarj' and typical homo-
logies common to all the higher vertebrates.

Turning now to the brain, the undoubted organ of the mind, we find, in its

intellectual and psychical manifestations, a class of phenomena which gives to man's

life-functions their most remarkable character. However difficult it may be for our

limited understanding to comprehend the nature of conscious sensation, we are

forced to the conclusion that the act invariably takes place through the instrument-

ality of a few nerve-cells, whose functional activity requires to be renovated in

precisely the same manner as the muscular force expended in walking. The aggre-

gation of such cells into ganglia and nerves, by means of which refiex action,

consciousness, and a variety of psychical phenomena take place, is found to per-

meate, in a greater or less degree, the whole of the organic world. In the higher

vertebrates the seat of these manifestations is almost exclusively confined to an

enormous collection of brain substance placed at the upper end of the vertebral

Wecolumn, and encased in a complete osseous covering called the skull.            learn

from numerous experimental researches, carried out by physiologists in recent years,

that the brain is a dual organ, consisting of a double series of distinct ganglia and

connected to some extent by a complex system of nervous tissues, not only with

each other, but with the central seat of consciousness and vohtion. But the diffi-

culty of determining the natui-e of its functions, and the modus operandi of its

psychological manifestations, is so great that I must pass over this part of the sub-

ject very hghtly indeed. The conditions of ordinary reflex action require that a

group of muscles, by means of which a particular bodily movement is effected,

shall be connected with its co-ordinating ganglion by an afferent and an efferent

system of nerves. Impressions from without are conveyed by the former, or sen-

sory nerves, to the central ganglion, from which an impulse is retransmitted by the

motor nerves, and sets in operation the muscular force for producing the required

movement. But this efferent message is, in many cases, absolutely controlled by

volition ; and not only can it prevent the muscular action from taking place, but it
                                           TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                889

can effect a similar movement de novo without the direct iutervention of external

impressions at all. Now it has been proved experimentally that the volitional

stimulus, which regulates the various movements of the body, starts from definite

portions of the brain according to the diflerent results to be produced. This locali-

sation of brain functions, though still far from being thoroughly understood, comes

very appropriately into use in this inquiry. From it we learn that the homology

which characterises the structural elements of the bodies of animals extends also

to the component parts of their respective brains. The law which differentiates

animals according to the greater specialisation of the functions of their various

organs has therefore its counterpart in the brain, and we naturally expect an

increase of brain substance in every case in which the functional activity of a

specific organ is extended. Thus the act of stitching with a needle and thread,

an act beyond the mental and physical capacity of any animal but man, would

entail a certain increase of brain substance, simply in obedience to the great com-

plexity of the movements involved in its execution, over and above that which

may be supposed to be due to the intellectual and reasoning faculties which

invented it.

That man's brain and his intelligence are correlated to each other is a fact too

axiomatic to require any demonstration; nor can it be doubted that the relation-

ship between them is of the nature of cause and effect. Bat to maintain that the

amount of the latter is directly proportional to the size of the former is rather

straining the laws of legitimate inference. In drawing any general conclusion of

this nature from the bulk of brain substance, there are some modifying influences

which cannot be disregarded, such, for example, as the amount of cranial circula-

tion and the quality of the brain cells. But the determination of this point is not

the exact problem with which the evolutionist is primarily concerned. To him the

real crux in the inquiry is to account for the evolution of man's comparatively

large brain under the influence of existing cosmic forces. After duly considering

this pi'oblem, and casting about for a possible explanation, I have come to the con-

clusion that not only is it the result of natural laws, but that one of the main

factors in its production was the conversion of the upper limbs into true hands.

From the first moment that man recognised the advantage of using a club or a

stone in attacking his prey or defending himself from his enemies, the direct incen-

tives to a higher brain development came into existence. He would soon learn by

e.xperience that a particular form of club or stone was more suitable for his pur-

poses                         and  if the  desiderated  object were  not  to  be  found  among  the  natural
                           ;

materials around him, he would proceed to manufacture it. Certain kinds of stones

would be readily recognised as better adapted for cutting purposes than others,

and he would select his materials accordingly. If these were to be found

only in a special locality, he would visit that locality whenever the prized

material was needed. Nor would it be an unwarrantable stretch of imagina-

tion to suppose that the circumstances would lead him to lay up a store for future

use. These simple acts of intelligence assume little more than may be seen in
the actions of many of the lower animals. Consciousness of his power to make

and to wield a weapon was a new departure in the career of man, and every repe-

tition of such acts became an effective and ever-accumulating training force. What

a memorable event in the history of humanity was the manufacture of the first

sharp stone implement ! Our sapient ancestor, who first used a spear tipped with

a sharp flint, became possessed of an irresistible power over his fellow men. The

invention of the bow and arrow may be parallelled with the discovery of gunpowder

and the use of cannon, both of which revolutionised the principles of warfare in

their respective ages. The art of making fire had a greater influence on human

--civilisation than the modern discovery of electricity. The first boat was in all

probability a log an idea which might have been suggested by the sight of an

animal clinging to a floating piece of wood carried away by a flood. To scoop this

log into a hollow boat was an afterthought. The successive increments of know-

iedge by which a single-tree canoe has been transformed into a first-class Atlantic

liner are scattered through the unwritten and written annals of many ages. In his

expeditions for hunting, fishing, fruit-gathering, &c., primitive man's acquaintance

·with the mechanical powers of nature would he gradually extended, and pari
passu with the increasing range of his knowledge there would he a corresponding
development in his reasoning faculties. Natural phenomena suggested reflections
as to their causes and eflects, and so by degrees they were brought into the cate-
gory of law and order. Particular sounds would be used to represent specific
objects, and these would become the iirst rudiments of language. Thus each
generalisation when added to his previous little stock of knowledge widened the
basis of his intellectual powers, and as the process progressed man would acquire
some notion of the abstract ideas of space, time, motion, force, number, &c. ; and
continuous thought and reasoning would ultimately become habitual to him. All
these mental operations could only take place through the medium of additional
nerve cells, and hence the brain gradually became more bulky and more complex
in its structure. Thus the functions of the hand and of the brain have been corre-
lated in a most remarlcable manner. Whether the mechanical skill of the hand
preceded the greater intelligence of the brain, or rice vei'sa, I will not pretend to
say. But between the two there must have been a constant interchange of gifts.
According to Sir C. Bell, ' the hand supplies all instruments, and by its corre-
spondence with the intellect gives him universal dominion.'

      That mind, in its higher psychical manifestations, has sometimes been looked
npon as a spiritual essence which can exist separately from its material basis need

not be wondered at w-hen we consider how the pleasing abstractions of the poet, or

the fascinating creations of the novelist, roll out, as it were, from a hidden cavern
without the slightest symptom of ph}'sical action. It is this marvellous power of
gathering and combining ideas, previously derived through the ordinary senses,

which gives a pnmd facie appearance of having here to deal with a force exterior

to the brain itself But indeed it is questionable if such psychological phenomena

are really represented by special organic equivalents. May they not be due rather

to the power of volitional reflection which summons them from the materials
stored up by the various localised portions into which the biain is divided ? From
this point of view there may be many phases of pure cerebration which, though
not the result of direct natural selection, have nevertheless as natural and physical
an origin as conscious sensation. Hence imagination, conception, idealisation, the
moral facidties, &c., may be compared to parasites which live at the expense of

their neighbours. After all the (greatest mystery of life lies in the simple acts
of conscious sensation, and not in the higher mental combinations into which

they enter. The highest products of intellectuality are nothing more than the trans-
 formation of previously existing energy, and it is the power to utilise it that

 alone finds its special organic equivalent in the brain.

      But this brings us on controversial ground of the highest importance. Pro-
fessor Huxley thus expresses his views on the phase of the .argument now at

issue :

      ' I have endeavoured to show that no absolute structural line of demarcation,

wider than that between the animals which immediately succeed us in the scale, can

be drawn between the animal world and ourselves ; and I may add the expression
myof belief that the attempt to draw a psychical distinction is equally futile, and

that even the highest faculties of feeling and of intellect begin to germinate in

lower forms of life.'

     On the other hand, Mr. Alfred E. Wallace, who holds such a distinguished

position in this special field of research, has promulgated a most remarkable theory.

 This careful investigator, an original discoverer of the laws of natural selection,

 and a powerful advocate of their adequacy to bring about the evolution of the

entire organic world, even including man up to a certain stage, believes that the
cosmic forces are insuflicient to account for the development of man in his civilised
capacity. ' Natural selection,' he writes, ' could only have endowed savage man

with a brain a few degrees superior to that of an ape, whereas he actually possesses

 one very little inferior to that of a philosopher.' This deficiency in the organic

forces of nature he essays to supply by calling in the fyuiding influence of a

' superior intelligence.' In defending this hypothesis from hostile criticism he ex-

plains that by ' superior intelligence ' he means some intelligence higher than the

' modern cultivated mind,' somethins: intermediate between it and Deity. But as

this is a pure supposition, unsupported by any evidence, and merely a matter of

personal belief, it is unnecessary to discuss it further. I would just, en passant, asli

Mr. Wallace why he dispenses with this ' higher intelligence' in the early stages of

man's evolution, and finds its assistance only requisite to give the tinal touches to

humanity.

In dealing with the detailed objections raised by Mr. Wallace against the theory

of natural selection as applied to man, we are, however, strictly within the sphere

of legitimate argument ; and evolutionists are fairly called upon to meet them. As-
his own theory is founded on the supposed failure of natural selection to explain

certain specified peculiarities in the life of man, it is clear that if these difficulties

can be removed, cadit qucestio. It is only one of his objections, however, that comes

within the scope of my present inquiry, viz., that which is founded on the

supposed ' surplusage ' of brain power in savage and prehistoric races.

    In comparing the brains of the anthropoid apes and man Mr. Wallace adopts

the following numbers to represent their proportional average capacities, viz.,

--anthropoid apes 10, savages 26, and civilised man 32 numbers to which there can

be no objectioD, as they are based on data sufficiently accurate for the requirements

of this discussion. In commenting on the mental ability displayed in actual life

by the recipients of these various brains he states that savage man has 'in an un-

developed state faculties which he never requires to use,' and that his brain is much
beyond his actual requirements in daily life. He concludes his argument thus :

We' see, then, that whether we compare the savage with the higher developments

of man, or with the brutes around him, we are alike driven to the conclusion that

--in his large and well-developed brain he possesses an organ quite disproportionate

to his actual requirements an organ that seems prepared in advance, only to be
Afully utilised as he progresses in civilisation.
                                                   brain one half larger than that of

the gorilla would, according to the evidence before us, fully have sufficed for the

limited mental development of the savage ; and we must therefore admit that the

large brain he actually possesses could never have been solely developed by any of

those laws of evolution whose essence is that they lead to a degree of organisation

exactly proportionate to the wants of each species, never beyond those wants

that no preparation can be made for the future development of the race ; that one

part of the body can never increase in size or complexity, except in strict co-ordina-

tion to the pressing wants of the whole. The brain of prehistoric and of savage

man seems to me to prove the existence of some power distinct from that which

has guided the development of the lower animals through their ever-varying forms

of being.' ^

With regard to the closing sentence of the above quotation, let me observe

that the cosmic forces, under which the lower animals have been produced by

means of natural selection, do not disclose, either in their individual or collective

capacity, any guiding power in the sense of a sentient influence, and I believe

that the ' distinct power ' which the author summons to his aid, apparently from

the 'vasty deep,' to account for the higher development of humanity is nothing

more than the gradually acquired product of the reasoning faculties themselves.

Not that, for this reason, it is to be reckoned less genuine and less powerful in it&

operations than if it had emanated from an outside source. The reasoning power-

displayed by man is virtually a higher intelligence, and, ever since its appearance

on the field of organic life, it has, to a certain extent, superseded the laws of

natural selection. Physical science has made us acquainted with the fact that two

or three simple bodies will sometimes combine chemically so as to produce a new

substance, having properties totally different from those of either constituents in a

state of disunion. Something analogous to this has taken place in the development

of man's capacity for reasoning by induction. Its primary elements, which are-

              > Natural Selection, ^c, 1891, p, 193.
892 EKPORT-- 1893.

also those of natural selection, are conscious sensation, heredity, and a few other
properties of organic matter ; elements which are common, in a more or less degree,
to all living things. As soon as the sequence of natural phenomena attracted the
attention of man, and his intelligence reached the stage of consecutive reasoning on
the invariableness of certain eifects from given causes, this new power came into
existcDce; and its operations are, apparently, so diSerent from those of its com-
ponent elements that they can hardly be recognised as the ofispring of natural
forces at all. Its application to the adjustment of his physical environments has
ever since been one of the most powerful factors, not only in the development of

humanity, but in altering the conditions and life-functions of many members of

the animal and vegetable kingdoms.
     I have already pointed out that the brain can no longer be regarded as a single

--organ, but rather as a series of organs connected by bonds of union like so many
--departments in a Government office in telephonic communication all, however,

performing special and separate functions. When, therefore, we attempt to com-

pare the brain capacity of one animal with that of another, with the view of

ascertaining the quality of their respective mental manifestations, we must first
determine what are the exact homologous parts that are comparable. To draw
any such inference from a comparison of two brains, by simply weighing or
measuring the whole mass of each, would be manifestly of no scientific value.

For example, in the brain of a savage the portion representing highly skilled

motor energies might be very much larger, while the portion representing logical
power might be smaller, than the corresponding jjarts in the brain of a philosopher.
But should these inequalities of development be such as to balance each other, the
weight of the two organs would be equal. In this case what could be the value of
any inference as to the character of their mental endowments ? Equal-sized
brains do not display equivalent, nor indeed analogous, results. To postulate such

a doctrine would be as irrational as to maintain that the walking capacities of
different persons are directly proportional to the weight of their bodies. Similar
remarks are equally applicable to the skulls of prehistoric races, as it would appear
that evolution had done the major part of its work iu brain development long

--before the days of neolithic civilisation. Huxley's well-known description of the

Eugis skull ' a fair average skull, which might have belonged to a philosopher,

--or might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage ' goes far to settle

the question from its anatomical point of view. Until localisation of brain func-
tions makes greater progress it is, therefore, futile to speculate to any great extent
on the relative sizes of the skulls of different races either iu present or prehistoric

times.

      But there is another aspect of the question which militates against Mr.

Wallace's hypothesis, viz., the probability that many of the present tribes of

savages are, in point of civilisation, in a more degenerate condition than their fore-

fathers who acquired originally higher mental qualities under natural selection.

There must surely be some foundation of truth in the widely-spread tradition of
the fall of man. And, if such be the case, we naturally expect to find some stray
races with inherited brains of greater capacity than their needs, in more degenerate

circumstances, may require. An exact equivalent to this may be seen in the

feeble intellectuality of many of the peasants and lower classes among the civilised
nations of modern times. Yet a youth born of such parents, if educated, often
becomes a distinguished philosopher. It is well known that if an organ ceases to
perform its functional work it h.ns a tendency to deteriorate, and ultimately to dis-
appear altogether. But from experience we know that it takes a long time for the
 effects of disuse to become manifest. It is this persistency that accounts for a
number of rudimentary organs, still to be met with in the human body, whose
 functional activity could only have been exercised ages before man became
differentiated from the lower animals. Such facts give some support to the

 suggestion, previously made, that philosophy, as such, has no specially locahsed
 portion in the brain. Its function is merely to direct the current of mental forces
 already existing.

      But, again, Mr. Wallace's argument involves the assumption that the un-
                                                                            -'

necessarily large brain of the savage had been constructed on teleological principles

Myfor the sole purpose of philosophising.  opinion is that the greater portion of

this so-called surplusage is the organic representative of the energy expended in

the exercise of the enormous complexity of human actions, as displayed in the
movements of his body and in the skilful manipulations necessary to the manu-

facture of implements, weapons, clothing, &c. All such actions have to be repre-

sented by a lai'ger bulk of brain matter than is required for the most profound

philosophical speculations. The kind of intelligence evinced by savages, however
low their position in the scale of civilisation may be, is different from, and incom-

parably greater than, that manifested by the most advanced of the loveer animals.

To me it is much more rational to suppose that the development of the large brain

of man corresponded,^anp«ss?<, with that of his characteristic physical attributes,

more especially those consequent on the attainment of the iipright position. That

these attributes -were acquired exclusively through the instrumentality of the

-- Wecosmic forces was, as the following quotation will show, the opinion of Mr.
Darwin : '  must remember that nearly all the other and more important

differences between man and quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature,

and relate chiefly to the erect position of man ; such as the structure of his

hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.'

Mr. Wallace, however, considers the feet and hands of man ' as difiiculties on

the theory of natural selection.' 'IIow,' he exclaims, 'can we conceive that early

ma.n, as an animal, gained anything by purely erect locomotion? Again, the

hand of man contains latent capacities and powers which are unused by savages,
and must have been even less used by palseolithic man and his still ruder

predecessors. It has all the appearance of an organ prepared for the use of

civihsed man, and one which was required to render civilisation possible.'

But here, again, this acute ob.server diverges into his favourite by-path, and

introduces a ' higher intelligence ' to bridge over his difficulties.

    We have now reached a stage in this inquiry when a number of questions of

a more or less speculative character fall to be considered. On the supposition that,
at the start, the evolution of the hand of man was synchronous with the higher

development of his reasoning faculties, it is but natural to ask where, when, and in

what precise circumstances this remarkable coalition took place. I would not,
however, be j ustified in taking up your time now in discussing these questions in
detail ; not because I think the materials for their solution are unattainable, but

because, in the present state of our knowledge, they are too conjectural to be of

scientific value. In the dim retrospective vista which veils these materials from

our cognisance I can only see a few faint landmarks. All the osseous remains of

man which have hitherto been collected and examined point to the fact that,

during the larger portion of the Quaternary period, if not, indeed, from its very

commencement, he had already acquired his human characteristics. This generalisa-

tion at once throws us back to the Tertiary period in our search for man's early appear-

--ance in Europe. Another fact disclosed by an analysis of his present corporeal
--structure is that, during a certain phase of his previous existence, he passed

through a stage when his limbs, like those of the present anthropoid apes, were

Weadapted for an arboreal life.  have therefore to look for the causes which

brought about the separation of man from his quadrumanous congeners, and

entailed on him such a transformation in his form and habits, in the physical condi-

tions that would supervene on a change from a warm to a cold climate. In the

gradual lowering of the temperature of the subtropical climate which prevailed in

Central Europe and the corresponding parts of Asia during the Miocene and

Pliocene periods, and which culminated in the great Ice age, together with the

concurrent changes in the distribution of land, seas, and mountains, we have the
most probable explanation of these causes. Whether man forsook his arboreal
habits and took to the plains from overcrowding of his own species in search of

different kinds of food, before this cold period subjected him to its intensely adverse

circumstances, it -would be idle for me to offer an opinion. Equally conjectural

would it be to inquire into the exact circumstances which led him to depend ex-
 clusively on his posterior limbs for locomotion.

      During this early and transitional period in man's career there was no room for
«thics. Might was right, whether it emanated from the strength of the arm, the skill
of the hand, or the cunning of the brain. Life and death combats would decide the
fate of many competing races. The weak would succumb to the strong, and ulti-
mately there would survive only such as could hold their own by flight, strength,

agility, or skill, just as we find among the races of man at the present dav.
     In summing up these somewhat discursive observations, let me just emphasise

the main points of the argument. With the attainment of the erect position, and
the consequent specialisation of his limbs into hands and feet, man entered on a
new phase of e.xistence. With the advantage of manipulative organs and a pro-
gressive brain he became Homo sapiens, and gi'adually developed a capacity to
understand and utilise the forces of nature. As a handicraftsman he fashioned

tools and weapons, with the skilful use of which he got the mastery over all other
animals. With a knowledge of the uses of fire, the art of cooking his food, and
the power of fabricating materials for clothing his body, he accommodated himself
to the vicissitudes of climate, and so greatly extended his habitable area on the

globe. As ages rolled on he accumulated more and more of the secrets of nature,
and every such addition widened the basis for further discoveries. Thus com-

--menced the grandest revolution the organic world has ever undergone a revolu-

tion which culminated in the transformation of a brute into civilised man. During

this long transitional period mankind encountered many difficulties, perhaps the
most formidable being due to the internecine struggles of inimical members of
their own species. In these circumstances the cosmic processes, formerly all-

powerful so long as they acted only through the constitution of the individual,

were of less potency than the acquired ingenuity and aptitude of man himself.
Hence local combinations for the protection of common interests became necessary,

and with the rise of social oi"ganisations the safety of the individual became merged
in that of the community. The recognition of the principle of the division of
labour laid the foundations of subsequent nationalities, arts, and sciences. Coin-
cident with the rise of such institutions sprang up the germs of order, law, and
ethics. The progress of humanity on these novel lines was slow, but in the main

steadily upwards. No doubt the advanced centres of the various civilisations
would oscillate, as they still do, from one region to another, according as some new

discovery gave a preponderance of skill to one race over its opponents. Thus the
civilised world of modern times came to be fashioned, the outcome of which has been
the creation of a special code of social and moral laws for the protection and guidance
of humanity. Obedience to its behests is virtue, and this, to use the recent words of
a profound thinker, ' involves a course of conduct which, in all respects, is opposed
to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. In place of
ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside or
treading down all competitors, it requires that the individual shall not merely
respect but shall help his fellows ; its influence is directed, not so much to the
survival of the fittest, as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive. It repu-

diates the gladiatorial theory of existence. It demands that each man who enters

into the enjoyment of the advantages of a polity shall be mindful of his debt to

those who have laboriously constructed it ; and shall take heed that no act of his
weakens the fabric in which he has been permitted to live. Laws and moral

precepts are directed to the end of curbing the cosmic process and reminding the
individual of his duty to the community, to the protection and influence of which
he owes, if not existence itself, at least the life of something better than a brutal

savage.'

     These humble remarks will convey to your minds some idea of the scientific
interest and profound human sympathies evoked bj' the far-reaching problems
which fall to be discussed in this Section. Contrasting the present state of anthro-

pological science with its position some thirty or forty years ago, we can only marvel

at the thoroughness of the change that has taken place in favour of its doctrines.

Now man's immense antiquity is accepted by a vast majority of the most thoughtful

men, and his place in nature, as a derivative animal at the head of the great chain
of life, appeals for elucidation to all sciences and to all legitimate methods of

research. But among the joyful pseans of this triumphal march we still hear some

--discordant notes notes, however, which seem to me to die with their echoes, and

to have as little effect on scientific progress as the whistling of an idle wind. For

my own part I cannot believe that a science which seeks in the spirit of truth to

trace the mysteries of human life and civilisation to their primary rootlets, a science
which aims at purging our beliefs of superstitious figments generated in days when
scientific methods were too feeble to expose the errors on which they were founded,
a science which reminds us in a thousand ways that success in life depends on a

correct knowledge of the cosmic forces around us, can be opposed to the highest

and most durable interests of humanity.

                  1. On the Ethnographic Aspect of Dancing.
                        By Mrs. Lilly Gkove, F.B.G.S.

Dancing corresponds to a universal primitive instinct in man. The value of a

scientific study of dancing as illustrating some aspects of ethnology is very great.

--At all periods there were three kinds of dances: 1. The imaginative or poetic.

2. The descriptive. 3. The relif/ious. This last is most important, and may be

called the fountain of the other kinds. Dancing is connected with every ancient

myth. Among the savages the idea of masric always accompanies it. Religious

dances can be divided in {a) dances directly in honour of the Deity ; (b) dances
Aon various occasions intended to jjropitiate the Deity.
                                                          strange feature is the fact

that so many dances are performed in a circle. Sun-dances are numerous. War-

Aances are of two orders, either as a preparation fur war or as a rejoicing after

triumph. The Corrobberree illustrates the former aspect. Excellence in dancing

among savages is obtained by very simple means ; anyone who makes a mistake in

the dance is killed.

    Women take a larger share in the dance than men. This is accounted for by

Herbert Spencer.

Marriage-dances are found in every tribe. So are devil-dances, used as

exorcisms or as a medicine cure. The dance of the Veddahs of Ceylon, the Baile

de Pifano of Chili, the skeleton-dance of Australia, belong to this class. Dancing

in the cathedrals of Spain and Mexico is traced back to a Hebrew custom, and to

King David's act of adoration. Dancing may be the outcome of pain and sorrow

as well as the expression of joy. Funeral dances are common in Nubia and Central

America, and were much in favour with the ancient Egyptians. In conclusion, the

universality and the naturalness of dancing make it an important factor in the

history of man.

ments. The replies sliow that some form of measurement is, or has been, carried
on in twenty-tive schools, details of which will be found in the table below
(Table 1). They also show that the methods adopted differ considerably
(Table 2), a fact which somewhat detracts from the value of the observations

for comparative purposes.

     The advantages of systematic measurements of boys from the scholastic and
the scientiSc points of view are alluded to, and it is suggested that an endeavour
should he made to encourage and systematise such work in large schools.

                  By W. WiLBERFOECE Smith, M.I)., M.ii.C.P.

     Some 25,000 separate weighings, made by the author in the course of years,
afford some results interesting to the Section, notwithstanding that others, forming
the greater part of his observations, are outside its scope. Thus, in June 1892,
twelve men of the Horse Guards were tested. Apart from the body weight,

together with height, breathing capacity, &c., of these fine fellows, it is suggestive
to notice the immense weight of the accoutrements which they wear as ordinarily

seen in public. The charts shown also illustrated the following points, viz., the
relation of weight to chest-girth, the regular growth of girls, and the remarkable
increase which occurs at the time of emergence into womanhood, rapid loss of
nutrition associated with departure from home routine, weight in corpulency, and
the eiiect of alcohol and of its cessation.

     The object of this paper is to trace the various decorative elements found in
early Christian art in Great Britain to their source, and to show in what way the

native styles of art existing in this country at the time of the introduction of
                                                                                  --

Christianity {circa a.b. 450) were influenced, first by the Italo-Byzantine art, which
came in with the importation of the illuminated AISS. used in the service of the
Church, and subsequently by the coming in contact of the Anglo-Saxon and
Scandinavian conquering races with the Celtic and other populations already
inhabiting the British Isles. Early Christian art in this country is essentially
decorative, and to a lesser extent symbolic. The conventional grouping and
general treatment of the figure-subjects show that they are obviously barbarous
copies of Byzantine originals. If any definite conclusions are to be arrived at with
regard to the evolution of early Cliristian art in Great Britain, it must be by a
careful examination and comparison of the minute details of the ornament. The

--ornament consists of the following elements:

(1) Interlaced work "|

(2) Key patterns   I ^rgjeommeettrriiccaall.

(3) Step patterns  f

(4) Spirals        J

(5)    Zoiimorphic designs  "1    Sr?uggestj.edj ib. y ani· mali,  hi uman, andj

 6     Anthropomorphic designs i  vegetable forms.

(7) PhyUomorphic designs J

     The possible sources whence each of these different patterns was derived are next
to be considered. These are divided into the native or imported styles of deco-
rative art existing in Great Britain previous to the introduction of Christianity
namely, the art of the ages of stone, bronze, and iron, and Romano-British art ; and

--the external sources, made accessible after a.d. 450 namely, the Italo-Byzantine,

Anglo-Saxon, and Scandinavian styles. The spirals are to be traced to a 'late
Celtic ' source in the late iron age, the interlaced work and phyllomorphic designs
to an Italo-Byzantine source, the step patterns possibly to a Saxon source, the
zoomorphic designs perhaps to a Scandinavian source, and the key patterns to the
classical fret adapted to suit the diagonal setting-out lines usually employed in
drawing early Christian ornament in Great Britain.

     Even the brilliant civilisation of Kulturvolher retains traces of a primitive bar-
barism. While the investigations of "VVaitz, Tylor, Lubbock, &c., into the life of
Naturmlker are instructive in showing the growth of thought, the origin of institu-
tions must be looked for among ' Aryans.' Wherever they come from, or, more
correctly speaking, whenever the phase of civilisation associated with the name
Aryan came into existence, their high capacity for development was evoked or
stimulated by contact with Semitic or Hamitic races.

   A further attempt is made here, by the aid of (i.) philology, (ii.) archaeology

in its widest sense, to bridge the gulf between the rude notions of the Uruolk and
distinct developments in Southern Europe.

    The features considered here are found, not only among Kidturvolker, but also
among unprogressive races from the Antipodes to Archangel. Yet, not only are
there differences between ' Aryan ' and Semitic conceptions, but even deviations
among branches of the same family of races.

     Though it has been maintained, on the high authority of Ottfried Miiller and
Philippi, that the Greek legal systems originated independently, Leist, no doubt
rightly, traces them to a common inheritance.

     The richness of the sources varies with the mental endowments, the intellectual
activity, and the literary monuments of the several races.

     The question of punishment, &c., had its (1) religious, (2) secular aspect.
    As among many rude races in modern times there is no system of publie

punishment, so tliere the act of retaliation devolved upon the individual injured.
Still, it is not entirely a private matter, for it is part of the system of centralisation :
in the first degree under the head of the family, in the second under the sacerdotal
classes, the chieftain, prince, or Mng, or both together.

(II.) puninhment by the community or its representative.

which this symbolism is in accord with the ancient Central American sculptures
and the Mexican picture-writings ; also to trace the same symbolism in the Old

World, believing that through it may be found a key to many migrations, and to

much of the intercourse between the Old World and the New in prehistoric

times.

      2. Notes on Flint Saws and Siclcles. By Robert Muneo, M.B.

     The announcement a few years ago of the discovery, by Dr. Flinders Petiie,
of corn sickles made of wooden casings, having as f eeth a number of serrated iliut
flakes inserted along a groove in the concave edge of the implement, and the almoyt
simultaneous publication by Dr. Munro of the discovery of double-handed saws

similarly constructed in the Polada lake-dwelling in Italy, have led to a speculative
discussion* as to whether or not the so-called flint saws, so abundantly foimd

among the prehistoric remains of all countries in Europe, might not have been the
eliminated teeth of such saws or sickles. The author of this paper sees in this
discussion an occasion for reviewing the materials in Western Europe bearing on
the problem thus raised. In the abundance of flint saws during the Stone Age in
Europe, contrasted with the rarity of this implement when made of bronze in the
succeeding age, he recognised a prima facie argument in favour of the existence of
such compound sickles. The result of his investigation into the matter is thus
stated : * In conclusion, we must not forget that our primary basis of facts rests on
the productions of two widely distant archaeological areas, which must therefore be
treated separately and independently of each other. The discovery of these very

interesting Egyptian sickles can, at best, be only used as a hypothetical suggestion
of the existence of analogous implements elsewhere. In support of the theory that

such sickles were in use among the prehistoric people of Western Europe, the author
finds in this rapid review of existing materials little or no evidence. On the other
hand, the compound Polada saws are equally suggestive of a wider application,
and we may, with greater probability of success, look out for the remains of similar
implements among the dibris of prehistoric civilisations beyond that of the lake-

dwellings of Europe.'

           3. On PreTiistoric Eemains in Crete. By John L. Mtres.

     The objects described were obtained from a cave in the valley above Kamaraia,
on the south side of the mountain mass of Psilariti (Mount Ida) in Crete. They
consist wholly of fragments of pottery, of shapes which resemble somewhat those
of the pre-Mykensean pottery from Santorin, Syra, and Amorgos, but decorated
with fine black glaze, and, above this, with geometrical and floral patterns in

white, yellow, and two shades of red. On one fragment part of a human figiu'e
is represented, in a style which recalls that of some Mykensean examples. Some

points of likeness have been noticed between these specimens and those found by
Professor Flinders Petrie at Kahun, and attributed by him to the period of (he
twelfth Egyptian dynasty. But untU a further examination has been made of the

Kamarais cave it is impossible to date the new find with any certainty.

                3. Ethnographical Notes relating to the Congo Tribes.

                              By Herbert Ward, F.R.G.S.

     The subjects that are treated at greatest length in this paper relate to super-
stition and general customs. In the description of the 'N'Kimba' ceremony of
the Lower Congo natives we learn, for the first time, the motive for this remark-

able ' secret society.' Native eloquence is a subject containing interesting in-
formation ; but the most important subjects are those which bear briefly upon

women, their condition and circumstances. The method of cicatrisation, which
is a universal practice among the tribes of the Upper Congo, is described ; and
much concise information is given concerning the adornment and decoration of the
Congo natives in that portion of the paper devoted to costume.

              4. On the Mad Read. By Crocklet Clapham, M.D.

     The author stated that the older phrenology of Gall had been superseded by

Ferrier's cerebral localisation. He then gave some results of his examination of

nearly 4,000 insane heads. For statistics and particulars he referred to papers by
him (' Brain Weights and Head Measurements of Insane ') in Hack-Tuke's ' Psy-
chological Dictionary.' His observations were drawn from eight asylums in the
north of England and south of Scotland, and these compared with a number of

sane heads.

     Insane heads he found to show a larger average size than sane ones, though
insane brains were smaller. His standard of comparison was by a cranial index,
which he obtains by adding together the measurements of the whole circumference
and the antero-posterior and transverse arches of the head. Of these measure-
ments that of the transverse arch was the only one smaller in the insane, and was
in fact the weak point in the insane. The cranial index he found further useful,
as when expressed in inches it indicated nearly the weight of the normal contained

brain in ounces.

     Female heads were smaller and more sjrmmetrical than male.
     Heads increased in size with increased body height and weight ; heads of
those over forty years of age larger than those under forty ; larger in dark-
than in fair-complexioned individuals ; larger in insane professional men than in
              TUANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                            901

Other classes of insane, and also larger than in sane professional men. Gardeners
had the smallest heads. Bricklayers' heads were larger than cabinetmakers'.

A table was shown illustrating the fact that heads enlarged as you went north, but

not regularly, as the smallest heads were from Perthshire.
     The frontal segment of head circumference bore a larger proportion to whole

circumference in insane, which, with the fact of frontal lobes weighing more in
proportion to whole encephalon in idiots and imbeciles than in total insane class,
and the fact that the typical insane head was cuneiform with the greatest
transverse diameter anterior to central point of head, seemed to discredit the
' noble forehead,' and point out the occipital lobes as the seat of intelligence. This
was supported by facts of brain development and comparative cerebral anatomy,
as well as by the flat occiput of idiots and the cerebellum of the Bushmen
projecting beyond the occipital lobes.

6. Pin-wells and Bag-lushes. By B. Sidney Hartland, F.8.A.

Professor Bhys has lately brought together a number of instances, in Wales

and the Isle of Man, in which persons frequenting sacred wells for the cure of

disease and other purposes have been in the habit of throwing pins into the water,

stuffing rags under stones, or tying rags upon adjacent trees ; and he has discussed
the reasons for these practices, suggesting that the pins are offerings and the rags

are vehicles for the transfer of the disease. The object of the present paper is to

Aconsider these and other suggestions. few of the most characteristic observances

at wells now or formerly held sacred in AVales are first brought together. They

are compared with ancient and modern observances on the continent of Europe

and elsewhere at sacred wells, crosses, trees, temples, and other objects of super-

stition. Professor Rhys' suggestions, and the theory recently put forward by

M. Monseur in the ' Bulletin de Folklore ' as to the observances at sacred crosses

and trees, are then discussed. M. Gaidoz, ten years ago, in the ' Revue de

I'Histoire des Religions,' dealing with the same class of cases as M. Monseur, ex-

pressed the opinion that pins and nails were merely substantial reminders for the

deity whose aid was invoked. None of these solutions, however, fulfils all the

Aconditions.  satisfactory solution must apply equally to the crosses and shrines

as to the wells and trees, to the driving of nails as to the dropping of pins and the

tying of rags. It is therefore suggested that the object of the usages was union

with the divinity, to be achieved by the perpetual contact with the god of some

article identified with the worshipper. It cannot, of course, be denied that the

ideas of offerings and of transfer of disease have attached to some of the rites in

later times ; but it is submitted that the original intention was different, and that

these explanations only arose after the real motive was forgotten.

7. On the Primitive Americans. By Miss J. M. Welch.

       8. On the Indians of the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers, Canada.
               By the Right Rev. Dr. Bompas, Bishop of Selkirk.

     These Indians are of Mongolian race, and appear to have migrated from Asia.
They are distinct from the Esquimaux and other circumpolar races. Their languages
are agglutinative, and in some cases almost monosyllabic. They dress in skins,
inhabit houses of skins stretched over wooden frames, and occupy themselves
mainly with hunting. Their arrows are pointed with bone, flint, and more recently
with iron, and hammer-headed arrows are used for striking small birds. In summer
they live largely on the great rivers in canoes of pine trunks or birch bark ; heavy

loads of meat are transported in large boats of moose-skin. They practise ivory
and wood carving, produce fire by means of a drill, cook their food in water-tight
wicker baskets, and formerly tattooed their persons vdth characteristic marks.
The dead are exposed on platforms, out of reach of the wild beasts. European

culture is fast obliterating the national peculiarities.

     The following Papers and Reports were read :

1. Recent Introduction into the Indian Army of the Method of Finger Prints
        for the Identification of Recruits. By Francis Galton, F.R.S.

     Mr. Galton read copies of official letters just received by him from Surgeon
Lieut.-Colonel Hendley, of Jeypore, who had memorialised the authorities in India
in favour of affixing to the nominal roll of recruits an impression ia ink of the fore,
middle, and ring fingers of each recruit, offering at the same time to do so in respect

to those whom he himself examined for fitness to serve. In reply the Commander-

in-Chief ' approved of the proposal to employ prints of finger-tips as marks for
identification, as they are so extremely easy to make, and so useful in guarding

against personation.'

     Surgeon Lieut.-Colonel Ilendley has had considerable experience in taking such
imprints, having already sent to Mr. Galton those of the ten digits of nearly 1,000

persons, most of whom were prisoners in the gaol of Jeypore,

2. On the Excavation of the Stone Circle of Lag-ny-Boiragh on the Meayll
     Hill at Port Erin, Isle of Man. By P. M. C. Kermode, F. S.A.Scot.,

    and Professor W. A. Herdman, F.R.S.

     This was found on excavation to be a circle of eighteen graves arranged in six
sets of three. In each set two graves are tangentially placed, and the third is
radial, projecting outwards from the circle. For such a triradiate arrangement the
term ' tritaph ' is proposed. The sides and ends of the tangential graves are
usually formed of single large stones (up to ten feet in length), while the radial
graves (?) have two pairs of smaller upright stones at their sides, and no end stones.

Possibly they may have been built as passages, but remains of cinerary urns were
found in them, as well as in the tangential graves. About two feet from the

surface was the floor of the grave, composed of flat slabs of various sizes, and under
these slabs we found the broken urns, charcoal, fragments of charred bone, black
oily earth, several flint arrow-heads, scrapers, knives, &c. Near the floor of the
grave was also found in every case a number of rounded white quartz stones,
evidently brought up from the sea-shore.

   A full account of the excavation will be published shortly in the ' Trans. Biol.

Soc. Liverpool,' vol. viii.

    3. On the Structure of Lake Dwellings. By Robert Munko, M.B.

     In this communication Dr. Munro described the various methods adopted by
the lake-dwellers in the construction of the under-structures and platforms on
which their huts had been placed :--

      (1) Pfahlbaiden, or pile-structures proper.

     (2) Solid biisements of wood, or islands made of mixed materials, crannogs,

fascine structures, &c.

     (3) Cellular basements of beams arranged hke a log-house.
      After noticing the fragmentary indications of huts collected from time to time
on the sites of lake-dwell mgs, the author went on to describe the ruins of a cottage
exposed a few years ago by peat-cutters at the Schussenried, Wiirtembei'g. It was
of a rectangular shape, measuring thirty-three feet long by twenty-three feet broad,
and its walls were constructed of wooden beams plastered over with cla)'. Its
interior was divided into two compartments, one of which contained a hearth.
Dr. Munro then gave a description of an equally important discovery recently made
in Argyllshire. This was a crannog showing foundations of a circular house
thirty-two feet in diameter, and also divided into two compartments, one of which
contained a hearth and the remains of a doorway.

          A4. British Village of Marsh Dwellings at Glastoiihtiri/.

                              By Arthur Bulleiu, F.S.A.

     This village, discovered by Mr. Arthur Bulleid in March 1892, is situated a
little more than a mile north of the town of Glastonbury, in the upper part of one of
the moorland levels of Central Somerset found to the south of the Mendip Hills. The
site is fourteen miles from the coast of the Bristol Channel, but only about 15
feet above high-water level. As late as 1540 the neighbouring lands were occupied
either by areas of water or swamp, one mere being five miles round. The village
is bounded on its east side by a natural watercourse.

      There is little on the surface to indicate the site of a village, but on careful in-

fipection between sixty and seventy low circular mounds may be seen, varying from

15 to 35 feet in diameter, and from 6 inches to 2 ft. 6 in. high at the centre. These
form the foundations or floors of separate dwellings, which are constructed in the

--following way : On the surface of the peat is a layer or platform of timber and

brushwood kept in place by numerous small piles at the margin. On this a laver

of clay is placed, slightly raised at the centre, where the remains of a hearth are
generally found. The dwelling itself was composed of timber filled in with wattle
and daub. Not only have the wall-pcsts been found in situ, but also the entrance
threshold and doorstep.

     The extent of the ground covered by the sixty or seventy mounds measures
more than 400 feet north and south, by 300 feet east and west. The east border
of the settlement has been met with, and is well defined by a thick lino of piles
and timber. This side of the village was undoubtedly, to begin with, protected by
water, which in course of time was replaced by an accumulation of a peaty nature.
It is in and on this formation outside the settlement that many interesting struc-

tures entering into the construction of the village have been unearthed, such as

banks of clay and stone, morticed timber and hurdlework. Among other things

that have been discovered is a boat 17 feet long, quantities of wheel and hand-
made pottery, sling stones, and bones of animals, and a great number of objects of
bronze and iron, horn, bone, and stone, such as fibuhx; and rings, knives, saws and
weapons, combs, needles, pottery stamps, and querns.

6. On Early Uses of Flint in Polishing. By H. Stopes.

The author exhibited and described a quantity of flints that had attained a

highly polished or gi-ooved surface from having; been used for pohshing. Several

of these had been elaborately shaped for use, and presented two or more smoothed

or polished facets. They were ordinary nodules, tabular flint, echini, shells or

fihell-casts filled with flint and broken or worn to a fine surface, &c. Many

of them have been polished neolithic axes, and have served as hammer stones and

Aother purposes as well as polishers.  great number are small spear-heads and

arrow-heads. In many cases they have been worn to a considerable degree. They

come from numerous places, but chiefly the Thames Valley, Kent.

7. On Palceolithic Anchors, Anvils, Hammers, and Drills. By H. Stopes.

     The author pointed out the great importance of ascertaining the history of the
development of tools, as the increase of mental power was greatly secured by
improved skill in the manufacture and use of tools. The action was (and is) reflex.
The author defined tools as objects made and used intelligently for a specific

purpose, not missiles or other things used naturally, although it is not yet possible

to distinguish many of these objects. Many specimens of flint and other stones
were exhibited that bore traces of having been made and used as anchors, net weights,
ankers, &c., that were trimmed, round holes occurring naturally in the stone. The
use and fabrication of these, and also the wood and bone doubtless worked at the
earns time, led to the use of anvils, hammers, and drills, many of which were
ehown. Especial attention was drawn to one form of drill that, with a point and
cutting edges, strongly resembles modern steel augurs or centre-bits. All these

t«ols have been found at Northfleet, Kent, at the Milton Street pit, 100 feet above
O.D., excepting a few older ones from the higher plateau of Kent. These possess the
characteristic deep-red ferruginous tint, and are well worked and waterworn.
