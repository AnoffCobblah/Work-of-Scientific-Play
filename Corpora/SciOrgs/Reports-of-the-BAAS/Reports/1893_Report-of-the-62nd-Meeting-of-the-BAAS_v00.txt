                     REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

Report of the Oouncil for the year 1891-92, presented to the General
              Committee at Edinhurgh, on Wednesday, August 3, 1892.

     The Council have received reports from the General Treasurer during-
the past year, and his account from August 1, 1891 to June 30, 1892,
which has been audited, will be pi'esented to the General Committee.

    An invitation to hold the Annual Meeting of the Association at

Oxford in 1894 has been received, and will be brought before the General
Committee on Monday.

     Resolutions referred to the Council for consideration and action if

desirable :

     (A) ' That Mr. 0. L. Tupf)er's paper on " Recent Progress in Indian Agriculture,"

and Mr. W. C. Furnivall's paper on " Kecent Progress in Indian Railways," be

printed in ewienso.'

     The Council resolved that Mr. Tupper's paper should be printed in
full, and Mr. furnivall's in abstract.

    (B) ' That the General Committee meet on the Monday at 3.30 P.M., and the
Committee of Recommendations meet on the Tuesday at 3.30 P.M.'

     The Council recommend to the General Committee that their meeting
on Monday be held at 3.15 p.m., and that the meeting of the Committee
of Recommendations on Tuesday be held at .3.1.5 P.M.

     Resolutions referring to the Ordnance Survey, viz. :

     (C) 1. 'That the publication of the one-inch and six-inch Ordnance Survey Maps

                     is. in the interests of Science, urgently required at the earliest possible

                  date, no less than in the interests of Industry, Manufacture, and

                     Technical Education.'

          2. ' That steps be taken and provision made for keeping the Ordnance Maps
                   up to date.'

           3. ' That the Maps should be made more accessible to the public, and should

                     be sold at a lower price, as is the case in nearly all other official publica-
                    tions, such as Admiralty Charts, Blue-Books, etc'

     The Council have been informed that the President of the Board of
Agriculture has appointed a Departmental Committee to inquire into the
state of the Ordnance Survey, and as this Committee has not yet re-
ported, the Council have taken no further action in the matter.

     The following Resolutions, which were passed by the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of Science at the meeting held at

Christchurch, New Zealand, 1891, have been received by the Council :
-- ----                                                                         --

                         EEPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                                Ixxix

                             Resolutions.

       ' (1) That it is desirable to secure greater uniformity in Biological
 nomenclature, especially in the department of Morphology.

       ' (2) That in order to secure such uniformity the following steps be
  taken :

       ' (a) The appointment of an International Committee to define terms of general
 importance, e.g., terms common to Botany and Zoology, terms relating to Position,

   etc.

         (h) The preparation of an authoritative historical glossary of Biological terms.
       ' (fc") The systematic record of new terms in the various recording- publications.

I' ' (3) That copies of these Resolutions be transmitted to the British and
  American Associations, and to the Anatomische Gesellschaft.'

     The Council appointed a Committee consisting of Dr. Sclater, Dr.

Woodward, Professor Marshall Ward and Professor Howes to consider

these proposals, and have adopted their report in the following tei'ms :

' After considering the Resolutions submitted by the Australasian

Association for the Advancement of Science, we think from the context
that by the word " nomenclature " in the first resolution, is meant " ter-

minology." Assuming this to be the case, we quite agree that it would

be desirable to secure greater uniformity in Biological terminology, but

we doubt whether the appointment of an International Committee would

tend to secure that object.

'As regards the recommendation (h) in the second Resolution, we

also quite agree that the preparation of a good glossaiy of Biological

terms would be of great advantage, if a qualified person could be induced

Weto undertake the task of editorship.     also agree that the glossary

ought to be supplemented from time to time by records, to be kept up in

the various recording publications.'

This Report will be transmitted to the Australasian Association.

The Report of the Coi'responding Societies Committee has been

received, and will be presented to the General Committee.

The Corresponding Societies Committee, consisting of Mr. Francis

Galton, Professor R. Meldola, Sir Douglas Galton, Sir Rawson Rawson,

Dr. J. G. Garson, Sir J. Evans, Mr. J. Hopkinson, Mr. W. Whitaker,
Mr. G. J. Symons, Mr. W. Topley, Professor T. G. Bonney, and Mr. T. V.

Holmes, is hereby nominated for re-appointment by the General Com-

mittee, together with Mr. B. B. Pouiton, Mr. Cuthbert Peek, and the

Rev. Canon Tristram, in the place of Professor A. W. Williamson, Pro-

fessor Boyd Dawkins, and General Pitt Rivers.

The Council nominate Professor R. Meldola, F.R.S., Chairman, Mr.

G. J. Symons, F.R.S., Vice-Chairman, and Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G.S.,

Secretary, to the Conference of Delegates of Corresponding Societies to

be held during the Meeting at Edinburgh.

    In accordance with the regulations the retiring Members of the Council,

                                      |

                           Geological Survey of the United Kingdom,

                                       PRESIDENT.

    In its beneficent progress through these islands the British Association

    for the Advancement of Science now for the fourth time receives a
    welcome in this ancient capital. Once again, under the shadow of these

    antique towers, crowded memories of a romantic past fill our thoughts.
    The stormy annals of Scotland seem to move in procession before our eyes
    as we walk these streets, whose names and traditions have been made
    familiar to the civilised world by the genius of literature. At every turn,
    too, we are reminded, by the monuments which a grateful city has

   erected, that for many generations the pursuits which we are now

    assembled to foster have had here their congenial home. Literature,
    philosophy, science, have each in turn been guided by the influence of

   the great masters who have lived here, and whose renown is the
   brightest gem in the chaplet around the brow of this ' Queen of the

     North.'

        Lingering for a moment over these local associations, we shall find a

    peculiar appropriateness in the time of this renewed visit of the Asso-

   ciation to Edinburgh. A hundred years ago a remarkable group of men

    was discussing here the great problem of the history of the earth.

    James Hutton, after many years of travel and reflection, had communi-

                                                                                                                                            B2

cated to the Royal Society of tliis city, in the year 1785, the first outlines

of his famous ' Theory of the Earth.' Among those with whom he took

counsel in the elaboration of his doctrines were Black, the illustrious dis-
coverer of ' fixed air ' and ' latent heat ; Clerk, the sagacious inventor of

                                                                                                                                                                                   '

the system of breaking the enemy's line in naval tactics; Hall, whose fer-
tile ingenuity devised the first system of experiments in illustration of the
structure and origin of rocks; and Playfair, through whose sympathetic
enthusiasm and literary skill Hutton's views came ultimately to be
understood and appi-eciated by the world at large. With these friends,
so well able to comprehend and criticise his efi'orts to pierce the veil that
shrouded the history of this globe, he paced the streets amid which we

are now gathered together ; with them he sought the crags and ravines
around us, wherein Nature has laid open so many impressive records of

her past ; with them he sallied forth on those memorable expeditions to
distant parts of Scotland, whence he returned laden with treasures from

a field of observation which, though now so familiar, was then almost

untrodden. The centenar}^ of Hutton's ' Theory of the Earth ' is an
event in the annals of science which seems most fittingly celebrated by a
meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh.

    In choosing fi'om among the many subjects which might properly

engage your attention on the present occasion, I have thought that it
would not be inappropriate nor uninteresting to consider the more salient

features of that ' Theory,' and to mark how much in certain departments

of inquiry has sprung from the fruitful teaching of its author and his

associates.

     It was a fundamental doctrine of Hutton and his school that this
globe has not always worn the aspect which it bears at present ; that, on

the contrary, proofs may everywhere be culled that the land which we
now see has been formed out of the wreck of an older land. Among

these proofs, the most obvious are supplied by some of the more familiar
kinds of rock, which teach us that, though they are now portions of the
dry land, they were originally sheets of gravel, sand, and mud, which had
been worn from the face of long-vanished continents, and after being
 spread out over the floor of the sea were consolidated into compact stone,
and were finally broken up and raised once more to form part of the dry
land. This cycle of change involved two great systems of natural

processes. On the one hand, men were taught that by the action of

running water the materials of the solid land are in a state of continual

decay and transport to the ocean. Ou the other hand, the ocean-floor is
ADDRESS.  O

liable from time to time to be upheaved by some stupendous internal
force akin to that which gives rise to the volcano and the earthquake.
Hutton further perceived that not only had the consolidated materials
been disrupted and elevated, but that masses of molten rock had been
thrust upward among them, and had cooled and crystallised .in large
bodies of granite and other eruptive rocks which form so prominent a

feature on the earth's surface.
     It was a special characteristic of this philosophical system that it

souo-ht in the changes now in progress on the earth's surface an explana-

tion of those which occurred in older times. Its founder refused to
invent causes or modes of operation, for those with which he was familiar
seemed to him adequate to solve the problems with which he attempted
to deal. Nowhere was the profoundness of his insight more astonishing

than in the clear, definite way in which he proclaimed and reiterated his

doctrine, that every part of the surface of the continents, from mountain-
top to sea-shore, is continually undergoing decay, and is thus slowly

travelling to the sea. He saw that no sooner will the sea- floor be

elevated into new land than it must necessai-ily become a prey to this

universal and unceasing degradation. He perceived that, as the transport

of disintegrated material is carried on chiefly by running water, rivers
must slowly dig out for themselves the channels in which they flow, and
thus that a system of valleys, radiating from the water-parting of a
country, must necessarily result from the descent of the streams from the

mountain crests to the sea. He discerned that this ceaseless and wide-

spread decay would eventually lead to the entire demolition of the dry
land, but he contended that from time to time this catastrophe is pre-

vented by the operation of the underground forces, whereby new
continents are upheaved from the bed of the ocean. And thus in his

 system a due proportion is maintained between land and water, and the

 condition of the earth as a habitable globe is preserved.

    A theory of the earth so simple in outline, so bold in conception, so

 full of suggestion, and resting on so broad a base of observation and
 reflection, ought, we might think, to have commanded at once the atten-

 tion of men of science, even if it did not immediately awaken the interest

 of the outside world ; but, as Playfair sorrowfully admitted, it attracted
 notice only very slowly, and several years elapsed before anyone showed

 himself publicly concerned about it, either as an enemy or a friend.

 Some of its earliest critics assailed it for what they asserted to be its

 --irreligious tendency an accusation which Hutton repudiated with much

  warmth. The sneer levelled by Cowper a few years earlier at all inquiries
 6 EEPORT-- 1892.

 into the history of the universe was perfectly natural and intelligible
 frona that poet's point of view. There was then a widespread belief that
 this world came into existence some six thousand years ago, and that any
 attempt greatly to increase that antiquity was meant as a blow to the
 authority of Holy Writ. So far, however, from aiming at the overthrow of
 orthodox beliefs, Hutton evidently regarded his ' Theory ' as an important

 contribution in aid of natural religion. He dwelt with unfeigned pleasure

 on the multitude of proofs which he was able to accumulate of an orderly
 design in the operations of nature, decay and renovation being so nicely
 balanced as to maintain the habitable condition of the planet. But as he
 refused to admit the predominance of violent action in terrestrial changes,
and on the contrary contended for the efficacy of the quiet, continuous

processes which we can even now see at work around us, he was con-

 strained to require an unlimited duration of past time for the production
of those revolutions of which he perceived such clear and abundant
proofs in the crust of the earth. The general public, however, failed to
comprehend that the doctrine of the high antiquity of the globe was not

--inconsistent with the comparatively recent appearance of man a distinc-

tion which seems so obvious now.
      Hutton died in 1797, beloved and regretted by the circle of friends

who had learnt to appreciate his estimable character and to admire his
genius, but with little recognition from the world at large. Men knew
not then that a great master had passed away from their midst, who had
laid broad and deep the foundations of a new science; that his name

would become a household word in after generations, and that pilgrims
would come from distant lands to visit the scenes from which he drew his

inspiration.

     Many years might have elapsed before Hutton's teaching met with

wide acceptance, had its recognition depended solely on the writings of
the philosopher himself. For, despite his firm grasp of general principles
and his mastery of the minutest details, he had acquired a literary style
which, it must be admitted, was singularly unattractive. Fortunately
for his fame, as well as for the cause of science, his devoted friend and
disciple, Playfair, a,t once set himself to draw up an exposition of Hutton's
views. After five years of labour on this task there appeared the classic
'Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory,' a work which for luminous
treatment and graceful diction stands still without a rival in English
geological literature. Though professing merely to set forth his friend's

doctrines, Playfair's treatise was in many respects an original contribu-

tion to science of the highest value. It placed for the first time in the
ADDRESS.  7

clearest light the whole philosophy of Hntton regarding the history of
the earth, and enforced it with a wealth of reasoning and copionsnesa

of illustration which obtained for it a wide appreciation. From long

converse with Hutton, and from profound reflection himself, Playfair
gained such a comprehension of the whole subject that, discarding the
non-essential parts of his master's teaching, he was able to give so lucid
and accurate an exposition of the general scheme of Nature's operations
on the surface of the globe, that with only slight corrections and expan-

sions his treatise may serve as a text-book to-day. In some respects,

indeed, his volume was long in advance of its time. Only, for example,
 within the present generation has the truth of his teaching in regard to

the origin of valleys been generally admitted.
      Various causes contributed to retard the progress of the Huttoniau

doctrines. Especially potent was the influence of the teaching of "Werner,
 who, though he perceived that a definite order of sequence could be
recognised among the materials of the earth's crust, had formed singularly
 narrow conceptions of the great processes whereby that crust has been
 built up. His enthusiasm, however, fired his disciples with the zeal of
 proselytes, and they spread themselves over Europe to preach everywhere

the artificial system which they had learnt in Saxony. By a curious fate

 Edinburgh became one of the great headquarters of Wernerism. The
 friends and followers of Hutton found themselves attacked in their own
 city by zealots who, proud of superior mineralogical acquirements, turned
 their most cherished ideas upside down and assailed them in the uncouth
jargon of Freiberg. Inasmuch as subterranean heat had been invoked
 by Hutton as a force largely instrumental in consolidating and upheaving
 the ancient sediments that now form so great a part of the dry land, his

 followers were nicknamed Plutonists. On the other hand, as the agency
 of water was almost alone admitted by Werner, who believed the rocks

 of the earth's crust to have been chiefly chemical precipitates from a

 primeval universal ocean, those who adopted his views received the
 equally descriptive name of Neptunists. The battle of these two con-
  tending schools raged fiercely here for some years, and though mainly
  from the youth, zeal, and energy of Jameson, and the influence which his

  position as Professor in the University gave him, the "Wernerian doctrines
  continued to hold their place, they were eventually abandoned even by

  Jameson himself, and the debt due to the memory of Hutton and

  Playfair was tardily acknowledged.
       The pursuits and the quarrels of philosophers have from early times

  been a favourite subject of merriment to the outside world. Such a feud
8 REPORT-- 1892.

as that between the Plutonists and Neptunists would be sure to famish
abundant matter for the gratification of this propensity. Turning over

the pages of Kay's 'Portraits,' where so much that was distinctive of
Edinburgh society a hundred years ago is embalmed, we find Hutton's

personal peculiarities and pursuits touched ofi" in good-humoured carica-

ture. In one plate he stands with arms folded and hammer in hand,

meditating on the face of a cliff, from which rocky prominences in shape

of human faces, perhaps grotesque likenesses of his scientific opponents,

grin at him. In another engraving he sits in conclave with his friend
Black, possibly arranging for that famous banquet of garden-snails which
the two worthies had persuaded themselves to look upon as a strangely

neglected form of human food. More than a generation later, when the

Huttonists and Wernerists were at the height of their antagonism, the
humorous side of the controversy did not escape the notice of the author

of ' Waverley,' who, you will remember, when he makes Meg Dods

recount the various kinds of wise folk brought by Lady Penelope Pen-
feather from Edinburgh to St. Konan's Well, does not forget to include
those who ' rin uphill and down dale, knapping the chucky-stanes to
pieces wi' hammers, like sae mony road-makers run daft, to see how the
warld was made.'

    Among the names of the friends and followers of Hutton there is one

which on this occasion deserves to be held in especial honour, that of Sir
James Hall, of Dunglass. Having accompanied Hutton in some of his
excursions, and having discussed with him the problems presented by the
rocks of Scotland, Hall was familiar with the views of his master, and
was able to supply him with fresh illustrations of them from different
parts of the country. Gifted with remarkable originality and ingenuity,
he soon perceived that some of the questions involved in the theory of
the earth could probably be solved by direct physical experiment. Hutton,
however, mistrusted any attempt ' to judge of the great operations of
Nature by merely kindling a fire and looking into the bottom of a little
crucible.' Out of deference to this prejudice Hall delayed to carry out
his intention during Hutton's lifetime. But afterwards he instituted a
remarkable series of researches which are memorable in the history of
science as the first methodical endeavour to test the value of geological
speculation by an appeal to actual experiment. The Neptunists, in
ridiculing the Huttonian doctrine that basalt and similar rocks had once
been molten, asserted that, had such been their origin, these masses would

now be found in the condition of glass or slag. Hall, however, triumph-
antly vindicated his friend's view by proving that basalt could be fused.
ADDRESS.  J>

and thereafter by slow cooling could be made to resume a stony texture.
Again, Button had asserted that under the vast pressures which must be
effective deep within the earth's crust, chemical reactions must be power-
fully influenced, and that under such conditions even limestone may

conceivably be melted without losing its carbonic acid. Various specious
arguments had been adduced against this proposition, but by an ingeni-
ously devised series of experiments Hall succeeded in converting lime-
stone under great pressure into a kind of marble, and even fused it, and
found that it then acted vigorously on other rocks. These admirable
researches, which laid the foundations of experimental geology, constitute
not the least memorable of the services rendered by the Huttonian school

to the progress of science.

     Clear as was the insight and sagacious the inferences of these great
masters in regard to the history of the globe, their vision was necessarily

limited by the comparatively narrow range of ascertained fact which up
to their time had been established. They taught men to recognise that

the present world is built of the ruins of an earlier one, and they
explained with admirable 'perspicacity the operation of the processes-
whereby the degradation and renovation of land are brought about. But
they never dreamed that a long and orderly series of such successive
destructions and renewals had taken place, and had left their records in
the crust of the earth. They never imagined that from these records
it would be possible to establish a determinate chronology that could be
read everywhere, and applied to the elucidation of the remotest quarter of
the globe. It was by the memorable observations and generalisations of
William Smith that this vast extension of our knowledge of the past
history of the earth became possible. While the Scottish philosophers
were building up their theory here. Smith was quietly ascertaining by
extended journeys that the stratified rocks of the West of England occur
in a definite sequence, and that each well-marked group of them can be
 discriminated from the others and identified across the country by means
 of its enclosed organic remains. It is nearly a hundred years since he

 made known his views, so that by a curious coincidence we may fitly

 celebrate on this occasion the centenary of William Smith as well as that

 of James Hutton. No single discovery has ever had a more momentous

 and far-reaching influence on the progress of a science than that law ot
 organic succession which Smith established. At first it served merely
 to determine the order of the stratified rocks of England. But it soon
 proved to possess a world-wide value, for it was found to furnish the key
 to the structure of the whole stratified crust of the earth. It showed that
10 EEPOET 1892.

within that crust lie the chronicles of a long history of plant and animal
life upon this planet, it supplied the means of arranging the materials for
this history in true chronological sequence, and it thus opened out a mag-

nificent vista through a vast series of ages, each marked by its own dis-

tinctive types of organic life, which, in proportion to their antiquity,

departed more and more from the aspect of the living world.
     Thus a hundred years ago, by the brilliant theory of Hutton and the

fruitful generalisation of Smith, the study of the earth received in our
country the impetus which has given birth to the modern science of
geology.

     To review the marvellous progress which this science has made during
the first century of its existence would require not one but many hours
for adequate treatment. The march of discovery has advanced along a
multitude of different paths, and the domains of Nature which have been
included within the growing territories of human knowledge have been
many and ample. Nevertheless, there are certain departments of investi-
gation to which we may profitably restrict our attention on the present
occasion, and wherein we may see how the leading principles that were
proclaimed in this city a hundred years ago have germinated and borne

fruit all over the world.

     From the earliest times the natural features of the eai'th's surface
have arrested the attention of mankind. The rugged mountain, the cleft

ravine, the scarped cliff, the solitary boulder, have stimulated curiosity

and prompted many a speculation as to their origin. The shells embedded
by millions in the solid rocks of hills far removed from the sea have still
further pressed home these ' obstinate questionings.' But for many long
centuries the advance of inquiry into such matters was arrested by the
paramount influence of orthodox theology. It was not merely that the
Church opposed itself to the simple and obvious interpretation of these
natural phenomena. So implicit had faith become in the accepted views
of the earth's age and of the history of creation, that even laymen of in-
telligence and learning set themselves unbidden and in perfect good faith
to explain away the difficulties which Nature so persistently raised up,
and to reconcile her teachings with those of the theologians. In the
various theories thus originating, the amount of knowledge of natural
law usually stood in inverse ratio to the share played in them by an
uncontrolled imagination. The speculations, for example, of Burnet,
Whiston, Whitehurst, and others in this country, cannot be read now

without a smile. In no sense were they scientific researches ; they can
only be looked upon as exercitations of learned ignorance. Springing
                                                                                                                   1

                                                                     ADDRESS.                                   1

mainly out of a laudable desire to promote what was believed, to be the

cause of true religion, tbey helped to retard inquiry, and. exercised in that

respect a baneful influence on intellectual progress.

It is the special glory of the Edinburgh school of geology to have

cast aside all this fanciful trifling. Hutton boldly proclaimed that it was

no part of his philosophy to account for the beginning of things. His

concern lay only with the evidence furnished by the earth itself as to its

origin. With the intuition of true genius he early perceived that the

only solid basis from which to explore what has taken place in bygone

time is a knowledge of what is taking place to-day. He thus founded

his system upon a careful study of the processes whereby geological

changes are now brought about. He felt assured that Nature must be

consistent and uniform in her working, and that only in proportion as

her operations at the present time are watched and understood will the

ancient history of the earth become intelligible. Thus, in his hands, the

investigation of the Present became the key to the interpretation of the

Past. The establishment of this great truth was the first step towards

the inauguration of a true science of the earth. The doctrine of uni-

formity of causation in Nature became the fruitful principle on which the

structure of modern geology could be built up.

   AFresh life was now breathed into the study of the earth. new spirit

seemed to animate the advance along every pathway of inquiry. Facts

that had long been familiar came to possess a wider and deeper meaning

when their connection with each other was recognised as parts of one

great harmonious system of continuous change. In no department of

Nature, for example, was this broader vision more remarkably displayed

than in that wherein the circulation of water between land and sea plays

the most conspicuous part. From the earliest times men had watched the

coming of clouds, the fall of rain, the flow of rivers, and had recognised

that on this nicely adjusted machinery the beauty and fertility of the

land depend. But they now learnt that this beauty and fertility involve

a continual decay of the terrestrial surface ; that the soil is a measure of

this decay, and would cease to afford us maintenance were it not continu-

ally removed  and  renewed                                           that  through the  ceaseless transport of  soil
                                                                  ;

by rivers to the sea the face of the land is slowly lowered in level and

carved into mountain and valley, and that the materials thus borne out-

wards to the floor of the ocean are not lost but accumulate there to form

rocks, which in the end will be upraised into new lands. Decay and

renovation, in well-balanced proportions, were thus shown to be the

system on which the existence of the earth as a habitable globe had been
12 KEPORT-- 1892.

established. It was impossible to conceive that the economy of the
planet could be maintained on any other basis. Without the circulatioa
of water the life of plants and animals would be impossible, and with
that circulation the decay of the surface of the land and the renovation

of its disintegrated materials are necessarily involved.

     As it is now so must it have been in past time. Hutton and Playfair

pointed to the stratified rocks of the earth's crust as demonstrations that

the same processes which are at work to-day have been in operation from'

a remote antiquity. By thus placing their theory on a basis of actual

observation, and providing in the study of existing operations a guide to
the interpretation of those in past times, they rescued the investigation of
the history of the earth from the speculations of theologians and cosmo-

logists, and established a place for it among the recognised inductive
sciences. To the guiding influence of their philosophical system the pro-
digious strides made by modern geology are in large measure to be
attributed. And here in their own city, after the lapse of a hundred
years, let us offer to their memory the grateful homage of all who have

profited by their labours.

     But while we recognise with admiration the far-reaching influence of

the doctrine of uniformity of causation in the investigation of the history

of the earth, we must upon reflection admit that the doctrine has been
pushed to an extreme perhaps not contemplated by its original founders.
To take the existing conditions of Nature as a platform of actual know-

ledge from which to start in an inquiry into former conditions was logical

and prudent. Obviously, however, human experience, in the few cen-

turies during which attention has been turned to such subjects, has been
too brief to warrant any dogmatic assumption that the various natural
processes must have been carried on in the past with the same energy
and at the same rate as they are carried on now. Variations in energy
might have been legitimately conceded as possible, though not to be
allowed without reasonable proof in their favour. It was right to refuse

to admit the operation of speculative causes of change when the pheno-
mena were capable of natural and adequate explanation by reference to
causes that can be watched and investigated. But it was an error to take

for granted that no other kind of process or influence, nor any variation

in the rate of activity save those of which man has had actual cognisance,

has played a part in the terrestrial economy. The uniformitarian writers

laid themselves open to the charge of maintaining a kind of perpetual
motion in the machinery of Nature. They could find in the records of the
earth's history no evidence of a beginning, no prospect of an end. They

saw that many saccessive renovations and destrnctions had been effected
on the earth's surface, and that this long line of vicissitudes formed a

series of which the earliest were lost in antiquity, while the latest were

still in progress towards an apparently illimitable future.
     The discoveries of William Smith, had they been adequately under-

stood, would have been seen to offer a corrective to this rigidly uniformi-
tarian conception, for they revealed that the crust of the earth contains
the long record of an unmistakable order of progression in organic types.
They proved that plants and animals have varied widely in successive
periods of the earth's history, the present condition of organic life being
only the latest phase of a long preceding series, each stage of which re-
cedes further from the existing aspect of things as we trace it backward

into the past. And though no relic had yet been found, or indeed was

ever likely to be found, of the first living things that appeared upon the

 earth's surface, the manifest simplification of types in the older formations

 pointed irresistibly to some beginning from which the long procession
 had taken its start. If then it could thus be demonstrated that there
had been upon the globe an orderly march of living forms from the low-

liest grades in early times to man himself to-day, and thus that in one

 department of her domain, extending through the greater portion of the
 records of the earth's history. Nature had not been uniform but had
 followed a vast and noble plan of evolution, surely it might have been

 expected that those who discovered and made known this plan would

 seek to ascertain whether some analogous physical progression from a
 definite beginning might not be discernible in the framework of the globe

  itself.

      But the early masters of the science laboured under two great disad-
 vantages. In the first place, they found the oldest records of the earth's

 history so broken up and effaced as to be no longer legible. And in the

 second place, they lived under the spell of that strong reaction against
 speculation which followed the bitter controversy between the Neptunists
 and Plutonists in the earlier decades of the century. They considered
 themselves bound to search for facts, not to build up theories ; and as in
 the crust of the earth they could find no facts which threw any light
 upon the primeval constitution and subsequent development of our planet,
  they shut their ears to any theoretical interpretations that might be
 offered from other departments of science. It was enough for them to main-

  tain, as Hutton had done, that in the visible structure of the earth itself

  no trace can be found of the beginning of things, and that the oldest ter-
  restrial records reveal no physical conditions essentially different from
14 REPORT-- 1892.

those in whicli we still live. They donbtless listened with interest to the
speculations of Kant, Laplace, and Herschel, on the probable evolution
of nebulte, suns, and planets, but it was with the languid interest attach-
ing to ideas that lay outside of their own domain of research. They re-
cognised no practical connection between such speculations and the data
furnished by the earth itself as to its own history and progress.

    This curious lethargy with respect to theory on the part of men who
were popularly regarded as among the most speculative followers of

science would probably not have been speedily dispelled by any discovery

made within their own field of observation. Even now, after many years

of the most diligent research, the first chapters of our planet's history

remain undiscovered or undecipherable. On the great terrestrial palimp-

sest the earliest inscriptions seem to have been hopelessly effaced by those
of later ages. But the question of the primeval condition and subsequent
history of the planet might be considered from the side of astronomy and

physics. And it was by investigations of this nature that the geological
torpor was eventually dissipated. To our illustrious former President,
Lord Kelvin, who occupied this chair when the Association last met in
Edinburgh, is mainly due the rousing of attention to this subject. By
the most convincing arguments he showed how impossible it was to
believe in the extreme docti'ine of uniformitarianism. And though,

owing to uncertainty in regard to some of the data, wide limits of time
were postulated by him, he insisted that within these limits the whole
evolution of the earth and its inhabitants must have been comprised.
While, therefore, the geological doctrine that the present order of Nature
miist be our guide to the interpretation of the past remained as true and
fruitful as ever, it had now to be widened by the reception of evidence
furnished by a study of the earth as a planetary body. The secular loss
of heat, which demonstrably takes place both from the earth and the sun,
made it quite certain that the present could not have been the original
condition of the system. This diminution of temperature with all its
consequences is not a mere matter of speculation, but a physical fact of

the present time as much as any of the familiar physical agencies that

affect the surface of the globe. It points with unmistakable direct-
ness to that beginning of things of which Hutton and his followers could
find no sign.

     Another modification or enlargement of the uniformitarian doctrine
was brought about by continued investigation of the terrestrial crust and
consequent increase of knowledge respecting the history of the earth.
ADDRESS.                                                          15

Though Hutton and Playfair believed in periodical catastrophes, and

indeed required these to recur in order to renew and preserve the

habitable condition of our planet, their successors gradually came to

view with repugnance any appeal to abnormal, and especially to violent

manifestations of terrestrial vigour, and even persuaded themselves that

such slow and comparatively feeble action as had been witnessed by man

could alone be recognised in the evidence from which geological histoiy

must be compiled. Well do I remember in my own boyhood what a

Wecardinal article of faith this prepossession had become.  were taught

by our great and honoured master, Lyell, to believe implicitly in gentle

and uniform operations, extended over indefinite periods of time, though

possibly some, with the zeal of partisans, carried this belief to an extreme

which Lyell himself did not approve. The most stupendous marks of

terrestrial disturbance, such as the structure of great mountain chains,

were deemed to be more satisfactorily accounted for by slow movements

prolonged through indefinite ages than by any sudden convulsion.

What the more extreme members of the uniformitarian school failed

to perceive was the absence of all evidence that terrestrial catastrophes

even on a colossal scale might not be a part of the present economy of

this globe. Such occurrences might never seriously affect the whole

earth at one time, and might return at such wide intervals that no

example of them has yet been chronicled by man. But that they have

occurred again and again, and even within comparatively recent geologi-

Howcal times, hardly admits of serious doubt.  far at different epochs and

in various degrees they may have included the operation of cosmical influ-

ences lying wholly outside the planet, and how far they have resulted from

movements within the body of the planet itself, must remain for further

inquiry. Yet the admission that they have played a part in geological

history may be freely made without impairing the real value of the

Huttonian doctrine, that in the interpretation of this history our main

guide must be a knowledge of the existing processes of terrestrial change.
    As the most recent and best known of these great transformations, the

Ice Age stands out conspicuously before us. If any one sixty years ago

had ventured to affirm that at no very distant date the snows and

glaciers of the Arctic regions stretched southwards into France, he would

have been treated as a mere visionary theorist. Many of the facts to

which he would have appealed in support of his statement were already

well known, but they had received various other interpretations. By

some observers, notably by Hutton's friend, Sir James Hall, they were

believed to be due to violent debacles of water that swept over the face
16 REPORT 1892.

of the land. By others they were attributed to the strong tides and
·currents of the sea when the land stood at a lower level. The uniformi-

tarian school of Lyell had no difficulty in elevating or depressing land

to any required extent. Indeed, when we consider how averse these

philosophers were to admit any kind or degree of natural operation other

than those of which there was some human experience, we may well

wonder at the boldness with which, on sometimes the slenderest evidence,
they made land and sea change jDlaces, on the one hand submerging
mountain-ranges, and on the other placing great barriers of land where
a deep ocean rolls. They took such liberties with geography because
only well-established processes of change were invoked in the operations.
Knowing that during the passage of an earthquake a territory bordering

the sea may be upraised or sunk a few feet, they drew the sweeping

inference that any amount of upheaval or depression of any part of tho
earth's surface might be claimed in explanation of geological problems.
The progx'ess of inquiry, while it has somewhat curtailed this geo-
graphical license, has now made known in great detail the strange story

of the Ice Age.

    There cannot be any doubt that after man had become a denizen of

the earth, a great physical change came over the northern hemisphere.
The climate, which had previously been so mild that evergreen trees
flourished within ten or twelve degrees of the north pole, now became so
severe that vast sheets of snow and ice covered the north of Europe and
crept southward beyond the south coast of Ireland, almost as far as the
southern shores of England, and across the Baltic into Prance and
Germany. This Arctic transformation was not an episode that lasted
merely a few seasons, and left the land to resume thereafter its ancient
aspect. With various successive fluctuations it must have endured for

many thousands of years. When it began to disappear it probably

faded away as slowly and imperceptibly as it had advanced, and when
it finally vanished it left Europe and North America profoundly changed
in the character alike of their scenery and of their inhabitants. The
rugged rocky contours of earlier times were ground smooth and polished
by the march of the ice across them, while the lower grounds were
buried under wide and thick sheets of clay, gravel, and sand, left
behind by the melting ice. The varied and abundant flora which
had spread so far within the Arctic circle was driven away into more
southern and less ungenial climes. Bat most memorable of all was

the extirpation of the prominent large animals which, before the advent
of the ice, had roamed over Europe. The lions, hyisnas, wild horses,
       ADDRESS.     17

hippopotami and other creatures either became entirely extinct or were
driven into the Mediterranean basin and into Africa. In their place came

--northern forms the reindeer, glutton, musk ox, woolly rhinoceros, and

mammoth.
     Such a marvellous transformation in climate, in scenery, in vegetation

and in inhabitants, within what was after all but a brief portion of geo-

logical time, though it may have involved no sudden or violent convul-

sion, is surely entitled to rank as a catastrophe in the history of the
globe. It was probably brought about mainly if not entirely by the

operation of forces external to the earth. No similar calamity having
befallen the continents within the time during which man has been re-

cording his experience, the Ice Age might be cited as a contradiction to

the doctrine of uniformity. And yet it manifestly arrived as part of the
established order of Nature. Whether or not we grant that other ice ages
preceded the last great one, we must admit that the conditions under
which it arose, so far as we know them, might conceivably have occurred
before and may occur again. The various agencies called into play by

the extensive refrigeration of the northern hemisphere were not different

from those with which we are familiar. Snow fell and glaciers crept as

they do to-day. Ice scored and polished rocks exactly as it still does
among the Alps and in Norway. There was nothing abnormal in the

phenomena save the scale on which they were manifested. And thus,
taking a broad view of the whole subject, we recognise the catastrophe,

while at the same time we see in its progress the operation of those same
natural processes which we know to be integral parts of the machinery

whereby the surface of the earth is continually transformed.

    Among the debts which science owes to the Hattonian school, not the

least memorable is the promulgation of the first well-founded concep-

tions of the high antiquity of the globe. Some six thousand years had

previously been believed to comprise the whole life of the planet, and

indeed of the entire universe. When the curtain was then first raised

that had veiled the history of the earth, and men, looking beyond the
brief span within which they had supposed that history to have been
transacted, beheld the records of a long vista of ages stretching far away
into a dim illimitable past, the prospect vividly impressed their imagina-
tion. Astrouomy had made known the immeasurable fields of space; the
new science of geology seemed now to reveal boundless distances of time.
The more the terrestrial chronicles were studied the farther could the
eye range into an antiquity so vast as to defy all attempts to measure or

18 REPORT-- 1892.

define it. The progress of research continually furnished additional evi-
dence of the enormous duration of the ages that preceded the coming
of man, while, as knowledge increased, periods that were thought to have
followed each other consecutively were found to have been separated by
prolonged intervals of time. Thus the idea arose and gained universal
acceptance that, just as no boundary could be set to the astronomer in
his free range through space, so the whole of bygone eternity lay open to
the requirements of the geologist. Playfair, re-echoing and expanding
Hutton's language, had declared that neither among the records of the
earth nor in the planetaiy motions can any trace be discovered of the
beginning or of the end of the present order of things ; that no symptom
of infancy or of old age has been allowed to appear on the face of Nature,
nor any sign by which either the past or the future duration of the uni-

verse can be estimated ; and that although the Creator may put an end, as
He no doubt gave a beginning, to the present system, such a catastrophe
will not be brought about by any of the laws now existing, and is not
indicated by anything which we perceive. This doctrine was naturally
espoused with warmth by the extreme uniformitarian school, which re-

quired an unlimited duration of time for the accomplishment of such slow
and quiet cycles of change as they conceived to be alone recognisable in

the records of the earth's past history.

     It was Lord Kelvin who, in the writings to which I have already re-
ferred, first called attention to the fundamentally erroneous nature of

these conceptions. He pointed out that from the high internal tem-

perature of our globe, increasing inwards as it does, and from the rate of

loss of its heat, a limit may be fixed to the planet's antiquity. He showed

that so far from there being no sign of a beginning, and no prospect of
an end to the present economy, every lineament of the solar system bears
witness to a gradual dissipation of energy from some definite starting-

point. No very precise data were then, or indeed are now, available for

computing the interval which has elapsed since that remote commence-
ment, but he estimated that the surface of the globe could not have con-
solidated less than twenty millions of years ago, for the rate of increase
of temperature inwards would in that case have been higher than it
actually is ; nor more than 400 millions of years ago, for then there would

have been no sensible increase at all. He was inclined, when first dealing

with the subject, to believe that from a review of all the evidence then
available, some such period as 100 millions of years would embrace the
whole geological history of the globe.

      It is not a pleasant experience to discover that a fortune which one
             9

ADDRESS.  1

has unconcernedly believed to be ample has somehow taken to itself

wings and disappeared. When the geologist was suddenly awakened

by the energetic warning of the physicist, who assured him that he had
enormously overdrawn his account with past time, it was but natural

under the circumstances that he should think the accountant to be mis-

taken, who thus returned to him dishonoured the large drafts he had
made on eternity. He saw how wide were the limits of time deducible
from physical considerations, how vague the data from which they had
been calculated. And though he could not help admitting that a limit

must be fixed beyond which his chronology could not be extended, he
consoled himself with the reflection that after all a hundred millions of
years was a tolerably ample period of time, and might possibly have been

quite sufficient for the transaction of all the prolonged sequence of events

recorded in the crust of the earth. He was therefore disposed to acquiesce

in the limitation thus imposed upon geological history.
     But physical inquiry continued to be pushed forward with regard to

the early history and the antiquity of the earth. Further consideration
of the influence of tidal friction in retarding the earth's rotation, and of
the sun's rate of cooling, led to sweeping reductions of the time allowable
for the evolution of the planet. The geologist found himself in the

plight of Lear when his bodyguard of one hundred knights was cut down.
' What need vou five-and-twenty, ten or five ? ' demands the inexorable

physicist, as he remorselessly strikes slice after slice from his allowance
of geological time. Lord Kelvin is willing, I believe, to grant us some
twenty millions of years, but Professor Tait would have us content with

less than ten millions.

    In scientific as in other mundane questions there may often be two
sides, and the truth may ultimately be found not to lie wholly with either.

I frankly confess that the demands of the early geologists for an unlimited

series of ages were extravagant, and even, for their own purposes, unneces-
sary, and that the physicist did good service in reducing them. It may

also be freely admitted that the latest conclusions from physical con-
siderations of the extent of geological time require that the interpretation
given to the record of the rocks should be rigorously revised, with the view

of ascertaining how far that interpretation may be capable of modification
or amendment. But we must also remember that the geological record

constitutes a voluminous body of evidence regarding the earth's history
which cannot be ignored, and must be explained in accordance with as-
certained natural laws. If the conclusions derived from the most careful
study of this record cannot be reconciled with those drawn from physical

                                                                                                                                               c2

considerations, it is surely not too much to ask that the latter should be

also revised. It has been well said that the mathematical mill is an ad-
mirable piece of machinery, but that the value of what it yields depends
upon the quality of what is put into it. That there must be some flaw

in the physical argument I can, for my own part, hardly doubt, though

I do not pretend to be able to say where it is to be found. Some as-
sumption, it seems to me, has been made, or some consideration has been

left out of sight, whicb will eventually be seen to vitiate the conclusions,
and which when duly taken into account will allow time enough for any

reasonable interpretation of the geological record.

In problems of this nature, where geological data capable of numerical

statement are so needful, it is hardly possible to obtain trustworthy com-

Weputations of time.     can only measure the rate of changes in progress

now, and infer from these changes the length of time required for the com-

pletion of results achieved by the same processes in the past. There is for-

tunately one great cycle of movement which admits of careful investigation,

and which has been made to furnish valuable materials for estimates of

this kind. The universal degradation of the land, so notable a character-

istic of the earth's surface, has been regarded as an extremely slow

process. Though it goes on without ceasing, yet from century to cen-

tury it seems to leave hardly any perceptible trace on the landscapes of

a country. Mountains and plains, hills and valleys, appear to wear the

same familiar aspect which is indicated in the oldest pages of history.

This obvious slowness in one of the most important departments of

geological activity, doubtless contributed in large measure to form and

foster a vague belief in the vastness of the antiquity required for the

evolution of the earth.

But, as geologists eventually came to perceive, the rate of degradation

of the land is capable of actual measurement. The amount of material

worn away from the surface of any drainage-basin and carried in the form

of mud, sand, or gravel, by the main river into the sea, repi'esents the

extent to which that surface has been lowered by waste in any given

period of time. But denudation and deposition must be equivalent to

each other. As much material must be laid down in sedimentary accu-

mulations as has been mechanically removed, so that in measuring the

annual bulk of sediment borne into the sea by a river, we obtain

a clue not only to the rate of denudation of the land, but also to the

rate at which the deposition of new sedimentary formations takes

place.

As might be expected, the activities involved in the lowering of the
                ADDEESS.                                         2]

surface of the land are not everywhere equally energetic. They are

naturally more vigorous where the rainfall is heavy, where the daily

range of temperature is large, and where frosts are severe. Hence they

are obviously much more effective in mountainous regions than on plains
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

and their results must constantly vary, not only in different basins of drain-

age, but even, and sometimes widely, within the same basin. Actual

measurement of the proportion of sediment in river water shows that

while in some cases the lowering of the surface of the land may be as

y^much as  of a foot in a year, in others it falls as low as ij-g'oo^. In

other words, the rate of deposition of new sedimentary formations, over

an area of sea-floor equivalent to that which has yielded the sediment,

may vary from one foot in 730 years to one foot in 6,800 years.

If now we take these results and apply them as measures of the length

of time required for the deposition of the various sedimentary masses

that form the outer part of the earth's crust, we obtain some indication of
the duration of geological history. On a reasonable computation these

stratified masses, where most fully developed, attain a united thickness of

not less than 100,000 feet. If they were all laid down at the most rapid
recorded rate of denudation, they would require a period of seventy-
three millions of years for their completion. If they were laid down
at the slowest rate they would demand a period of not less than 680

millions.

    But it may be argued that all kinds of terrestrial energy are growing
feeble, that the most active denudation now in progress is much less

vigorous than that of bygone ages, and hence that the stratified part of

thie earth's crust may have been put together in a much briefer space of

time than modern events might lead us to suppose. Such arguments are
easily adduced and look sufficiently specious, but no confirmation of them

can be gathered from the rocks. On the contrary, no one can thought-

fully study the various systems of stratified formations without being

impressed by the fulness of their evidence that, on the wtole, the accu-
mulation of sediment has been extremely slow. Again and again we

encounter groups of strata composed of thin paper-like laminae of the

finest silt, which evidently settled down quietly and at intervals on the

Wesea bottom.   find successive layers covered with ripple-marks and

sun-cracks, and we recognise in them memorials of ancient shores where

sand and mud tranquilly gathered as they do in sheltered estuaries at the

Wepresent day.  can see no proof whatever, nor even any evidence which

suggests, that on the whole the rate of waste and sedimentation was more

rapid during Mesozoic and Pateozoic time than it is to-day. Had
22 REPORT-- 1892.

there been any marked difference in this rate from ancient to modern

times, it would be incredible that no clear proof of it should have been

recorded in the crust of the earth.

But in actual fact the testimony in favour of the slow accumulation

and high antiquity of the geological record is much stronger than might

be inferred from the mere thickness of the stratified formations. These

sedimentary deposits have not been laid down in one unbroken sequence,

but have had their continuity interrupted again and again by upheaval

and depression. So fragmentary are they in some regions, that we can

easily demonstrate the length of time represented there by still existing

sedimentary strata to be vastly less than the time indicated by the gaps

in the series.

There is yet a further and impressive body of evidence furnished by

the successive races of plants and animals which have lived upon the

earth and have left their remains sealed up within its rocky crust. No
one now believes in the exploded doctrine that successive creations and

universal destructions of organic life are chronicled in the stratified

rocks. It is everywhere admitted that, from the remotest times up to

the present day, there has been an onward march of development, type

succeeding type in one long continuous progression. As to the rate

of this evolution precise data are wanting. There is, however, the

important negative argument furnished by the absence of evidence of

recognisable specific variations of organic forms since man began to

Weobserve and record.  know that within human experience a few

species have become extinct, but there is no conclusive proof that a
single new species has come into existence, nor are appreciable variations

readily apparent in forms that live in a wild state. The seeds and plants

found with Egyptian mummies, and the flowers and fruits depicted on

Egyptian tombs, are easily identified with the vegetation of modern
Egypt. The embalmed bodies of animals found in that country show no

sensible divergence from the structure or proportions of the same animals

at the present day. The human races of Northern Africa and "Western

Asia were already as distinct when portrayed by the ancient Egyptian

artists as they are now, and they do not seem to have undergone any

perceptible change since then. Thus a lapse of four or five thousand

years has not been accompanied by any recognisable variation in such

forms of plant and animal life as can be tendered in evidence. Absence

of sensible change in these instances is, of course, no proof that consider-

able alteration may not have been accomplished in other forms more

exposed to vicissitudes of climate and other external influences. But it
       !

            ADDRESS.  23

furnislies at least a presumption in favour of the extremely tardy progress

of organic variation.

     If, however, we extend our vision beyond the narrow range of human

history, and look at the remains of the plants and animals preserved in

those younger formations which, though recent when regarded as parts

of the whole geological record, must be many thousands of years older

than the very oldest of human monuments, we encounter the most

impressive proofs of the persistence of specific forms. Shells which

lived in our seas before the coming of the Ice Age present the very same

peculiarities of form, structure, and ornament which their descendants

still possess. The lapse of so enormous an interval of time has not

sufficed seriously to modify them. So too with the plants and the higher

animals which still survive. Some forms have become extinct, but few

or none which remain display any transitional gj-adations into new

Wespecies.  must admit that snch transitions have occurred, that indeed

they have been in progress ever since organised existence began upon our

planet, and are doubtless taking place now. But we cannot detect them

on the way, and we feel constrained to believe that their march must be

excessively slow.

     There is no reason to think that the rate of organic evolution has ever
seriously varied ; at least no proof has been adduced of such variation.
Taken in connection with the testimony of the sedimentary rocks, the
inferences deducible from tossils entirely bear out the opinion that the
building np of the stratified crust of the earth has been extremely

gradual. If the many thousands of years which have elapsed since the
Ice Age have produced no appreciable modification of surviving plants
and animals, how vast a period must have been required for that

marvellous scheme of organic development which is chronicled in the

rocks

     After careful reflection on the subject, I affirm that the geological
record furnishes a mass of evidence which no arguments drawn from
other departments of Nature can explain away, and which, it seems to
me, cannot be satisfactorily interpreted save with an allowance of time

much beyond the narrow limits which recent physical speculation would

concede.

     I have reserved for final consideration a branch of the history of the
earth which, while it has become, within the lifetime of the present gene-
ration, one of the most interesting and fascinating departments of geo-
logical inquiry, owed its first impulse to the far-seeing intellects of Hutton
 24 REPORT-- 1892.

 and Playfair. With the peneti'ation of genius these illustrious teachers
 perceived that if the broad masses of land and the great chains of moun-
 tains owe their origin to stupendous movements which from time to time
 have convulsed the earth, their details of contour must be mainly due to
 the eroding power of running water. They recognised that as the surface
 of the land is continually worn down, it is essentially by a process of
 sculpture that the physiognomy of every country has been developed,
 valleys being hollowed out and hills left standing, and that these in-
 equalities in topographical detail are only varying and local accidents in

 the progress of the one great process of the degradation of the land.

     From the broad and guiding outlines of theory thus sketched we have
now advanced amid ever- widening multiplicity of detail into a fuller and

nobler conception of the origin of scenery. The law of evolution is
written as legibly on the landscapes of the earth as on any other page of
the Book of Nature. Not only do we recognise that the existing topo-
graphy of the continents, instead of being primeval in origin, has gradu-
ally been developed after many precedent mutations, but we are enabled
to trace these earlier revolutions in the structure of every hill and glen.
Each mountain-chain is thus found to be a memorial of many successive
stages in geographical evolution. Within certain limits, land and sea
have changed places again and again. Volcanoes have broken out and
have become extinct in many countries long before the advent of man.
Whole tribes of plants and animals have meanwhile come and gone, and
in leaving their remains behind them as monuments at once of the slow
development of organic types, and of the prolonged vicissitudes of the
terrestrial surface, have furnished materials for a chronological arrange-
ment of the earth's topographical features. Nor is it only from the
organisms of former epochs that broad genei'alisations may be drawn
regarding revolutions in geography. The living plants and animals of
to-day have been discovered to be eloquent of ancient geographical
features that have long since vanished. In their distribution they tell
us that climates have changed, that islands have been disjoined from
continents, that oceans once united have been divided from each other,
or once separate have now been joined ; that some tracts of land have
disappeared, while others for prolonged periods of time have remained in
isolation. The present and the past are thus linked together not merely
by dead matter, but by the world of living things, into one vast system

of continuous progression.
     In this marvellous increase of knowledge regarding the transforma-

mytions of the earth's surface, one of the most impressive features, to

mind, is the power now given to us of perceiving the many striking

contrasts between the present and former aspects of topography and

Wescenery.  seem to be endowed with a new sense. What is seen by

-- --the bodily eye mountain, valley, or plain serves but as a veil, beyond

which, as we raise it, visions of long-lost lands and seas rise before us in

a far-retreating vista. Pictures of the most diverse and opposite cha-

racter are beheld, as it were, through each other, their lineaments subtly

interwoven and even their most vivid contrasts sub'dued into one blended

harmony. Like the poet, ' we see, but not by sight alone ' ; and the ' ray

of fancy ' which, as a sunbeam, lightened up his landscape, is for us

broadened and brightened by that play of the imagination which science

can so vividly excite and prolong.

     Admirable illustrations of this modern interpretation of scenery are

supplied by the district wherein we are now assembled. On every side

of us rise the most convincing proofs of the reality and potency of that

ceaseless sculpture by which the elements of landscape have been carved

into their present shapes. Turn where we may, our eyes rest on hills

that project above the lowland, not because they have been upheaved

into these positions, but because their stubborn materials have enabled

them better to withstand the degradation which has worn down the

softer strata into the plains around them. Inch by inch the surface of

the land has been lowered, and each hard rock successively laid bare has

communicated its own characteristics of form and colour to the scenery.

If, standing on the Castle Rock, the central and oldest site in Edin-

burgh, we allow the bodily eye to wander over the fair landscape, and

the mental vision to range through the long vista of earlier landscapes

which science here reveals to us, what a strange series of pictures passes

before our gaze ! The busy streets of to-day seem to fade away into the

mingled copsewood and forest of prehistoric time. Lakes that have long

since vanished gleam through the woodlands, and a rude canoe pushing

from the shore startles the red deer that had come to drink. While we

look, the picture changes to a polar scene, with bushes of stunted Arctic

willow and birch, among which herds of reindeer browse and the huge

mammoth makes his home. Thick sheets of snow are draped all over the

hills around, and far to the north-west the distant gleam of glaciers and

snow-fields marks the line of the Highland mountains. As we muse on

this strange contrast to the living world of to-day the scene appears to

grow more Arctic in aspect, until every hill is buried under one vast

sheet of ice, 2,000 feet or more in thickness, which fills up the whole

midland valley of Scotland and creeps slowly eastward into the basin of
                   --

the Nortli Sea. Here the curtain drops upon our taoving pageant, for in

the geological record of this part of the country an enormous gap occurs

before the coming of the Ice Age.

    When once more the spectacle resumes its movement the scene is-

found to have utterly changed. The familiar hills and valleys of the

Lothians have disappeared. Dense jungles of a strange vegetation

--tall reeds, club-mosses, and tree-ferns spread over the steaming swamps

that stretch for leagues in all directions. Broad lagoons and open seas

are dotted with little volcanic cones which throw out their streams of

lava and showers of ashes. Beyond these, in dimmer outline and older in

date, we descry a wide lake or inland sea, covering the whole midland

valley and marked with long lines of active volcanoes, some of them several

thousand feet in height. And still further and fainter over the same

region, we may catch a glimpse of that still earlier expanse of sea which

ill Silurian times overspread most of Britain. But beyond this scene our

Wevision fails.  have reached the limit across which no geological

evidence exists to lead the imagination into the primeval darkness

beyond.

Such in briefest outline is the succession of mental pictures which

modern science enables us to frame out of the landscapes around Edin-

burgh. They may be taken as illustrations of what may be drawn, and

sometimes with even greater fulness and vividness, from any district in

these islands. I cite them especially because of their local interest

in connection with the present meeting of the Association, and because

the rocks that yield them gave inspiration to those great masters whose

claims on our recollection, not least for their explanation of the origin of

scenery, I have tried to recount this evening. But I am further impelled

to dwell on these scenes from an overmastering personal feeling to which

I trust I may be permitted to give expression. It was these green hills

and grey crags that gave me in boyhood the impulse that has furnished
the work and joy of my life. To them, amid changes of scene and

surroundings, my heart ever fondly turns, and here I desire gratefully to

acknowledge that it is to their influence that I am indebted for any claim
I may possess to stand in the proud position in which your choice has

placed me.

     The chair was taken by Mr. G. J. Symons, F.R.S., the Corresponding
Societies Committee being also represented by Sir Douglas Galton,

Dr. Garson, Mr. W. Whitaker, Mr. W. Topley, and Professor R. Meldola

as Secretary.

     The Report of the Corresponding Societies Committee, printed copies
of which had been circulated among the Delegates, was, on the motion
of the Chaii'man, taken as read. The subjects Created of in the Report
were then dealt with in the order of the Sections.

                                                    Section A.

   --Temperature Variation in Lakes, Rivers, and Estuaries. Mr. Mark

Stirrup stated that the Manchester Geological Society had been of some
use in this inquiry. Some few years ago he had solicited the Water
Committee of the Manchester Corporation to undertake observations iu
their lai-ge reservoirs at Woodhead, but although these were commenced.
CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  31

a difficulty was soon experienced in finding reliable observers, and they
had consequently to be given up. Mr. Wa.tts had, however, at his request,
taken the matter up with regard to the Oldham reservoirs, and had been
at great pains to make trustworthy observations, which had received the

warm appi-oval of the Temperature Committee.

     Mr. M. H. Mills thought that it might be advantageous if similar
observations were extended to the temperature variations of underground

waters.

     Tbe Chairman explained that there was already a Committee of the
Association dealing with underground temperatures, and he suggested

--that they might extend their work to water as well as soil.
     Meteorological Photography. The Chairman stated that some progress
had been made during the year with the work of this Committee, and
they had been fortunate in obtaining some very good photographs of
clouds, lightning, frost effects, &c. These photographs were exhibited in
the meeting-room of Section A, and he invited the Delegates to inspect

them. A report of what had been thus far done would be presented

during the meeting, and he expressed the hope that the Delegates would
assist the Committee by securing the co-operation of amateur photo-

graphers throughout the country.
      Mr. Gushing presented two photographs showing the effects of a snow-

storm taken during the previous vrinter.

                                                    Section C.

  --Oeological Photography. The Rev. J. O, Bevan announced that on

his representation the Woolhope Club had recently appointed a Committee
to deal with this subject, and he hoped that their efforts during the year
would be of use to the Geological Photographs Committee.

    Mr. O. W. Jeffs stated that the work of this Committee, of which he was
Secretary, had made satisfactory progress during the year, and he ex-

pressed his thanks to the Corresponding Societies not only for the assist-

ance which they had rendered by supplying photographs, but also for

the interest which they had raised in different parts of the country.
As a result of the work an exhibition of photographs had been arranged
in the meeting-room of Section G. The total number of photographs
received during the year was 300. "With respect to amateur photographic
societies Mr. Jeffs stated that their Committee had not yet received from
them the assistance which they had hoped. Although a large number of
people in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales had helped them, it was

necessary to point out that what was now wanted was work of a more
systematic character. The Yorkshire Naturalists' Union had sent in the
largest number of photographs received from any one society. The Bast
Kent Natural History Society had also formed a photographic section and
had sent in the results, but in other parts of the country work had not

been carried on to the same extent, and he hoped that some of the
Delegates would advocate their cause and promote local photographic

surveys on a systematic plan.

    Mr. Wm. Gray remarked that the Committee must not be discouraged

by the limited number of photographs which might be sent in during any
particular year, because at the present stage, when the whole scheme was
being organised, the number of photographs did not indicate the amount

oof work that was being done. Thus the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club
 32 REPORT-- 1892.

 had been well represented last year, but would not be so well represented
 this year, because they were engaged in organising their work and pre-

 paring their own lists. When these were ready the work would progress

 more rapidly.

      Mr. Gushing presented two photographs on behalf of the Croydon
 Microscopical and Natural History Club.

     The Rev. H. H. Win wood raised a question with respect to the obtain-

 ing of copies of the photographs. The amateur photographer took the

negatives, but did not wish to be troubled with multiplying prints. He

thought it desirable that the name of the person holding the negative
 should be made known in order that copies of any particular photograph

 might be obtained.
      Mr. Gray stated that this was one of the points which had been con-

sidered by their Society in Belfast, and they proposed to inform the public
where copies of the photographs were to be obtained.

     Mr. Sowerbutts said he knew a considerable number of amateur
photographers who would not send away their negatives to be printed

from, nor would they allow prints to be made without their consent. He

had tried to do something for the Committee with amateur photographers
in Lancashire, but had found that the amateur who went out to photo-
graph did not usually confine himself to such subjects as were required
by the Committee. About 120 negatives had been taken by the Man-
chester Geographical Society, but these had not been taken specially for
geological purposes, and only four had been sent to the Committee. The

Manchester Geological Society, represented by Mr. Mark Stirrup, took
photographs for scientific and not for mere pictorial purposes, and these

would, no doubt, be of greater value. Their Geographical Society had,

however, arranged to take a series across Lancashire for their own pur-

poses, and any of the photographs showing geological features would, he
thought, be at the service of the Committee.

     Mr. Jeffs said that, in order to remove any misconception which might
exist with respect to the purpose of the Committee, he would state that
their first object was to have a typical collection of photographs illus-
trating the geological features of the country. Their next object was to
enable teachers and lecturers to have copies of any of the photographs
that might be desired. In furtherance of this object they had already
published in their Report for 1890,' and had continued in their present
Report, a list of photographs, giving particulars and the name of the

photographer from whom they could be procured. Any person wanting

copies could obtain them by writing. Of course the fixing of price was a
local matter and beyond the control of the Committee ; he thought that
some of the photographers might be generous enough to present copies
in the interests of science. Mr. Jefl"s added that their Committee could
not undertake to hold the negatives.

     Mr. C. J. Watson suggested that copies of the photographs should be
circulated among the Corresponding Societies, as they could not tell
from the pnbUshed list which of the photographs would be of use to a

local Society. He thought that this would be met by having an album

of duplicate prints for circulation in the manner suggested.
     Mr. A. S. Reid said that he had been engaged for some time in incit-

ing the local Societies to take up this work. He found that the amateur

geologist was not inclined to add to the weight which he had to carry.
The appliances for taking good photographs need not, however, be verj'
heavy, as he had been experimenting with an ordinary hand camera,
weighing five pounds, which he h;id carried over some of the rockiest

parts of Scotland. He had contribated a short paper to the ' Photo-

graphic Quarterly ' for January 1891, showing what could be done with
one of these smyll cameras. Mr. Reid exhibited a print taken from one
of these quarter-plate negatives, which he considered quite good enough
for preparing larger diagrams from for teaching and lecturing purposes.

     Mr. Holgate expressed his regret that the Committee could not under-

take the care of the negatives, as he was of opinion that many photo-

graphers would be willing to take two negatives of any section, one for
the use of the Committee, for the purpose of supplying prints at some
fixed charge to the societies or individuals requiring them.

     The Chairman stated that the Meteorological Photographs Committee
had never experienced any of the difficulties referred to with respect to
the negatives ; those who took the photographs were in all cases willing
that free use should be made of them by the Committee, and he expressed
the hope that in the interests of science it might be the same with kindred

--subjects.
     Sea Coast Erosion. Mr. Topley said that a mass of information had
been accumulated by this Committee, and it had been decided to conclude
their work this year. For some parts of the country the records were

fairly full, but for other parts very meagre. He mentioned that the

French Government had appointed a commission to do similar work,
which had adopted the form of questions circulated by this Committee.

                   Section D.

  --Disappearance of Native Plants. Mr. D. Corse Glen reported that

two papers on this subject had been sent in to the Committee by the
Perthshire Society of Natural Science, but these had apparently not been

made use of.
     The Rev. E. P. Knubley explained that the Committee probably

intended to confine their report this year entirely to Wales and the

adjoining counties in the West of England. In view of the meeting

being at Edinburgh next year, it was likely that the Perthshire lists

--would be taken for the next report.
     Destruction of Wild Birds' Eggs. Dr. Vachell said that the Cardiff
^Naturalists' Society had taken up a case in 1890 with respect to the

destruction of birds and eggs on the island of Grassholme, in the Bristol

AChannel.  Bill had been introduced into Parliament last year by Mr.

Pease, but this had unfortunately not been proceeded with. The pro-

tection of the birds, and of the eggs during the breeding season, was a

very important matter, and he would be very glad if the Delegates would

give some practical aid with the object of furthering the Bill.
     The Chairman suggested that a recommendation from the Committee

of Section D, backed up by a similar recommendation from the Confer-
ence, might be sent up to the Council through the Committee of Recom-

mendations.
     Dr. Garson concurred with this suggestion ; he thought that the

recommendation might be referred to the Council directly by the Sec-

tional Committee.                            »

    Mr. Kermode said that in the Isle of Man they did pi-otect the eggs

as well as the birds, and he hoped that they would succeed in getting
similar protection in Great Britain.

                                                     Section E.

   --Teaclting of Geography in Primarij Schools. Mr. Sowerbutts said

that he had not received any communications on this subject from the

Delegates, so that he could make no statement beyond what he had
gathered in a general way as to the education in the Manchester district.

He distributed among the Delegates a report on geographical education

which had been presented to the Council of the Manchester Geographical
Society, and which contained evidence of very great improvement in the
teaching of this subject. They had communicated with all the primary
schools in Lancashire and Yorkshire, offering to conduct examinations and
to give prizes. Replies had been received from three School Boards, a
number of children had sat for examination, and all the prizes had been
awarded. The two difficulties which had been met with were, first, the
pressure of time in primary schools ; and, secondly, that geography was

not a compulsory subject under the Code. He considered the report itself

as of great interest and value. One paper by Mr. Cardwell, of St. Bede's
College, might almost be nsed as a text-book by any teacher who would

adopt it for his pupils. Mr. Sowerbutts expressed his willingness to

follow up the subject, Avhich in his opinion had not received much en-
couragement from the Government Departments, and he added that if

the Delegates would refer to the report which he had circulated, and
communicate with him, he sliould be in a position to give a report at the

--next meeting.'

 ' ' Ordnance Maps. The Chairman stated that at the Leeds meeting
last year a strong recommendation had been sent up to the Council as to
the cost, the antiquity, and the difficulty of procuring copies of the
Ordnance maps. The Council had communicated with Mr. Chaplin, of
the Board of Agriculture, and they had heard unofficially that material
alterations would be made, so that these maps would be very much more

accessible than heretofore. He added that, so far as his experience went,
nineteen-twentieths of the people of this country did not know how to
make use of an Ordnance map.^

      Mr. Holgate said that it would be desirable to have the contours
of different heights printed in different colours. It would then be easy for
teachers to get their pupils to trace out these contours and cut them out

in cardboard. For teaching geography in an interesting way they could
not, in his opinion, have anything better than a raised map, made in this

manner.
      Mr. Peter Price mentioned, as an illustration of the slow progress of

     ' Communications to be addresseil to I\Ir. Eli Sowerbutts, 44 Brown Street, Man-

 chester.

H^' ^ The following resolutions were referred by the General Committee to the
Council for consideration and action if desirable at the Cardiff meeting :

     (1) ' That the publication of the one-inch and six-inch Ordnance Survey Maps i.s,
in the interests of Science, urgently required at the earliest possible date, no less
than in the interests of Industry, Manufacture, and Technical Education.

     (2) That steps be taken and provision made for keeping the Ordnance Maps up

to date.

     (3) That the I\Iaps should be made more accessible to the public, and should be

sold at a lower price, as is the case in nearly all other official publications, such as
Admiralty Charts, Blue Books, kc'

the survey, that the town of Cardiff" had purchased new maps, which had
been found to show only about one-half the present town. The survey
had been made ten years ago, and the maps were quite useless for the

purpose for which they had been purchased.
     Mr. Mills said that it was only fair to state that he had never written

to Stanford's for any map without receiving it by return of post.
     Mr. Gray was of opinion that the maps should be sent gratuitously to

schools. The children often had no idea of what a map meant, and they
should have the maps of their own districts on different scales, in order

that they might gain a better knowledge of geography.
     The Chairman stated that he had recently been to Clevedon, and had

been unable to procure the Ordnance map from the best shop in the town.
He had written to Stanford and obtained one in two days, and had found
that the map was twelve years old.

     Mr. Whitaker said that there was no difficulty in getting one-inch
maps with the contours printed on them, as the Ordnance Survey was

now engaged in producing such maps. The work required time, however,
as the copper plate of a one-inch map took a year to engrave. If the
Government could be forced into using photo-zincography the maps might
be produced more rapidly. He knew that nearly all the one-inch maps

were to be procured with contours, although not with hill shading.

Processes were now being tried at Southampton for printing in the hill

 shading in a transparent ink which would not obscure the lettering, the
roads, rivers, or contour lines, &c. The chief delay occurred in the en-
graving, but the maps were always dated. With respect to the six-inch

maps, Mr. Whitaker said that local surveyors or anyone who could pace
accurately could fill in new features for themselves. In condemning a
map as being of no use, all that was meant was that the new features had
 not been put on it, and that, of course, was bound to happen in growing
 towns like Cardiff, Manchester, and Southampton. The Government
 did not give the Survey the means of going over the ground again. The

 only way of hastening matters and of insuring the insertion of the latest

 features would be to influence the Treasury, which controls all the

 Government Departments.
      Mr. Sowerbutts expressed his belief that the delay was mainly in the

 method of producing the maps. He had been surprised at the facility

 with which the Survey maps were produced in Brussels for about four-

 pence each directly from the zinc plates.

      Mr. Kenward expressed his admiration for the one-inch Oi'dnanco

 map. He said that he had made forty or fifty journeys on foot through
 every part of North Wales and had never found the map at fault.

    --Flameless Explosives. Professor Merivale stated that there was

  nothing new to report this year. The work was still going on, and next

  year they would have something definite to bring before the Delegates.
        Mr. Mills said that the Chesterfield and Midland Counties Institution

  had been carrying on similar experiments, and it was to be regretted
  that both institutions were spending money and time over the same

,

' work.

       The Chairman expressed the hope that they would combine to carry
   on the experiments together.

   --Aid in Anthropological Exploration. Dr. Garson stated that at last

year's Conference lie had called attention to the existence of a Committee
for giving advice on this subject. As an illustration of the evil arising
from neglecting the assistance thns offered he mentioned a case vphich
had come under his notice during the year, in which a large barrow had

Abeen opened at a cost of 100/. large number of valuable skeletons had

been found, but only the skulls and a few long bones of at most three of
the skeletons had been sent to him to work up ; the rest of the bones had
not been preserved. Thus a barrow with a number of skeletons had been
simply destro^'ed and the money wasted. The exploration had been done
as a piece of local work, and if application had been made to the Com-

mittee of Aid they could have given directions or sent some one down to
assist the local Committee. Dr. Garson pointed out that the Committee
of Aid did not pi-opose to take the work out of the hands of, or to lay

claim to the credit due to, local effort ; they wished only to give assistance

and advice. He thei'efore urged the Delegates to bring the existence of

this Committee under the notice of their Societies.
     Dr. Yachell said that he could bear out the remarks made by Dr.

Garson. Some Roman remains had been found at Llantwit Major,

amongst them being some very fine skeletons. Permission had been
obtained to carry on excavations, but they were uncertain whether they
would be stopped, and ultimately they were prevented from carrying on
the work. Several skulls were obtained, but not the remaining portions
of the skeletons, as they had no means at hand of preserving the bones,
which in a few days crumbled to pieces. The skulls were sent to
General Pitt-Rivers, who reported that these were of no use without

--the other parts of the skeletons.
      Registration of PreMstoric Ttemains. Dr. Garson said that the Secre-

tarj^ of this Committee, ]\Ir. J. W. Davis, was not present at the Cardiff

Meeting, but a report had been presented to Section H.
     The Rev. J. 0. Bevan stated that the Woolhope Naturalists' Field

Club had decided to prepare a map showing the antiquities in their county.
It was to be based on the prospectus issued by the Society of Antiquaries,
and they wished to produce a map similar to that which had been pre-
 pared for Kent. They were going to appoint representatives in every
 parish, and to request them to send particulars of any objects of interest
and to enter the positions of such objects on the Ordnance maps. He had
been empowered by his Society to ask any of the Delegates who might

 have seen other schemes to furnish any hints that might be of use before

they issued their own prospectus.
      Dr. Garson suggested that those who were undertaking this kind of

 work should communicate with the Secretary of the Prehistoric Remains
 Committee of the British Associaticm,' as that Committee was making a
 record of all ancient remains thi'oughout the country, and they had a
 .system which it would be desirable to adopt in order to bring all the
 records into harmony.

     Mr. Ken ward approved of this suggestion.
      Mr. Whitaker requested the Delegates to communicate any discoveries
of or concerning ancient remains to the Ordnance Survey. They would

often find errors of omission in the maps, or the periods of antiquities

definitely stated althougli still under discussion by arcbfeologists. If

errors of this kind were communicated to the Director-General of the

Ordnance Survey they would be attended to. As an instance he men-

tioned that a member of the Hampshire Field Club had discovered a

British  earthwork which  was  not  on  the  map                         this  omission  had  been
                                                                      ;

made known to the Survey, and it was now being or would be surveyed

and inserted.

Mr. Kenward stated that he had been able to do a similar thing in

the case of the unnoted Roman camp at Metchley Park, near Birmingham.

                              Second Conference, August 25.

     The chair was taken by Mr. G. J. Symons,F.R..S., the Corresponding
Societies Committee being further represented by Sir Douglas Galton,
Mr. Whitaker, Dr. Garson, and Professor Meldola as Secretary.

                               Section A.

I --Temperature Variation in Lakes, Jtivers, and Estuaries. Dr. H. R.

Mill, the Secretary of this Committee, stated that last year the Committee

had been recommended to draw up its fourth and final report. The

report which had been presented took the form of a discussion of the

observations which had been made during the past three years chiefly

through the agency of the various Corresponding Societies. Their Com-

mittee had been appointed about the time when the Conference of Dele-

gates had taken shape, and it was one of the first pieces of work recom-

mended to be taken up. The object was to ascertain by observations,

taken twice daily, the temperature of rivers, estuaries, and lakes in all

Aparts of the kingdom.    very good beginning was made in England,

Scotland, and Ireland, but unfortunately the Irish observations were

not continued, some of the observers writing to say that they had com-

menced observations but were tired of them, and others that they could

see no good in them. The Cardiff' Naturalists' Society had distinguished

itself by the energy with which the subject had been taken up.

Dr. Mill exhibited a diagram which he had prepared, showing the results

of two sets of observations, the first set made in the River Tafif in the

Castle grounds, and the second set in the Bristol Channel from one of the

lightships. The curve drawn from the first set showed the temperature

during the winter months and the way it varied, falling greatly during
cold weather and rising rapidly during warm weather. The curve drawn

from the second set showed that the water in the Channel was generally

at a higher temperature, and that it kept its temperatm-e more uniformly.

In fact the temperature frequently rose when the land teraperatiire fell,
and fell when the land temperature rose. The subject had also been in-

vestigated by the Fishery Board of Scotland, whose report was being

published. The observers at Rochdale and Oldham had also made an

extremely valuable series of observations, some of which had been pub-

lished by the Rochdale Society. The same thing had been done by the

Manchester Geological Society in connection with the Oldham observa-

tions to which he had referred. The East Kent Natural History Society

had made careful observations in the River Stour, which were accom-

panied by a series of reports drawn up by Colonel Horsley. These reports

would be published in extenso. Observations had been made in the sea

at Dover with the object of ascertaining whether any diff'erence was pro-
38 KEPOiiT-- 1892.

duced by the current running from the North Sea to the Atlantic,
or from the Atlantic to the North Sea, but the result was nega-
tive. The complete list of local societies which had interested them-
selves in the work was a very considerable one, and he mentioned only
those whose contributions were most valuable. In addition to the Cardiff,
East Kent, and Manchester Geological Societies, the Northamptonshire,
]5urton-on-Trent, and Rochdale Societies had all done admirable work.
At Kuaresborough one of the members of the Yorkshire Naturalists'
Union had made some of the most interesting- observations of all, because
ho had taken the readings in conjunction with the air temperature, and
also the earth temperature, thereby bringing out in a very interesting
way the great activity of the sui'face water in responding to changes in
the atmosphere. This observer had also made a number of most admir-
able observations under the ice during the severe winter of last year.

He found that in tlie first spell of freezing the average temperature under

the ice was under 34°. There was a thaw and another frost, and it fell
to 83°. Another thaw followed, and then a third frost, and it was only
(.luring the third period of freezing that the average temperature of the
Avater came down to 32°. It was very fortunate that the work of the
Committee had been extended over last year, and that the observers had

met with such favourable conditions. He thanked the Delegates, the

observers, and the Secretaries for the completeness with which the
observations had been carried out. In several cases the observers had

carried on the work on their own account, and he trusted that such
observations would be continued and extended. Dr. Mill, in conclusion,

expressed his willingness to render all possible assistance to such observers.

     The Chairman said that for some reasons he regretted that the work
of this Committee had come to an end, but he thought that their efforts

had prepared the waj^ for future organisation. He did not see why the

Royal Meteorological Society, which dealt with the question of air and
earth temperatures, should not deal with water temperature. Neither

did he see why the Scottish Meteorological Society should not deal with
this subject. He was inclined to hope that these two Societies might
make some arrangement for conducting and co-ordinating such observa-

tions.

   --Meteorological Photography. Mr. A. W. Clayden, the Secretary of this

Committee, stated that although a large number of circulars had been

sent to the various local Societies asking for contributions of meteoro-

logical photographs very few had as yet responded. The majority of the

photographs Avhich had been sent had come from isolated observers. He

therefore urged the Delegates to bring the subject before their Societies,
with a view to securing organised co-operation.

                                                     Section B.

  --Inquiry iiito the Condition of the Atmosphere of Manvfaduring Toivns.

Professor Meldola said that he had received a letter from Mr. J. R.
Ashworth, the Secretary of the Rochdale Literary and Scientific Society,
asking whether it would be of use for the British Association to appoint
a Committee for this subject, which was attracting some attention in
Manchester at the present time.

     Mr. Mai'k Stirrup said there was a Committee in Manchester busy

collecting information with respect to the exceptional atmo.sphere of that
CORKESrONDING SOCIETIKS.  39

town and its effect on vegetation and the health of the community.' The
investigation was going on, and the report would be published by the
Society ; if any of the Delegates desired copies he would be happy to

forward them on application. He suggested that other towns might be

induced to carry on similar work.

     The Chairman said that the Manchester Corporation had recently
started a meteorological observatory in the centi-e of the town under the

guidance of Dr. Tatham. He referred to the use of ozone papers, which

had been shown by chemists to be coloured by several other gases besides
ozone. Thirty years ago he had made some experiments in London with
identical test-papers, which had been exposed in ditJerent parts of the

town. He found that, in whichever direction the wind blew, the air

coming from the country always coloured the papers more or less, but
air which had passed over the town always lost the power of colouring
the papers. It appeared to him that some simple test of this kind w^s
wanted if it could only be made reliable. Mr. Symons also called atten-
tion to the fact that the Royal Horticultural Society had appointed n
Committee for investigating the atmosphere of London in relation to

fog and plant life.
     Dr. Mill referred to the excellent work which the late Professor

Carnelley had carried out in connection with the determination of the

number of micro-organisms present in the atmosphere of rooms, &c.

                                                         Section C.

     --Geological Plwtography. Mr. A. S. Reid said that their Committee

    had met since the last Conference, and had arrived at certain conclusions,

f which would be made known in due course. They had applied for a

    grant for the purpose of mounting the photographs, and a systematic
    method had been agreed upon, so that the prints could be mounted and
    handled without injury. The subject of lantern slides had been men-
    tioned, but they had decided that the collecting of these did not come

     within their province.

     --Earth Tremors. The Chairman stated that this Committee had during

     the past year been collecting apparatus and diagrams of apparatus for
    recording earth tremors. They had not yet come to any decision as to
    the best form of instrument, and they would be glad of any suggestions

    Irom those interested in the subject.^ Application had been made lor

     leappointment without a grant.

                                                          Section D.

     --Disappearance of Native Plants. The Rev. E. P. Knnbley reported

    that the Committee had been reappointed. From what had been said

     at the last meeting of the Conference he said that he might conclude
     that it was the wish of the Delegates that the reports from the North of
     England and Scotland should be incorporated in next year's report.
    The Committee for investigating the Invertebrate Fauna and Cryptogamic

  --Flora of the British Isles had not been reappointed.
          Destruction of Wild Birds' Eggs. Dr. Vachell said that this subject

          ' The Town Gardening Committee of the Manchester Field Naturalists' and
      Archajologists' Society. The Secretarj' is Mr. Alfred Griffiths, IG Kennedy Street,

--40 HEPORT 1892.

had been bronglit forward at, the meeting of the Sectional Committee,
and a Committee liad been recommended for appointment. It had been
suggested to him by Professor Meldola that the action of the Committee
might be strengthened if the matter were again brought under the
notice of the local societies throughout the country through the Delegates
at the present Conference, and he therefore detailed the facts which had
led to the proposal for the formation of a Committee. In March 1890
the CardiS' Naturalists' Society had visited the island of Grassholme,
and while there observing the ha.bits of some of the wild birds a number
of young men from one of H.M. steamships had landed and shot puffins
and gulls, and wantonly destroyed a large number of the eggs. The
affair had been fully reported in the ' Daily Graphic ' at the time. As there
seemed to be a wholesale destruction of wild birds' eggs going on, the
matter had been brought forward last year in Parliament by Mr. Pease,
and at the time he (Dr. Vachell) had done what he could to bring it

under the notice of the local societies. He had also called the attention
of their Members of Parliament to the subject, but the latter had taken
the view that it was not very serious, and that when boys were home for

their holidays they could not be prevented from taking birds' eggs.
Mr. Pease's Bill proposed to render the destruction of wild birds' eggs
prohibitory under a penalty not exceeding 5s. each egg, and left action
to county councils in England and the magistrates and quarter sessions
in Ireland. They did not wish to pin themselves to the exact text of
Mr. Pease's Bill, but they wanted some legislation for the better pro-

tection of wild birds' eggs. He therefore moved : ' That a Committee be

appointed to take steps for furthering legislative enactment for the better

protection of wild birds' eggs.' '

     Mr. Mills was opposed to the resolution, because in his opinion there

were a great many birds which did harm. He thought that it was neces-

sary for the v/elfare of the country and the preservation of game that

such birds should be destroyed.
     Professor Leipner said it was not proposed to include all birds in the

Bill ; it left liberty of action to the county councils, and he was in favour
of its becoming law.

     Mr. Chisholm Batten expressed his belief that there would be some
difficulty in getting the law efficiently carried out.

     Mr. Hembry approved of the resolution, and said that some good

would be done even if the law were only partially cai'ried out.
     The Chairman pointed out that there had, no doubt, been an abuse,

and it should, if possible, be checked. The proposal was as yet in its first
stage, and all action would }'est with the county councils and the justices,

to whom he thought the proper administi-ation of the law might very

well be left. As it stood, the proposal did not appear to him to do harm to
anybody's interests, and it did not follow that because such a law might be
in existence any person who took a bird's egg would necessarily be fined 5s,

      Mr. Slater remarked that gamekeepers were in the habit of destroy-
ing birds of prey because the latter destroyed the game. The balance of
nature was tiius upset, and the small birds allowed to increase and to

destroy the crops.

     ' The following is the resolution passed by the General Committee : ' That
Mr. Thomas Henry Thomas (Chairman), Dr. C. T. Vachell (Secretary), Professors
AV. N. Parker, Newton, and Leipner, Mr. Ponlton, and Canon Tristram be a Com-
mittee to consider proposals for the Legislative Protection of Wild Birds' Eggs.'
COERESPONDIMG SOCIETIKS.  41

     Dr. Vacbell said that the proposal to form a committee had been

seconded in Section D by Canon Tristram, who had strongly advocated

three Bills which had passed through the House of Commons, and whose
extensive practical knowledge of the subject was beyond question.

     The resolution was finally put to the meeting and carried with one

dissentient.

  --Popularising of Natural History Studies. Professor Merivale said

that it might interest the Delegates to learn what was being done in
Newcastle to popularise natural history, especially among young people.
They had a ' Dicky Bird Society,' numbering some 220,000 members,
and articles were published from time to time in the ' Newcastle Weekly
Chronicle.' One hundred and twenty species of birds had already been
described and illustrated, and the whole series, when complete, would be

rejjublished in a separate form.

     Mr. Sowerbutts also alluded to the useful dissemination of geo-
graphical and zoological knowledge through the same publication ('New-

castle Weekly Chronicle'), and spoke in high terms of the illustrations,
which, especially in the case of the birds, had been executed with

remarkable success by some photo-mechanical process.

  --Botanical Demonstrations for Teachers. Professor Lelpner called

attention to this subject, and invited all teachers in public, private, and
Board schools to attend two demonstrations at University College,
Bi-istol. His plan was to select three or four familiar wild flowers and
demonstrate their structure by means of diagrams on the blackboard.
T'he experiment had been tried one year, and had been so successful that

he had been asked to repeat it a second year.

                                             Section H.

  --Description of Museum Specimens. Dr. Garson said that it was very

necessary for all workers in anthropology to know where specimens were

preserved, especially in the case of local museums. It was sometimes
impossible to visit these museums personally, and the best thing under

the circumstances was to have a good description of the different speci-
mens. This was a subject which the members of local societies might
very well take up. Not only should the implements and other finds be
described, but the conditions under which they were found should be

carefully and completely recorded.

  --Registration of Frehistoric Remains. Dr. Garson announced that this

Committee, of which Mr. J. W. Davis was the secretary, had been re-
appointed. He urged upon the Delegates the importance of assisting in

this work, and asked those who desired information as to the method of

recording to communicate with Mr. Davis.

  --Aid in Anthropological Exploration. Dr. Garson made some further

remarks on this subject in continuation of the observations which he had

made at the last Conference. He said that there was a general notion
that in the case of human remains the skull was the only part of the

.skeleton worth preserving. This was a great mistake. The skull

was undoubtedly valuable, but no less valuable were the other parts of
the skeleton, particularly the long bones and the pelvis. Great care
should be taken to preserve all bones and to keep the bones of each
skeleton sepai-ate, so that the stature and other characteristics of each
individual skeleton could be ascertained. It happened sometimes from
      ---

42 REPORT-- 1892.

want of knowledge on the part of those engaged in excavations that
after the exploration was completed all the bones except the skall had
been reinterred. In some cases sentimentality came into question, and
he instanced a case where, in deference to the wishes of the proprietor's
wife, some extremely valuable remains had been reinterred and thus lost

to anthropological science. He recommended skeletons to be sent to
anthropological museums in preference to being preserved by individuals.
Thus he knew of a case where at the death of the excavator some valuable

skeletons he possessed were buried by his executors, and would have been
entirely lost but that a friend of his having heard of the circumstance

promptly dug them up, and they were now in an anthropological

museum.'
     Mr. Kenward said that, with reference to the registration of ancient

remains, it would be a good thing if Mr. Davis would issue a short circular

of instructions, so as to secure uniformity of results. He mentioned that

the Society of Antiquaries had been working in the same direction and
had appointed local secretaries in different parts of the country.

     The Rev. J. O. Bevan also expressed a desire for information respect-
ing the best form of prospectus to issue on behalf of the Woolhope Club,
which, as he had stated at the last Conference, had decided to take up

the subject of the registration of ancient remains.

      The Chairman remarked upon the desirability of having uniformity
of method in this work, and thought that the Society of Antiquaries
would be the most efficient body for organising the whole system.

      Dr. Garson agreed with this, and, in reply to a question by Mr. Ken-
ward, he stated that the simplest means of estimating the stature of a
body from the remains was to measure the femur and the tibia, making .
tbe measurements with extreme care and using the metric system. The
spike on the upper surface of the tibia was not to be included in the
measurement, and the femur was to be measured along its greatest length,
 the head and inner surface of the lower end of the bone lying in the same

 plane.

   --Interchange of PuhIicatio7is. Among subjects of general interest dis-

 cussed at the Conference was the importance of the Corresponding
 Societies freely interchanging their Transactions, Proceedings, and other
 publications. It was pointed out that, while printing, the additional cost

 of an extra 50 or 100 copies would be very trifling. Many of the Corre-

 sponding Societies are already in the habit of sending their publications
 to kindred Societies. The Hampshire Field Club deposits all such
 publications in the Southampton Public Library, so as to render them

 i'reely accessible.

     On the motion of Mr. Holgate a vote of thanks was passed to the

 Chairman for presiding at the Conferences.
      The Committee recommends the addition of the following Societies to

 the list :

      1. The Federated Institution of Mining Engineers.
      2. The Liverpool Geographical Society.

     On the other hand it has to announce the withdrawal of the Royal

 Scottish Geographical Society.

Report of the Committee, consisting o/Lord McLaren (Ghairman)^
     Professor Crum Brown (Secretary), Dr. John Murray, Dr.
     A. BucHAN, the Hon. Ralph Abercrombie, and Professor Cope-

     land, appointed for the purpose of co-operating with the Scottish
     Meteorological, Society in making Meteorological Observations on

     Ben Xevis. {Drawn up by Dr. A. Buchan.)

During the past year the bourly eye observations by night and by day

Lave been made at the Ben ^N'evis Observatory vritbont interruption hj

]\[r. Oinond and the assistants. At the Low Level Observatory at Fort

William, the continuous registration and other observations have been

also successfully carried on as detailed in last year's report.

                    The Directors have been again indebted to Mr. R. C. Mossman,

F.R.S.E., Mr. Drysdale, M.A., Mr. Craig, Mr. H. F. Rankin, and Mr.

Stewart, B.Sc, from Profes.sor Tail's Laboratory, who have generously

given their services as ol).servers for periods varying from four to eight

weeks during the winter and summer mouths, thus extending much-

needed relief to the regular members of the observing staff.

                    For the year 1891 the following were the monthly mean and extreme

pressures, temperatures, hours of sunshine, amounts of rainfall, number

of fair days, or days of less than 001 inch of rain, at the Observatory, the

mean pressures at the top of the Ben bein? reduced to .32° F. only, while

those at Fort William are reduced to 32° and sea-level (see table next

page) :--

                    The mean temperature of the whole year at Fort William was 47°-0,

being 0°-2 under the mean of previous years. This was the deficiency

in the temperature of IS'Jl over a large district surrounding Fort William.

On ihe other hand, the mean temperature at the top of the mountain was
31°'3, or 0°3 above the average of the year. The mean temperature at

the top as compared with the bottom of the mountain was thus half a

degree relatively warmer, and it may be noted that this excess of the

annual temperature held good in insular situations to the west and south-

west from Barrahead to Islay.

                    The lowest mean monthly temperature occurred at both Observatories

in IMarch, the mean at the top being 2U°0 which was also the mean for

January 1^86, this being the lowest monthly mean since the Observa-
tory was opened. The highest monthly mean at the top was 43°-l in
June, and at Fort William 57°7, also in June. The general character

of the weather for the year was anti-cyclonic, with therefore a large
amount of sunshine, and for the time of the year a small difference in

the temperatures at the two Observatories. The temperature of February
was very high, and the weather exceptionally fine. At Fort William

temperature was 4°-l above the average, but at the top the average was

exceeded by 7°-5. This was by far the mildest winter n.onth hitherto

experienced by the observers. The weather was largely anti-cyclonic, and
on many occasions the atmosphere Avas unusually dry, and temperatures
were higher at the top than at Fort William at the same time. Conse-

quently the difference between the mean temperatures at the top and
bottom was unprecedentedly small, being indeed only approached in this,

being 312 bours in excess of tbe number of bours registered at tbe top.
It may be pointed out tbat tbe number of bours of possible sunsbine is,

particularly in winter, considerably greater at tbe top tban at Fort
William, Tvbicb is enclosed by bills.

     Tbe rainfall for tbe year was 178 02 incbes ; in 1890 tbe amount was
IDS'S-i incbes. Tbese are by considerable amounts the beaviest annual
rainfalls yet observed. At Fort William tbe amount was 78'81 incbes,
or nearly lOO'OO incbes less tban on tbe top of tbe mountain. Hence
while tbe rainfall at Fort William was tbe average, tbat of Ben Nevis
was 24 per cent, above tbe average. Tbe rainfall of September was
phenomenal, amounting at tbe Observatory to 43'55 incbes ; tbe amount
for the same month at Fort William being 13'02 inches. One inch of
rain or upwards fell on each of 16 days of the month, and on the 1st
4'9o incbes were recorded, and 3'37 inches on the 2Dd. It is remarkable
that during tbe extraordinarily heavy rains near the east coast on tbe
20th and 21st, the rainfall at the top of Ben Nevis was light ; and on tbe
other hand, while practically no rain fell in the east on the 17tb, 18tb,
and 19tb, the rainfall on tbe Ben amounted to 405 incbes. At several

of the stations of the Scottish ]\Ieteorological Society tbe rainfall over

this part of Scotland was fully double tbe average of the month ; but at
the Observatory it was three times tbe average.

     The number of days un which tbe rainfall was nil, or less tban the
hundredth of an inch, was 106, there being only one fair day in August,
but the unusually large number of 19 fair days is reported in April, and
18 in June. At Fort William there were 138 fair days during 1891, and
in April, May, and June 21, 18, and 19 are respectively recorded.
Again, while at Fort William at least an inch of rain fell on 18 days
during the year, there were 68 such days at the top of tbe Ben ; and
while at Fort William there was an entire absence of such wet days in
April, May, June, and July, only in April at the top was no such wet
day recorded.

     At Fort William the mean atmospheric pressure was 29'857 incbes,
or 0"030 inch above the mean pressure. The monthly extremes were,
the maximum 30'303 incbes in February, and the minimum 29601 incbes
in October, these being 0-328 inch above and 0'219 below tbe means

respectively.

     On tbe suggestion of Mr. J. T. Buchanan, who has recently been

examining some phases of the bygrometry of Ben Nevis in connection
with the cloud and fog observations, it bas been agreed to institute a

systematic series of observations, having for their object a carefal record
of tbe height above sea-level of the lower surface of clouds tbat from

time to time cover the side of the mountain facing Fort Wilham. The
importance of this new series of observations will be I'ecognised when the

large portion of the year the Observatory is enveloped with a completely
saturated atmosphere is taken into considei'ation.

     Mr. R. C. Mossman has investigated the remarkable squall which
occurred in tbe British Islands on the morning of February 1, 1892.
Tbe more important of tbe results are the rapid rate, about forty miles an
hour, with which it swept over the country from N.W. to S.E., tbe sud-
den fall and equally rapid rise of pressure being at many places fully six -

hundredths of an inch, the sudden great fall of temperature fully ten

degi-ees at many places, and tbe sudden change of wind. Tbese features
are well marked in the Ben Nevis observations, which show well, among
ON METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEN NEVIS.  71

other points, the great height in the atmosphere the squall reached, bear-
ing in its train totally changed conditions of temperature and moisture.

Mr. Mossman has been engaged in discussing the remarkable series of
observations made by Mr. Wragge in 1882 at eight stations well dis-
tributed up the slopes of Ben Nevis from Fort William to the top. The
work is so far advanced as to indicate the important bearing of the re-
sults as regards the vertical distribution of pressure, temperature, and

moisture during the changes of weather of that year.

     Steps have been taken to make the observation of dust particles in the
atmosphere part of the regular work of the Observatory. Eight observa-
tions are made daily, and as each of these eight is the mean of ten, there
are really eighty of these observations made every day. The observa-
tions now accumulated amply confirm the tentative results given in your
Committee's last year's report, as showing a well-marked diurnal varia-
tion. Further, dry, thick fog is shown to contain a great amount of dust,
but thin, wet mist very little. It is when a tbin drizzling mist envelops
the summit that the lowest values are obtained, and the all-important
observation has been made, after consulting the daily weather maps of
Europe at the time, that the winds differ in direction 90°, or even more,
from the winds then prevailing near sea-level. In other words, the
drizzling and practically dustless winds blow out from a shallow cyclone
overspreading this part of Europe at the time. The significance to

weather forecasting of these different types of wind, as regards dustiness,

or dustlessness, to the cyclones and anti-cyclones prevailing is too evident

to call for further remark.

     In your Committee's last report, expression was given to a desire that
a system of special observations on the hygrometry of the atmosphere be
instituted at the two Observatories, with the view of arriving at some
accurate knowledge of the absolute amounts of aqueous vapour at differ-
ent heights under the different weather conditions. With reference to
this, the Directors of Ben Nevis Observatory report that the University
of Edinburgh has awarded the Scholarship placed at their disposal by the
Commissioners of the Exhibition of 1851 to Mr. A. J. Herbertson ; and
that the research to which he will devote his attention during the two
years he holds the scholarship is the hygi'ometry of the atmosphere, and
it is understood that the investigation will begin at Ben Nevis Observa-

tory, and will proceed on the lin'es indicated by the Directors.

     During the past year Mr. Omond has been engaged in an important
inquiry into the relations of the Ben Nevis High and Low Level Observa-

tories to the cyclones and anti-cyclones, or the weather changes of the
British Islands. In this large inquiry the instances dealt with are

arranged into eight groups, according to the direction, N., N.E., E., &c.,

 of the gradient from Ben Nevis in the direction of the cyclone or anti-
cyclone. To these are added two groups, first when Ben Nevis is inside the
 highest isobar; and second, when it is inside the lowest isobar; in other

 words, when the Observatories are approximately either in the centre of

 an anti-cyclone or of a cyclone.
      Dr. Buchan is investigating the observations at the two Observa-

 tories during February and September, 1891, in their relations to the
 changes of weather. These two months have been selected owing to the
 exceptional character of the weather which prevailed, and the admirable
 illustrations afforded of the more striking meteorological conditions, and
 meteorological contrasts of the two Observatories, and other striking

which include the valuable observations made at the northern lighthouses

of storms of wind and rain, and other phenomena, which are made night

Seventh Report of the Committee, consisting of Vrofessor Fitzgerald

     (Chaii^man), Professors H. E. Armstrong and 0. J. Lodge (^Secre-

      taries), Professors Lord Kelvin, Lord Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson,

    A. Schuster, J. H. Poynting, A. Crum Brown, W. Ramsay,
     E. Frankland, W. a. Tilden, W. N. Hartley, S. P. Thompson,
     W. C. Roberts-Austen, A. W. Rucker, A. W. Reinold, Gr. Carey
     Foster, and H. B. Dixon, Captain W. de W. Abney, Drs. J. H.
    Gladstone, J. Hopkinson, and A. J. Fleming, and Messrs. W.
     Crookes, Shelford Bidwell, W, N. Shaw, J. Larmor, J. T.
     Bottomley, R. T. Glazebrook, J. Brown, E. J. Love, and

     John M. Thomson, appointed to consider the subject of Electro-
     lysis in its Physical and Chemical Bearings.

The document refen'ed to in last year's report as being drawn up by the
Rev. T. 0. Fitzpatrick, of Christ's College and Cavendish Laboratory,
Cambridge, is now nearly finished, and represents a great amount of labour,
for which the best thanks of the Committee are due to the compiler. It
consists of a table summarising the results obtained by many experimenters

on the electro-chemical properties of solutions in water, and gives, for
various concentrations, the conductivity, migration, and viscosity data
 of a great variety of salts. It will be printed in next year's report.

     The work of the active members of the Committee is proceeding, but
it is not in a condition for annual reports. In the opinion of the members
present at a meeting held in Edinburgh it was thought best to suspend
the official existence of the Committee for a time in order to be able to
make a more full and satisfactory report on the progress achieved after
the lapse of a few years. Tbey therefore do not at present ask for reap-

pointment.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor 0. J. Lodge,

     Mr. A. P. Chattock, and Professor G. Carey Foster, appointed
      to investigate the phenomeyia accompanying the Discharge of
     Electricity from Points. [Draivn up by Mr. A. P. Chattock.)

During the past year a large number of experiments have been made
on the passage of sparks between points and flat plates, especially with

regard to the differences exhibited by the two kinds of electricity in this
ON THE DISCHAEGE OF ELECTRICITY FKOM POINTS.           73

respect. It was hoped that the results thus obtained would have been
sufficiently complete to submit to the meeting this year, but owing to

unavoidable delays in carrying out the experiments this is not the case.

The main conclusion, however, appears, so far, to be that in the formation
of sparks the anode is a far more important factor than the cathode,
disturbing influences having little or no effect when applied to the latter,
though they may prevent the passage of sparks altogether if applied to
the anode. This is in accordance with Lehmann's recently described
experiment on the effect of a strong blast of air upon sparks. It is also
borne out by experiments now in progress on the critical distance
between a point and a plate at which discharge from the point changes
from the form of a silent glow to that of a spark, the distance being
appreciably greater when the point is the anode than when it is the

cathode.

     Another line of investigation, which was indicated in last year's
report, has been followed up in the attempt to measure the ratio of the
mass of the gas molecules concerned in carrying a current of electricity
to the quantity of electricity carried. The discharge being arranged to
take place convectively along a non-conducting tube of uniform bore, the
slopes of mechanical pressure and electrical potential along its axis are

determined. The apparatus for this purpose has undergone many

changes, chiefly on account of the difficulty experienced in bringing the
electrometer to the potential of that part of the tube with which it is
connected. Stationary conductors within the tube were found to be
unreliable for this purpose, and a modification of the well-known ' water-
dropper ' has therefore been adopted in the latest form of the instrument.

The slope of potential is measured by observing the differences of

potential between successive pairs of positions one centimetre distant
from each other along the tube. The electrometer has thus to measure

small differences of potential at a high mean potential with respect to the
earth. For this purpose an instrument has been specially designed, from
which the leakage to earth seems negligible. To obtain the slope of

pressure in the discharge tube the motion of an indiarubber diaphragm,

separating two air-tight chambers, is observed, the chambei's being

connected, like the terminals of the electrometer, to successive pairs of

points along the tube, and the movement of the diaphragm being

Amagnified optically.  difference of pressure of about five dynes per

squai-e centimetre causes a movement of one scale division in the present

insti'ument, and this is found to be quite sufficient for the purpose.

With this apparatus it is hoped that reliable results will shortly be

obtained.

     Finally, preparations are being made to extend the measurements

already obtained of the strength of field at a discharging point to higher

than atmospheric pressures. For this purpose a powerful compression

pump and a strong discharge chamber are being constructed. Upon the
assumption that discharge occurs by the breaking down of electrically

polarised molecular chains in the gas, it is possible to obtain from such
measurements another rough estimate of the value of the electrical charge
associated with a gas atom, by extrapolating to the pressure at which

the gas molecules are brought close together. It seems desirable to
obtain all the evidence possible which bears upon this important point.

Tour Committee ask for reappointment withont a grant.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Liveing^

    Dr. C. PiAzzi Smyth (Secretary), and Professors Dewar and

     ScHUSTEE, appointed to co-operate tvith Dr. C. Piazzi Smyth in his
     researches on the Ultra-violet Rays of the Solar Spectrum.

The present report is on the proposed experiments (from September,
1891, to January, 1892) for enabling Dr. C. Piazzi Smyth to improve

certain points in the taking of his solar-spectrum photographs in the
ultra-violet by aid of additions to the apparatus obtained through means
of a grant from the British Association at Leeds in 1890.

     The Report continuates the last one by the same committee, as
printed in the British Association's Cardiff volume of 1891, at pp. 147
and 148 thereof, said space being then taken up with little more than
descriptions of vrhat the apparatus, then only just finished, was intended
for. Now, however, a sufficient amount of experiments have been obtained
to allow the results to be classified and collated under three several

 heads, or thus :

      (1) Improved focussing means for setting the focus of the viewing,
 or photographic telescope, both more accurately and easily as well,
 from previous book-record, rather than from renewed eye-and-hand
 observation on every occasion. This was carried out mainly and success-
 fully by supplying wheels ten inches in diameter, and nicely graduated
 on their circumferences, to either end of the ordinary axle of pinion-
 movement of the focussing tube, taking care also to turn the said pinion
 at the last moment in the direction of increasing the readings and noting
 what they were. This record method of focussing, too, it is believed, is
 one which will be found of very general application, and much used every
 coming year, now that photography is continually substituting more and
 more the observer's eye and hand, with almost all kinds of optical notation
 of luminous phenomena.

       (2) Improved magnifying means were next required for the viewing,
 and equally photographing, telescope. The chief feature necessary here
 was a large field with the increased magnifying power, and was given to
 a considerable extent by a grand Barlow-achromatic concave lens placed

 inside the usual telescope tube, by Messrs. T. Cooke & Sons, of York.

       For mere magnifying, however, wherever the part of the spectrum
  under examination permits it without other addition, I have since then fully

 made up my mind that the second order of Professor Rowland's later and

 nnprecedentedly fine Gratings from his new ruling engine, give sharper

  magnifying to the spectrum than any lens I have experimented with.
       But they give it in a different way, i.e. the second orders of Grating's

 --spectra do ; for they magnify only in one direction that of separation

  while a lens magnifies in a direction at right angles to that also. That

  feature is no doubt so much the worse for the lens, because it weakens
  the intensity of a continuous spectrum operated upon by it. But then

  there is another feature which is bad for the second, or any subsequently
  still more magnified, spectrum-order of a Grating, viz. that they admit

  the red light of a previous order in the middle of their own violet ; unless
  some possibly very absorptive liquid be employed to stop such red light

  where it is not wanted.

--76 REPORT 1892.

Kow Messrs. Cooke's Barlow concave lens wants no help of that kind,

for it was constructed to magnify the first order of spectrum only, and

that has no red light of any other order intruding into its own ultra-

violet, or requiring some chemical liquid to dull its potency. Hence I

have actually found that I have been able to carry Messrs. Cooke's lenti-

cular magnifying of the first order of a Grating's spectrum, four plates

further into the invisible, than I was able to do with the second order of

the very same Grating's spectra, assisted in various chromatic modes.

As an illustration of which I beg to append a list of spectrum photographs

so obtained last autumn.

    (3) Lastly, my attention was kindly and earnestly directed by

Professor Liveing to keep on the look-out for possible changes in some

part or parts of the solar spectrum, depending on time and date only,

especially if their origin should appear to be in the Sun.

    Now it did so happen one morning that one of the glass negatives of

H Kthe and region of the solar .spectrum did show a very strange and

myanomalous difference fi-om all the others, so different indeed that

first impression was to throw it away as irretrievably spoilt by some acci-

dent. But on considering what such an accident could be, or how it

could be reproduced if desired, I was still more confounded and non-

plussed. Having, moreover. Professor Liveing's letter still before me,

the most respectful course seemed to be, on second thoughts, to describe

publicly how the anomaly brought itself forward so far as I knew, and to

leave gentlemen with more experience than myself to form their own

opinions, either for or against its being anything important.

    Now the main point of the anomaly is, that the whole space between

H Kand is bright, while that outside them is dark, even very dark. To

understand which feature thoroughly and in the terms worked in by

Nature, it was necessary that there should be several plates employed, and

each of them should show, not only the whole space between those giant

lines or bands, but at least as much more on either side.

Moreover, as good definition does not continue to hold all along even

so small a plate of glass as a quarter size, but has to be set and reset

several times in its course, while the appearance of the lines alters almost

radically on account of the mere curvature of the field, I enclose in an

H Kalbum case in the first place thirteen ordinary photographs of the and

lines, taken at successive foci all across the field, and then three various

impressions from one and the same anomalous photograph. No. 14;

following that by Nos. 15 and 16, ordinary, but focussed to the right,

views                                   the  whole eighteen now exhibited being enlarged on paper to six
                                     :

times the size of the glasses, for convenience of examination. And I

should perhaps duly forewarn all and sundry that ' date ' plays no part

H K --in the arrangement of this bundle of repetitions of the and lines only

the continual progress from left to right of the place of sharpest definition.
ON PUOTOaRAPIIS OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.             77

Second Report of the Gommittee, consisting of Mr. Gr. J. Symons

     (Chairman), Professor R. Meldola, Mr. J. Hopkinson, and Mr.
    A. W. Clatden (Secretary), appointed to consider the applica-

     tion of Photography to the Elucidation of Meteorological

    Phenomena. (Drawn up by the Secretary.)

Tour Committee report tliat the work has been continued daring the past
year on the lines laid down in the Report for 1891.

     Considerable additions have been made to the number of observerp

from whom assistance may be expected, in spite of the removal of several

names from last year's list.
     The total number of photographs received up to July 23 was 361,

representing a variety of phenomena, but chiefly illustrating the results
obtainable in cloud photography by various methods. This number,

however, does not adequately represent the progress made, for many

other photographs have been promised, and will in all probability be
received in a few weeks.

     The adoption by the majority of the International Meteorological
Congress at Munich of the classification of clouds, proposed by Messrs.
Hildebrandson and Abercromby, suggested to your Committee that it
would be well for them to adopt it, at least provisionally. They cordially

agree with the action of the English delegates at the Congress in
opposing the acceptance of a system which is entirely empirical ; bul
since the great majority of foreign meteorologists have determined to
employ it, your Committee consider that they should adopt it provision-

ally. They think it will be well to follow the example set by other
countries until the further study of cloud-forms, and their relation to one
another, render it possible to make a more scientific code.

     Arrangements have therefore been made for the cataloguing of the

collections of meteorological photogi'aphs in the possession of the Royal
Meteorological Society, and of the Chairman of your Committee.

               Photographs of Lightning.

Very few new photographs have been sent in as yet, but from Mr.

J. H. Bateman two of great interest have been received. Following the

suggestions in the instructions issued last year, two cameras were em-

ployed, the first being stationary, and the second moved rapidly from

side to side. The plate exposed in the fixed camera shows four flashes,

Awhile the one which was moved shows six.  flash which is single or

the fixed plate is resolved into three on the moving plate, showing that

the flash did consist of a series of discharges along much the same path.

The absence of reduplication in the others points to the conclusion that

they were single. Two of these single flashes occupy exactly the same

relative positions on the two plates, showing that they must have been

simultaneous.

Your Committee regret that there should have been no opportunity of

carrj'iiig out any further experiments upon the phenomena presented by

lightning photographs. However, recent discoveries concerning high-

tension discharges ought to elucidate the subject. Thus it seems highly

probable that the hazy continuous luminosity shown by many photo-

graiihs may be due to the flame of burning nitrogen.  ^

Before leaving the subject of lightning, it may be pointed out that in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     .

--78 REPORT 1892.

 Mr. Bateman's photographs the narrow ribbon structure in each flash is
not more pronounced in the moving photograph than in the one which was

 stationary.

     The Royal Meteorological Society has received several new photo-
 graphs of lightning. They all show the narrow ribbon structure ; one

 shows reduplication of the images of some chimneys as well as the flash,
 while another shows a bright flash and several dark ones. Of this last

Mr. Robert Law, who took the negative at Melbourne, remarks that there

 were two flashes, the second reversing the image of the first.

                             Methods of Cloud Photography.

      The information at the disposal of your Committee does not, as yet,
seem sufficient to enable them to pronounce definitely in favour of any
one method as the best. They have made some progress in ascertaining
the methods adopted abroad, and also in experimental work at home.
The subject divides itself naturally into two sections, dealing respectively

--with cumulus or heavy clouds, and with cirrus or other light clouds.
      Cumulus. With all heavy clouds it is certain that admirable results
may be obtained with a little practice in adjusting the stop and length of
exposure. So far as the quality of the results obtainable is concerned,
there does not seem to be any manifest advantage in the use of a coloured

 screen, of a black mirror, of specially slow, or of orthochromatic plates.
Nevertheless, it is quite certain that results of a given excellence are

more easily obtained on a slow plate with a strong developer considerably

restrained. It is equally certain that the use of the coloured screen, or
of the black mirror, renders the process easier still.

     With correct exposure and careful development it should not be
necessary to resort to intensification of the image. If some such treat-
ment should be required, inexperienced observers should be warned that

in the use of mercurial salts it is well to keep the plate in constant

movement while in the mercury bath, in order to avoid undue granulation

--of the image.
     Cirrus. Those who have made a special study of the photography of

thin clouds appear to be agreed that in order to bring out all the details

of their structure some special device must be adopted.

     By extremely nice adjustment of the exposure and subsequent intensi-

fication of the image, very fair results can be sometimes obtained ; but the
process is difficult, and only practicable in experienced hands.

     Dr. Riggenbach, who first described the black mirror device, recom-
mends that exposure should be so arranged that the sky leaves practically
no impression on the plate, while the thin image of the cloud must be
intensified by means of Schlippe's salt (sulphantimoniate of soda)

     M. Angot, in a report presented to the Meteorological Society of
France, remarks that a black mirror is only advantageous when the
cloud is about 90° from the sun. In theory this is of course correct,
but the Secretary to your Committee has found that there is a manifest

practical advantage in its use for all parts of the sky, including even the

immediate neighbourhood of the sun itself. M. Angot then goes on to
say : ' The best results are obtained by coloured screens, yet the ordinary
screens are insufficient. The following formula, due to M. Leon Vidal,

gives every satisfaction. In a small glass trough with parallel faces

--there is placed a solution made with the proportions sulphate of copper

175 grams, bichromate of potash 17 grams, sulphuric acid 2 cubic
centimetres. These are dissolved in 100 to 500 cubic centimetres of
                                                                .

      ON PHOTOGBAPHS OF METEOROLOGICAL PHENOMENA.                                               79

water, according to the thickness of the trough and the results to be
obtained. The sulphate of copper arrests the red rays, and the bichro-
mate the blue and violet. The plates used were Luniere's orthochromatic,
and the exposure from '5 to "8 second.'

     Your Committee regret that they have not yet received any illustra-
tions of the results obtainable by the above means, but it is hoped that
an exhaustive trial of the method may be carried out in the course of the
coming year.

     The Secretary to your Committee has continued the comparative

trial of slow and ordinary plates with or without a black mirror. He
reports that ordinary plates and direct exposure may often give satis-

factory results when the background of sky is a clear deep blue. If,

however, it is at all hazy, the correct exposure becomes extremely diffi-

cult. With slow plates, however, such as Mawson & Swan's trans-

parency plates or photomechanical plates, it is fairly easy to obtain

results of considerable excellence.

With  the  black  mirror  ordinary plates  give  excellent  results                             but
                                                                                             ;

here again, unless the clouds are moving with unusual rapidity, or unless

the light is very bad, there is a great advantage in the use of slow plates.

i- It is, indeed, easy to obtain a fairly dense image of any cloud, however

luminous and however thin, by the combined use of mirror and slow

plate. Such means give abundant detail and full gradation of light and

shade, even when the sun is actually in the field of view. Exposure

--would vary from about '2 to about -8 second with an aperture

          The developer used in all these experiments is the familiar formula
      with pyrogallol and sulphite of soda considerably restrained.
* Special attention should be drawn to the admirable series of cloud
      studies presented to the Committee which were taken by Signor

rMannucci at the Vatican Observatory under the direction of the Rev.

      Padre Denza, S.J. These show what can be done by direct exposure,
      Signor Mannucci recommending a slow plate for the more difficult
     subjects. The pictures taken by the Secretary to your Committee in a
     similar manner show the value of the slow plate and black mirror.

                                          Miscellaneous Photographs.

          With regard to miscellaneous photographs of meteorological interest,
      your Committee regard with some satisfaction the number of pictures
      they have been able to secure which show the violence and severity with
      which the great blizzard of March 1891 visited the South-west of England.
      They believe it is of great importance that fairly complete pictorial records

      should be kept of all such abnormal events.
           They are also pleased to be able to report that several of the photo-

      graphic periodicals have recently manifested considerable interest in the
      work, one paper, the ' Practical Photographer,' having just offered a series
      of prizes for the best meteorological studies ; and the editor has promised to
      present any competing pictures to your Committee. Several photographic
      societies are also taking the matter up, and your Committee hope that the

     effect of such powerful aid may rapidly make itself felt, both by increasing
      their collection and by adding to the number of contributors.

           In order to show the widespread interest already taken in the subject,

       brief catalogues of the three principal collections are appended.
            In conclusion, your Committee ask to be re-appointed with a grant of

       15?., in order to follow up properly what they regard as a satisfactory start.

     Kelvin, Mr. K. Etheridge, Professor John Perry, Dr. Henry
     Woodward, Professor Thomas Gray, and Professor John Milne

     (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of investigating the

    Earthquake and Volcanic Phenomena of Japan. {Draivn up

The first of the above seismographs, constructed in 1883, partly at

the expense of the British Association, still continues to be used as the

standard instrument at the Central Observatory in Tokio. I am indebted

to Mr. K. Kobayashi, the Director of the Observatory, for the following

table of its records :

total number of earthquakes in the year were severe, 42 per cent, mocie-
rate, and 49 per cent, feeble.

                                       Notes on Special Earthqual-es.

     1. On February 5, at 1 a.m., an earthquake was felt over nearly the

 whole of North Japan, extending from Tezo in the north to Tokio in the
south. The area shaken was 9,670 square ri. This is the first time since
1884, Avhen extended observations were commenced, that so large an area
 was disturbed. Whatever damage occurred was slight.

     2. On April 11, at 3 a.m., an area of 2,190 square ri was shaken in

Central Japan. The provinces of Tango and Tanba were most seriously

 affected.

     3. On April 29, at 10 a.m., North Japan was disturbed by a shock

extending over 1,930 square ri. In Nasu-gori river banks gave way, at
Utsonomiya walls were cracked, and to the south, in Tokio and other
 places, clocks were stopped and articles overturned. The motion was
 generally horizontal.

     4. On July 15, at 7.30 a.m., an elliptical area of 600 square ri near

 Lake Inawashiro was suddenly shaken. This was followed by a second
 shaking, and whilst this continued Bandaisan, which overlooks the lake,
 exploded, and in a few minutes buried nearly 28 square miles of country
 beneath a sea of earth and boulders 30 to 100 feet in depth.

      Whether the preliminary shakings were unsuccessful efforts of the
 steam beneath Bandaisan to obtain a vent, or whether they were shakings
due to faulting or other causes, which destroyed the equilibrium between
 internal forces and the rocky cover which restrained them, is a matter
 for speculation. It may here be mentioned that one result of the Ban-
 daisan explosion has been to form a lake which is 83 miles long and from

 1 to 3 miles in breadth.

     A list of the earthquakes felt in Tokio in 1888 has been published in

 a previous Report. Between January and December 101 disturbances

 were recorded.

                                1. Earthqual-e Frequency per Month.

      During the year 1888 the number of earthquakes in each month was

  as follows :

    Of the 101 earthquakes which took place in Tokio in the year 1888,
the following are the most notable :

    From the preceding table we see that the average frequency per
season was 232'5, and also that the maximum frequency was in summer,
and the minimum in winter.

    If we call the six months from April to October the hot season, and

--those from October to April the cold season, we have :

the terrible catastrophe which occurred last year (1891), suffering the

most.

     In the neighbourhood of Gifa people were thrown into a state of
alarm. The banks of the Nagara River were rent for some distance.

There was much damage to porcelain, wine-bottles, &c. Pendulum-

clocks, especially those facing towards the south or north, were stopped.

According to the observations of the Gifa Observatory, the duration of

the earthquake was about 2 minutes 30 seconds. The movement, which vas

very slight at first, was followed three minutes after by a violent shaking,

and at the fifth second the range of motion to the north and south was

4 bu 4 rin (about -^ in.). But, from the moment at which the east and

west motion came into play, the intensity was so much increased that the

two leaden cylinders of the seismometer, together with the index, were

overthrown, which put an end to the observations. The maximum range,

however, seems to have been about 21 mm.

AS. July 28, at 11.40 p.m.  short description of this earthquake, by

which 20 persons were killed, 74 wounded, and many buildings destro_5ed,

is given in the tenth Report (1890). For a full account see the paper

by Messrs. Sekiya and Kikuchi forming vol. xiii.. Part II., of the ' Trans-

actions of the Seismological Society,' also vol. xvi. of the same publication.
     4. December 31, 1 p.m. This earthquake extended from Yezo in the

north to beyond Tokio in the south, shaking 9,210 square ri of country.
It seems to have originated in the bed of the Pacific.

           Earthquakes Olserved at the Central Observatory in Tokio.

     Between January and December, in Tokio, 113 shocks were recorded,
a list of which has appeared in pi'evious Reports.

disturbance which gaA^e them birth. If this is not done, then a large

disturbance which took place, for example, near the end of the winter

months may have the long series of shocks which follow, and which indi-

cate that the conditions which lead to earthquakes are being destroyed,

added in with the summer disturbances, and the rule that earthquakes

Anare more frequent in winter is obliterated.  effect of this description

is shown in the tables for 1889, which might have been drawn up omit-

ting 281 secondary disturbances which occurred in Hiogo. In connection

with these analyses it would .=!eem desirable that earthquakes should be

grouped according to their origins, and, in addition to what is done at

present, separate analyses be made for each group. Some of the earth-

quakes which occur in the north of Japan do not appear to have any

more connection with those which occur in the south of Japan than the

earthquakes of Great Britain have with the earthquakes of Switzerland.

The earthquakes from all these regions may conform with the law of

winter frequency, but it is also desirable to know the relationship between
earthquakes of a given group. Do the earthquakes which originate

beneath the ocean follow the same laws as those which originate in our

mountains ? Is the occurrence of earthquakes at one particular origin

more in accordance with some rule than the occurrence of similar dis-

turbances at some other focus ? With the aid of the four or five thousand

maps showing the area shaken by every earthquake since 1885 such

questions might be answered, but time and means for their analysis are

thus far wanting.

On a New Method which may be Employed foe Investigating Earth

                                   Tremors or Earth Tips.

In Reports to this Association in 1887 and 1888 I gave an epitome

of the work which had been accomplished in investigating small earth

movements called earth tremors. The more important results were,

that tremors were most frequent with a low barometer, and they were

especially noticeable if there was a steep barometric gradient. They

often occuri'ed when it was absolutely calm in Tokio, and often heralded

the approach of a wind from the south-west. The instrument employed

was automatic in its action, the records being made at intervals of five

minutes. Being, like all other tromometers, of the ordinary pendulum

type, it only indicated when tremors were strong and the time of their

occurrence. The instruments which I have been using for the last few

months give perfectly continuous records of earth tremors, measure them

as to amount and direction, and throw considei-able light upon the nature

of these movements. From the character of the records it is also seen

whether the column on which ihe instruments are placed remains

horizontal or suffers tilting. Anyone possessing a small metal stand

which has three levelling screws and a metal upright can, with a silk

fibre, a small sewing-needle, a small shot, and a glass fibre, construct one

of these instruments. In the sketch, a h represents the needle, with the

shot fixed at a, and a c the fibre, which is secured at a and c by shellac.

The glass fibre is joined to 6 a as a continuation of its length. This acts

as a pointer, and moves above a mirror, on which there is a finelj'- divided

scale. The fibre may be replaced by a rigid wire, when it must be properly

Apivoted. Agate cups at b and c give greater sensibility.  complete-

arran^-ement requires two such pieces of apparatus, which may be placed
to work on the same scale as shown in the plan.

     Everything must be well sheltered from currents of air. For a
continuous record the glass pointer is replaced by a small galvanometer
mirror, which reflects a ray of light through a slit into a box, where it is

                                                       photographed upon a moving plate.

                                                               posed to give are as follow :

                                                       1. By unequal expansion of dif-

                                                               struments the pointer or ray of light

might be displaced. As at least four of these instruments, which are
differently constructed, some with wire suspensions, and others with
fibre suspensions, only vary in amount of displacement, and seldom, if
ever, in direction, whilst the temperature is changing, it v.'ould seem that

temperature effects are too small to be observed. Lighting a stove in
the room and raising the temperature quickly does not appear to pro-

duce any effect. Good spirit-levels are subject to great changes by
changes in temperature, and therefore it is diificult to use them as
recorders of changes in level. I have had a pair of such levels under

glass cases, standing on excellent stone columns, for several years, but

the results were too unsatisfactory for publication. When they were

side by side and parallel the bubble of one might move to the right, and

 the other to the left.

      2. In consequence of hygroscopic changes the instruments carried by

a silk fibre may possibly be affected. I have not observed such changes,
but Mr. F. Omori, who is repeating my work, tells me that they are

 evident. I cannot imagine them to exist in the instruments which have
 wire suspension, and by the use of quartz fibres which Mr. F. Boys,

 F.R.S., has sent me, this possible source of error may be eliminated

 where fibres are employed.
      3. Because the horizontal member of the conical pendulum has in

 several cases been a fine steel needle, magnetic effects may be introduced.
 If these are measurable, they must be extremely small. With a
 8-foot ray of light during a tremor storm, the image may be continuously
 moving through a range of from 1 to 2 inches. This is too large to be

 magnetic. If a record for twenty-four hours is repi'esented by a straight
 line 12 inches in length, I find that this from time to time is gradually
              --

deflected from ^ to |- inch from its true path, and the line, which is often
straight, has one or two bow-like bends, suggesting that the column on
which the instruments rest has been gradually lifted or warped for a
period of, say, five or six hours, and then for the next four or five hours
been gradually lowered or gradually returning to its original form.
Occasionally this lifting process only takes from fifteen to thirty minutes.
The character of the record is hardly that which would be expected as a
result of magnetic influences.

                           Obseevatioks.

All my observations have hitherto been made upon a table-like stone

column which forms the foundation of a column built some fifteen years

ao-o to carry an equatorial telescope. It is 4 feet square, made of

carefully squared blocks of stone measuring 4'x2'xl' 3", and rises

3' 6" above the floor of one of the rooms in my house which for many

years was the Astronomical Observatory of the Imperial University.

Unless the shutters of a window are closed for three or four hours the
Amidday situ strikes the south face of the column.
                                                                                                              fibre instrument

photographically recording N. and S. motion stands near the N.B.

corner of the column. On the N.W. corner a second fibre instrument

shows B. and W. motion as a spot of light on a scale. Between these

two a pair of wire instruments records N.S. and E.W. motions, and a

second set of instruments records similar motions on the south side of the

column. In between them, from time to time, similar instrunaents have

been used in varying positions.

     In regular use there were, therefore, three instruments recording N.

and S. motion, and three which recorded E. and W. motion. Observa-
tions were commenced on December 18, 1891, and with but few interrup-
tions they are being continued. A few of the more important results are

as follows :

                                   Ti-emors.

1. On many occasions a stiff" gale has been blowing, and although we

should expect tremors if they were a direct eff'ect of the wind, all the

instruments have been still : as, for example, on January 15, with W. and

S.W. wind;    January  18, with    N.W. wind                                                        February  8, with  S. wind

February 24, everything remarkably steady, with N.W. wind; February 27,

strong N.  wind and  very  slight  tremors                                       March              1,  N.W.  wind  ;  March  27,
                                                                              ;

W. wind.

On each of the above days the wind was unusually strong. The

I'evolving roof above the column and the shutters rattled, whilst each

gust of wind caused my bouse, which is of wood, to shake. When this

latter happened, by carefully watching the pointers of an instrument

through a magnifying glass, they were seen to tremble, and each

trembling, which was momentary, corresponded with the impulses of the

wind upon the outside of the building. There was no swing produced in

the pointers, but only a temporary vibration along their length. The

movements consequent on ' earth tremors ' are distinct and continuous

angular displacements, and not the vibration of pointers.

2. Tremors often occur when the wind is high. They also occur

when it is modei-ate, and when it is absolutely calm. The relationship of
                                                                                                                      --

--110 REPORT 1892.

such tremors to winds at a distance, and to barometrical gradients, have

been discussed in previous Reports. Sometimes the tremors are only

shown on the instruments recording N. and S. motion, sometimes only on

those which record E. and W. motion, and sometimes they are marked

on all the instruments.

     8. One of the most important results obtained from the new method

of observation is that the so-called earth tremors do not appear to be

movements resulting from a general vibration in the soil, such as might,

for example, be caused by the falling of heavy weights. With a tremo-

meter of the ordinary pendulum type a simple swinging, corresponding

to the  period  of  the  pendulum, is  only seen                                              and  although  it  has  been
                                                                                           ;

observed that the swing is not always uniformly to the right and left of

the same point, this swinging might still represent a cumulative effect of

minute vibrations. With the conical pendulum arrangement, the inertia

of which is extremely small, although they sometimes appear to be

moving with their natui-al period, it is oftener that their vibrations

appear to be forced. By watching the spot of light as it fitfully swings

from side to side, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly, during a

tremor storm, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the movements

are produced by the tilting of the column. For example, on the night of

February 14, when the barometer was low (29'6) and but little wind, all
the E. and W. instruments were moving, while the N. and S. were still.

The E. and W. light from time to time swung between 32 and 39 (i divi-

sion =2"5 mm.), and it seemed as if at irregular intervals, which did

not correspond with gusts of wind, that the east side of the column had

been lifted. On February 16, in the afternoon, whilst a strong N.W.

wind was blowing for some time, the E.W. spot of light rested at 30,

then it would move to 34, but return to 30. Five minutes later it stood

at 35, but now and then it would move quickly to 40, and return to 30.

It did not swing evenly on either side of any point. Similar observations

have been made on other days. With the N. and S. recorder these

effects, which are apparently due to tilting, have only been observed

once or twice, and they were not well pronounced. It is probable that

these movements may be due to the same causes, which at the time of

very heavy winds I have seen to cause the bubble of a delicate level to

pulsate. One result of these observations is that, for the present, at least,

I can no longer regard earth tremors as movements which correspond in

character to vibrations like those which may be produced by a steam-

-- --hammer or a railway train on which I have often experimented bat

rather that they ai'e wave-like pulsations, irregular in period, and

producing changes in level.

They may possibly be the result of sudden variations in barometric

pressure over large areas.

4. During a tremor storm, which sometimes lasts for twenty-four

hours, the range of motion is very variable, the intervals between periods

of maximum movement being sometimes ten or fifteen minutes. If these

motions are due to tilting, this means that the slopes of the wave-like

pulsations are not equally steep.

     5. The photographic records, which refer to N. and S. motions

--whether there are tremors or whether tremors do not exist by the

deviation of the spot of light, sometimes to the right or sometimes to the

left, give evidence of angular motion of the mirror, which may be ex-

plained on the assumption of tilting of the ground, warping of the column

or portions of the instrument by change of temperature, a variation in
the condition of the fibre by change in moisture, or as an effect due to

magnetic influences. Sometimes it appears that the southern side of the
column had risen or sunk within a period of fifteen minutes. At other

times the movement takes several hours. Usually it takes about as long-
to sink as it did to rise ; but this is by no means invariable, the upward
motion being sometimes accomplished in a few minutes, whilst the
lowering extends over several hours. The following are examples of

these movements, which for convenience are described as an actual lifting

or sinking of the south side of the column.

   --February 9. Daring the day the south side rose shghtly, and sank

again towards night.

  --February 10. About 4.30 A.M. the south sunk suddenly 2 mm., but in

one hour returned to its normal position.

  --February 11. Between the morning and the afternoon the south side

rose slowly.

  --February 12. No movement observable.
   --February 13. Steady rise of the south side, commencing in the morn-

ing, and continuing until 8 p.m. and on to midnight.

  --February 14. Fi-om midnight of the 13th the south sank, the greatest

fall taking place during the afternoon. This sinking continued steadily

--to the 15th. On the 16th this sinking was irregular.
     February 17. ^Between 3.30 and 4.30 a.m. the spot of light moved

2 mm. to the right and back to the left, indicating a rising and then a

Asinking of the south side.  similar movement, but of from 4 to 5 mm.,

took place in fifteen minutes, commencing at 9.30 p.m.

  --February 18. The south rose slightly during the day, and sank to-

wards night. About midday there was a deflection like the two which

took place on the 17th.

   --February 19. During three hours the south sank, and then rose in

three hours, the range of motion being about 6 mm. During the night

the south ag^in sank, and rose within a period of about three hours.

  --February 21. Early in the morning the south slightly sank, and this

continued until the afternoon, when within an interval of ten minutes it

quickly rose. There was a sudden but slight sinkage at midnight.

  --February 24. During the whole day, and also at night, the south was

slightly sinking.

  --Febriiary 25. During the day the south was rising.
   --February 26. From 4 to 7 a.m. the south sank, after which it rose to

9 A.M. In the afternoon it again sank ; &c.

     The deflections referred to as measured on the photographic record

are usually about 2 mm. ; it is not unfrequent that they reach 5 or 6 mm.,
and once they were as much as 15 mm.

    When the mirror has a period of four or five seconds, and it is 29 inches

from the photographic plate, a deflection of 1 mm. might be due to a

tilting represented by '25 inch per mile. The sensitiveness of the
apparatus may be changed by altering the period of the mirror. The

approximation given may also be used in giving angular values for the

tremors which have been observed.
     The fact that the south side of the column appears to rise when the

sun is on the south side of the house would indicate that the tilting was
due to temperature, but as the same movements also take place during
the night, and at irregular intervals, it cannot be an immediate effect of

sun-heat. Closing the shutters and blinds of the one window in the
room does not alter the angular displacements. The N. and S. pointer
of a glass fibre instrument standing on the S.E. corner of the column may-
be altered by lighting a small stove which stands within 3 feet of the
column, and raising the temperature of the room 20° to 30° Fahr. In a
few hours this corner of the column becomes quite warm to the hand,
and the pointer shows that the southern side has been warped or tilted
upwards. Although the fire may burn all day, I do not observe any

change in the other instruments, and it is therefore difficult to imagine

that the deflections which have been noted are the immediate result of a

chano-e in the temperature or hygrometric state of the atmosphere in the

room where the column is situated. The character of the movements
is hardly such as might be expected from changes in declination. At

the Magnetical Observatory, about two miles distant from my house,

whatever changes have been recorded do not coincide either in character

or in time with the movements under discussion.

     The conclusion arrived at is, that from time to time there is evidence

that the column in my house is tilted sometimes quickly, but more gene-

rally slowly. The cause of this tilting is not inside the house, but outside.

It may be local, and due to variation in the temperature or the moisture

in the ground.

To determine whether the tilting extends over a considerable area a

second photographic recorder is being erected in a seismological labora-

tory about 400 yards distant from my private observatory.

    6. On January 28, at about 11.20 p.m., a small earthquake took place,

after which it was observed that the N. S. pointers of all the instruments

had been displaced in the same direction. It appeared as if the south

side of the column had been slightly tilted. East and west pointers

were not disturbed. Subsequent earthquakes in February did not pro-

duce any change.

Earthquakes are recorded as streaks of light across the plate, and as

the instruments are so sensitive, they are capable of recording disturb-

ances which ordinary instruments fail to indicate.

    In making these investigations I am now receiving valuable assistance

from Mr. F. Townley, in Yokohama, and Mr. James Murdoch, in Omori,

Myeach of whom is provided with tromometers.  colleague. Professor

W. K. Burton, has given me most valuable assistance in carrying out the

photographic part of my work.

                               Earth Tremoes and Firedamp.

     In 1884 I repoi'ted to this Association that in the previous year I had
established a tromometer and other instruments underground in the
Takashima Colliery, near Nagasaki. Shortlj' after they were put up a
fall of the roof cut off access to the chamber where they were placed, and
ever since they have remained buried beneath the bed of the Pacific

Ocean. As Mr. John Stoddart, who took charge of the instrument, has

died, and Nagasaki is so far distant, I have not been able to re-establish
these observations, one of which was to determine whether the giving off

of firedamp was in any way connected with earth tremors.

      In the ' Proceedings of the Nox'thern Institute of Mechanical and

Mining Engineers,' Mr. Walton Brown drav^s attention to the possible
ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND TOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 113

connection between earth shakes, tremors, and the issue of firedamp, and
refers to the work attempted at Takashima.

     Some years later the British Association appointed a committee to in-

vestigate their possible re]ationships, and I believe that seismographs and
delicate seismoscopes were set up in the Newcastle district. At the time I
pointed out that such instruments could only record earthquakes, and it

was unreasonable to suppose that there could be any connection between
earthquakes and the ordinary outpourings of firedamp. The instru-
ments required were tromometers, rather than seismometers and seismo-
scopes, and in this Report I have defined the nature of the phenomena
to be looked for, which are more like wave-pulsations than tremors.

The instrument by which these may be investigated is the light form of
conical pendulum already described. The records are not the same as

those obtained from the swinging of a pendulum tromometer. We know

that a curve showing the microseismic activity in Italy closely follows a
curve showing the colliery explosions between 1860 and 1881 which have

occurred in Germany. Unfortunately, we do not know anything about
microseismic activity in Germany. From tromometric observations
made at the ^Ecole de Douai, by M. Chesneau, during February and ]\Iarch
1886, and from observations on the escape of gas estimated by a Pieler
lamp at the Herin Mine (Compagnie d'Anzin), we learn that certain
relationships between these two phenomena were established (.see ' De

     Earth pulsations, like escapes of firedamp, usually take place when

the barometer is low ; but a more general rule for the occurrence of the
former phenomena is, that they are observable whenever the district of
observation is crossed by a steep barometric gradient. It would be of

interest and of value to determine whether the escape of firedamp follows

a similar rule, and, for the welfare of our mines and miners, tromometric
observations oug-ht to be inaugurated in the neighbourhood of some of
the more fiery of our mines. The movements to be sought for are not
minute earthquakes, tremors, or vibrations, but pulsatory movements

which may be compared to the swell upon an ocean.

          On the Overturning and Fracturing of Columns.

In the Report for 1891 a short account of the results of experiments

on the overturning and fracturing of columns was given. Partly in

consequence of the terrible disaster on October the 28th of that year,

when thousands of structures of all descriptions were overturned,

shattered, or utterly ruined, these experiments are being extended.

With regard to overturning we can now state with considerable

accuracy the acceleration necessary to overturn a column-like structure

of given dimensions. One set of experiments, in which Mr. F. Omori

has continued to assist me, shows most clearly that a group of similar

columns, whether they are large or small, heavy or light, so long as they

have tlie same ratio of height to breadth, with horizontally applied motion

will fall simultaneously. Further than this, the acceleration which was

recorded as having caused them to overturn is practically identical with

that which may be calculated from their dimensions. The ratios of

breadth to height varied from 1 : 2^ up to 1 : 9, and in each group there

were at least six columns. These ratios are identical with the dimensional

ratios of gravestones and other bodies overturned by the last earthquake.

The actual sizes of the columns experimented on were not small ; for

example, one column, where the ratio of breadth to height is 1 : 2^, was
9^ in. square and 25| in. high. One result of this work is that we can
now go from place to place through the shaken district, and state with

considerable accuracy the accelerations that were experienced. As we

have one or two diagrams from the shaken area, we know, at least

approximately, the period of the motion, and we can therefore calculate

the amplitude and maximum velocity of motion which was experienced.

Such calculations are now being made by Mr. F. Omori.

From the formula given in the last Report, which showed a relation-

ship between the dimensions, weight, and strength of a structure, and the

acceleration which would shatter the same, we are now able to calculate

accelerations from shattering phenomena. The greatest difficulty which

had to be overcome in making these investigations was the collecting

and subsequently determining the strength of portions of masonry

structures which had been ruined. Altogether, 26 cases of brickwork

have been obtained from the earthquake district, and the testing of their

contents has been completed. Reference is made to the results of the

calculations based on these experiments under the section relating to the

Great Earthquake.

The only new development of the fracturing formula has been to

determine the form of a wall or pier which, rather than snapping at its

--base as was the case with many structures at the time of the last earth-

quake, and also with all the columns subjected to back and forth motion

--on the earthquake track would be as likely to break at any one

horizontal section as at any other. The effect of the last earthquake was

to cause brick piers of railway bridges to snap at their bases, and it

would therefore seem that the basal section required greater strength.

This might possibly be obtained by increasing the basal dimensions at

the expense of a portion of the brickwork in their upper parts, which, so

far as offering resistance to effects resulting from their own inertia, were

apparently more than sufficiently strong. As a result both of reasoning

and observation, it is evident that in earthquake countries, piers, walls,

chimneys, and the like should have vertical sections different from

Athose which they receive in ordinary practice.  full account of these

experiments will be published in a ' Journal of Seismology ' which is

shortly to be issued.

                  The Gkeat Eakthquake op October 28, 1891.

     If we may judge from the contortions produced along lines of railway,

the Assuring of the ground, the destruction of hundreds of miles of huge
embankments which guard the plains from river-floods, the utter ruin
of structures of all descriptions, the sliding down of mountain sides and
the toppling over of their peaks, the compression of valleys, and other

bewildering phenomena, we may confidently say that last year, on the

morning of October 28, Central Japan received as terrible a shaking aa
has ever been recorded in the history of seismology. It is a subject
ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 115

that might be written about at interminable length, and therefore in this

short Report no attempt is made to give detailed descriptions of all that

happened.

    Mr. F. Omori, who works with me in the Seismological Laboratory,

has spent several weeks in the shaken district, and ever since has been

busily engaged in analysing the materials he collected. Professor

Tanakadate, with a staff of assistants, devoted himself to observations

relating to the velocity of propagation of earth-waves, the curious sound

phenomena, and, lastly, to a redetermination of magnetic elements in the

devastated district. Dr. B. Koto has studied the phenomena from a

geological standpoint.

Under the title of ' The Great Earthquake in Japan,' in conjunction

with Professor W. K. Burton, I have published a general account of the

more striking phenomena which were observed, illustrating the same by

a series of photographs. The questions to which greatest attention has

been given are those of importance to engineers and builders, but

inquiries and investigations have been made relating to everything

Awhich was thought to be of interest.  few days after the disaster, at

the request of Professor D. Kikuchi, I drew up a circular containing

some fifty queries. Ten thousand of these documents were issued, and
now, here and at the Central Observatory, we are surrounded by boxes

filled with newsjDaper cuttings and replies. Five per cent, of the whole

may be of value, but yet it has all to be patiently examined. In addition
to this material, there is that of our own collecting, which, in addition to

what has already been mentioned, includes some hundreds of diagrams

taken by seismographs of what seemed to be at one time an unending-

series of shocks which followed the great disaster. This chaotic mass of

material is gradually being sifted, and assuming a form suitable for

systematic investigation. Although many of the results may be marked

by the magnitude of the phenomena they represent rather than by

their novelty, we have already gone sufficiently far to see that certain

observations can hardly fail in widening the circle of our present

knowledge.

     The first notice that I received of the earthquake was at 6h. 39m. lis.

on the morning of October 28, whilst I was in bed. From the manner in

which the house was creaking and the pictures swinging and flapping on

Mythe wall I knew the motion was large.  first thoughts were to see

the seismographs at work ; so I went to the earthquake-room, where to

steady myself I leaned against the side of the stone table, and for about
two minutes watched the movements of the instruments. It was clear

that the heavy masses suspended as horizontal pendulums were not

behaving as steady points, but that they were being tilted, first to the

right, and then to the left. Horizontal displacements of the ground were

not being recorded, but angles of tilting were being measured. That

whenever vertical motion is recorded there must be tilting, and therefore

no form of horizontal pendulum is likely to record horizontal motion, is

a view I have often expressed. What I then saw convinced me that

such views were correct. Next I ran to a water-tank which is 80 feet

long, 28 feet wide, and 25 feet deep. Its sides are practically vertical.
At the time it was holding about 17 feet of water, which was running

across its breadth, rising first on one side and then on the other to a

height of about 2 feet. It splashed to a height of 4 feet. It seemed

clear that the tank was being tilted, first on one side, and then on the

                                         I2

other. Whilst this was going on trees were swinging about, telegraph-

wires were clattering together, the brickwork of the tank was cracked,

and the college workshop, a few yards away, was so far shattered that it

has had to be partially rebuilt. The effect of the motion upon niyself

was to make me feel giddy and slightly sea-sick. The chimney of a

paper-mill in Tokio fell, and also a chimney at the electric-light works in

Yokohama.

    The constructor of the latter chimney derived some satisfaction from

the fact that it fell as a heap of loose brick round its base, for had it

been made of better materials, it might have toppled over in large

masses, and destroyed neighbouring buildings. Many sti-uctures were

slightly fractured. During the day twenty-one other shocks were re-

coi'ded, but nearly all of them were so slight that they failed to give a

diagram sufficiently large for analysis. From the slow and easy, swing-

ing nature of the motion, it was known that the shock was not of local

origin, but that it had originated at a distance. As disturbjinees of this

character had often reached ns from an area beneath the Pacific Ocean

about 400 miles to the north-east, it was from the northern parts that

we expected to receive further information. The surmise that the origin

was at a distance proved correct, but instead of being beneath the ocean

to the north-east, it was beneath the land in an exactly contrary direction.

The first news was that in Kobe, which is about 400 miles towards the

south, many chimneys had fallen, earthquake shocks continued, and all

were in alarm ; whilst at Osaka, which is 356 miles from Tokio, a cotton-

mill had collapsed and many people had lost their lives. Little by little

news of destruction arrived from many towns, and as it came it grew

more terrible. The scene of greatest disaster was the Nagoya-Gifu Plain,

which lies about 140 miles W.S.W. of Tokio, and 80 miles N.E. of Kobo.

In this district destruction had been total. Cities and villages had been

shaken down, the ruins were burning, bridges had fallen, river embank-

ments had been destroyed, the ground was fissured in all directions, and

mountain sides had slipped down to dam the valleys. More accurate

estimates of certain damages are now before us. The killed numbered

9,960, the wounded 19,994, and the houses which were totally destroyed

were 128,750. In addition to these there were many temples, factories,

and other buildings. In an area of 4,176 square miles, which embraces

one of the most fertile plains of Japan, and where there is a population

of perhaps 1,000 to the square mile, all the buildings which had not

been reduced to a heap of rubbish had been badly shattered. To rebuild

the railway, reconstruct bridges, roads, and embankments, and to relieve

immediate distress, about one and three-quarter million pounds sterling

have been poured into the district, the greater portion of which came

from the Imperial treasury. This sum, however, only measures a

fraction of the total destruction. One hundred thousand houses have yet

to  be  rebuilt,  irrigation  works  have  to  be  repaired                                         a value  has to be

--months interruption of traffic and of industries, and nearly 10,000

people have lost their lives all of which ai-e factors which cannot be

overlooked when measuring the effect of an earthquake by the sum it
takes to replace the damage it has occasioned.

    The immediate cause of this great disturbance was apparently the

formation of a fault which, according to Dr. B. Koto, can be traced on
ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OV JAPAN. 117

the surface of the earth for a distance of between forty and fifty miles.
In the Neo Valley, where it runs nearly N. and S., it looks like one side
of a railway embankment about 20 or 30 feet in height. The fields at

the bottom of this ridge were formerly level with the fields now at the

top of it. In Mino, where it strikes towards the east, it is represented
by subsidences and mound-like ridges, suggesting the idea that they
might have been produced by the burrowing of a gigantic mole.

Although there is only 20 feet of displacement on the surface, from what
we know of surface disturbances resulting from the caving in of sub-

terranean excavations, the maximum throw of this fault is in all prob-
ability veiy much greater than that which is accessible for measurement.

Not only have the rice-fields been lowered, but, according to the

peasants, the mountain peaks on the western side of the valley have

decreased in height.

     Not only is there evidence of subsidence along this line, but there are
many evidences of horizontal displacements. Lines of roads have been

broken, and one part of them thrown to the right or left of their original

direction                                           whilst  fields  which  were rectangular have been cut  in  two, and

one-half relative to the other half been shifted as much as 18 feet up or
down the valley. One result of this is that landowners find there has

Abeen a partial alteration in the position of their neighbours.                                                more

serious change has been the permanent compression of ground, plots

which were 48 feet in length now measuring only 30 feet in length. It

Aappears as if the whole Neo Valley had become narrower. similar efiecfc

is noticeable in the river-beds, where the piers of bridges are left closer

together than they were at the time of their construction.

     Since the big shock about 3,000 minor shakings have been recorded.
At Gifu and Nagoya, where most of these were felt, their distribution with

regard to time was as follows, the numbers representing the number of

shocks which were recorded during successive intervals of ten days :

the line of the great fault, and again in a district to the west of Nagoyal,
about 25 miles farther south, in the middle of the Owaii Plain. This

second area of great disturbance may indicate the proximity of a second
line of fracture not visible on the surface, or it may be an area where

waves from various sides of the plane coalesced.
     With the first of these shakings great landslips took place, and moun-

tains which were green with forest now look as if they had been painted
yellowish white. The valleys in these districts have been filled with
debris, and behind one of the dams which has been formed there is now

a lake six miles in circumference. In one district on the eastern side of

the plain we are told that mountain peaks fell in and depressions were
formed. Depressions also occurred in some of the valleys, and the houses
of farmers suddenly sank up to their eaves, burying their inmates in a
sea of earth and mud beneath the floor on which they once lived.

     In the plains, river embankments which on the top are from 20 to 30

feet in width, and have slopes of 3 to 1 and 2 to 1, were very much

cracked and fissured. Usually these cracks were 2 or 3 feet in width, but
in places they had so far united that openings 10 or 15 feet wide and
about the same in depth had been formed. In all cases the fissures were
parallel to the river bank, and it was in villages near these banks where
destruction had been most complete. It might be expected that these
fissures would occur at distances of half wave-lengths from the river bank,
and at similar distances from each other, but no such rule was observable.
The general appearance of the ground was as if gigantic ploughs, each

cutting a trench from 3 to 12 feet deep, had been dragged up and down

the river banks.

      Fissures, out of which sand and water had been poured, sometimes to
form small craters, were also to be seen on the open plains. These fissures,

which seldom exceeded a foot in width, and which may have been formed
by the compression of watery strata beneath, may possibly give an ap-
proximate measure of maximum horizontal displacement, the direction of

motion being at right angles to the direction of the fissure.

     Along the railway-line many curious appearances were presented. It
was almost everywhere more or less disturbed, the exceptions being

where it passed through small cuttings. Along these cuttings, although
they might not be more than 20 or 50 feet in depth, the rails and sleepers

were unmoved ; from which it may be inferred that the movement on the
free surface of the plain had been much greater than the movement at a

comparatively shallow depth. Measurements of the motion experienced
on the surface and that recorded in pits 10 to 20 feet in depth have
already been given in former reports. The results of these experiments
have been practically applied to several buildings in Tokio, by giving
them basements and a free area. The Imperial College of Engineering
is such a building. It does not show the slightest trace of damage after
the last earthquake, whilst at a distance of 20 yards the workshop, which
is also a strong brick building, but rising from the surface, as already
stated, has had to be rebuilt. This is the third time the Engineering
College has escaped damage, whilst neighbouring brick buildings have
been cracked in almost every room.

     Where the line was on the open plain, and only separated from it by a
narrow ditch on either side, it appeared as if the ground had moved back

and forth beneath the track until the gravel ballast had been piled up into
bolster-like ridges between the sleepers. This indicated a longitudinal
         ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 119

motion, but in many places it was noticeable that the sleepers, relatively

to the ground, had been moved endways. Neither of these movements

greatly exceeded 6 inches. Wherever the line crossed a small depres-

sion in the general level of the plain, even if it did not exceed 2 or 3 feet,

at such places the whole of the track was bent from its straight course

into a bow-like form, suggesting the idea that along these depressions,

which are probably filled with softer material than that composing the

plain, a greater quantity of motion had been transmitted, which, striking

the line like a flood, had caused a permanent deflection. The more reason-

able explanation is that these lines of soft material, like the valleys and
river-beds, had been permanently compressed, and the amount of com-
pression was measured by the amount of bending. Effects of compression
were most marked on some of the embankments, which gradually raise

the line to the level of the bridges. On some of these the track was bent

in and out until it resembled a serpent wriggling up a slope. Not only
were there these horizontal foldings, but by subsidence or compression
there were vertical folds, which in places gave the line the appearance of
a switchback. Close to the bridges the embankments had generally
disappeared, and the rails and sleepers were hanging in the air like huo-e

catenaries.

     At the bridges, one of which, over the Kisogawa, and made up of

200-feet spans, is 1,800 feet in length, the destruction was various. In
neai'ly all cases wing walls had given way. At one brick bridge the abut-
ments had been forced backwards, and the arch had fallen bodily between
them down upon the roadway, where it lay in two big segments, looking
like a gigantic toggle-joint. At the Nagara Bridge the piers, each of
which consisted of five large iron columns filled with concrete and braced
together, had in several instances not simply been broken at their bases
but they were snapped in pieces and thrown out upon the shingle beach
of the river, where they lay like bits of broken carrot. The bridge
was thrown 19 feet out of a straight line, and one of the foundations
near the centre of the river moved 5 feet 2 inches up-stream. Where the

greatest deflections occurred the foundations could not be positively
recognised.

    Mr. 0. A. W. Pownall, who constructed these bridges, and who o-ave
me the above measurements, estimates the deflection on the line where it

approaches the bridges at 1 foot 6 inches in a distance of 90 feet. The dis-
tance through which the foundations of the Kiso Bridge have permanently

--approached each other is 2 feet in a span of 200 feet that is to say, the

contraction across the river-bed is 1 per cent. When all the piers of a

bridge had not been broken, it was observed that those which escaped
were the shorter ones, near the river banks. The longer piers of the
Kisogawa Bridge had a cross-section of 22-5 feet by 10 feet, and a heicht
of 29 feet above the plane of fracture, which was 4 or 5 feet above their
foundations. They carried girder's weighing about 200 tons. The shorter
piers, which also had a cross-section of 22'5 feet by 10 feet, had heights
of about 21 feet above their planes of fracture. They carried girders
weighing about 22 tons.

     The tensile strength of the brick and cement work of these piers was
as shown by actual tests, unusually high, often reaching 100 lb. to the

square inch. When making these tests, it was seldom that the cement

gave way, fracture taking place either by the breaking of the brick or by
separation between the cement and brick.
                              --

120 KEPOET-- 1892.

The tensile strength of brick and mortar work from cotton-factories

and other private buildings seldom exceeded 5 lb. to the square iucb.

Professor Tanabe, of the Imperial College of Engineering, has very

kindly applied the fracturing formula to the Kisogawa and other structures,

with the following results :

The tall piers at the Kisogawa Bridge, which were broken, were

capable of resisting an acceleration of 505 feet per sec. per sec, whilst

the shorter piers, which were also broken, could have resisted a force in-

volving an acceleration of 10'8 per sec. per sec.

The acceleration in the neighbourhood of this bridge was therefore

greater than the higher of these two numbers                                                                                                                                                                                                                            because there  is no
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

necessity that one set of piers out of a series should only have half the

strength of another group in the same series, or that any given structure

should be weaker at its base than it is in its upper parts. So far as resist-

ance to stresses consequent on horizontal movement is concerned, the

writer ventures to express the opinion that when constructing in an

earthquake country, ordinary engineering practice requires modification.

Such modifications are being made by Mr. C. A. W. Pownall in the con-

struction of a series of bridges now being built up the Usui Pass, in this

country.

For the Nagara Bridge, where cast-iron j^iers have snapped in two,

the accelerations experienced have not yet been calculated.

Leaving the railway works, and examining the various brick-and-

mortar structures, like public buildings and mills, which existed at many

towns upon the plain, we meet with hardly anything but absolute ruin.

Two conspicuous brick-and-mortar ruins in Nagoya were the Post Office

and a cotton-mill. Walls like these, even if not weakened by openings

near their base, assuming them to have been 40 feet high and 1^ foot

-- --thick, and with a tensile strength for their brickwork of 5 lb. per square

inch which is not an underestimate might have resisted a suddenness

of motion of a few inches per sec. per sec. From overturning phenomena
and diagrams we know the acceleration impressed upon buildings in this
area may have been as much as 15 feet per sec. per sec.

     One curious form of destruction was that which was observed with
many mill chimneys, which, with the exception of one in Yokohama, in-

stead of breaking at their bases, gave way at about two-thirds their

height. Sections near the bases of these chimneys were apparently

sufficiently strong to resist the stresses due to the inertia of the upper

parts, while sections at about two-thirds the height were so weak that

they failed to resist the inertia effect of the upper one-third of the

chimney. Calculations respecting these structures have not yet been

made.

The ruins of ordinary Japanese buildings existed along all the roads

in never-ending lines. In some streets it appeared as if the houses had
been pushed down from the end, and they had fallen like a row of cards.

Where a row of buildings had only been partially pushed over, it was

noticeable that those at the end had suffered more than their neighbours.

Sometimes you passed acres of heaped-up rubbish, where sticks and earth

and tile were so thoroughly mixed that traces of streets or indications of

buildings had been entirely lost.

    Many of the ruined towns, like Kasamatsu and Gifu, caught fire, and

all that remained was a sea of reddish earth and broken tile. At several

places people were caught in the fallen ruins, and subsequently burnt ta

        ON THE EARTHQUAKE AND VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF JAPAN. 121

death. The chief causes which led to the destraction of Japanese build-
ings were :

     1. The heavy roofs, which are usually made of a heavy framework
carrying a layer of heavy tiles bedded in a thick layer of mud. The

roofs of the farmers' houses are covered with a heavy thatch. These

latter fell intact, and even now the country is covered with these saddle-

shaped masses, which have served as temporary tent-like shelters.
     2. The want of cross-bracing and the thinness of the vertical sup-

ports, the strength of which is reduced to perhaps an eighth of what it
might be by a variety of tenons, mortices, and other cuts, made for the

reception of cross-timbers.

     Both of these faults in the construction of an ordinary Japanese
dwelling might be easily overcome, but from the buildings which are now
being erected it is clear that the survivors prefer that to which they have
been accustomed and can easily obtain. Buildings to resist earthquake
motion are outside the experience of ordinary carpenters in Japan, and
any novelty in construction would be expensive. For these reasons,
coupled perhaps with the idea that severe earthquakes only recur at long
intervals, the inhabitants of the Nagoya district are giving another trial
to the old forms of construction.

    Among the buildings which were only shattered, but which did not

fall, are two castles and several heavy-roofed temples.
     The castles stood, partly, perhaps, because they were well built, partly

because they were surrounded by deep moats, but chiefly on account of
their pyramidal form, their bases being sufficiently wide and strong to
withstand effects due to the inertia of their upper parts.

     The temples undoubtedly resisted the severe movements partly

because they were well built, but chiefly, perhaps, on account of the multi-
plicity of jointed corbel-work, which comes between the upper parts of
the supporting pillars and the heavy roof. If this had not existed, and

acted as a yielding medium between the roof and its supports, it seems

impossible that the latter could have resisted the inertia of the load above
them.

    A class of buildings which here and there escaped entire destruction

were structures like some of the school- houses, which were built of wood,
and framed according to foreign methods.

     The movements which caused all this terrible destruction throughout
 the Gifu and Nagoya Plain do not appear to have been waves which were

entirely those of elastic compression and distortion. On the coast-line to
the north of the devastated district we are told that the shore-line rose

and fell, and with this rising and falling the waters receded and advanced.

 In the district itself many eyewitnesses tell us that they saw the ground

in waves.

     Mr. Kildoyle, an engineer, who at the time of the disaster was in
Akasaka, says that the waves came down the street in lines. Their
height may have been 1 foot, and the distance from crest to crest any-

thing between 10 and 30 feet ; but he very naturally added that he
could not be sure of any measurements, as he was expecting that the

houses on one side or the other of the street might at any moment fall in
upon him. It may here be remarked that because on the street side of
the houses in a town there are many openings, which make this side of

 the buildings weaker than they are at the back, the tendency is to fall
 forwards from two sides into the street. For the safety of the inhabitants

of a town, special attention ought to be given to the construction of shop

and other frontages, and the streets be made wide.

Another indication of wave movement is the statement of people who

say that after they had been thrown upon the ground the movements of

Athe earth rolled them from side to side.  station-master, who tumbled

on the line as the station-house fell close behind him, showed the writer

the manner in which he seized one of the rails whilst lying on the

ground, the rail passing between his legs. While in this position he

was tumbled from side to side, first striking the ground with one

shouldei', and then with the other.

Reasons for believing that in Tokio the ground was thrown into long

undulations have already been given. First, there was the evidence of

our sensations ; secondly, the observation of the manner in which water

moved in ponds ; and, thirdly, the observations on the movements of

bracket seismographs, which were tipped from side to side. The most

certain evidence about the tilting is, however, that which is furnished by

the diagrams of many seismographs, which, rather than showing a series

of irregular waves with superimposed irregularities, in almost all cases

show a series of clean-cut curves. In one instrument which was tested

the periodicity of these curves did not agree with the period of the

instrument, from which we may conclude that they had not been formed

by swinging. Further, the periods of a consecutive series of waves are

not constant. For example, one set of east and west tiltings followed

each other, with periods measured in seconds of 3'4, 2'0, 2'7, 17, 4-1, 3'1,

3'1, 2'7. On another instrument another set of waves, taken at random,

followed each other at intervals of 1'9, 2*5, 1'3, and 2'6 seconds. These

observations also preclude the idea that the records were obtained by

swinging. The most interesting observation, however, is that a pair of

conical pendulums, the bobs of which were supposed to be steady points,

and which had no pointers for multiplication, gave diagrams about twice

as large as similar, but smaller, conical pendulums which carried pointers

to multiply any motion relative to their bobs six times.

The actual records are as follows :

movements of the writing-pointers, the latter quantities varying with
the amount of stability given to the horizontal pendulums. Immediately
after the earthquake Mr. F. Omori very kindly made such determinations
for a seismograph in the laboratory of the Imperial University, with the

result that the maximum slopes which this seismograph had recorded were
about one-third of a degree. Waves with these slopes, as shown on the

diagram, succeeded each other at intervals of about 2'2 seconds. The

vertical motion which was recorded was about 10 mm. ; but as ordinary
lever spring instruments, when the levers are not parallel to the wave-

fronts, are as sensitive to tilting as horizontal bracket or conical pendu-

lum seismographs, these measurements must be regarded as maximum
rather than actual values. Combining the maximum wave-slopes with
these records of vertical motion, we obtain certain values for the lengths
of the waves, which may be taken at 18 or 20 feet ; and as we know their
period, we may determine their velocity of propagation, which appears to

have been about 8 feet per second. This is exceedingly slow, but not-
withstanding the errors in the observation of vertical motion, I do not
think the velocity exceeded double this amount. The velocity of propa-
gation of more truly elastic vibrations will be referred to later.

     From these observations, which I think are made for the first time,
rather than concluding that modern seismographs are useless whenever
vertical motion occurs, we see that on such occasions they must be
regarded as angle-measurers. The action of any bracket seismograph
when recording horizontal motions depends greatly upon its inertia, but

to obtain the best measurements of tilting, any cause likely to produce
swinging should be minimised. To obtain a true measurement of vertical
motion, the method which first suggests itself is to have a number of
spring lever arrangements in different azimuths, the one which happened
to have its arm at right angles to the direction in which the wave
advanced being the one which would give the best results.

    Independently of any new instruments which may be devised to
measure tilting, we now know that the instruments we already possess

have a double function, not only naeasuring horizontal displacements, but
also measuring angles of tilting. In order to take advantage of this

second function, it is necessary that when a bracket or conical pendulum
instrument is once set up, experiments should be made to determine the
effects of tilting, otherwise, should it be tilted by an earthquake, its records

will not be measurable.

    An investigation of considerable importance in connection with the

intensity and direction of motion, which has been carried out by Mr. F.
Omori, relates to the overturning of bodies of various dimensions. At
all temples, which are more thickly distributed than the towns and
hamlets, there are stone lanterns, standing on circular or square pedestals,
whilst in the vicinity there are hundreds of gravestones, which are square
or rectangular in section, and stand freely on their ends. Applying the
overturning formula to some thousands of these which were overturned
in the Nagoya-Gifa Plain, average minima and maxima values for the

accelerations experienced at different points within the earthquake area
have been determined. Inasmuch as the results given by the formula,
which is due to Professor C. D. West, conform with the results obtained

by experiment, we have every confidence in the figures given in the

following table :

part of the plain the direction of motion, similarly determined, must have
been more north and south.

    From the measurements of maximum acceleration, and from the

records of seismographs which at Nagoya and Gifu gave for the com-
mencement of the disturbance the period of the back and forth motions,

we may approximately- determine the amplitude and maximum range of

motion. The following are a few of such determinations, which it will
be observed do not materially differ from the width of fissures found in
the open country. The period taken is one and a half second :

exploding charges of dynamite, velocities were obtained varying from
200 to 630 feet per second. All these experiments were made in
alluvium. Amongst other results the following were of importance :

1 The velocity of transit decreases as a disturbance radiates.

2. The velocity of transit varies with the intensity of the initial

disturbance.

3. The motions transmitted most rapidly are vertical free-surface

vibrations ; normal motions come nest, whilst the lowest records obtained

were for transverse motions (see 'Trans. Seis. Soc.,' vol. viii. p. 50, &c.).
     Mr. Mallet determined a velocity in sand of 824-915 feet, and in

granite, of 1664-576 feet per second. General Abbott, at the destruction

of Flood Rock, noted velocities as high as 20,526 feeb per second.

Professor S. Newcomb and Captain C. Button determined velocities for

the Charleston earthquake of 17,072 feet per second. The highest velocity
for a sound-wave through piano steel of density 7 '7 is given by Tomlin-

son at 5,198 metres (17,049 feet) per second.

    Although elastic vibrations may have been transmitted from the

earthquake district 150 miles to the Tokio Plain at the rate of several

thousand feet per second, the resultant gravity-waves in the Tokio Plain
itself do not seem to have been propagated at a greater rate than a few

feet per second. With these results before us, all we can say is, that

earthquakes have caused motions in the ground, which apparently have
been transmitted at rates varying between 10 feet per second and 20,000

feet per second, the latter being a rate which is higher than that at

which sound-waves are propagated through hard steel. Attention has
often been called to these facts, but any explanation for them has not yet

been formulated.

The result of Professor Tanakadate's magnetic survey has not yet

been published, but I believe he finds that there is a slight irregularity

in the curve, showing the daily change in declination, which does not

Aappear to have been noticed before the earthquake.  curious observa-

tion, made by Dr. Julius Scriba and other medical men, was that many

of the troubles amongst tbe wounded, like tetanus and erysipelas, were

in great measure due to the result of nervous excitement. From my

own observations at a time when all were camped in the midst of ruin,

and every few minutes a shock was heralded by a booming sound, the

only effect that the great catastrophe had produced upon the people was,
when they heard one of these unaccountable noises, to cause them to act
with unusual quickness in seeking safety. Amongst the Japanese, so

far as I could learn, there was no hysteria, fainting, or nervous prostra-
tion like that which was observed amongst European women. Although,
they were surrounded by ruin, the dead, and the dying, all that happened

when a hollow thundering announced a coming shock was that they ran
quickly for the open, shortly afterwards coming back laughing and

talking about the terrible effects of earthquakes. Notwithstanding this,

it is not unlikely that this disaster will have produced an impression

sufficiently great that for many a year to come it will be commemorated
by a religious ceremony, when services will be performed in honour of

the dead.

     The Nagoya-Gifu Plain is a flat expanse of rich alluvium, covering

an area of about 600 square miles. On its east and west sides it is fringed

by low hills made out of tertiary tuffs lying at the feet, pateozoic moun-

tains which rise to heights of from 2,000 to 4,000 feet. These latter,
                                                                                          ;

128 BEPORT-- 1892.

which stand np in serrated ridges and overlook the plain, are composed

of slates, schists, and other metamorphic rocks. Here and there beds of

limestone are found, and rising from the midst of these hills are several

larger granite bosses. Volcanic rocks do not exist in this jaart of Japan.

From ancient maps and historical accounts we know that the southern

portion of this plain has rapidly been encroaching on the sea. This is,

no doubt, lai'gely due to sedimentation ; but because evidences of elevation

exist at so many places along the eastern coast of Japan, it is reasonable

to infer that the growth of land may in part be attributable to this

Acause.     certain number of earthquakes are every year recorded in the

Nagoya-Gifu Plain, but it is by no means so often shaken as many other

Aparts of the Empire.  somewhat remarkable observation connected

with the seismological history of this portion of Japan is the fact that,

although written records of natural phenomena are usually fewer the

further we go back in time, yet, from what has been chronicled, great

earthquakes were more frequent in the district between Nagoya and

Osaka in bygone times than they have been during more recent times.

The last severe shakings at and near Gifu took place in 1826, 1827, and

in 1859. Many ordinary buildings and even mountains suS'ered, people

and animals were killed, rivers were stopped up, and floods occasioned.

AThe shocks lasted for several days.  rather severe shock was felt on

May 12, 1889. In 1880 there were shocks and sounds coming froni the

north-west. From 1885 to 1890 the number of shocks annualTy recorded

in that district was respectively 9, 4, 10, 12, 15, and 36. In 1888, in

one locality near to the centre of the late disturbance, 19 shocks were

recorded ;  in  1889  the number was  15                in  ] 890  there were 20  shocks
                                                     ;

and between January and October 1891, that is, up to the time of the

great distui'bance, 26 shocks were noted. These figures suggest the

idea that for four years before the Gi-eat Earthquake there was a marked

increase in seismic activity, and that an unusual number of small dis-

turbances had heralded the great collapse.

Even if it is only sometimes true that small shakings warn us of

larger ones to follow, because the latter are so terrible in their effects, it

would seem well to carefully study districts in which from time to time

there are definite indications of an increase in underground activity.

Earthquakes generally occur in mountainous countries where the

mountains are geologically young, or in countries where there is evidence

of slow secular movements like elevation. These latter movements are

usually well marked in volcanic countries, and it is not unlikely that

the majority of earthquakes, even in volcanic countries, are the result of

the sudden yielding of rocky masses which have been bent until they

have reached a limit of elasticity. The after-shocks are suggestive of

the settling of disjointed strata.

     In Japan, the majority of the earthquakes which we experience do
not come from the volcanoes, nor do they seem to have any direct con-

nection with them. Assuming that the greater number of earthquakes

represent interruptions in the general process of rock crumpling, it would

appear that light might le thrown upon the time of their occurrence by

careful observations on the change of level in a district where seismic

disturbances were frequent. To accomplish this it is suggested that

several miles of water-pipes be laid at right angles to a known axis of

elevation, and that continuous photographic records be kept showing the

Aheight of the water in standards at each end of the line.         more com-

plete arrangement would be to have two lines of piping, placed at right-
angles. The cost of the installation would be about 5001.

     In conclusion to this Report it must not be overlooked that the re-
marks on the Great Earthquake only aim at giving an outline of phe-
nomena which have been observed, and the general character of the
results to which they lead. More detailed accounts will not be ready
for publication for some months.

    Professor Gr. A. Lebour, Mr. A. B. Wynne, Mr. W. Galloway,.
     Mr. G. F. Deacon, Mr. E. Wethered, and Mr. A. Strahax,

     appointed for the purpose of investigating the Rate of Increase
     of Underground Temperature downivards in various Localities

    of Dry Land and under Water. {Drawn up by Professor

     Everett, Secretary.)

Regret has been expressed in previous Reports at the scarcity of observa-

tions from America. An important contribution towards supplying this

lack is described in the ' American Journal of Science and Art ' for

March, 1892, under the heading ' Preliminary Report of Observations

Aat the Deep Well, Wheeling, West Virginia, by William Hallock.' coiay

of this Preliminary Report was sent by Mr. Hallock to the Secretary,

and further details have been elicited by correspondence. The passages

between inverted commas in the following account are in Mr. Hallock's
own words.

The well belongs to the Wheeling Development Company. ' It was

commenced in September, 1890, and sunk with rapidity to about 4,100 ft.
by April, 1891. Then the Company, despairing of getting oil or gas,

were about to abandon it, when Professor I. C. White persuaded them

to deepen it and give it to science. Drilling was recommenced, and early

in May they stopped at a depth of 4,500 ft., fearing to go further with the-

old Manilla rope.'

' The hole was sunk by the ordinary oil-well outfit, i.e., a jumper drill

on a rope.' It is dry, with the exception of a few feet of water at the

bottom.

' About ten days after drilling stopped, Mr. F. H. Newell ' and Mr.

Hallock ' took a series of temperatures at every 250 ft.'
     ' The thermometers, immersed in zinc buckets of water, 3 ft. high and

4 inches in diameter' (^ inch less than the diameter of the bore), 'were

left in place for twenty-four hours. This series of May does not differ

essentially from the later ones of June and July, and shows no sign of

heat due to jumper.'

' In June ' Mr. Hallock ' returned to Wheeling, and during June and

July made two very careful and complete series, which are given in the

table. Each series touched evei-y 250 ft. ; but the two series were shifted

1892.                 K
130 BEPORT-- 1892.

so that the points of one series fell midway between those of the other

eeries, thus touching every 125 ft. or thereabouts. When it is considered

that these two series were taken a month apart, and yet nowhere differ
by more than 0°-3 F., it seems pretty good evidence of the accuracy and

constancy of the results. Many of the points, as at 1,590, 2,500, 3,000,
3,500, 4,000, and 4,460, were checked as many as four or five times.'

     The thermometei'S were raised and lowered by steel wire, which also

served to measure the depths. They were lowered to place about 11 a.m.,
and left till next morning, though trials showed that they had practically

i-eached a stationary condition by 5 or 6 P.M. Sometimesthey were left in

for several days. They were of the Negretti maximum kind, used upside

down. They were carefully compared, and corrections were applied not

only for their index errors, but also ' for the contraction of the recording

column in cooling from the maximum tempei'atnre to the temperature at

which they were read. They were put two (sometimes three) together,
and hence always checked each other, agreeing very satisfactorily. They
were hung upon a long spiral spring in the zinc bucket in water, or upon

the wire 250 ft. from the bucket at the end.'

The well is cased with iron tubes to the depth of 1,750 ft. There

are three of these tubes, the first reaching from the top to the depth

of 400 ft., the second from the top to 1,200 ft., and the third or innermost

from the top to 1,570 ft., the internal diameter of tliis last being 4| inches.

No reliance was placed on the temperature of the cased portion.

The strata are nearly horizontal, their dip being only 50 ft. to the

mile                        and the uncased  portion consists almost entirely of shale, the  only
                         ;

important exception being an oil sand at from 2,900 to 3,000 ft. The

conditions are eminently favourable for the purposes of the Committee.

In view of the disturbance of temperature by convective circulation

of water, which was proved to exist in the deep bores at Sperenberg and

Schladebach (see Reports for 1876 and 1889), and was obviated by the

use of special plugs for isolating any required portion, Mr. Hallock made

careful experiments on the effect 'of isolation. Two series of woollen

wads were placed ten feet apart, and thermometers in the intervening

space gave the same indications as other thermometers above and below

the wads. ' In fact a thermometer simply tied on to the steel wire

recorded the same as an isolated one.' Nevertheless, as a measure of pre-

caution to prevent circulation, long blocks nearly filling the hole were

nearly always placed above and below the thermometers, except when

they were in the long buckets.

      In endeavouring to account for the absence of convection in this dry

bore, we are confronted with the fact that air is much more expansible

than water, and therefore more easily put in motion by difference of

temperature. On the other hand, the process of 'jumping ' which was
employed in the present case leaves the sides much rougher than diamond

boring, which was the method employed at Sperenberg and Schladebach
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and this roughness tends to hinder circulation.

The main difference to which we must look for the explanation is the

difference of thermal capacity ; this capacity, for equal volumes, being

about 3,000 times as great for water as for air. It would thus appear

that the air is so easily warmed and cooled, that the heat whicli it gives
and takes does not sensibly affect the temperature of the walls, surrounded

as they are hy a practically infinite extent of rock tending to maintain
them at their original temperatures.
ON THE RATE OF INCREASK OF UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURE. 131

    When these observations are plotted they give a remarkably smooth

curve. The portion from 1,835 to 3,232 ft. is nearly straight, with an
average gradient of 1° P. for 82*4 ft. It then becomes gradually steeper.

     Beginning at the point where the casing stops, viz., 1,591 ft., the first
244 ft. (1,691 to 1,835) give an average gradient of 1° in 92 ft.

      The next 651 ft. (1,835 to 2,486) give 1° in 84-5 ft.
      The next 746 ft. (2,486 to 3,232) give 1" in 80-6 ft.
       The next 643 ft. (3,232 to 3,875) give 1° in 62-4 ft.
       The next 587 ft. (3,875 to 4,462) give 1° in 58-1 ft.

The mean gradient for these 2,871 ft. (1,591 to 4,462) is 1° in 71-8 ft.
To determine the surface temperature, advantage was taken of a

heading at the depth of 100 ft., which was being driven into new ground
Ain a neighbouring coal-mine.
                                 thermometer inserted in a hole bored

3 ft. into the face of the heading showed 51°'3 on five successive days.

This is checked by the mean annual temperature of the two neighbouring

towns, Marietta and Steubenville, which, according to the Coast Survey,

is 51°-5. Comparing the .temperature 51°-3 at 100 ft. with 110°-15 at
4,462 ft., we have a mean gradient of 1° T. in 74-1 ft.

The public spirit shown by the Wheeling Development Company in

deepening this bore at great expense for purely scientific purposes cannot

be too highly commended. There is reason to hope tbat the boring will

be continued, with the aid of a steel rope, to at least 6,000 ft., so as to

make this the deepest well in the world.

Mr. Hallock, by whom the plan of observation was devised and carried

out, is senior assistant in the Astrophysical Observatory of the Smith-

sonian Institution, Washington.

[A request for information as to the temperature of the water at the

bottom has been answered by Mr. Hallock since the reading of the Report.

The temperature of the water was observed in May 1891, and found to

be 110°-36 at the depth 4,492 ft., as the mean of three obsei-vations, viz.,

110°-4, 110°-5, 110° 2, at the respective depths 4,500, 4,500. and 4,475 ft.

Mr. Hallock adds that this water leaked in at the depth of about

2,900 or 3,000 ft. and i-an down, amounting to about ten or fifteen gallons

per day.]

countries, and two meetings of the Committee were held, at which dis-
cnssions took place. Major Cardew, of the Board of Trade, was present,
and took part in the discussion. Dr. von Helmholtz drew special
attention to the need for having a unit of resistance defined in terms of a
specified column of mercury, and pointed out that the difficulty arising
from the uncertainty of the relation between the centimetre and the

gramme might be avoided by defining the mass of mercury column of

given length, which has a resistance of cue ohm. After discussion the
following resolutions were agreed to :

      1. That the resistance of a specified column of mercury be adopted

as the practical unit of resistance.

     2. That 14'4521 grammes of mercury in the form of a column of

uniform cross section 106'3 m. in length at 0" C. be the specified column.
      3. That standards in mercury or solid metal having the same resist-

ance as this column be made and deposited as standards of resistance

for industrial purposes.

      4. That such standards be periodically compared with, each other, and
also that their values be redetermined at intervals in terms of a freshly
set up mercury column.

      It was further agreed that these resolutions should be communicated
to the Electrical Standards Committee of the Board of Trade.

     With regard to the unit of current and of electromotive force, it was
agreed that the number '001118 should be adopted as the number of
grammes of silver deposited per second from a neutral solution of nitrate

of silver by a current of 1 ampere, and the value 1'484 as the electro-
motive force in volts of a Clark cell at 15° C.

      Dr. von Helmholtz expressed his full concurrence in these decisions,
which are, as he informed the Committee, in accord with the recommen-
dations which have already been laid by the Cnratorium of the Reichs-
anstalt, as well as by himself, before the German Government.

      The Committee wish to place on record their thanks to Dr. von
 Helmholtz and the other visitors for the help they have aff'orded them in
 coming to so satisfactory a conclusion.

      Dr. Lindeck laid before the Committee some information as to the
 properties of the manganese alloy used at the Reichsanstalt for resistance
 coils (see Appendix IV.), and it was agreed that it was desirable to obtain
copies of the German standards in manganese for further comparison with
the standards of the Association. The Committee therefore recommend
 that they be reappointed, with the addition of the name of Mr. George
 Forbes, and with a grant of 251., including an unexpended balance of
 101. ; that Professor G. Carey Foster be Chairman, and Mr. R. T.

 Glazebrook, Secretary.

ON STANDABDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 137

     The Board of Trade Committee recommended for adoption the values
-9866 and 106-3.

     The specific resistance of mercury in ohms is thus

                ·9407 X 10-^

         =Also 1 Siemens unit  "9407 Ohm
                = -9535 B.A.U.

         1 Ohm  =1-01358 B.A.U.

     The results found by Lord Eayleigh were reduced by the use of the
value for the specific resistance of mercury in B.A. units found by him.
If instead we use the value ·9585, the mean of the best determinations,
we have, as in the table, for the length of the mercury column having a

resistance of 1 ohm the values 106'27 and 106'31. At the meeting of the
Committee M. Guillaume stated that a correction should be made to M.

Wuilleumeier's value, which would raise it to 106;31. This arose from
some uncertainty as to the correction required to the resistance of mercury
for change of temperature on which M. Guillaume had been working

lately. Taking these corrections we arrive at 106'31 as the mean of the

above.

On the Change of Resistance of Mercury tuith Temperature.
                       By M. G. GuiLLAUME.

     At the meeting of the Committee M. Guillanme communicated the

results of his determination of the relation between the resistance of
mercury and the temperature. Great precautions were taken with the view
of ensuring that the whole of the mercury in the tube should be at the
temperature of the bath.

    Two series of determinations with different arrangements in the

bridge were made. The results of these two series give for the resistance
of mercury in a glass tube in terms of the temperature the values

(a) Rt= Ro (1 + ·00088023T + -OOOOOlOOeST^)
                               +                                                                                       ;

In the formulae T is the temperature reckoned from freezing-point by the

air thermometer. According to Mascart, de Nerville, and Benoit

                  Rt=Ro (1 + -0008649T+-00000112T2)

On a Special Form of Clark Cell. By Professor H. J. Carhart.

--Portahility. Standard cells must be portable in order to make them

serviceable for general, technical, and scientific purposes. To secure

portability I have adopted the following construction : Into the bottom of

a glass tube | in. x 2\ in. is sealed a platinum wire. In filling pure dis-

tilled mercury is first poured into the tube. On this is placed the

Amercurous sulphate paste.  tightly fitting cork diaphragm is then

pushed down firmly upon the paste. Some zinc sulphate solution is

then poured in, and a zinc rod is immersed in this solution, its lower end

touching the cork. The tube is then securely sealed. Such a cell is

perfectly portable, and may be sent by post without disturbance to its

contents.

   --Temperature Coefficient. It is well known that an increase in the

density of the zinc sulphate solution decreases the E.M.F. of a Clark

cell. This effect is included in the temperature coefficient of a Clark

cell containing crystals of zinc sulphate, since some of the crystals

dissolve when the tempei-ature rises and the density increases. When

the temperature falls recrystallisation occurs. To avoid the change in

E.M.F. due to this change in density I have preferred to use a solution

saturated at 0° C. Such a solution I have found to have a specific

gravity of 1-397 at 20° C. The E.M.F. of the cell is then 1-44 volt if
the Clark cell as made by Lord Rayleigh be taken as 1-434 volt.

    The temperature coefficient may be written as follows :

              Et=Ei5{l- -000386 (<-15) + -0000005 (t-l5y}

or per degree the coefficient is

                           -·000387 + -000001 (<-15).

This is almost exactly half the value usually obtained for the Clark cell
with crystals.

   A cell made with such a solution has the advantage that it reaches its

equilibrium quickly after a change of temperature. Cells made in the
old way require time for the process of crystallisation and for diffusion.

On Wire Standards of Electrical Resistance. By Dr. St. Lindeck,

    Assistent hei der Physikalisch-Technischen Eeichsanstalt, Charlottenburg,
     Berlin.

     It is well known that electrical resistances made out of the alloys gene-

rally used for this purpose, as German- silver, nickelin, &c., change their
value in the course of time, and this in a degree which cannot be allowed
ia measurements meant to be at all accurate. Such a variation is natu-
rally the greater the more unstable the material and the shorter the time

elapsed since winding.

     The following is a short account of the researches conducted in
the Physikalisch-Technische Eeichsanstalt in Charlottenburg on this
subject by Dr. Feussner and myself. That investigation had to be under-

taken specially, as it is one of the duties of the Blectrotechnical Labora-

tory of this institution to secure that reliable standards of resistance may

be obtainable by electricians.
     "We found by preliminary experiments that by more or less continued

heating a coiled wire showed an interesting variation of its resistance,
which led to a systematic investigation of the whole question.'

     For different materials we determined :

     1. The chemical composition, the temperature- coefficient, and the

 specific resistance of the material.

      2. The variation of resistance through the strain produced by winding.
     3. The time- variation during the period subsequent to winding.
     4. The influence of heating to different temperatures.

    A piece of the double silk-covered wire was wound on a wooden

bobbin and its ends soldered to thick copper bars. The bobbin was

placed directly in a petroleum bath, in order to determine exactly the
temperature, and its resistance was acciirately measured by a Wheat-

     ' Some of the results here quoted as to the influence of stress and of a moderate
rise of temperature were previously arrived at by Dr. T. KlemenCiC {Sitz.-Ber. TI ien.
Ahad. 97, 1888).
140 EEPOET-- 1892.

stone's bridge arrangement. As regards the variation of resistance

through winding, it was observed that the resistance of all kinds of wire

increased by winding, as would be expected, the increase being more pro-

nounced for a given gauge of wire the less the bobbin's diameter. This

increase is due to a mechanical hardening of the wire by strain, and it is

well known that the resistance of any metal is less in the annealed state

than in the hardened condition. At the same time an elongation can

hardly be avoided, especially with thin wires, also causing an increase

of resistance. As the gauge of the wires generally was 1 mm., this

second cause was of secondary importance.

    In the first place we investigated a German-silver alloy which the

firm of Siemens & Halske in Berlin used for standards at that time. It

appeared that the increase of resistance through winding could amount

to 1 per cent., and that the time-variation during the following months

was  very   considerable                                                          the  latter  showed itself               always as an increase of
                                                                               ;

resistance. Another remarkable circumstance is the further increase of

resistance (amounting to a few tenths per cent.) by heating such a wire

for several hours at about 100° C.

     It might be supposed that the wire would be annealed by the effect of

the high temperature, and that its resistance would therefore decrease.

But our extensive investigations gave the important i^esult that heating

causes an increase of resistance in all alloys containing zinc to any con-

siderable amount. On the other hand, all alloys examined containing no

zinc show a decrease of resistance under the same conditions. The

increase of resistance by winding is also much more pronounced with

alloys containing zinc than with those in which this metal does not occur.

All this seems to point out that in the former alloys changes of structure

go on, which are accelerated by any kind of stress or by variations of tem-

perature, and always tend to increase the resistance. These changes of

structure also become apparent by the time- variations, which occur when

tlie resistance coil is left to itself. The latter observations are in perfect

agreement with what was found by former observers on the time- variation

of German-silver. The interesting result was then arrived at, that the

time-variation would be much accelerated by heating the resistance at a

high temperature, say 100° C, for a few hours. Within two months

after winding, the period in which German-silver varies most, variations

·could not be shown within the errors of observation in wires treated in

the manner described. During longer periods, say one or two years,

variations would still occur, even with annealed German-silver coils. But

they hardly reach the tenth part of those occurring when this process has

not been gone through.

     The following table shows the results of one of the experiments with

two  wires  of  German-silver                                                          (60 per cent.  Cu                   25 '4  per  cent. Zn ;  14'6

a bobbin of 10 mm. diameter. The wire marked I, was left to itself

after winding, whereas the wire II. was annealed after winding by
heating it to a temperature of 90° Centigrade during three hours. The
resistance of each was measured at intervals of nearly two months
from time to time.

    The alloy, which is now being regularly manufactured and brought
out under the name of manganin, consists of 84 per cent, of copper,
12 per cent, of manganese, and about 4 per cent, of nickel. As the
observations made by nie for the last two years in the Reichsanstalt have
shown, this is a most appropriate material for standard resistances.
     The general character of the resistance- variations of manganin with

temperature may be best understood from the diagram (fig. 1), in which

                                                                    Fig. 1.

     In order to show that at the same temperature the resistance always

--returns to the same value in other words, that there is no hysteresis in

the relation between those two quantities, some points of the curve were
determined with temperatures descending from 70° C, whereas others
were obtained with ascendir.g temperature. This process was repeated

several times. The spots marked / correspond to descending, the spots

^marked to ascending temperature, and the points belonging to the

same series of observations have the same sign. All points are extremely
close to the same continuous curve, and it is quite obvious that this
curious behaviour is a constant physical quality of the material. Of
course such a resistance-coil must have been artificially aged before the
beginning of the observations ; it was indeed heated during live hours at
a temperature of about 140° C. Otherwise, as I mentioned before, a
progressive process of decrease of resistance through annealing would
superpose upon the regular variation of resistance according to the curve.

It is true that this maximum resistance-point does not always occur at
exactly the same temperature for wii'es of different size ; it is well known

that the electrical constants of all resistance alloys change slightly with

the gauge of the wire. But it is also true that the maximum resistance-

                                                                     FiG. 2.

-- --point of manganin of a thicker size say 1 ram. occurs, as a rule, afc

about 30° C, and so at ordinary temperatures the temperature-coefficient
is even less than for this particular specimen of wire.

     The material is very soft, and can be drawn to the finest gauges ; but
ON STANDARDS FOR USE IN ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 145

it must not be annealed in free air, because the manganese then would

oxidise, and the qualities of the material would be altered. Thus it is

not possible to buy, for instance, a ^vire, say 1 mm. thick, and to draw it
dowa to the required gauge without taking proper precautions.

  --In concluding, I will very briefly refer to the construction of our

wire-standards for instance, to a standard of one ohm (fig. 2).'

The double silk-covered wire is wound on a metal bobbin, h b, which

is previously covered with a thin piece of silk, coated with shellac var-

nish and heated, in order to secure good insulation. The bobbin can be

screwed to the ebonite disk d, but it is not fixed to it before the accurate

adjustment of the resistance. The resistance of the wire must be 1-2 per

cent, larger than one ohm to begin with ; then it is wound on the bobbin,

heavily coated with shellac varnish, and heated in an air-bath at a

temperature of 140° C. during about five houi-s. By this procedure we

obtain, as already stated, very constant      Fig. h.
resistances ; further, the shellac is melted
at this temperature, and becom.es after

cooling a hard, highly insulating mass,

which at the same time protects the

wire against any chemical action.

To the ends of the wire are previously

soldered with silver two small copper

rings. The exact adjustment is made

by means of a fine wire-resistance,/, of

100-200 ohms put in multiple arc with

Athe thick wire.  comparatively great

length of this fine wire corresponds to

a' very small change of the whole resist-

ance, and so it may be easily adjusted to

a few thousandths per cent. Then the

small rings at the ends of the two wires

are screwed together and soldered to

Athe stout connecting pieces, pp.  wide

brass case, c c, serves to protect the wire.

In taking observations the resistance

is put in an oil-bath (fig. 3) ; the tem-

perature of the wire may then easily be

determined, and besides that, there can-

not exist any thermo-electric force be-

tween the two solderings. It is a matter

of fact that the thermo-electric force of

manganin against copper is very small

indeed; it amounts only to 1"5 micro-

volt for 1° C. ; the corresponding value                       We see that
for other resistance materials is generally 20-30 microvolts.

even in this respect the manganin is much preferable.

The construction of standards of O'l ohm, and, on the other hand, of

10, 100, 1,000 ohms and more, is essentially the same as described. Of

course there is no multiple arc to those of 10 ohms and more.

As to the constancy of manganin resistances 1 will quote a few

figures. Table VII. refers to a resistance which is used to determine

          APPENDIX V.

On the Clark CelU By Dr. BZahle.

In connection with the report of the Committee I beg to call your

attention to some researches I made, by order of the Physico-Technical

Institute at Berlin, on Clark cells. The time is too short for communi-

cating my measuring methods and results in full extent ; I can only give

you a short summary of the chief points.

HI used in my researches Lord Rayleigh's            form, the positive

electrode being mercury once distilled, the negative an amalgam con-

taining ninety parts of mercury and ten parts of zinc. The last was poured

into the vessel as a hot liquid, and solidified on the bottom. The paste,

which covers the positive electrode, is made by grinding together

mercurous sulphate, mercury, and a mixture of crystals and concentrated

solution of zinc sulphate. No heat was used in preparing this paste.

The mercurous sulphate was bought, and contained, according to

chemical analysis, no foreign ingredients. The zinc sulphate was made

basic by boiling with rods of metallic zinc ; after cooling, the dissolved

oxide of zinc precipitates, and with it the oxides of the metals more

negative than zinc. For oxidising the ferrous sulphate, which is always

present in commercial zinc sulphate, a small current was semt between

two platinum electrodes through the boiling basic solution ; the ferrous

sulphate was changed by the generated oxygen into ferric oxide, and fell

Hout. The cells set up with these materials showed a great agreement

in their B.M.F.'s. I never found a difference greater than x^wo^'t of a
volt between the E.M.F. of any two of them.

The next point I studied was the influence of the impurities in the

different materials composing the cell on the E.M.F., because on the one

hand it is well known that the smallest impurity of the mercury alters

very distinctly the E.M.F., and on the other hand the mercurous sulphate

I bought never contained impurities of a remarkable amount, and

different samples always had the same qualities ; I only investigated, as
the most important matter, the impurities of the zinc and its sulphate.

It was fon nd that the foreign ingredients of the zinc sulphate are of very

little importance, and that only the presence of free acid in the above-

described cleaning process, the result of boiling with metallic zinc, alters

the E.M.F. in a considerable degree. Among the impurities of the zinc

only those caused by metals more positive than zinc are of importance

the zinc may contain considerable quantities of the negative metals

without any alteration of the E.M.F. I conclude that the impurities of the

zinc are of greater importance. If we use it in the form of rods amalga-

mated on the surface, it seems to be a great advantage to dissolve the

zinc in mercury, using it then as a solid amalgam.

The following are the values I found by a great number of observa-

tions for the temperature coefficient of different forms of cells, measuring

between 1"° and 30° in rising and decreasing temperature. The figures

--here giv r, are the mean values of some cells of the same form^ treated in

the same inanner :

this fact, because making the electrolysis in this manner one has

certainly to take a greater figure for the equivalent, and therefore the

ratio between the unit and the measured amount of current remains the

same. The following figures are given by taking one ohm=l-063 S.U.,

and by assuming that a current of one ampere strength deposits in an

hour 4-0259 grammes                                                                                       the  last  figure                   exceeds  that  given  by the Board

Hments the E.M.F. of the
                                                                                                               cells, set up with clean materials in the

above- described manner, as 1-4332 volt at 15°, and am sure that, when

using the same arrangement of the silver voltameter, this value will be

right by five parts in 10,000 if the equivalent is certain to this extent.

If I express the value given by Lord Rayleigh for the cells of the original

Clark's form in this unit, it is 1-4346 volt at 15°. Lord Rayleigh finds

Hthe E.M.F. of this cell a few ten-thousandths of a volt greater than

that of the old form. Therefore it would, perhaps, be 1-4350 volt at 15°i

Recently Mr. Glazebrook has made a new determination, and finds the

E.M.F. of the original Clark cell, in the above fixed units, to be 1-4342 volt

Hat 15°. He has also compared cells set up by me, and now brought

to England, and finds their E.M.F. smaller by Twoot^'s of a volt than

Hthat of the original form. Therefore the E.M.F. of the cell is 1-4338

volt at 15°. This last value and that found by me are in good agree-

ment. It is to be noted that the anodes and cathodes in my voltameters
are much smaller than those in the English ones.

   HIt may be mentioned here that the mean E.M.F. of four cells set

up in the same manner as before, but containing, in accord with Professor

Carhart's directions, a solution of sulphate of zinc, saturated at 0°, was
found to be 1-442 volt at 16°, using the same units as above.

It only remains to give some directions on the best form of Clark

cells._ I suppose it will be good to distinguish such cells which are to
remain as standards in the laboratories and are used by their maker, and

such as are to be used for practical purposes. These do not need to have

the same degree of accuracy, but they must be able to be carried about.

In the Board of Trade memorandum the original Clark cell is adopted as
Hthe standard
                                                                                   ;
             but I think Lord Rayleigh's                                                                                                               form gives more accu-

racy and is easier to set up. In the old form not all the parts of the

zinc rod are in saturated solution, and therefore the value of the E.M.F.

will be a little uncertain. Another disadvantage is that parts of the zinc

rod may fall down in the mercury, and will so produce a considerable

Hvariation of the E.M.F. On the other hand, the electrodes of the form

are always in concentrated solution, and there is no possibility of parts

Hof the negative electrode coming over to the positive one. I have set np

about sixty cells, and have found no difficulty, when using carefully

cleaned materials, to keep the difference of the E.M.F. of the single cells
under a ten-thousandth of a volt.

To construct cells for practical purposes which will stand carriage,

the most simple way is to separate the two electrodes by a porous wall.
I can show here such a cell of a form constructed by Dr. Feussner, and

issued hitherto by the German Reichsanstalt. The positive electrode is
an amalgamated platinum plate with the surrounding paste in a porous

vessel of clay. The zinc rod forming the positive electrode is on the

upper  part  protected  by a glass                                                                                   tube                     the  lower  part  is  blown rectan-
                                                                                                                                           ;

gularly and covered with crystals of sulphate of zinc. The whole glass

vessel is filled with a concentrated solution of this salt. The E.M.F. of

Hsuch cells
           is  about   QQm^tbs  of  a volt  higher  than  that  of  the  cells.

                      -i-

The agreement of different cells of this form is very sufficient for practical

purposes ; the difference between the E.M.F. is always smaller than

T o 6 ^^ of a volt. The only disadvantage of this form is that its E.M.F.
does not follow quickly the alterations of temperature ; but I suppose one

could improve that by diminishing the size of the cell.

   HWe endeavoured in the Reichsanstalt to make Lord Rayleigh's form

transportable on account of its good qualities, and to do this without

introducing foreign substances as porous walls. The investigations in

this direction are not yet finished, but I am able to exhibit a cell which

was constructed for this purpose and seems to be good. The positive

electrode is formed by an amalgamated platinum plate fixed on a wire of

the same metal, which is melted in the bottom of one of the two tubes

forming the vessel. The negative electrode is formed by the 10 per-

centage zinc amalgam solidified on the bottom of the other tube, and

also connected with a platinum wire melted in the glass. The whole

vessel is filled with paste and closed by a glass .stopper perforated by a

thermometer, of which the bulb is within the vessel. Such a cell can be

turned without any danger, and is suitable for transport. The E.M.F.

                                                                                         ;

agreement between the E.M.F. 's of different cells constructed in similar

manner does not exceed -j-y^f^y^ths of a volt. But before using such cells

for practical purposes, they must be observed for a longer time till one

is sure that their behaviour will not be altered by age.

These are the principal results obtained recently in the Reichsanstalt

on this matter. Some of them will be already known here ; but I
hope to have given new proof that the Clark cell is a very accurate

standard for E.M.F., and a good measuring instrument for practical

purposes.

                 On the Values of certain Standard Resistance Coils.
                             By R. T. Glazebrook, F.R.8.

     In the report of the Committee for 1800 it was stated that during the
early part of the year small changes had taken place in the values of some
of the old B.A. standards, which had been subjected to a very low temper-
ature early in that year. These coils have been compared together at
intervals since that date, and the following tables will show that at the
temperatures given there is no indication of any further change. The
difference between the coils and the standard coil flat is given in bridge
wire divisions. The value of one bridge wire division is about "00005
ohm.

     The first few lines in Tables X. and XI. give the values of the differ-
ences observed in 1890. These are followed by those of the more recent
observations which were taken at a temperature of about 16°.

     These observations are sufiBcient to show that there has been no appre-
ciable change in the relative values of these coils.

   XLThe observations on the legal ohm standards given in Table

lead to the same conclusion.

     Two observations were made at a much lower temperature, and these

would seem to indicate a slightly less temperature-coefiBcient than is
shown by the observations between 10° C. and 20° C.

     The values of the two new coils in B.A. units between temperatures of
10° and 20° are given by

     "We may thus conclude that during the past two years there has been

no relative change in the values of the platinum silver unit standards of
the Association.

     Four of these are the original standards made in 1865-67 ; two
others v^ere made by Messi-s. Elliott Bros, in 1885, and the last two by the
assistant at the Cavendish Laboratory from wire supplied by Messrs.

Elliott in 1889.

     The report of the Committee for 1890 contains as an appendix a very
full account of the tests on the air condensers belonging to the Associa-
tion. It was there stated that while the insulation resistance of No. I.
was very high, that of No. II. was not completely satisfactory ; No. II.
was therefore taken to pieces and set up fresh. Its capacity and also that
of No. I. were determined afresh, using the commutator method described

in the previous paper.

     The following values wei^e found :

condenser "2 show that there has been no appreciable change in the
relative value of Standards I. and II. The observations throughout are
accurate to about one part in 10,000.

     During the process of the work Mr. Bowley compared several of the
resistance boxes of the Association together. As these are used as
standards in many experiments it will be useful to put the results on

record.

     Box Elliott 1253 is a Wheatstone's bridge box of platinum silver in
legal ohms, said to be right at 17° C. Assuming that the two 1,000-ohm
coils of the bridge are equal, and the experiments showed no appreciable

difference, the following values were found for certain coils in terms of a

nominal 10,000 ohms taken from 1253.
     The temperature of all the coils was about 15°'6 C.
     Thus the box Elliott 1825 is right at about 4° below the box 1253,

-while the box Nalder 1870 is right at about l°-5 below 1253.

On Dispersion in Double 'Refraction due to Electric Stress.
                         By Dr. John Kerr.

The object of the experiments was to find whether the optical effect

of electric stress varies with wave-length. The only dielectric examined

was CSj, and the cell was that described in the ' Phil. Mag.' for

March, 1880. The two nicols at the ends of the cell were placed with

principal sections parallel, and at 45° to the lines of force. Immediately

after the second nicol came a spectroscope, which received no other light

than that which passed through the two nicols and the uniform part of

the electric field. The lunette of the spectroscope was focussed, and

directed so that one of Fraunhofer's lines passed through the intersection

of the wires, and the instrument was untouched until the end of the

measurement.

When the electric force is applied, the spectrum  darkens                                                 and as the
                                                                                                       ;

potential rises through a sufficient range, a black fringe passes gradually

over the spectrum, entering at the violet end, and leaving at the red.

This fringe we know to be the place of phase- difference tt, or of retardation-

difference ^\, of the two component rays.

The one measurement made in each case was that of the potential at

which the black fringe was bisected by the above-mentioned Fraunhofer's

line. The following table contains the results of the two sets of measure-

ments last taken. In each of the last three divisions of the table the first
two lines of numbers correspond to the two sets of measurements, and the

third line to their averages. The quantities represented by the numbers

sponding optical effect, and Q' for the value of Q when V=180.^

    From the fact that Q' undergoes a regular increase from the red end

of the spectrum to the blue, and from the approximate equality of the

lowest line of numbers, it may be inferred
     (1) That the optical effect of electric stress in a given medium (CSj)

increases as the wave-length diminishes.

    (2) And more definitely, that the optical effect varies exactly or very

nearly in the inverse ratio of the square root of wave-length.

     Solar Radiation. {Draxvn up by Sir Gr. Gr. Stokes.)

The work of the Committee during the past year has been confined to an

examination, both experimental and theoretical, of Balfour Stewart's

second actinometer when used as a dynamical instrument. Actinometers
may be divided into two classes, which may conveniently be denominated

dynamical and statical respectively. In those of the dynamical class the

mercury or other fluid employed is examined while the head of the

column is in motion, in consequence of the exposure being varied by

suitable manipulation, and readings of the column are taken at chosen

times, or else the times are noted when the top of the column reaches

chosen readings. In the statical class the instrument is allowed to attain

its permanent state, subject of course to a secular change, such as that

due to the varying altitude of the sun, and the results are deduced from

the stationary readings of two or more thermometers. Herschel's,

Hodgkinson's, and Stewart's first actinometers are examples of the

dynamical kind                                                                         the  black  bulb  thermometer, Violle's  actinometer, and
                                                                                    ;

Stewart's second actinometer, when used as he intended, are examples of

the statical class.

Stewart's second actinometer has been already described (see Reports

of the Association for 188G, p. 63, and 1887, p. 32), but to save the

trouble of reference it may be well briefly to mention that it consists of

an envelope of thick copper, closed on all sides except as regards a small

hole to allow the sun's rays to enter, and one to allow the stem of the

central thermometer to pass through. In the actual instrument the

envelope is cubical, and its temperature is determined by three thermo-

meters, with their bulbs sunk in hollow chambers in the thick metal, two

(a, b) in the front face of the cube, or that turned towards the sun, the

third (c) in the back face. The internal thermometer (d) has a lenti-

cular bulb, which is mounted so that it lies at the centre of the cube, or

nearly so, and has its plane perpendicular to the incident rays. Th&

copper cube is surrounded by a thick coating of felt, and this by a cover-

ing of thin brass. The object of this arrangement is to make the tem-

perature of the copper cube sensibly the same all round, and at the same

time to prevent it from changing more than very slowly when the indtru-
ment is exposed. The thermometers a, b, c were graduated to degrees,

D to half-degrees, all Fahrenheit.

With a view to increasing the eflfect of the radiation from the sun on

the thermometer d its bulb was ordered to be of green glass of a particu-

lar kind. This, as we ascertained from Mr. Casella, who made the instru-

ment, occasioned a great deal of trouble, as not only had a pot of green

glass to be made specially for the purpose, but many thermometers broke

in the process of construction, the fracture taking place at the junction of
the green glass of the bulb with the colourless glass of the stem. In a

future instrument we should not think of encountering these difficulties,

since, as will presently appear, our researches led us to the conclusion
that little advantage, if any, was gained by the substitution of green for

colourless glass in the construction of the bulb.

    The principle of the instrument was to make any point of the radia-

tion thermometer (d) look, so to speak, in all directions outwards at an

envelope of uniform temperature, except as to directions lying within a
very small solid angle (that subtended by the hole), within which the
sun's rays were admitted. If the direct rays of the sun had been used

the solid angle in question could only be made small on condition of
admitting only a very small amount of the sun's rays, which would not

have sufficed to raise the temperature of d sufficiently above that of A, b, c.

To reconcile the two conditions of allowing the bulb of D to be almost

wholly surrounded by the copper envelope, and at the same time permit-
ting a sufficient amount of solar radiation to fall upon it, a lens was intro-
duced, mounted on a stem perpendicular to the front face, to which face

the plane of the lens was parallel, and from which the lens was distant by

its focal length. In this way the necessary hole in the envelope need
hardly be wider than the image of the sun, though it was convenient to

allow some margin in order to provide for the contingency of the pointing
of the instrument not being very exact. The lens was provided with

two diaphragms for optional use, one having twice the area of the other.

The observations which have been taken at intervals during the past

year with a view to test the practical working of Stewart's second actino-

meter have been made by Professor McLeod ; the reduction of the obser-

vations has been mostly done by the Chairman, with whom also Professor

McLeod has been in frequent communication as to the lines of inquiry.

In consequence of other engagements, the observations have not yet been
subjected to so complete a reduction as the care with which they have

been made deserves                                                                                          but enough has been done to serve as a guide to the
                                                                                                         ;

inquiry, and to permit of some general conclusions as to the^behaviour of

the instrument.

As has been already stated, the instrument was intended for use as a

statical actinometer with permanent exposure. But it seemed desirable

in the first instance to study the march of the thermometers when the

instrument was first exposed to radiation from the sun, or the sun's rays

were cut off after it had been exposed for some time. This seemed to

hold out a better prospect of obtaining a thorough insight into the work-

ing of the instrument than if it had been at once used as a statical

actinometer                                                besides                                          which  the  latter  use would  have  involved  some

outlay in the way of providing some sort of equatorial mounting and

clock movement, and it did not seem desirable to go to the expense of

this unless preliminary testinj; showed that the instrument was likely to

be successful when used as a statical actinometer.

     The temperature of the case was determined from the readino-s of the
thermometers a, b, c by taking first the mean of a and B, and "then the

mean of that and c. It was found, however, that A and B always read

almost exactly alike, and c was not usually more than one or two tenths

of a degree lower. In any future instrument it would douhtless be

sufl&cient to determine the temperature of the copper case by a single

thermometer sunk in one of the side faces, midway between the front and

back face.
     In spite of the felt packing the temperature of the case was found to

change more rapidly when the instrament was exposed to the sun than

was to be desired, and Professor McLeod found it an improvement to

introduce a screen of tinned iron placed a little distance in front of the

front side of the cube, and of course provided with a hole for letting the

sun's rays through that were to fall upon the thermometer D. In most

of the observations the case thermometers were mei'ely sunk in their

holes, the sides of which the bulbs might or might not touch in one or

two places. It was feared that in spite of the slowness of the change of
temperature of the case, the lagging of the case thermometers might

possibly introduce a sensible eri'or. Accordingly the effect was tried of

introducing a packing of reduced silver between the bulb of the thermo-

meter and the wall of the cavity in which it was inserted. By packing

in this manner one of the thermometers A, B, and leaving the other

unpacked, it was possible to judge whether any sensible error was to be

apprehended from lagging. It was found that the packed thermometer

was a little more prompt, but the difference of temperatures read oS was

very small, little more than emerging from errors of observation.

In the first regular observation on the march of the thermometers

under insolation, the four thermometers were read before exposure, then

the instrument was exposed, and the thermometers read at intervals of a

minute for a quarter of an hour, by which time thermometer D had

become sensibly stationary, having risen 61°'3, while the case thermo-

meters rose about 2°, the excess of D over the temperature of the case

rising to 49°7. The sun was then screened off, and the reading of all

the thermometers at intervals of one minute continued for about half an

hour. During this time the case thermometers continued slowly to rise,

the total rise in the half-hour amounting to 1°"5 the central thermometer

stood only 0°'4 or 0°'5 above the case thermometers. The sky was very

clear,  and there were no clouds near the sun                                                                                                                                                                        and as the insolation began
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

at XII., 26, the decrease of the sun's altitude during insolation was but

small.

It remains to be shown whether, and if so in what way, a measure of

the radiation can be obtained from the results.

Let be the tempei^ature of the insolated thermometer, T that of the

case as measured by the case th'ermometers, q the coefficient of cooling,
the rate of cooling being taken as following Newton's law, r the rate of

heating of D due to solar radiation. Then in the time dt the increment

dO of d's temperature is made up of the gain, rdt, due to radiation and

--the loss, q(6 t), due partly to convection, partly to the excess of the
Weradiation from D to the case over that from the case to D.

when the time t which has elapsed since exposure, or whatever other
change it may have been in the disposition of the instrument, is large

enough to permit of our neglecting the last term in (2). The constant
X, the reciprocal of q, in (3) denotes a time, which may conveniently be
called the lagging time of the thermometer n.

Were the actinometer used as a statical instrument the simple ex-

pression (3) is all that we should be concerned with. The quantity r

varies as the radiation, but involves a coefficient depending on the par-

ticular instrument and for a given instrument on the area of the dia-

phragm used, and on the presence or absence of the quartz plate which

is furnished for covering the aperture. The constant q need not be

determined, as it is associated with a coefficient depending on the instru-

ment. By itself alone the actinometer gives only the ratio of variation

of the radiation. To obtain an absolute measure the actinometer would

have to be compared, once for all, with some actinometer which gives

Weabsolute results.  believe that the main object which Stewart had in

view was to furnish an instrument which might supply a means of

detecting possible variations in the intrinsic intensity of radiation from

the sun, corresponding, suppose, to the sun-spot period ; and for this
object the same instrument would be employed throughout, so that we

should not be concerned with absolute measures.

In studying, however, the march of thermometer D when the instru-

ment is exposed, or else the sun's rays cut weoff", must have recourse to
equation (2), and now we can no longer dispense with a knowledge of
the value of the constant q. The easiest way of determining it seemed
to be to make use in the first instance of the readings in the latter

portion of the observation, when thermometer D, after having been

heated by exposure, was cooling in consequence of the sun's rays having

been intercepted by a screen. In this case r=0, and we have simply

Hence, if we plot the observations, taking the time for abscissa and the

logarithm of the excess u for ordinate, we ought to get a series of points

lying in a straight line.

On laying down the observations on paper it was found that, after a

slight initial irregularity, the dots representing the observations lay

extremely closely in a straight line until the excess u, which began at

49°-7, was reduced to about 3°. They then began to fall a little too

high, and the height above the straight line representing the previous

Weobservations kept increasing as we proceeded.  have not investigated

the cause of this variation, but it seems possible that it may have been

due to a slight lagging of the case thermometers. As these were still

rising, though D was falling, the lagging would make the temperature of

the case appear a little too low, and therefore the excess u a little too

great, and therefore the actual reduction of ti, would be somewhat less

than the calculated. The difference between the real and apparent

temperature of the case would be too small sensibly to affect the result

Weuntil the absolute excess u became comparatively small.                                                                               are not,

however, concerned with such small excesses u in the actual use of the

instrument. The lagging time deduced came out 5'6 minutes.

The reciprocal of this was then introduced into equation (2), which

was then applied to the reduction of the first portion of the observation,

that portion, namely, which was concerned with the rise of D consequent

on exposure. As and T are observed and q deemed to be known, the
equation contains only two unknown quantities, namely, r, which depends

on the radiation, and the ai'bitrary constant c. These might be deter-

mined by any two not unfavourably selected observations of the series,

and then the observed and calculated values of u ought to agree for the

rest. This, however, was found to be by no means the case, and the

differences between theory and observation wei'e far too methodical to ba

attributable to errors of observation. Equation (2) was then tried as a

mere formula of interpolation, q being taken as a disposable constant as

well as r and c. Any three observations would of course theoretically

suffice for the determination of the three constants, and then the formula

would give the calculated final excess, to which r is theoretically propor-

tional, or the calculated value of u for any other observation of the series.

The numerical calculation is much facilitated by choosing for the

determination of the constants three observations equidistant in time.

If t,, be the time of the first of the three and Ai the chosen interval, we

have from (2)

    A rough calculation showed that four minutes was a very suitable

interval A^ to choose, which also agreed with the result of actual trials.

When various trios were taken from different parts of the series not too

near the end, as there the differences became small, and consequently
errors of observation would be telling, the calculated final excesses came
out remarkably accordant. It thus appeared that equation (2) was no
mere formula of interpolation, but that it was very well satisfied, pro-
vided, at least, the higher part of the series were not included. The
limit to which the excess tended when it had become nearly stationary
was evidently a little, though only a little, lower than the calculated
limit. This is not to be wondered at, because in the calculation it was
assumed that the cooling followed Newton's lavv, which it is known is
not sufficiently accurate when the excess of temperature is as great as
40° or 50°, the cooling in such a case being more rapid than if Newton's
law had been followed exactly, the constant involved in it being determined
by observations taken with more moderate excesses of temperature.

     The values of q as determined by different trios did not come out so
closely accordant as the calculated final excesses, as might indeed have

been expected from the nature of the equations. Still they agreed in

showing that to satisfy the insolation observations the coefficient of cool-

ing q must be taken distinctly larger, in the ratio of about 5 to 4, than

when the thermometer cooled after exposure. When a beam of the rays

of the sun falls on the front face of the thermometer a portion of heat is

absorbed directly by the mercury under the place where the rays strike.
As mercury is opaque the portion thus warmed would in the first

instance form a thin stratum adjacent to the surface by which the rays

entered. Of course currents of convection would arise in the mercury,

and also the fluid metal would conduct the heat.. But if the heat thus

tends to get diffused, on the other hand there is a constant renewal of

the superficial heating. Now this specially heated stratum, however

thin, helps to raise the mean temperature of the surface, but contributes

comparatively little to the                                                        mean  temperature  of the  mass                           in fact, if it

Nowwere infinitely thin it would contribute infinitely little.                                                                               the rate of

cooling is determined by the average temperature of the surface taken

all round, whereas the indication of the thermometer is determined by

the average temperature of the whole mass of mercury. Hence the

mean temperature of the surface is greater than the mean temperature

of the mass                                                                        and therefore, if the rate of cooling is supposed to be
                                                                                ;

determined by the temperature indicated by the thermometer, in other

words, to be what it would have been if there had been no such inequality

of temperature in different parts of the mass, we must to make up for it

take a larger coefficient of cooling.

Hitherto a single series only of observations has been mentioned.

In fact, a considerable number of series were taken, but as the general

mode of treatment and the general character of the results are prettj^

nearly the same throughout, it does not seem necessary to mention them

except when they were made for the special elucidation of particular

points.

In the first sei-ies the diaphragm used with the lens was the larger

one, of ^/2-inch diameter. It seemed desirable to compare the results

obtained with this and with the smaller diaphragm of 1-inch diameter.

Accordingly, on a day when the sky was clear, series were taken with

the two diaphragms in succession. On reducing the results it was fouad

that the effect of radiation through the larger diaphragm was as nearly

as possible double that through the smaller.

The object of the quartz plate was to prevent possible irregularities

arising from the action of wind, which, it was thought, might cause some

interchange between the air inside and outside the cube. It seemed

desirable to try the instrument with and without the quartz plate.

Comparative series were accordingly taken on a clear and not windy day

_with and without the quartz plate. The efl'ect was in round numbers

about 10 per cent, less with plate on than with plate off. When the

plate is used there is loss by reflection from the two surfaces, besides

which there may also conceivably be loss by absorption. The loss by

reflection can easily be calculated by Fresnel's formula for the intensity

of reflected light. If we disregard the double refraction, and take /x for
the refractive index answering to the mean of the heat rays incident, and

take account of the rays reflected an even number of times, as well as of

those which are not reflected at all, we have for the intensity of the
164 KEPOET-- 1892.

transmitted light, that of the incident being 1-

                                                                                 2/x

On multiplying the calculated final excess got from the observations

without any plate by the above factor, it came, within the limits of errors

of observation, the same as the calculated final excess obtained from the

observations with the quartz plate on. It follows that there is no

seusible loss due to absorption in the quartz plate. It is to be re-

membered that the rays that fell upon the quartz had already passed

thi-ough the glass lens, and also that in the radiation from the sun it is a

CO inpai-atively small proportion of heat rays that are absorbed by glass
and similar substances.

It remains to be explained in what way we were led to the conclusion

tliat the employment of green instead of coloui-less glass for the bulb of

tlie insolation thermometer must have made but little difference in the

results obtained.

Imagine a thermometer to be suddenly exposed to solar radiation, as

in Stewart's second actiuometer, and consider what its behaviour ought

to be on the two extreme suppositions: (I) that the mercury in contact

with the glass reflects perfectly all the rays that fall upon it, but that the

shell  is  partially  opaque                                   (2)  that  the  mercury  reflects  only  partially,  but
                                                            ;

that the shell is perfectly diathei-manous.

On the first supposition the mercury would not be warmed at all by

the rays which fell upon it, but only by conduction from the shell, which

itself would be heated by absorption of a portion of the rays that fell

upon it, either as they came from the sun or as they were on their way

back after reflection at the surface of the mei-cury. The rise of tempera-

ture of the shell would ultimately vary as the time elapsed. But if the

shell were at a given temperature the total heat received by the mercury
from the shell would vary ultimately as the time during which it has been
passing in. But as the temperature of the shell is not constant, but its

rise varies ultimately as the time since exposure, the total heat received
by the mercury will vary ultimately as the integral of a quantity which

varies as the time, and will therefore vary ultimately as the square of

the time.

On the second supposition the mercury receives its heat directly from

the sun, and the total heat received varies ultimately as the time daring

which it has been receiving it.

Now in the actual observation the gain of heat was found to be

ultimately sensibly proportional to the time elapsed, not to the square

of the time, as may be inferred from the fact that the rate of increase

Wewas decreasing from the first.                                          may conclude therefore that the gain

of heat was due almost entirely to the imperfection of the reflection from

the mercury, which entails direct absorption by the mercury of the

portion which failed to be reflected, and only in a comparatively in-

significant degree due to absorption of heat by the shell in the passage of

the heat through it. "We may therefore infer that the substitution of

green for colourless glass in the shell of the bulb would make but little

difference in the results obtained. This agrees with the experience of

Captain Abney, who was led by his experiments on the diathermancy

of various kinds of glass to suppose that a thermometer with a bulb of

green glass would rise decidedly higher in sunshine than one with a shell
ON THE INTENSITY OF SOLAll lUDIATION.            165

of colourless glass, but found on trial that the substitution of green for

colourless glass made only a slight difference.

That the rise should be due chiefly to absorption of radiant heat by the
Wemercury is not to be wondered at.
                                     do not know -whether actual

experiments have been made on the reflecting power of mercury in

contact with glass, but we should probably not be far wrong in estimating

it at about 65 per cent., which is about the reflecting power of speculum

metal in air. This would leave as much as 35 per cent, of the incident

rays to be absorbed by the mercury.
     In some of the experiments the change of temperature of the case was

barely slow enough to allow of regarding T as constant in the integration
of (1). But it is easy to pi-ove that if T vary slowly, though not

infinitely slowly, in order to correct for the finiteness of the rate of

change, we have merely to add the term --dijqdt to the right-haud

member of (2).

The report which I have the honour of presenting to the British Associa-

tion does not constitute a coherent whole, but has, on the contrary, the
character of detached notes, which notes can, however, be classified in
three groups. In the first I will give the value of several constants deter-
mined in modern times. The second embraces various propositions which

seem to me already in a sufiiciently advanced state for it to be possible

to come to a decision with regard to them. Lastly, in the third part I
have made brief allusion to various units which will doubtless come

under discussion in a few years, and about which it may be convenient

meantime to endeavour to form an opinion.

                    First Part.--Values of Certain Constants.

    Up to quite recent modern times a certain number of geodetic data

were derived from the ancient toise of Peru, or from the toise of Bessel.

Many physical constants are given in terms of a yard, foot, inch, or mil
(·001 inch) ; it is therefore important to know the value of these various

units in terms of the metre, which tends to become more and more,
thanks in part to the British Association, the international _ scientific
unit. I ought to say first that, since the Conference of Weights and
Measures held in Paris in 1889, the metre and kilogramme are no longer
defined by the standards of the Archives of France, but by the copies of
these standards which are deposited in the International Bureau of

Weights and Measures : these copies are the common property of the
nations who adhered to the convention of the metre.

   --Toises. According to a determination of M. Benoit, Director of the

International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the true value of the

 ancient toise of France is

                                                           l'»-94909a,

 and that of the toise of Bessel is

                                                            l'»-949061.

--Yard. The accepted value of the metre, according to Kater, is

                                                                                                                         39-3708 inches

or, according to Clarke,

                                                                                                                         39-3704 inches.

These numbers were deduced from standards of the metric system

whose value was insufficiently known. But, thanks to modern determi-
nations, we have beeu enabled to obtain an accurate reduction of these

ancient values,  as                                                                                             well as  those  of Mr.  Comstock                                                M.  Tittmann has thus

I would not trespass on your patience by describing the precautions

I have taken, the difficulties encountered in the work, and the reasons

which make me leel that this result is sufficiently free from systematic

errors. By sixty-four series of measurements made between 0° and 61°,

I have arrived at the following mean result :

1. Apparent resistance of mercury in hard glass, in terms of the

hydrogen thermometer

                          '·t=»-o(1+0-0008809T-(-0000000999T2).
     2. True resistance of mercury (corrected for dilatation of the glass)
in terms of the same scale :

                                                          Introduction.

      I wish first to demonstrate by some examples the three following

principles :

      1. There would be danger, from the point of view of precision, in sup-
pressing intermediary units which are theoretically unjustifiable, but
which can be represented by precise standards.

      2. In certain cases it would be advantageous to reduce the constants
to the C.G.S. system more than has been done.

     3. For ordinary physics and industrial application certain approximate

definitions are clearly sufficient, while metrologists can, for their own use,

apply the necessary corrections to their results.

1. In theory one unit of each kind is enough to express all quantities of

the same nature, but in practice it is usefnl to keep several units.

     The unit of energy in all its forms is the erg, or one of its decimal
multiples, and if we knew with sufficient exactness an official value of the
mechanical equivalent of heat we could express in ergs all the constants

which calorimetry requires. This will, without doubt, be done in the

future, but for the present the final result would lose in precision if we did

not keep an intermediate unit, the calorie, of which everyone can easily

procure for himself an exact standard                                                                                                                                                                                                      for the reduction to the erg would
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

introduce in certain cases a greater uncertainty than the crude result. In

theory we should have gained somewhat, but the result would have been

rendered more vague.

2. Let us take, on the contrary, the case of the mechanical equivalent

of heat in which several intermediate constants occur more or less, accord-

ing as it is expressed in normal or in local kilogrammetres or in joules.

The most exact mode of realising a given amount of loork is by absorbing

the effect produced by the earth on a heavy body. Then, knowing the

mass of a body, it will be necessary, in order to measure the work which
it does in falling, to know the value of ^' ' at the place of observation and
the pressure of the air which are well determined. The whole reduction

of the experiment will not introduce an error of 1 : 10,000 in the result,
an error which is in this case quite negligible.

Hence, if there is any practical interest in keeping the value of the

equivalent in gramme-force centimetre, the question of precision does
not come in at all, and unification cannot but gain by completing the

reduction to the C.G.S. system.

3. After having theoretically defined a unit it is useful to give a legal

value and a standard of it ; this legal value carries a special name, and by
an odd reversal of the problem, in the progress of measurements, the

theoretical unit becomes expressed in terms of the legal standard. If one

is afraid that this unnatural state of things might cause inconvenience it

is only necessary to consider the case of the metric system to convince

oneself that this is not so at all. Originally the kilogramme was defined in

terms of the decimetre, taking the density of water as equal to 1. To-
day the litre is deduced from the kilogramme, but the litre is no longer

rigorously equal to a cubic decimetre.

    A certain number of physical constants determined by hydrostatic

weighings or by volumetric measures are expressed in terms of the (milli-

litre)* or (millilitre)', and not in terms of the centimetre or cm^.
     The occasions in which it would be necessary to establish a difiereuce

between these quantities are so rare that I do not believe I am going be-

yond the truth in saying that the half of physicists have never expressed

this difficulty.

With these preliminaries I pass to the propositions.

                                                 Unit of Pressure.

     So far the unit of pressure has escaped reform, but by a very happy
chance we could, by a change of little importance, adopt a unit of pres-
sure which would be in harmony with the C.G.S. system, and whose
value would be as convenient and exact a one as possible.

      Let us admit provisionally that the absolute density of water at 4°

is equal to unity ; we shall have for the density of mercury at 0° the

number 13"5956, wliich expresses its relative density (specific gravity).
The pressure being given by the equation

                                                      jp=hgd,

we must choose for rj some normal value. Now, there can be no hesitation

on this point Meteorologists, metrologists, and geodesists have adopted

the normal value at  45°, and at sea-level                                                                                         physicists have begun to adopt
                                                                                                                                ;

this unity, and any exceptional cases can only be attributed to pre-

conceived ideas. The normal value of g is

                              cm

                     980-65

       P =L8

   =Let^=10«; then /i 75-005 cm.

     Starting from this result I propose to adopt as the imit of pressure
the pressure exerted by a column of mercury of 76 cm. at 0° under the
normal conditions of gravity, and to call this unit the barie. This
decision would in no wise prevent one from keeping as secoudary units
the pressures exercised by colnmns of mercury 1 mm., 1 cm., or 1 m. in
heiglat, which bear a simple ratio to the unit pressui'e.'

     I do not think that any measurements have been made in which it
would be of use to take into account the compressibility for a pressure of

one barie ; but as this correction varies as the square of the height,
the limit beyond which it is no longer negligible is 2 or 3 metres of
mercury, a correction must be applied in certain experiments on this
account.

                                        The Temperature Scale.

     The thermometric system is an entirely arbitrary one, and is subject
to only one condition, namely, that of offering a simple relation with
precise experimental data. The adoption of a normal unit of pressure in
nowise renders it necessary to make use of this unit for the determina-
tion of the higher fixed point of the system of temperatures. The
adoption of a thermometric system (that is to say of a fundamental
interval and of its subdivision) by all physicists alike would evidently be
extremely useful, and it is doubtless to avoid breaking suddenly with
popular customs that the Centigrade system has not yet come into

universal use.

      Altogether different is the question of a thermometric scale, that is
to say of a function of some natural phenomenon which represents

the temperature when it is made to satisfy two equations of condition.
Carnot's principle, as Lord Kelvin has shown, allows us to define a scale
of temperatures independently of the thermal properties of any given
body. The most accurate experiments may lead to the belief that,

within the limits of temperature measured as yet, the hydrogen thermo-
meter furnishes us with a scale of temperatures which is practically
equivalent to the thermodynamic scale ; and it is for this reason that
this standard scale has been adopted by the Comite International des
Poids et Mesures. I would propose, therefore, that all physicists should
be recommended to reduce all exact measui'ements to the Centigrade scale

     ' For the unit of pressure to be completely defined it is necessary to state
whether account shall be taken of the compressibility of mercury and of its vapour
pressure, of which the value at 0° is as yet not very well determined.

                                              Third Part.

Certain proposals still awaiting their final form and considerations ou

certain points :

                  The Calorie.

     It has been pi-oposed on various occasions not to adopt an independent
unit of heat-energy. In the equation

we ,have          aMcd=i

M = unit of mass of water  ;
=c
          specific heat of water
                                                                                                                                               ;
=6 the interval of temperature corresponding to one degree ;
=j either the C.Gr.S. unit or the practical unit of energy ;
=a the heat-equivalent of this energy.

=The proposal in question is equivalent to putting a 1, and, as we

cannot modify M, to fixing c and Q so as to satisfy the equation.

Messrs. Preece and Forbes proposed in 1889 to modify the temperature

system, while Prof. Ostwald prefers to attribute to water a specific heat
M = =difiering from unity (equal to 4*2, when
                                                                                                                                                  1 gramme, 6 1° C, and

=j 1 joale). I am also of opinion that it would be best to agree to this

last alternative finally ; but I have pointed out previously why I think it

preferable for the moment to adhere to the status quo, and to consider this

reform one of those to be accomplished ia a more or less distant future.

For the present it is, above all things, necessary to define the calorie

--that is to say, the temperature at which the specific heat of water shall

be considered equal to unity but I do not think this decision can be

taken before the question has again been submitted to a very accurate

experimental investigation. The temperature measurements would, of

course, be necessarily referred to the normal scale.

                  Radiation. .

No special unit has hitherto been employed for radiation in general,

and the only unit which has been used in a particular case is irrational

for in solar radiation all authors have taken for their unit the calorie yer

minute, a unit which conforms to no system at all. No radiation has
hitherto been measured to an approximation equal to that with which we

know the mechanical equivalent of the calorie, hence there would be no

inconvenience in using the watt as the unit of intensity of radiation.

This unit would yield very acceptable numbers for the majority of cases

Weof total radiation which we have to measure.                                                                                                    might even push our

analysis still further, and divide the spectrum of an incandescent body into

bands O'l /^ (/x=micron) in breadth ; the unit would then be the watt in each
of these bands. The spectram would thus be completely defined, and

moreover the sums of the partial intensities would be numerically equal to

the total intensity of the radiation.

     ' The differences between the indications of various kinds of mercury thermo-
meter and the hydrogen thermometer have been determined by very accurate
experiments. The comparisons carried out by M. P. Chappuis with mercury thermo-
meters of hard French glass are the most complete ones that have hitherto been

made. We also possess reduction tables for thermometers made of hard Jena glass,

of French lead glass, English lead glass, &c. It is much to be desired that only

samples of hard glass should be used in the construction of thermometers.

     The physical definition of ' visibility ' there adopted is

                V+ii

in which I, is the intensity at the centre of a bright interference band,

and I2 the intensity at the centre of the adjoining dark band. In order

to interpret the actual curves obtained by observation of interference

fringes, it is first necessary to reduce the results of the eye-estimates of

visibility, which may be designated by V,,, to their absolute values as

above defined.

For this purpose two quartz lenses, one concave and the other convex,

and of equal curvatures, were mounted with their crystalline axes at

right angles to each other between two nicols. Under these conditions

a series of concentric interference rings appeared. If a be the angle

between the principal section of the polariser and the axis of the first

quartz, and to the angle between the axis and the analyser, the intensity

of the light transmitted will be                         --

     The curves show a general tendency to estimate the visibility too
high when the interference bands are clear, and too low when they are

indistinct. This tendency may be modified by a number of circum-

stances ; thus it increases with the refrangibility of the light used ; it

is greater when the field contains a large number of bands than when

there are but few ; it is greater while the visibility carve is falling than

when it is rising ; it does not seem to be greatly affected by the intensity
of the light ; finally it varies on different occasions and with different ob-

servers. Notwithstanding these disturbing causes, the result, after
applying the correction, will rarely be in error by more than one-tenth of
its value, and ordinarily the approximation is nauch closer than this.'

     The observations necessary to construct the visibility curves, from
which the distribution of light in any approximately homogeneous source

is to be deduced, may be made with any form of interference apparatus,

which allows a considerable alteration in the difference of path between
the two interfering streams of light.

     The apparatus actually employed for this purpose was designed for
the comparison of wave-lengths, and while admirably adapted for the
observation of visibility curves it contains many parts not necessary for

     · The formula for visibility deduced in the preceding paper is

in which

                          C = \<p(x) cos kxdx,

                          S = U) («) sin Jixdx,

                                    P= [<)(«) <^a-,

                                         =ft 2irD,
                                     D = Difference in path,

and <p(x) represents the distribution of light in the source.
     In this expression no account was taken of the effect of extraneous light, and it

was assumed that the two interfering pencils were of equal intensities. It can be
shown that the error due to both these causes tends to lower the visibility ; but in
either case the correct values may be obtained by multiplying by a constant factor.

   VIn the first case let e be the intensity of the extraneous light, and the result*

ing visibility ; then by definition

whence V = (1 + r) V.

     In the second case, let p be the ratio of intensities of the interfering pencils
then it can readily be shown that the resulting intensity is

                            I = (l + p-)P + 2p (C cos a-S sin »),

and hence the visibility is

                          ^ "l + p2  P'

whence

                                                                        2p

this use. Fig. 1, page 171, presents tlie plan of an arrangement which,

while showing all the essential parts, is much Jess complicated. Starting
from V, a vacuum tube containing the substance whose radiations are to

be examined (and which is usually enclosed in a metal box in order that

it may be raised to any required temperature), the light is analysed by
one or more prisms, forming a spectrum from which any required
radiation may be separated from the re-st by passing through the slit S.^

     The light from S is rendered nearly parallel by a collimating lens, and
then falls on a transparent film of silver on the surface of the plane

parallel plate Gr,.^

     Here it divides, part being transmitted to the fixed plane mirror M,
and part reflected to the movable mirror M2. These mirrors return the

light to the silvered sui'face, where the first part is reflected and the
second transmitted, so that both pencils coincide on entering the observ-

ing telescope.^

    A little consideration will show that this arrangement is, in all respects,

equivalent to a film or plate of air between two plane surfaces. The
interference phenomena are therefore the same as for such an air-plate.

      The theory of these interference bands has been given in an article

entitled Interference Phenomena in a New Form of Refractometer, ' Philo-

sophical Magazine ' for April 1882. As is there shown, the projections of

the bands are, in general, conic sections, the position of maximum dis-

 tinctness being given by the formula

                      P= -^ tan i cos2 6,
                                          tan 9

 in which t^ is the thickness of the equivalent air-plate, where it is cut by
 the axis of the telescope, 4>, the inclination of the two surfaces, 6 and i,
 the components of the angle of incidence parallel and perpendicular re-
 spectively to the intei'section of the surfaces, and P, the distance of the

 plane of maximum distinctness from the surfaces. If 6 be small, the
 variations of P with 6 may be neglected, and we have then

                              P=-i5_tan i,
                                   tan ^

or with sufl&cient accuracy,

                              P=^-?i.

     ' In the case of close groups of lines the image of the source is first thrown on a
slit, otherwise the lines at S would overlap.

    - The light entering the telescope is a maximum when the thickness of the silver

film is such that the intensity of the transmitted light is equal to that of the reflected

light. The silvering has another important advantage in diminishing the relative
intensity of the hght reflected from the other surface. Indeed, for this purpose it
is advisable to make the tilm heavier ; even so thick that the reflected light is twice

as bright as the transmitted. This does not atTect the ultimate ratio of intensities

--of the interfering pencils for what is lost by transmission on entering the plate G,

is made up by reflection on leaving it, the effect being simply to diminish somewhat
the whole intensity. Another advantage of the thicker film is that it can be made
uniform with far less ditficulty than the thin film. It may be mentioned that with
this form of instrument the interference fringes in white light present a purity and
gorgeoui-ness of coloration that are surpassed only by the colours of the polariscope.

     ' The second plane parallel plate G,, is made of the same thickness as the first,
and is required to equalise the optical paths of the two pencils.

rrom this ifc will be seen tliat the focal plane varies very rapidly with i,
so that, unless 0=0, it is impossible to see all parts of the interference
bands in focus with equal distinctness. If, however, 0^0, that is, if
the two surfaces are strictly parallel, then P=co, and if the observing

telescope is focussed for parallel rays, all parts of the bands are equally
distinct. Under these circumstances the interference fringes are concen-
tric circles, whose angnlar diameter is given by

     In attempting to verify this formula, by actual observation, one is met
by the difficulty that all parts of the bands are not in focus at the same
time, the right and left bands being more distinct than the central one,
to which attention ought to be directed. Notwithstanding the rather
rough character of the observations, the results agree fairly well with
theory. If <^o is the ratio of the wave-length to the width of the rectan-

until the platinum spiral outside the tube was raised to fixed temperatures
would give a means of deducing from the indications of the spiral the
true temperature within the tube.

     These adjustments being eS'ected, the screw of the ' wave-comparer'
was turned to zero ; that is, till there was no difference of path between
the interfering pencils. At this point the visibility should be as great

as possible, and was accordingly marked 100. The screw (of 1 mm.

pitch) was then turned through one turn, thus giving a difference of
path of 2 mm., and the visibility again estimated, and so on. The curve

was then drawn, giving the estimated visibihty for each 2 mm. difference

of path, and this was corrected for the personal equation as before

described.

     It follows that the visibility curve is practically the same as that due
to a double source, whose components have the intensity ratio 7 : 10, and
in each of which the light is distributed according to the exponential law,
expressed by the first term.

thus giving a=0'08 for the distance between the components, and
8=0'057 for the ' half-width ' of each. These values give for the distribu-
tion of light in the blue hydrogen line the fall curve in fig. 4a.

                 Oxygen.

     Fig. 5, Plate I., represents the results obtained from oxygen prepared
by heating a tube containing mercuric oxide, drying the gas by sulphuric
acid, and exhausting and filling repeatedly, till the spectrum was nearly

pure. The lines are much less bright than those of hydi'ogen, and in

order to obtain satisfactory results,\the current had to be increased so
far that the tube was frequently broken. Notwitbetanding the somewhat
uncertain character of the observations, it wlir be seen from fig. 5a that
the curve for the orange-red line corresponds very well with that given
by the formula

       V=2~^''^*"[-36 + -32 cos 27rX/2-69 + -16 cos 27rX/4-85

The agreement between the coefficient 2              and the general curve

drawn through the maxima is also shown in fig. 6&.

The interpretation of these results is that the orange-red oxygen line

is a triple, whose components have intensities in the ratios 1:1:1/2,

and whose distances apart are 1"51 and 0*84 respectively, and whose

' half- width ' is 0-027. This is shown in fig. 5c.

The results obtained from metallic sodium in the vacuum tube are so

varied, the character of the lines being so considerably altered by tem-

perature and pressure, that a complete study is at present impossible.

This is especially true of the yellow lines, and the difficulty is con-

which does not permit the separate examination of the lines. Some

being very low and the temperature about 250°.'

     The full curve in fig. 6b, Plate I., gives the experimental result for
the visibility at the maxima for yellow sodium light, corrected for the
personal equation. The dotted curve corresponds to the formula

                                V=2~^'^^'' cos -7/50 cos -1/140.

                        Y=2~^''^^^' cos ·8/Q-58 cos -7/50 cos ·1/140.

     The interpretation of these results is that each of the sodium lines is
a close double, as shown in fig. 6a.

     The yellow-green sodium-line at A.= 5687 is a double whose com-
ponents are about the same distance apait as the yellow pair. It was
found to be far less variable than the yellow ; and the full visibility

curve, neglecting slight irregularities, gives the experimental results
corrected for personal equation. Fig. 7b, Plate I., shows that its com-
ponents are single, and correspond in distribution of light fairly well
with the exponential curve, fig. 7a.

     The same may be said of the orange-red double at 6156 also, except

that this seems to have a companion of feeble intensity.
     The doubles at 5150 and at 4982 were also examined, the curves

showing nearly the same results as the red.

     The temperature at which the radiations from metallic ziuc could be
conveniently observed was in the neighbourhood of the melting-point of
the glass of which the vacuum tubes were made. But few observations
were recorded, though these were quite consistent. The results of the
observations, corrected for personal equation, are given in figs. 8 and 9,
Plate I. The former is the record obtained from the red line near
 6360, and shows that this line is single, the distribution of light agreeing
 very well with a simple exponential curve, the ' half-width ', being 0013.
 The latter shows the results of observation on the blue line near 4811.
 The dotted curve is the visibility curve due to a distribution represented

 in fig. 9a.

      Metallic cadmium in the vacuum tube at a temperature of about 280°
 gives a number of very bright lines, widely separated, and varying very
 slightly with temperature or pressure. Fig. 106, Plate II., shows the

 experimental visibility curve of the red line near 6439, corrected for the

 The remarkably close agreeruent leaves no doubt that the distribution of

 light in the source follows very nearly the exponential law, giving the
 curve in fig. 10a, in which the 'half-width ' of the source is 0'0065.

intensity of whose components is in the ratio 5:1, and whose distance

     The curve for the blue radiation at 4800 is given in fig. 126, Plate

[I., and shows that the results may be approximately represented by

V=2~^°'^* cos -1/32, which corresponds to the distribution of intensity

     The metal is not sufficiently volatile at the temperatures attainable,

but the chloride answers admirably, giving a brilliant green light, the
visibility cui-ve varying but little with temperature. This curve is
given in fig. 136, Plate II., together with the dotted curve representing
the equation

     This is the visibility curve due to a double source, each of \\ hose
components is a close double, as shown in fig. 13a.

                                     Mercury.

     Mercury in a vacuum tube gives two yellow lines, 5790 and 5770, a
very brilliant green line at 5461, and a violet line at 4358.

     The yellow lines are not very bright, and are., so close together that it
is somewhat difficult with the dispersion employed to prevent the light
from overlapping. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the close agree-
ment of a number of observations shows that the curve for the lower line,

given in fig. 146, Plate II., is a close approximation to the truth.
Neglecting the effect of a line of feeble intensity at a distance of about

24 from the principal line, the distribution of light in the source is

represented in fig. 14a, which gives for the visibility curve

which, represents the visibility curve produced by two lines of intensities,
1 : 3 and separated by 0-019 division as shown in fig. 15a.

     The green mercury line is one of the most complex yet examined.
The constituent lines are, nevertheless, so fine that the interference bands
are frequently visible when the difference of path is over four-tenths of
a metre. The full curve in fig. 16, Plate II., gives the results of

observations corrected for personal equation, while the dotted curve
represents the equation

          V=2~''^^''^^V-69Vi2 + -03V2^+^8V,V2 cos 27rX/31-4,

          V,=-62 + -38 cos 27rX/360,

and

         V2=77 + -23 cos 27rX/110.

This is the visibility curve corresponding to the distribution repre-

sented in fig. 16a. The components of the line, for simplicity, have been

assumed to be symmetrical, as figured ; but the observations are not

sufficiently accurate to determine whether, for instance, each component

is a double or a triple line. In this case, also, as in the preceding ones,

it is impossible, from the data given, to determine whether the smaller

Acomponent is to the right or left of the principal line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               direct obser-

vation with the grating showed, however, that the smaller component is

towards the red end of the spectrum.
     The full curve shows that there is at least one other line probably

-- --more than one whose intensity is roughly one-twentieth of the principal

line, and whose distance from it is about three times that of the chief

components.

The violet mercury line is much more difficult to observe than the

others. The results obtained by observation, corrected for personal

equations, are given by the full curve fig. 176, Plate II. The formula

for the dotted curve is

     The results of the preceding work are collected for comparison in

Dfig. 18, Plate III., together with the  group in the solar spectrum.

From these, as well as from the curves, it will be seen that it is easy by

this method to separate lines whose distance apart is only a thousandth

of that between D, and Dj, and even to determine the distribution of

light in the separate components. The conditions most favourable to

high values of the visibility are low density and low temperature, and

these conditions were complied with as far as possible. Still, in many

cases, the range of visibility due to slight variations of the conditions

shows that the behaviour of each substance must be carefully studied

    The effect of temperature and of pressure on the visibility may be

readily accounted for on the kinetic theory. In fact, there is but little

doubt that these are the chief, if not the sole, causes of the broadening of
the spectral lines, and the consequent diminution of visibility, the latter
cause acting by altering the period of the source by frequent collisions,
and the former by the alteration in the wave-length of the light due to
the motion of the source in the line of sight.

    If, now, the density of the vapour is very low, the second cause may be

ignored, and it will be shown that in the case of hydrogen this is the case
when the pressure is one or two millimetres.

     In most of the cases investigated the pressure was so low that the dis-
charge passed with difficulty. Supposing, then, the effect of collisions to

be insignificant, let it be proposed to find the effect due to the motion of

the molecule in the line of sight. If v be the mean velocity of the mole-

Vcule and that of light, then the formula for the resulting visibility
--curve as given by Lord Rayleigh^ is h^{l a") /Q + a").

     If the definition of visibility as given above be taken, however, this
becomes

    If A be the difference of path at which the visibility is reduced to
half its value at X=0, then

                             A=-A/ ~ · ^'

or approximately,

                                                    AV

     If we take for hydrogen 17=2000 metres per second, then , =22500.

     Again, if we ignore the difference in the temperature (about which
there is considerable uncertainty), at which the other substances were
examined, the velocities v would vary inversely as the square root of the
atomic weight, and the number of waves in the difference of path at
which the visibility is 0'5 is therefore 22500 n/to.

     Considering the difficulties and uncertainties of the problem, the
following table shows a very remarkable agreement between the values
actually found and the calculated results.^

     - It should be stated that the value of A for the yellow sodium line, if taken
from the curve, would be much larger than that given. This was the mean of a
number of observatioDs taken within the past month. As has been stated before,
this particular curve has not been obtained since last year. A few other substances,

very difficult to examine, either because the lines are too feeble, or because the
spectrum is so unstable, have given results not quite so consistent as the above,
though all are of the same order of magnitude as that required by theory.

same                            but it may be important to note that there are a number of excep-
                             ;

tions to this rule, among which the green mercury line and the yellow

sodium line may be especially mentioned.

Thus, fig. 20a, Plate IV., represents the visibility curve usually

observed for the green mercury line, and fig. 20c represents that obtained
when the vacuum is so high that the discharge passes with difficulty,

while fig. 206 represents the intermediate stage. This last observation

was obtained by placing the mercury in an atmosphere of hydrogen whose
pressure could be measured by a McLeod gauge.

It might be objected that the presence of a foreign substance might

of itself aifect the distribution of light in the source, and therefore the

form of the curve. In order to test this point, a series of observations of
the red hydrogen line was taken, while the tube contained liquid mercury,

which was heated until the mercury spectrum was at least ten times as
bright as that of the hydi'ogen. The character of the visibility curve was

not perceptibly altered.

In the same series of experiments it was found that, provided the

pressure of the hydrogen remained constant, the effect of a change in
temperature from 75° to 140° had no appreciable effect on the result. In

this connection it may be mentioned that the character of the curve for

the green mercury line was not essentially altered when, in place of

metallic mercury, the nitrate, iodide, or the chloride was suljstituted, the

only important effect being a diminution in the visibility in the order
named.

In the case of yellow sodium light it has already been mentioned that

the character of the curve is more variable than that of any other line

thus far examined. This is illustrated by the curves in fig. 21a and

fig. 21b, Plate IV. It has not been possible thus far to devote the
attention which a systematic investigation demands. These changes are

very puzzling to trace, but undoubtedly much of the difficulty is due to

the fact that the dispersion employed was not sufficient to permit the

separate examination of the components. Still, there can be no doubt

that the width of the lines, their distances apart, and their relative inten-

sities vary rapidly with changes in temperature and pressure.

      In addition to the preceding investigations of visibility curves for

light emanating from a rare gas or vapour in a vacuum tube the cui-ves

for sodium, thallium, and lithium, in the flame of a Bunsen burner, have
been observed, and the results are given in fig. 22, Plate IV. The thal-
lium and lithium lines are clearly double, the distance between the com-
ponents of the former agreeing very well with the results obtained with
the vacuum tube.

     These substances were brought into the flame in the ordinary way,

and the results obtained were at least as good as when a finely divided
solution was used according to the method of Gouy. It appears from

these curves that the width of the line is about ten times as great as

when the vacuum tube is used. But if the temperature of the flame be
taken at 1500° C, and that in the vacuum tubes at 350° C, the lines

should be only twice as broad in the former case as in the latter. It

appears, then, that notwithstanding the small quantity of substance

present (barely enough to colour the flame) the real density must be com-

parable to that of the vapour of the substance boiling under atmospheric

pressure.

The principal object of the foregoing work is to illustrate the advan-

tages which may be expected from a study of the variations of clearness

of interference fringes Avith increase in difference of path. The funda-

mental principle by which the ' structure ' of a line or group of lines is

determined by this method is not essentially different from that of spec-

trum analysis by the grating, both depending, in fact, on interference

phenomena, but in consequence of the almost complete freedom from

errors arising from defects in optical or mechanical parts, the method

Ahas extraordinary advantages for this special work.                                     glance at fig. 18,

Plate III., will give a fair idea of the 'resolving power ' of the method as

compared with that of the grating. In order that the comparison be

quite fair, however, it would be necessary to take for a comparison spec-

trum that of the substances here used, and under the same conditions.

With the best instrumental appliances now in use, it is difficult to ' re-

solve ' lines as close together as the components of either of the yellow

sodium lines. It is evident, however, that by Li'ght-tvave Analysis, if I

may venture so to call the foregoing method, a tenth of this distance is

obviously within the limit ; indeed, if the width of the lines themselves be

less than their distance apart, there can be no limit.

                               Supplement.

I. It has already been pointed out that in many cases it is difficult or

impossible to decide between two or more distributions of lines which

give  very  nearly  the  same  visibility  curve                              and  when  there  are  many
                                                                           ;

lines in the source, the combinations of intensities and arrangements of

these from which a type may be selected are enormously great. Indeed,

even when the number of lines is greater than three, excepting perhaps

the cases where the lines may be in pairs (as in the case of yellow sodium

light), the resulting visibility curve becomes so complex that it is very

difficult to analyse. Doubtless in many cases where the components are

not too close, the grating will give the information necessary for the in-

vestigator to select the proper combination.

It may readily be shown that the formula

for the visibility curve due to a distribution of light, y=<f>{x), is identical

with that of the intensity curve at the focus of a telescope provided with

apertures which produce this distribution in the light passing through.

Accordingly, if a telescope be provided with apertures adjustable in

width, or length, and distance apart, the diffraction image of a distant

illuminated slit will give, at once, a representation of the whole visibility

curve, and by adjustment of intensities and distances any particular

visibility curve may be more or less accurately copied, thus furnishing a

Vmeans of studying the relations between                                      and 9f)(a;), which, while

giving, perhaps only a rough approximation to the truth, may prove more

convenient than analytical or graphical methods.

II. One of the purposes which led to these investigations was the search

for a radiation of sufficient homogeneity to serve as an ultimate standard

of length. It will appear from the curves of cadmium that there are

three lines which may be used for this purpose. The red cadmium line

is almost ideally homogeneous, and will readily permit the estimation of
      ON SPECTROSCOPIC MEASDEEMENTS.                                  185

a change of phase in the interference fringes of one-hundredth of a fringe

in a total distance of 200 millimetres, or over 300,000 waves.
     Both the green and the blue lines are fairly well adapted for the pur-

pose, and will prove very valuable as checks. Each of these, however,
has a small companion, and it is necessary to know the effect of this in

altering the phase of the interference bands.

    If (j) be the fraction of a wave by which the position of a minimum is
shifted on account of the presence of the companion, a the number of

' periods ' in the difference of path, and r the ratio of the intensities,

then

                         1 r cos ZTTii

Thus, if r=l/4, is a maximum when a is about 1/3, and for this

we have, approximately,

                         0=--O4.

     This is the largest correction to be applied, and is negative if the
brighter line has the greater wave-length. It is theoretically possible by
this means to determine, in case of an unequal double or a line unsym-
metrically broadened, whether the brighter side is toward the blue or the

red end of the spectrum.
     III. It has been argued that, even if all practical difficulties in making

large gratings could be removed, nothing further could be gained in
resolution of groups of spectral lines on account of the real width of the
lines themselves, caused by the lack of homogeneity in the radiations

which produce them. The results of the preceding investigations show

that, while this is very far from being true with present gratings, such a

limit undoubtedly exists. The accordance between the measured widths
of eighteen lines shows further that this broadening of lines in a rare gas
can be fully accounted for by the application of Doppler's principle to the
motion of the vibrating atoms in the line of sight, and, indeed, furnishes

what may be considered one of the most direct proofs of the kinetic

theory of gases.

     The form of the ultimate components of all the groups of lines thus

far examined is found to agree fairly well with an exponential curve,
<j^(a!)=e""°''°, which shows that the distribution of velocities cannot vary

widely from that demanded by Maxwell's theory.
     If the limit abovementioned were due solely to the motion of the

molecule, and the radiating substance could be rendered luminous while

its temperature was very low, it might be possible to observe interference

phenomena with a difference of path of many metres. But it must be

considered that, since every vibrating molecule is communicating its
energy to the ether in the form of light waves, its vibrations must
diminish in amplitude ; consequently the train of waves is no longer homo-
geneous, even though the vibrations remain absolutely isochronous, and

the result is a broadening of the line and limitation of the difference of

path at which interference is visible.

Fourth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. C.
    EoBERTS-AusTEN {Chairman), Sir F. Abel, Mr. E. Eiley, and
    Mr. J. Spiller, Professor J. W. Langlet, Mr. Gr. J. Snelus,
     Professor Tilden, and Mr. Thomas Turner {Secretary), appointed
     to consider the best method of establishing an International
    Standard for the Analysis of Iron and Steel. (Drawn up by

      the Secretary.)

In the previous report of this committee it was mentioned that four
out of the five proposed international standards had been prepared and
distributed as previously arranged, and that the work of the British

analysts was practically completed. Dumng the past year a meeting of

the British analysts has been held, and the analytical results have been
discussed. It was found that the agreement among these numbers was
good, more particularly so in view of the relatively small quantity of
material which could be supplied to each analyst, and it was decided fco
publish an account of the work of the British chemists so far as the
investigation has proceeded. This intention was communicated to
Professor Langley, as representing the American Committee, and received

his cordial approval. The results now communicated have therefore to
do only with the work of the British analysts and with the standards

Nos. I, 2, 3, and 4.

     It will be remembered that the analysts entrusted with the investiga-

tion in this country were as follows :

                                    Mr. A. H. Allen                  Sheffield,

                                         W. Jenkins                  Dowlais,

                                    G. S. Packer                     Glasgow,

                                    J. Pattmson                      Newcastle-on-Tyne,

                                    E. Riley                         London,

                                    J. E. Stead                      Middlesbrough,

                                    and the Royal School of Mines, London,

     Complete reports have been received from Messrs. Jenkins, Packer,

Pattinson, Riley, and Stead, while Mr. Allen, who was prevented by

other engagements from completely analysing the samples sent to him,
has forwarded a report on the determination of sulphur in iron and

steel

     Unfortunately, the analyst attached to the Royal School of Mines has
suffered from a long and serious illness, and his results have not been
completed. It has therefore been decided to dispense with his report,
and for the present the Royal School of Mines is represented by the

work of Mr. E. Riley, whose x'eputation as an analyst is so well known

and recognised.

    The report received from Mr. W. Jenkins gave the following values

as the results of his analyses :
                                    ·

ON THE ANALYSIS OF IRON AND STEEL.     187

These results aorree very fairly well with those of the other analysts,
with the exception of the carbon in Standard 3, which is 0'09 per cent,
higher than any of the other analysts returned. Unfortunately, Mr.

Jenkins, after a prolonged period of ill-healtli, died in May last, and hence

no check determination has been performed in this case. The Committee
desire to record their regret at the loss of an analyst who was so

courteous, so skilful, and so much respected. No account has been

received of the methods used by Mr. Jenkins, except references in a letter
to the Secretary, which indicate that the silicon was determined by the
sulphuric acid method, and checked by the use of nitric and sulphuric

--acids the sulphur by an evolution process, and the manganese by an

acetate separation and precipitation by bromine. The phosphorus was

weighed as phospho-molybdate.

combustion of the carbonaceous residue in a stream of oxygen. Cupric

chloride was first prepared by roasting copper scale in a muffle, dissolving

in pure hydrochloric acid, and passing chlorine into the solution to

convert the whole into the cupric condition. To a concentrated solution

of the cupric chloride so prepared, 10 per cent, of sodium chloride

was added, and the solution so obtained, which is distinctly acid, is

employed for dissolving the steel. The separated carbon was collected

on an asbestos filter, and burned in a glass tube with pure recently

--ignited oxide of copper.
     Sulphur and FhospJiorus. The steel was oxidised by pure nitric acid

(sp. gr. 1'40), redistilled in Mr. Riley's laboratory, evaporated to

di'yness, heated, dissolved in pure hydrochloric acid (also redistilled in

the laboratory), and the silica separated; the excess of hydrochloric acid

evaporated off until only just sufficient acid was left to keep the iron in

solution. The sulphur was precipitated by barium chloride, allowed to

stand twenty-four hours, and weighed as BaS04. The filtrate from the

determination of sulphur was reduced by addition of sulphide of sodium,

the precipitated barium sulphate was filtered off, and the phosphorus

precipitated as basic perphosphate of iron by boiling with ammonium

acetate. If there is not sufficient ferric oxide present, a little bromine is

added. The precipitate is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, citric acid is
added, then excess of ammonia and a small quantity of ' magnesia mix-

ture.' After standing twenty- four hours the precipitate is filtered off and

--weighed as Mg,2P207.
     Manganese. The iron was separated as basic ferric acetate, the

Sixth Report of the Cotiimittee, consisting of Professor W, A.
     TiLDEN and Professor H. E. Armstrong (Secretary), appointed

     for the purpose of investigating Isomeric Naphthalene Deriva-

    tives. {Drawn up by Professor Armstrong.)

It was stated in the last report that Mr. Rossiter and the writer had
devoted much time to the study of the dibromonaphthalenes, but that the

results were not sufficiently complete to render their publication desirable
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

an account of the work contemplated in this passage was communicated

to the Chemical Society late in the year (cf. ' C.S. Proceedins's,' 1891

p. 182).

In this communication data were given which suffice to characterise

and diffisrentiate^/ii;e of the isomeric dibromonaphthalenes, i.e., the 1 : 4,
1 : 4', 1 : 3, 1 : 2', and 1 : .3' modifications. The action of bromine on
a- and ^-dibromonaphthalene was also described, and the nature of the

complex product formed on c/i-brominating naphthalene, which has occu-

pied the attention of so many observers, was finally determined, it being
shown to consist of 1 : 4 dibromonaphthalene (m.p. 82-83°) mixed

with the 1 : 4' isomeride (m.p. 132°).

    When naphthalene is dibrominated, 1 : 4 dibromonaphthalene is the
major product, so much so that this modification crystallises out in an

almost pni-e state from the solution of the crude product in alcohol. It

has been stated by Darmstaedter and Wichelhaus that when naphthalene-

a-sulphonic acid is bromiuated a product is obtained which on crystal-
lisation from alcohol first affords 1 : 4' dibromonaphthalene, the remainder

of the product melting at 68-70°, and resembling that obtained from

naphthalene. It therefore seemed probable that, whereas naphthalene

yields chiefly 1 : 4 dibromonaphthalene, the a-snlphonic acid yields chiefly

the 1 : 4' derivative, and that consequently the acid radicle exercises a
marked influence in determining the entrance of bromine into the un-

substituted nucleus (cf Report for 1886), an influence much greater

than that of bromine towards sulphuric acid, as bromonaphthalene yields

little but the 1 : 4 acid when sulphonated. Darmstaedter and Wichelhaus'

experiments have been repeated by the writer, and the accuracy of this

conclusion  confirmed                                                                                                    a  very considerable  amount of  1:4' bromosul-
                                                                  ;

phonic acid is formed on brominating naphthalene-sulphonic acid, 1 4:

dibromonaphthalene being quite a minor product.

On comparing the dibromo-products obtained from naphthalene with

the dichloro-products, an nnusual divei^gence is apparent ; there can be

no doubt, however, that this is attributable to the extreme instability of

bromine addition compounds of naphthalene. The dichloronaphthalenes

are, in fact, products of the withdrawal of 2HC1 from the tetrachloride,

while the dibromonaphthalenes are products of the action of bromine on

bromonaphthalene, and hence it is that the 1 : 3 modification, which is

the chief product of chlorination, is absent from the product of bromination.

When the conditions are similar the difference in behaviour of naphtha-

lene towards chlorine and bromine is of the ordinary character, and such

as was to be expected                                                                                                    thus  when  a-chloronaphthalene is chlorinated by
                                                                                                                      ;

means of SOoCl., at such a temperature (100-180°) as to prevent the

persistence of an addition compound, it yields pure 1 : 4 dichloronaph-

thalene and no trace of the 1 : 3 isomeride, which is the principal pro-

duct of the hydrolysis of naphthalene tetrachloride. /3-Chloronaphthalene

in like manner yields a mixture of the 1 : 2 and 1 : 2' derivatives. The

results of a series of experiments on the formation of chlorinated naph-

thalenes at high temperatures by means of SO2CI2 and similar chlorinating

agents which the writer and Dr. Wynne are engaged in carrying out

will be given  on a subsequent  occasion they                                    desire,  however,  here  to
                                                                              ;

recognise the assistance which they have received from Mr. Jenks.

Finally, it may be mentioned that Mr. Rossiter and the writer, having

repeated Meldola's experiments on the bromonitronaphthylamines, have

been led to interpret this author's results in a manner somewhat different

from that originally adopted by him, but in accordance with the results

of more modern enquiries (cf. ' C.S. Proceedings,' 1891, p. 186; Meldola,

'C.S. Trans.,' 1892, p. 766).

   A comprehensive survey of the very numerous recorded facts shows

that the ' laws of substitution ' in the naphthalene series are in the

main easy to decipher, and pervaded by a few veiy simple principles.

The writer and Dr. Wynne hope during the coming year to discuss these

in a comprehensive memoir, dealing with the investigation which they

have conjointly carried on now during over six years. It is perhaps not

undesirable to state that no single fact has yet been recorded serving to

support the view advocated by Claus, that the structure of naphthalene

is unsymmetrical. Whatever its exact inner structure may be, the two

nuclei of naphthalene must be represented alike.

     and Mr. H. Gr. Madan, appointed for continuing the Biblio-

     graphy of Spectroscopy.

The collection of titles of spectroscopic papers has been continued
during the year, but as Mr. Madan is not now residing in Oxford, he has

not been able to verify all the references.
     Mr. Nagel has undertaken some portion of the work, and he is pro-

posed as a member of the Committee in place of Professor Reinold, who

wishes to retire.

     Action of Light on the Hydracids of the Halogens in presence
      of Oxygen.

A LARGE amount of work has been done during the past year, but the

Committee feel that the results obtained cannot at this stage be profitably
laid before the Section. They hope, however, to be able to present a

detailed report to the Association at the next meeting.

ON THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SOLUTION.  261

Sixth Report of the Comiinittee, consisting of Professor W. A.

     TiLDEN, Professor H. McLeod, Mr. S. U. Pickering, Professor

    W. Eamsay and S. Young, and Dr. A. E. Leeds, and Dr. W. W.

     J. NicoL {Secretary), appointed for the purpose of reporting
     on the Bibliography of Solution.

The Committee report that considerable progress has been made during
the past year. One new journal has been completely searched, and the

others have been brought up to date. The work has so far advanced
that the question of publication will soon have to be considered. The
titles already collected now number over 1,200, including cross references,
and are drawn from the leading scientific journals at home and abroad.

It will perhaps be desirable to publish a first instalment, as the subject of

Solution is now attracting so much attention that such a bibliography
would be of great use. The Committee desire reappointment.

Sixth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. A.
     TiLDEN, Professor W. Eamsay, and Dr. W. W. J. Nicol (Secre-

      tary), appointed for the purpose of investigating the Nature of

     Solution. (Draiun up by Dr. NicoL.)

I. The Atomic Volumes of Carbon and Hydrogen in Organic Substances
                                       when in Dilute Solution.

In 1883 it was observed that the molecular volumes of the sodium
salts of formic, acetic, and butyric acid showed in dilute solution au
approximately constant difference, giving 14'3 as the volume of the

group CHj (Nicol, ' Phil. Mag.,' August, 1883, p. 131).

      This point appeared wortliy of further examination, inasmuch as, if
dissolved substances are under comparable conditions when the solution
is sufficiently dilute, as seems most probable from a consideration of the
physical properties of such dilute solutions, then the apparent molecular

volumes in dilute solution could be compared in the same way as the
molecular volumes at the boiling-point, and thus the atomic volumes
of the various elements could be determined with greater ease and

certainty than at the boiling-point.

    A series of preliminary experiments with the commoner compound

·ethers have been completed, the x'Psults of which will shortly be published,

and these are so encouraging that the Committee have decided to go fully
into the subject, and as the preparation, purification, and analysis of a
sufficiently large number of compounds for the purpose of this research
is necessarily long and tedious, the Committee will be glad to receive the
assistance of members of Section B. who have suitable compounds, the
composition of which is guaranteed by analysis. Such substances must
be soluble in water, alcohol, benzol, xylol, ether, or chloroform. The
secretary will gratefully acknowledge the receipt of specimens (three to
five grams) sent to him at Mason College, Birmingham.
262 REPORT-- 1892.

                         II. Molecular Volume of Iodine in Sohition.

     It is well known that the coloar of solutions of iodine varies with the
 nature of the solvent from dark brown in the case of aqueous solution of

 potassium iodide, through red in benzol to violet in the case of carbon

 disulphide.

      From the colour of the last-named solution it has generally been

 assumed that in it the iodine molecule is diatomic, as in the state of gas.
 Within the last few years several attempts have been made to ascertain
 what is the composition of the iodine molecule in various solvents, the
 method employed being that of Raoult, depending on the effect of the
 dissolved iodine on the vapour pressure of the solvent.

      The Committee have commenced the examination of this subject from
 the standpoint of the apparent molecular volume of iodine in various
solvents, and considerable progress has been made with the work.
Aqueous potassium iodide, alcohol, ether, chloroform, benzol, xylol, and

carbon disulphide having been examined, it is intended to considerably
extend this list of solvents, and the Committee hope that they will be in
a position to report fally on this subject to the next meeting of the
Association, as they intend also to fully examine the point by the method
of vapour pressures.

     The Committee desire reappointment without grant.

Report (provisional) of a Committee, consisting 0/ Professor H. E.

     Armstroxg, Professor W. R. Dunstan, Mr. C. H. Bothamlev,
     and Mr. W. A. Shenstone {Secretary), appointed to investigate
     the formation of Haloids from pure Tuaterials. {Drawn up hy
     Mr. W. A. Shenstone.)

DuiUNG the past year two papers have been read before the Chemical
Society on subjects connected with the work undertaken by the Com-

mittee.'

     The results of further experiments with mercury and chlorine tend to
confirm the opinion expressed in a previous report that the interaction
of these two elements is greatly influenced by the presence of one or
more other substances, and they show that water is almost certainly one

of these active substances.

    Up to the present _2J?()-e chlorine has not been obtained. But W. A.

Shenstone and C. R. Beck have recently found that by igniting platinic

chloride in excess of hydrochloric acid platinous chloride may be obtained

in such a condition that the chlorine liberated from it by ignition in
vacuo is considerably more free from impurities than the prodnct of
igniting platinous chloride prepared in the ordinary way, and they think

it possible that by this method pure chlorine may perhaps ultimately be

obtained.

     They have also found that liquefied chlorine, which usually contains a

small proportion of hydrogen chloride, but is almost free from other
impurities, can be purified to some extent by fractional evaporation.

     Messrs. Shenstone and Beck have been occupied with the purifi-
cation of phosphoi'ic oxide, and have succeeded in preparing several
samples of that substance in a crystalline state, and free from the lower
oxides, by a process of oxidation with subsequent fractional sublimation of

the oxidised product.

     Some experiments have also been made with, hydrogen chloride and

oxygen, the results of which decidedly suggest that the interaction of
these bodies in the dry state is dependent npon either the relative masses
in which they are present or on the pressure at which they act. Mr.
Shenstone proposes to repeat and to extend what has been done in this

directioQ.

     The Committee desire to be reappointed, and ask that a grant of 201.

may be made to them.

Report (provisional) of a Committee, consisting of Professor H.

    McLeod, Professor W. Eamsay, Mr. W. A. Shenstone (Secretary),
     and Mr. J. Tudor Cundall, appointed to investigate the Influence
     of the Silent Discharge of Electricity on Oxygen and other

      Gases.

The Committee are glad to be able to report that the work undertaken is

proceeding in a satisfactory manner. After a year of continuous work,
in which they have had the assistance of Mr. Martin Priest, the funda-
mental difficulties of the research have apparently been overcome, and
several interesting observations have been made.

     As, however, only a small part of the work has yet been done, they
desire to defer presenting a detailed report till the next meeting of the

Association.

     The Committee, therefore, ask to be reappointed.

Report {provisional) of the Committee, consisting of Professor

    Perkin, Professor W. J. Russell, Captain W. de W. Abney,
     and Professor W. Stroud, on the Action of Light upon Dyed
     Colours. (Drawn up by Professor J. J. Hummel.)

As mentioned in the last report, it was decided to compare first the

fastness to light of the various red colouring matters. During the
past year wool and silk patterns have been dyed with the technical

prodncts, and are now being exposed to light. The results, however,
will not be ready till the next meeting of the Association, when both

dyed and exposed patterns will be exhibited.
     The grant of lOZ. voted at the last Meeting has been more than

expended in the erection of an additional exposing case, and in the
purchase of a colorimeter, and also for books in which to mount the
dyed and faded patterns.

 Since your reporter was appointed at the initiation of your Committee in
 1872 he has received most valuable assistance from past and present
members of the Committee in preparing the annual report, both as
regards original observations made by them, original data collected from
 others by them, and by general hints and suggestions received from

them. As regards the first two heads, many valuable communications

 have beeia too important to absoib into the general report, and have been
 given in separate appendices under the individual member's name. But
 your reporter is compelled to point out that the arrangement by which a

 member of the Committee took personal charge of a portion of England

 and Wales, which he instituted with a considerable measure of success in
 1873, has year by year become less operative, and each succeeding annual
 report has contained less and less matter contributed by the Committee.
 The last communication received was in 1889, and is embodied in the
 fifteenth report. Since then your reporter has had no assistance from,
 your Committee, and the sixteenth, seventeenth, and the present
 eighteenth reports have been wholly compiled from information col-
 lected by him and subsequently approved by the Committee at their
 annual meeting without alteration.

ON THE CHICCLATION OF UNDERGROUND WATEES.  265

     U^nder these circumstances your reporter bas reluctantly come to the
·opinion that it is unadvisable to continue to issue reports under the high
·authority of a committee of enquiry of the British Association which are
in reality the work of one person, for whose accuracy or otherwise the
Committee (and indirectly the Association) are made responsible
reports which, however cai-efuUy prepared from trustworthy information
from all parts of England and Wales, cannot possibly have the same
value as when each local detail received can be checked by a local repi'e-
sentative of the Committee, as was the case when your reporter first
divided the country into districts, in each of which your Committee had
an able representative.

      These results have been brought about by various causes : (1) Losses
·by death, including Mr. Binney, F.R.S., Professor Harkness, F.R.S.,
Mr. Mylne, F.R.S., Mr. Molyneux, F.G.S.

      (2) Lcsses through illness, including Professor Prestwioh, F.R.S.,
Dr. Crosskey, F.C.S., Mr. Plant, F.G.S., Mr. Pengelly, F.R.S.

      (3) Losses through change of residence and other causes, including
·Sir Frederick Bramwell, F.R.S., Mr. I. Roberts, F.R.S., Mr. Howell,
P.G.S., and other able observers.

      (4) Losses through members of the Committee contributing the in-
formation they have collected to the local societies, where they happen
to live, and where the matter is locally printed, and which, in the opinion
of your reporter, is the chief cause of the present dearth of information
.communicated by them to your reporter; for probably at no time were
our underground sources of water supply being more constantly tapped,
and at no time were boring contractors more willing to give thoroughly
intelligent accounts of the work carried out by them.

      Local publication has the advantage of giving the information quickly
to the local district, where it is of direct use for matters of detail, to
those on the spot, but is nearly useless for general reference and study,
·as local ti'ansactions of this class are constantly found to be absent from
public libraries, while their publication and concentration in the annual
volume of the British Association have been of great value for nearly
twenty years, and have largely given an incentive to the use of under-
ground water by pointing out its purity on the one hand and the absence
of law costs to obtain it on the other. Before finally closing the enquiry
your reporter suggests and your Committee approve that it would be
advisable to publish in a connected form the varied information given in

the past eighteen reports. In many of them the information is given in

-a more or less crude form, and the details of borings are given from year
to year as they progressed in depth, and details of one set of works

are carried on through several reports, and many of these are out of

print.

      It is therefore suggested that the Committee be reappointed with the
usual grant of 51. ; that the Secretary be requested to draw up a final
report embodying the whole of the facts obtained classified in counties
that it is advisable that the report in question should be issued and
sold as a separate publication. It would be with peculiar fitness that
your Committee should meet and present its final report, after its twenty
years' labours, at Nottingham, which rejoices in a magnificent supply of
the purest water derived from underground sources.

      Valuable information has been received by your reporter since the
last meeting from Dr. Parsons, of the Local Government Board ; Messrs.

man), Eev. IE. Jones {Secretary), Drs. J. Evans and J. Gr.

GrAESON, and Messrs. W. Pengelly, E. H. Tiddeman, and J. J.

Wilkinson, appointed to complete the investigation of the Cave

at Elholton, near Skipton, in order to ascertain whether Remains

of      ManPalceolithic  occur in the   Lower     Cave     Earth,        {Drawn

up by Eev. E. Jones.)

The exploration of this interesting cave was continued from the month
of September 1891 to January last. The work excavated and examined
has been extensive and a much lower level reached, but no new features
of any value have been obtained. The difficulty and expense of working
increase with the depth. Large blocks of stone and a stalagmitic floor
two to three feet in thickness were broken up by the aid of gunpowder.
The fissure is now fifty-five feet in depth from what was the floor of the
chamber when the cave was discovered. It has narrowed considerably,
being now only four to six feet in thickness.

     At the west end of the fissure the material continues to be crowded
with bones of Alpine hares and a few bones of bears and foxes, but the
rest of the fissure is now barren, and is composed of soft adhesive clay
resting on a layer of sand and gravel. This seems to indicate that we
are near the bottom of the fissure and pothole, and that our work will
be finished when this is reached.

    The age of these lower deposits has yet to be ascertained. No bones

of man, or of the horse or dog, animals domesticated by Neolithic men,
have been found in them, while the bones of bear, absent in the upper
layer, are abundant in the lower. The red deer and boar are found in
both layers, but the reindeer only in the clay layer. Angular pieces of

limestone are imbedded in the clay, but no boulders or scratched stones
have been found in it.

     The whole deposit is post-Glacial, but a great length of time must

have intervened before Neolithic man dwelt in the cave and buried his

dead there. The accumulation of forty feet of ossiferous material with a

series of stalagmitic floors some three feet thick before the advent of the

Neolith must represent a long period. No indications of Palceolithic man

have been found.

     The ' finds ' require tabulating ; many bones are still undetermined, and
various abnormal bones, both human and animal, should be noted. The

Committee desire therefore to be reappointed to prepare a final report,
but do not apply for a grant.

       ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND, WALES, AND IRELAND 267

Tiventieth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor J.

    Pkestwich, Dr. H. W. Crosskey, Professors W. Boyd Dawkins,
    T. McK. Hughes, and T. Gr. Eonney and Messrs. C. E. De
    Eance, p. F. Kendall, W. Pengelly, J. Plant, and K. H.

     Tiddeman, appointed for the purpose of recording the Position^

    Height above the Sea, Lithological Characters, Size, and Origin
     of the Erratic Blocks of England, Wales, and Ireland, reporting
    other mailers of interest connected ^vith the same, and taking
    measures for their preservation. {Draion up by Dr. Crosskey,

      Secretary.)

The researches of this Committee have been carried on during the past

--year with the assistance of the Yorkshire Boulder Committee the

Glaciahsts' Association (formerly the N.W. of England Boulder Com-

--mittee, and whose contributions are marked*) and several independent

observers.

     In previous reports the facts obtained by an exhaustive survey of the
erratics of the Midland Counties have been classified, and a series of
valuable results has thus been established.

     It has not as yet been possible to extend the same kind of treatment

to other districts on account of the constant accumulation of new

material, such as that of which the report of this year contains fresh

instalments.

     The facts discovered are, however, rapidly showing that they are
capable of orderly arrangement, and it cannot be doubted that the dis-
tribution and gi'ouping of the erratic blocks of Great Britain will thr-ow
light on some of the most intricate questions of Glacial Geology.

     The following reports have been received :

                        The Yorkshire Boulder Committee,

  Chairman : Professor L. C. Miall, F.B.8., F.G.S., F.L.S., Yorkshii-e

                                                    College, Leeds.

     The Yorkshire Boulder Committee have comparatively few eri'atic
blocks to report this year, nearly all the known examples having been
previously recorded. This being the case, they have been at liberty to
make important advances in their methods of research and to devise new
modes of operation.

     During the year their attention has been mainly given to maturing a
scheme for the careful and exact exploration of special glacial districts
not hitherto adequately investigated. They began with the valley of the
River Calder, including its tributaries, from its source to its junction
with the River Aire, near to Castleford, This valley has been subdivided
into geographical areas, each of which is now placed under the supervision
of a sub-committee. The results of this exploration they hope to embody
in their next annual report. They intend also to present a similar
report on the Sedbergh, Garsdale, and Dentdale district, now being
investigated after the same fashion.

      During the past year a sub-committee has been engaged upon the

preparation of a new and enlarged glacial map of Yorkshii'e on a scale of
                                                                                                                                   -- -- ----

(205) 5 ft. 9 in. X 5 ft. 3 in. x 4 ft. 3 in. ; approximate weight 10 tons ; sub-
             angular; top somewhat irregular, but on being turned over the under-

          side was found to be polished and flattened with rounded edges. It

          was imbedded in sand, which continued over a yard below it ; but,

          on a careful examination of an irregularity on the underside of the

          boulder, clay was found imbedded therein, so that it appears to have

       . been originally deposited in boulder clay, and that its present position

          is due to denuding agency. It has probably rolled from a neigh-

          bouring hill-top. (Immediately underneath it was a boulder of

          rhyolite about 6 in. x 4 in., rounded.) The direction of the longest

          axis as it lay was 115° E. of N. (W.N.W. by W. to E.S.E. by E.)

          height above O.D. about 550 ft. The upper surface of the boulder

          was level with the ground. A photograph was taken of it before dis-

          turbance, and afterwards of the underside, showing polished and

          flattened part ; no distinct scratches were visible, having probably

          been     obliterated  by  the  weathering                                                                  andesite with  epidote,                                                                                                            weathered,

--276 REPORT 1892.

     Opposite Hale Lighthouse

         (13G) 84 in. x 30 in. x 43 in. ; andesite.

     Mr. Arthur R. Dwei-ryhouse catalogues the following boulders in

order, beginning at the Hale Head and working round to the Decoj

Marsh.

     Owing to the large number of boulders in so short a distance (about
two miles), and the scarcity of fixed object by which to indicate their

whereabouts, it has been impossible to give the exact position of each, so

that they are merely catalogued in order, showing in the number column
the position of any objects which may act as landmarks.

     The great bulk of the boulders are evidently not in situ, having rolled
down from the clay cliffs, and are at present lying in the river sand.

     At a point about midway between the Head and the Rifle Butts there
is little sand, and a number of boulders are seen in situ embedded in the
surface of the clay, and these, together with a number of smaller ones

m(also situ) not enumerated in the report, show great regularity as

regards the direction of their axes and striae.
     It will further be noticed that, as one moves round the shore, the

strigs become further and further from the north and south line.
     This conforms to the observed direction of the striiB on the rocks at

Farnworth Church and Runcorn Gap, points still further up the river, at

the last of which the direction is E. and W.

288 KEPORT-- 1892.

On the S. side of these hills, down to the stream Sfcroan-a-Vreck,

which runs from near the foot of North Barrule to Corna Bridge, I have
noticed only three granite boulders. They are in a line with the Corna

School, as if they had come across the river there, not far from the place

where the other larger boulders are on Ballasaig. One of these

1 ft.  xl6 in.  ft.  6 in. xlO in.      is near  the      farmhouse  at  Magher-a-breck  ;

another, at Ballaglass,  is             X2 ft. X 2 ft.    10 in. ;   and the  third, to

the Westward of the Corna School, on Booley Vett, is 10 in. x 8 in. X

6 in. The other boulders on these lands are grit and vein-quartz,

chiefly angular.

   --Oil the S. side of Nortli Barrule. Below the Shepherd's cottage are aV

group of grits, vai-ying in size from G ft. downward, lying in a mass of

    Down Ballaglass, in an easterly direction, on Thalloo Loash, is a*

group of some 300 blocks of the micaceous grit, varying in size up to
6 ft. X 4 ft. X 3 ft., and one granite 2 ft. x 2 ft. X 10 in.

     Between the stream of Stroan-a-Vreck and Corna Stream, in the
plantation of Ballaglass above Corna Mill, are some hundreds of blocks

of grit and vein-quartz. Many of these have been collected at the junc-
tion of the stream. Below the bridge, down the side of Rhenab, are also

a large number of angular blocks of grit varying in character, some

micaceous, while others bear a resemblance to granite.

     These blocks appear to have travelled in an easterly direction, and
somewhat downhill to their present positions.

    Below here a patch of boulder-clay is exposed. On the lands of

Rhenab and Corrany ai'e scattered blocks of grit-quartz, vein-quartz, and

--clay slate. Some of these have been carried in a south-easterly direction.

One of the largest 10 ft. x C ft. x 5 ft., an oval boulder of grit, lies in
Rhenab Glen.

     One in the Corrany, 3 ft. X 2 Xft. 6 in. 8 in., has an impression
resembling a Lycopod on the flat side.

    On the hills above these lands, from Corna river to Lonan, are vein-
quartz and clay slate, many undisturbed.

     In the granite district of the Dhoon blocks have been carried in a
southerly-south-westerly direction, across Lonan to Onchan, and have
been traced from Agneish by Lonan Church to Baldrine and down

Groudale Valley.

 Thr Committee have to report j^radaal progress in the registration of the

 type specimens of British fossils, but regret that it is still impossible to
 begin the tabulation of the results. Several important lists have been
 received daring the year, and the printed catalogues of the collections at

' Cambridge (Woodwardian Museum), Bath, and Brighton, referred to in
 the last report, have now been issued. The lists, already at the disposal
 of the Committee, are enumerated below, and a special effort will shortly
 be made to obtain the remainder. The Keeper of the Department of

 Geology in the British Museum is making arrangements for the cata-
 loguing of the types in the national collection, and when this task is

 completed the Committee will be the better able to consider the most
 satisfactory method of dealing with the wliole of the material.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor James
     Geikie {Chairman), Dr. Tempest Andersox, Dr. Valentine
     Ball, Mr. James E. Bedford, Professor T, G. Bonney, Professor

    W. Boyd Dawkins, Mr. James W. Davis, Mr. Edmund J. Gar-

    S. Keid, Mr. R. H. Tiddeman, Mr. W, W. Watts, Mr. Horace B.
    Woodward, and Mr. Osmund W. Jeffs {Secretary), to arrange
    for the collection, preservation, and systematic registration of

     Photographs of Geological Interest in the United Kingdom.
    {Draivn up by the Secretary.)

In presenting their third report your Committee desire to observe that
although the number of photographs collected during the past year
shows a decrease as compared with the two previous years, yet a greater
proportion are of high scientific interest, and illustrate features of real
geological importance. At first it was unavoidable that a considerable
number of those received were only ' geological ' photographs in a general

sense. As explained in the last report,' it was not desired to restrict
this term too greatly ; but without some limit the collection would cease
to represent typical geological features of the United Kingdom, and
become simply a collection of landscape photographs.

     The number of photographs received and registered from the date of
the last report (August, 181»1) to the end of June, 1892, is 112, bringing
the total contents of the collection to 700. Owing to the early meeting
of the Association this year, the list was closed before a complete twelve
months' work could be recorded, and results have not yet reached the
Committee from several of the societies which have undertaken local sur-
veys for geological purposes. The following summary shows the geo-

graphical areas represented in the collection :

    An fixhibition of geological photographs was arranged in Section C

at the Cardiff meeting.

    Your Committee met at Cardiff and discnssed details of the work.

It was decided, on the recommendation of Dr. Tempest Anderson, to adopt

a standard mount of uniform size for preserving the photographs. The

style of mount adopted (known as tlie Zaehusdorf ' self-binding' mount)

is 15^ xl2 inches, and is fitted with a special guard perforated at reo-ular

intervals for binding. This is of sufficient size to hold one whole-plate,

or two half-plate, or four quarter-plate views. The views when mounted

may be readily arranged in any desired order, and additions or substitu-
Ations efi'ected.
                                                           supply of mounts has been obtained, and the collection

is now in process of mounting and arrangement. Forms containino-

descriptive details of the photographs are affixed to the mounts. It has been

arranged to supply these standard mounts to donors of photographs who

are willing                                 to       mount their     own  views                              otherwise  the  cost  of  mountino-
                                                                                                          ;

will fall on the Committee. It is found necessary to have the photographs

properly mounted, not only for greater convenience of reference, but also

to preserve them from possible injury by handling. The value of the

collection is already considerable and will increase as it grows in num-

bers.

    A new circular (No. 4) was issued by the Committee in November, and

addi-essed to a large number of geologists and photographers (both profes-

sional and amateur), and also to scientific and photographic societies in all

parts of the kingdom. While the Committee much appreciate the help

that has been afforded fi'om so many quarters, they would urge upon

geologists generally the desirability of promptly assisting the scheme in

order that their work may be proceeded with as quickly as possible. The

Committee are indebted to the editors of 'Nature,' the ' Literary World,'

'English Mechanic,' 'Photographic News,' 'Amateur Photographer/

' Globe,' ' Illustrated London News,' and other periodicals for givino-

prominence to their scheme for collecting and registering geoloo-ical

photographs.

     The use of photographic processes for illustrating works on geology
i.s becoming more frequent. Daring excursions of the Geologists' Associa-

tion, several photographs have been taken by members from which ' tint-
blocks ' have been made to illustrate papers in the ' Proceedings ' of the
Association. In several counties active efforts are being made by local
bodies for photographic surveys, and it is hoped that important geological
phenomena may be made a feature of these surveys, and that copies of
such photographs will be added to the collection formed by your Com-

jnittee.

    Reference was made in the last report to the appointment of a Com-

mittee on photographs by the Geological Society of America. The plan

of this Committee is laid practically on the same basis as that of the

British Association, the objects being (I) to make a photo-geological survey

of  America                                          (2) to exhibit  the  collection at the annual                           meetings of the
                                                  ;

Society                                     and      (.3)  to publish a register of photographs received.                              The first
                                         ;

register for 1890 contains a list of 293 photographs.

    Tour Committee deem it satisfactory that steps are thus being taken

to carry out their own object in other countries.

    Mr. C. J. Alford, F.G.S., mining engineer (of Suffolk House, Lawrence

Ponntney Hill, London), offered a series of geological photographs of

subjects abroad, which the Committee were unable to accept owmo- to

their operations bein? confined to the British islands. At the desire of

Professor W. Boyd-Dawkins, F.R.S., the information is now given, as it
may be of interest to many members of the Association.

      It has been suggested that, in order to save trouble in printing for
the purpose of supplying copies to applicants, donors of photographs,

should make arrangements with local photographers, to whom their nega-
tives may be entrusted, to execute orders for prints or lantern slides.

 This information is added in one case in the present report, and will be
 continued in future lists whenever a similar arrangement has been

 effected.

      Your Committee have kept in view the question of the disposal of the
 photographs and the proposed publication of a selection of approved sub-
 jects, but recommendations on both these points are still deferred until
 it is seen to what extent the collection is likely to reach. They respect-

 fully request reappointment with the object of further proceeding with

the work, in order that the collection may not be too partial or incom-
plete, but may represent as nearly as possible all important geological

 formations exhibited in the British Islands. Their special efforts, daring
 next year, will, it is proposed, be directed to obtaining photographs from
 the numerous localities not already included in the published lists. In this,

 attempt, valuable assistance may be rendered by officers of the Geological

 Survey and local geologists by sending to the Secretary of the Committee
early intimation of the opening of new sections showing features worthy
 of record by photography, in addition to particulars of old sections of
 typical importance, and localities of geological interest which havo
 hitherto escaped record, or of which sketches and diagrams only have
 been published. It is hoped, too, that delegates of the Corresponding
 Societies and the officers of local Field Clubs or other bodies will bring the

 scheme before their members, and thus materially aid in making known

 the objects of the Committee.
      Certain instructions have been drawn up, in order to secure uniformity

 of action, copies of which will be supplied on application to any member

 of the Committee. It is understood, however, that these are to be con-
 sidered merely as a guide, and that all suitable photographs illustrating
 natural features of geological interest will be accepted for registration
 even if not complying with the whole of the recommendations stated in
 the circular, a copy of which is appended :

                   Instructions for the Collection of Geological I'hotograplis.

       Photographs are desired illustrative of characteristic rock exposures, especially
  those of a typical character or temporary nature; important boulders; localities
  affected by denudation, or where marked physiographical changes are in operation ;
  raised beaches ; old sea-clitTs and other conspicuous instances of marine erosion
  characteristic river-valleys or escarpments, and the like ; glacial plienomena, such as
  rooJies moutonw'es, moraines, drums and kames, or any natural views of geological
  interest. Photographs of microscopical sections and tyi^ical hand-specimens of rocks
  are also admissible.

       I. The views should be taken under skilled geological direction, and the most
  typical views should be sectired in preference to general views. Societies are urged
  to form committees for the purpose of noting sections suitable to be photographed,
  and arranging such work as may be possible in each district. To this end it is
 anticipated that the services of many amateur photographers may be usefully brought

  into requisition.

       II. Size of 'phoiogn\^'\ recommended: 8i by G\ inches (' whole plate ') ; but this
  is optional. In view of the difficulty of carrying a heavy camera and plates, it is not

desired to exclude smaller views when these are well-defined and clear. In the case
·of small negatives, when sharp, an enlargement to whole-plate size is desirable for
the purpose of a place in the collection. The views should be printed by a permanent
process whenever practicable. Isochromatic plates are strongly recommended to be

"used.

     III. In order to preserve its scientific value, each photograph should be accom-

panied by as many of the following details as can be conveniently given. Forms for

this purpose will be supplied on application.

         (a) Name and position of section or locality.
          (6) Special features shown, with illustrative diagrams, when necessary.

                  (Further details may be given, if more convenient, on a separate tracing

                       attached to the photograph.)
          Cc) Height and length of section, and compass direction.

         Id) Name and address of photographer, or of the society under whose direction

                      the view is taken.

          ((?) Date when photographed.
          (/) Indication (where necessary) of direction of light and shade ; i.e., state

                      whether taken in. ' direct light ' or ' in shade.'

     IV. Each photograph sent in for registration should bear a heal number, and the
accompanying form should be numbered in accordance therewith.

     V. Photographs should be sent unmounted. Mounts of uniform size, with per-
forated edges for binding, to hold one whole-plate, two half-plate, or four quarter-
plate views, have been prepared, and a number will be forwarded, on application, to
ilonors of photographs who prefer to mount their own prints.

     VI. Lists of photographs, copies of photographic prints and information relative
thereto should be sent under cover to the Secretary to the Committee, at the earliest
posdhle date, in order to facilitate the work of registration.

                                                   (to JUNE, 1892.)

  --Note. This list contains the subjects of geological photographs,

copies of which have been received by the Secretary of the Committee
since the publication of the last report. Photographers are asked to
affix the registered numbers, as given below, to their negatives, for
convenience of future reference.

     Copies of any photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
either from the photographer direct or from the ofiBcers of the local
society under whose auspices the views were taken.

     The Committee in no case have assumed the copyright of photographs
registered, which is presumed to be held by the photographer.

     The price at which copies of photographs may be obtained depends

tipon the size of the print and local circumstances, over which the
Committee have no control.

Ninth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor T. Wilt-

     shire (^Chairm/xn), Dr. H. Woodward, and Professor T. Rupert

     Jones (^Secretary), on the Fossil Phyllopoda of the PalcKozoic

     Rocks. (Drawn up by Professor T. Rupert Jones.)

Eight reports by tliis Committee have been handed in and printed, the
last in 1890. Part I. of the ' Monograph on the British Fossil Phyllo-
poda,' by Professor T. Rnperfc Jones and Dr. H. Woodward, published
by the Palseontographical Society, contained twelve plates, illustrating
thirty-nine species, belonging to four genera of Phyllocarida [Ceratio-

caridce') therein described. Part II. of that Monograph is now finished,
                                                                                                                                                                                       .

          ON THE FOSSIL PHTLLOPODA OF THE PALAEOZOIC ROCKS. 299

and has five plates of twenty-eight species in seven genera (including

some of both the bivalve and the univalve Phyllocarida)

     The genera here treated of are Hymenocaris, Lingidocaris, Saccocaris,

Caryocaris, Apfychopsis, Peltocaris, Pimiocaris, and Discinocaris.

    I. Of Hymenocaris we know of only two species, both British, namely,
(1) H. vermicauda, Salter, very common in some beds of the Lingula-

flags in North Wales ; and (2) H. lata, Salter, represented by a unique
and distorted specimen from the same strata.

     II.  Of                                      L'ingulocaris                                                 there  ai'e  (1)  L.   lingulcecomes,                                  Salter                       (2)  L. sili-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

quiformis, Jones ; and (3) L. Salteriana, T. R. J. and H. W. These are

from the Cambrian of North Wales.

     III. Saccocaris major, Salter, from the Lingula-flags, and S. minor,

T. R. J. and H. W., from the Arenig series, are described and figured.

     IV. Caryocaris Wrightii, Salter, and the thinner C. Marrii, Hicks,

from the Skiddaw slates of Westmoreland, are fully treated of; and it is

suggested that the latter form is possibly due to a sexual difference.

     V. Of Aptychopsis we have recognised thirteen species, mostly

British : I. A, prima, Barrande, with its varieties longa and secunda, all

Bohemian. 2. A. Barrandeana, sp. nov., and its variety Irevior, nov.

W.3. A. cordiformis, sp. nov. 4. A. lata, sp. nov. 5. A. glabra, H.
6. A. Wilsoni, H. W. 7. A. Salteri, H, W. 8. A. LapwortU, H. W.

9. A. ovata, sp. nov. 10. A. suhquadrata, sp. nov. 11. A. angulata

(Baily). 12. A. ohlata, sp. nov.

     Nos. 5 and 8 are probably represented among the several figures of

various forms of ' Aptychopsis prima ' given by Barrande in his ' Syst.

Silur. Boliemp,' vol. i.. Supplement, 1872, plate xxxiii.

     Nos. 10 and 11 are fi'om the Silurian of Ireland; the others (excepting

No. 7, from South Wales) are from the Moffat series of South Scotland.

     VI. Three                                         species                                                  of Peltocaris         are  (1)  P.     aptyclioidcs,                                                     Salter
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

(2)  P. anatina, Salter                                                                                         (3) P. patula, sp. nov.
                                                                                                      ;

     Like Aptychopsis, Peltocaris is an Upper-Silurian British form, with

some representatives in the Middle Silurian.

     VII. Pimiocaris Lapworthi, Etheridge, jun., a rare Silurian form, is

known in Ayrshire and Westmoreland.

     VIII. Of the round subconical tests, undivided except by the tri-

angular nuchal notch, Discinocaris gives four species, all from the

Upper or Middle Silurian of South Scotland and Westmoreland : 1. D.

Browniana, H. W. 2. J), avails, sp. nov. 3. D. undulata, sp. nov.

4. D. gigas, H. W.

ON CRETACKOUS POLYZOA.  301

Report of the Comviittee, consisting of Dr. H. Woodward, Mr,
     Gr. R. Vine {Secretary), Professor 1'. Rupert Jones, and Dr. H. C.
     SoRBY, appointed for the completion of a report on the Creta-
    ceous Polyzoa. {Draivn up by the Secretary.)

                I. Upper- Cretaceous Polyzoa (British akea only).

In a previous report on Cretaceous Polyzoa ' I dealt with the strati-
graphical distribution of the fossils which had been found in the lower
beds of the Upper Cretaceous series, and in the Neocomian beds below.
Last year (1891), at the Cardiff Meeting of the British Association, I
contributed a paper on the Polyzoa of the Zones of the Upper Challc,^ in
which I referred to certain peculiarities of some of the Polyzoan fauna
derived from the British Senonian rocks, which had been noticed in

the course of my investigations. These peculiarities seemed to merit

something more than a passing remark, and I partly expressed an opinion
that, in all probability, if the different zones of the Chalk were carefully

worked, and the Polyzoan fauna studied, much light might be thrown

upon the zonal distribution of Polyzoa in Cretaceous rocks, both British
and Continental. In the present report I have endeavoured to carry out

my original design, and I believe I have now catalogued all the British
species which have been recorded up to date. Had it not been for the

willing help of personal friends, this would have been impossible. To

Mr. Gamble, of New Brompton, Kent, I tender my most sincere thanks

for placing before me his fine collection of Chatham Polyzoa, and for the

free gift of fragments derived from the Chalk and from the ' Flint-meal,''
·which have proved to be .of the highest value in the compilation of this

report. By means of this help the Chatham Chalk has been worked so
thoroughly that this section of my labours must be regarded as the type

of all the others that will follow.

      In the report already referred to I drew attention to the fact that in
Mr. Etheridge's lists of genera (with specific indications), published in the
second volume of Professor Phillips' ' Manual of Geology,' ^ only sixty-one
British species are recorded as derived from the whole of the Upper
Cretaceous rocks. This is sixteen more than were given by Professor
Morris in the ' Catalogue of British Fossils ' (ed. 1854). In Table VIIL,
p. 333, vol. ii. of Professor Prestwich's 'Geology,' 1888, the 'Polyzoars'
from the Chalk, Upper Greensand, and Gault are tabulated as ' 80,' or
about the same ' specific ' proportion as given by Mr. Etheridge, ' 59 genera
and 114 species,' if we leave out the 34 species found in the Neocomian
rocks. This, then, as there have not been any additions to the Cretaceous
Polyzoan fauna subsequent to those dates, must be taken as the status of
our knowledge since the issue of the admirable ' Catalosjue of British
Fossils ' by Professor Morris in 1854.

     Of public collections of Upper- Chalk Polyzoa I am acquainted with a
few only. The fine series in the British Museum (Natural History) I have

recently examined, but it is nov/ undergoing rearrangement. The series

contains Lonsdale's types, besides which there are selections from tha

cabinets of Mr. Woodward (Norfolk Polyzoa), Dr. Bowerbank, and
others. There is also a good collection in the Museum of Practical
Geology, Jermyn Street, derived from several British localities.

      In the ' Paleontologie Fran9aise : Terrains Cretaces,' vol. v., 1850-52,
d'Orbigny gives the sum-total of the Senonian Bryozoa of France as

follows (p. 1082) :--

      Bryozoaires Centrifugines (Cyclosfomatai'), genera 115 ; species 300.
                           Cellulines ((7/iei7osio?)ia/a .''), genera 54; species 547.

                                 ,,

     In Dr. Friedrich von Hagenow's ' Die Bryozoen der Maestrichter
Kreidebildung,' published in 1851, about 180 species are described and illus-

trated as derived from the Maestricht Chalk. In this work Dr. Hagenow
re-describes the whole of Dr. Goldfuss' Cretaceous Bryozoa, and breaks

up the limited classification of the group as given iu ' Petrifacten,' and
redistributes the restricted genera adopted by Goldfuss in that work.

      Previous to the publication of these two leading palseontological works,
which deal with the Bryozoa in detail, there were others of less note, but
all the Cretaceous species which had been described or catalogued before
1850 and 1852 are fully recorded by d'Orbigny in the introductory notes
which preface the specific descriptions in vol. v. of the ' Paleontologie

Fran^aise.'

      In 1886 Dr. Ed. Pei'gens and A. Meunier published their joint paper,
'La Faune des Bryozoaires Garumniens de Faxe,' > in which nearly 60
species of Bryozoa are recorded from this horizon, and eight of these are

either new species or new varieties. Some years since Professor J. Judd
made me a present of a large block of the Faxoe Limestone which he
brought with him from Denmark, and by carefully breaking up the mass
and then washing the finer debris I was able to pick out a quantity of

 these delicate fossils. I have therefore been able to verily most of the
 forms described by the authors, and I find" that at least five or six

other species, not given by Dr. Pergens, may be added to the Faxoe list.

      This little monograph, then, is extremely valuable to the student of
 Upper-Cretaceous Polyzoa on account of the very wide range, from
 Neocomian to Recent, which the authors assign to the species indicated

by them. No doubt the range of variation in many of our so-called

 species is only partially considered ; hence the desire on the part of some
 of our Continental palaeontologists to reduce to mere synonymy a large
 number of the generic and specific names of authors, and of d'Orbigny in
 pai-ticular. Whether palaBontological research will be retarded or helped

by the wholesale destruction of specific names, remains to be seen. On

 the other hand, the tendency of certain authors to increase the difficulties

 of the student by the introduction of new generic terms whenever slight
 variations of the Polyzoan zoarinm present themselves is much to be de-

 plored.

      In 1887 Dr. Th. Marsson's valuable monograph was published, ' Die
 Bryozoen der Weissen Sclireibkreide der Insel Riigen,' '^ and this work
 adds considerably to our knowledge of Upper- Cretaceous Polyzoan forms.
 In his descriptive text the author not only creates new divisional and

 new family names, but many new genera and species besides. It is very

                       ' Ann. de la Soc. Royale Malaool. de Bclgique, tome xsi.
                      ^ Druch imd Verlag vo9i Georg Beimer, Berlin, 1887.
   ON CRETACEOUS POLYZOA.  303

   evident that Dr. Marsson's attention has been, to a large extent, concen-
   trated upon the Poljzoa of this Cretaceoas horizon more particularly.

   This, however, I look upon as an advantage, because we have in this
   work a monograph, which is well illustrated, of the Riigen Bryozoa, and

   Dr. Marsson says that examples of the whole of the species described

   by him are in his own cabinet.'
        There is still another paper which must not be passed over in silence.

   In 1889 Dr. Pergens published the first part of his ' Revision des Bryo-
   zoaires du Cretace, figures par d'Orbigny.' ^ In this work Dr. Pergens
   accepts to some extent the divisions of Dr. Marsson, but the revision is
   chiefly valuable to the student of Cretaceous Polyzoa on account of the

   masterly way in which the author has dealt with the specific creations of
   d'Orbigny, and that, too, with d'Orbigny's examples before him, the whole
   of which are now preserved in the Paris Museum.

                            II. Classification op Cretaceous Poltzoa.

        In the preceding pages I have given, as far as I was able, the status
   of our present knowledge of British Upper- Cretaceous Polyzoa. It is
   very evident, judging by the identifications of the several authors whose
   authorities are quoted in the following lists, that the ' Palaaontology of
   France,' vol. v., is to a large extent the real source of their information
   on Cretaceous Polyzoa generally. Long before d'Orbigny favoured us
   with the productions of his facile pen, Dr. Mantell (' Medals of Creation,'

   1844) and Mr. W. Lonsdale gave some fairly faithful delineations of

   British Polyzoa (Dixon's ' Geology of Sussex,' 1850).
        The classification originally formulated by d'Orbigny was so framed

   as to include recent as well as fossil species, but it is evident, judging

   from the later work of the author, that d'Orbigny himself felt that this
   task was a difficult one. Nevertheless, we owe to this effort on his part
   the very full and valuable synopses and lists which have already been

   referred to. It is impossible, therefore, to accept the classification of

   d'Orbigny as a classification ; but if we cast about for one less elaborate, I

   am not sure that we shall meet with any that may be considered entirely

   faultless. The classifications of Mr. Hincks or Mr. Busk, modified by the

   researches and descriptions of Mr. A. W. Waters, must, for the present at
   least, serve the purposes of this report. Further on I have given my

   reasons for adopting some of the generic and specific names of d'Orbigny
   in preference to the more modern ones when arranging the Cheilostomata.
   In the arrangement of the Cyclostomata I have followed, though not
   slavishly, the generic and specific distinctions of Dr. Pergens, which were

   tabulated on pp. 279, 280 of my former report, 1890.

                  III. The Chatham Chalk and its Polyzoan Fauna.

         Professor Prestwich (' Geology,' vol. ii., p. 297), with characteristic
   brevity, refers to the zonal divisions of the Chalk ' which have of late
   years been worked out in considerable detail, and are found to coincide
   very closely with those previously established for the Chalk of the north

        ' Since this was written I have heard of Dr. Marsson's death. Probably the
   Polyzoa collected by him will be preserved in one of the German museums.

of France. Between the Isle of Thanet and Folkestone tbe Chalk, accord-

ing to Whitaker, Hebert, Price, and others, is divisible into several

groups and zones.' Very few of the sections, however, given by Professor

Prestwich contain the whole of the beds found in British Senonian rocks.

In the nei.Gfhbourhood of Salisbury, according to Mr. B. Westlake,^ we

have something like                     a   typical  succession                                                           consequently I shall take this
                                                                                                                       ;

In East Kent the zonal succession of the Upper Chalk is as follows :

D. Chalk with flints. Zone Micraster cor-angidnum, Margate.

     In the Isle of Wight, according to Dr. Ch. Barrois, there is a very
large development of Chalk of one particular zone (D).

     In Surrey, according to Mr. Caleb Evans (Prestwich, ' Geology,' vol.
ii., p. 297), the section of the line from Croydon ^through the North

Downs shows the following succession in about the thickness of 250

feet :

D. Zone of Micraster cor-anguinum,                                                                                        Purley beds.

     In Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire (Prestwich, p. 298) only
the base of the Upper Chalk is given, and characterised as

     (P.) Zone of Micraster cor-hovis. Chalk with flints.
            The zone of Holaster planus is regarded as the topmost division
                  of the Middle Chalk.

     The subdivisions of the Chalk in Yorkshire, according to Professor
Phillips and Mr. Blake (Prestwich, p. 298), are as follows. The thickness

of the strata characterised is about 500 feet.

By way of contrast, it will be only necessary for me to quote two of

the many palaeontological divisions of the Continental Chalk on account

of the correlation of these with our own British sections. In north-western

France the zonal divisions are, to a large extent, based on the strati-

graphical  divisions  of  d'Orbigny,  and  are  as  follows :  1,  Danian                                 and
                                                                                                       ;

                                 2. Senonian.

      Here, again, the zone of Holaster planus forms the top bed of the

               Turonian series.

     In all probability the Upper Chalk found in the neighbourhood of

Chatham may be placed in the zones marked D and E in the above sec-

tional divisions. Chatham is superficially separated from the Margate
and Rarasgate ontci'op by the supervening London Clay, but the Upper
Chalk must have been continuous from the Essex outcrop to Gravesend,

Chatham, and the Isle of Thanet ; also from Sussex to Dieppe.

    It is impossible for me, of my own knowledge, to give any information
i"especting the geology of Chatham and its vicinity. When the Polyzoa,
which will be elaborately dealt with presently, were sent to me by Mr.

Gamble, I asked him particularly to give some account of the zones in

which the more characteristic forms were found. In reply to this request
I received sketches of the several pits in which the Polyzoan material was
most abundant. [Since this was written I have spent three days with

--Mr. Gamble--purposely in the interest of this report to see for myself

the evidences on which the following remarks are based. I have seen

--the various sections collected material especially the ' Flint-meal ' re-
                                                                                                                                 ;

ferred to further on ; and, moreover, I have carefully examined Mr.

Gamble's private collection of Polyzoa, containing duplicates of nearly

all the forms sent to me from time to time.]
     Some of the adherent species of Polyzoa, such as Siomatopora, Fro-

boscina, and Diastopora, were found encrusting many ibssils ; such as
Micraster cor-anguinum, Ecliinocorys, and other echinoderms; but the
most abundant of the forms described were found in the ' FJint-meal,'
which was derived from the hollows of flints. To the protective
agency of this meal we owe the preservation of the mote delicate branch-

ing Polyzoa, together with a varied assortment of the spicula of sponges,

Foraminifera, Entomostraca, and other minute organisms.'

  ' ' Speaking: of the cavity and the so-called 'meal' found in the now celebrated

--Horstead Flint, Dr. G. Jennings Hinde suggestively remarks : ' The cavity appeared

to have been completely inclosed by the flint, which had thus hermetically sealed up

in its interior and preserved vinharmed from mechanical injury a small portion of

     Mr. Gamble obtained Polyzoa from several of the pits opened in the
Chatham district, but these were generally found in very restricted

horizons. I have sectional sketches of five of these pits, all of which I
have since visited, and in one (see annexed sketch) the strata appear to be
horizontal, being cut along the strike. Very high up or towards the top the
stratum is marked by two iron-stained bands. Just below the highest

     Section slwwing Pohjzoa Zone, Cliatliam Chalh.

--band the Polyzoa zone begins, but the life-climax if I may be allowed

the term--is reached just above and just below the lowest band. In the
section now under description this position is indicated by the figure 4,

which, Mr, Gamble says, consists of a bed of Ananchytes and Spatangus
completely invested by Membranipora3, Serpula;, and adherent forms of
Cyclostomata, such as Stomatopora, Proboscina, Diastopora, and other

forms. When searching in other pits for Polyzoa, it was found that the

presence of these two iron-stained bands was indicative of the position

where the Polyzoan fauna might be found ; but in some of the pits the

hands were either too high or too low, or, in other words, this zonal

division was not a marked feature in the rocks exposed, and the yield of

forms consequently suffered. Nearly the whole of the Polyzoa sent tp me

were derived from one particular pit, but similar forms, though not so

abundant, are found in other pits whenever the sectional or zonal lines

indicated above were exposed. After passing a little section which yielded

a few Polyzoan fragments, the Luton valley widens, the escarpment is

not so deep, and the Polyzoa zone is lost under the bed of the valley,

where it is not possible to meet it again except by boring. Mr. Gamble

says it must not be supposed that the Polyzoa are wholly confined to the

zone which is bracketed in the sketch. Polyzoa will be, and have been,

found  both  above  and  below  the  iron-stained bands                                                                                      but  the greater

     In Di-. Pergens' history and characteristics of this genus will be

found many details which may be valuable to the general student of

recent Polyzoa, as well as the fossil forms found in the Cretaceous rocks
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

but I question the value of the reduction of the ten species given by
d'Orbigny to mere synonyms of Pustulopora proboscidea, Edwards (1838),
(Perg., ' Revis. des Bryoz.,' p. 859). I cannot, however, wholly reject

-- --the evidence brought forward by Dr. Pergens, who has liberally supplied

me for comparison with many beautiful examples of P. proloscidea
(Edw.), dredged from 60 fathoms off Capri, Bay of Naples ; also examples

from the Faxoe Limestone, Denmark, which were fully described in their
joint paper (Pergens and A. Meunier), 'La Faune des Bryozoaires
Garumniens de Faxe,' 'Ann. de la Soc. Royale Malacol. de Belgique,' tom.

xxi., 1886, p. 202). I shall, therefore, indicate by the word 'forma' the
abundant variety found in the Chalk of Chatham, at the same time givino-

the original references to the figures given by d'Orbigny in the ' Atlas.'

Under the name Heteropora cosiata, d'Orb., Dr. Pergens places several

of the Gavea, species of d'Orbigny. As I cannot wholly accept this divi-

sion, I give Lonsdale's genus in preference, especially so as neither

d'Orbigny nor Dr. Pergens seems to recognise the prior claim of Lonsdale :

Petalopora, Lonsdale, 1850; Cavea, d'Orbigny, 1852. ^ In the Chatham

Chalk I recognise several fragments of a species similar to the above,

so we may regard the synonymy of Dr. Pergens as near the truth

=thus Gavea costata, d'Ovh. Petalopora pulchella (?), may be regarded

as a synonym of Lonsdale's species. One difficulty, however, presents

itself. Gavea costata, d'Orb., 1852, is regarded by the author as the same

as Entalopkora costata, d'Orb., 1850, 'Terr. Cret.,' p. 944, pi. 621,

figs. 19, 22. Probably d'Orbigny is correct in his later identification
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

--but, if so, there is no clear evidence of the characters so fully described
--by Lonsdale in his figures. I therefore think that Lonsdale's name

should stand, and that the following forms, characterised by d'Orbigny,

be regarded as synonyms. I have ijiven the names of those species only

which I have been able to identify from fragments found in the Chatham

Chalk. For the sake of uniformity I liave given all the synonyms sepa-

rate numbers, as other woi-kers on the Cretaceous Polyzoa may not be

myinclined to accept  decision on this point :

ing to the following genera of d'Orbigny : Glaviclausa, Glausa, Cavea,

Clavicavea, Sparsicavea, Muliia-escit;, Zonopora, Multizonopora, and typical
Heteropora. The characters of the species found in the Chatham Chalk
are so diverse that I feel compelled to make a slight departure from the
classification of Dr. Pergens in the special arrangement of this peculiar
group of Polyzoa :

     This genus was founded by d'Orbigny for Idmonea sp., Philippi,
derived from No. 26 stage, Falunien, for the location of Bitubigera

(^Idmonea) biseriata, Phil. (1844). Wo Cretaceous species is recorded by

d'Orbigny. Marsson, ' Bryoz. Weiss. Schreibkr. Riigen,' p. 31, adopts the
genus for the inclusion of one species, B. compressa, Mars., pi. iii., fig. 1.

The species now recorded is different from either of the forms cited, bui
it is very rare in the Chatham Chalk.

      63. Bitubigera cribriformis, sp. n.

     The zooecia of this species are disposed, Idmonea-like, in two series
obliquely over one-half the zoarinm. The interspaces between the rows
and the slightly rounded reverse are of a cribriform character. Judging
from his figures, Marsson's depicted characters are quite plain.

      I have seen a British example closely related to the above chai-ac-
terised as Idmonea gradata, but I have followed Marsson in the recognition
of d'Orbigny's genus.

     There are sliglit variations in the size of fasciculaj in young and pld
examples of this abundant' species. Idmonea semici/Uudrica, Rom.,
d'Orbigny regarded as a Trwncatula ('Terr. Cret.,' p. 10-"»4).

     In Mr. Gamble's collection of Chatham Polyzoa there is a very beau-
tiful example of this species, silicified and nearly transparent, Avhich
shows the inter-zooecial and reverse reticulation and all the other cha-
racters of the species in the most perfect manner.

and I now add Chatham, where it is somewhat rare.

    Of this citation I am rather doubtful. I have only seen the basal

     It is very certain that some of the species characterised by d'Orbigny
belong to the genus Honiwosolen, as defined by Lonsdale. The three
species of Truncatida of Hagenow, T. filex, T. truncata, and T. repens, are
relegated by Marsson (' Bryoz. Weiss. Schreib. Riigen,' p. 37) to the genns
Osculipora, d'Orbigny, under which name two of Hagenow's species are

I am aware, in no other copy known to me. Neither Osculipora, d'Orb.,

nor Truncatula, Hag., can in any sense be regarded as the same as

HomceosoJen, Lonsd. The date of Homoeosolen, Lonsd., 1850, and Trun-

catula, Hag., 1851, is sufficient apology for the restoration of the genus,

which was fully described by Lonsdale. As, however, d'Orbigny's names

are occasionally quoted by authors, I give full references to the Atlas

                                                Sub-order Cheilostomata.

    The classification of Cheilostomatous Polyzoa has uudergone many

--changes during the last twelve years or the period embraced since the
--publication of the first of my various reports on Fossil Polyzoa and

much really good work on the grouping has been done by specialists. It

would be impossible in a brief notice like the present one to indicate the

full meaning of these changes. By the old investigators zoarial and

zooecial characters were studied consecutively, but the diagnosis of a

species was moi'e dependent on zoarial than on zooecial characters. In

the Cretaceous Polyzoan fauna, as depicted by d'Orbigny in his really

great work, we have, we must admit, a peculiar arrangement of group-

ing, based on a variety of zoarial growths. Thus, one species having

different habits or modes of attachment will have a variety of specific

and even generic names. This cumbi'ous method of dealing with the

Polyzoan fauna, however, when once mastered, is not such a difficult task

as one at first sight would imagine, as the figures of the species help ns

to understand auy doubtful reference or diagnosis in the text. It is not,

however, the                                    classification of  the    future                                      and, though I have  to a large
                                                                                                                   ;

extent followed d'Orbigny in his estimate of species, I have done so after

reference to the newer work and suggestions of later authors. Were

this a monograph of Cretaceous Polyzoa such a proceeding would be

justly regarded as an offence, or at the least as disrespectful to other

workers                                         but, as this is a report  only on British Cretaceous Polyzoa, the
                                             ;

course I have adopted may be ungrudgingly allowed, especially as full

references are given to the text and atlas of d'Orbigny.

    In my last report ' I quoted from Phillips' ' Manual of Geology ' (1885)

Mr. Etheridge's estimate of the Upper- Cretaceous Polyzoan fauna, which

he put down at 61 species. In the present report from one horizon of

the Upper Chalk alone I have catalogued 125 really good species and

varieties ; and in all probability this may be considerably increased when

all the Polyzoan fauna is as carefully examined as the Chatham Chalk

has been by myself and Mr. Gamble. The general list, however, from all

the zones of the Chalk, as given in the zonal divisions at the end of the

report, has been nearly trebled.

1850. Genus Vincdlaria, d'Orb., ' Terr. Cret.' (Not Defrance.)

      This is by no means a satisfactory genus to deal with in the fossil
state, or at least with those species which are found in the British Chalk.
In a former report (1884 ·), on pp. 106-110, under the family term

Cellarid^, Hincks, I hav^e already discussed the probable relationship of
Vincularia species. In Mr. Waters' various papers species of Vincularia

are relegated to either Membranipora or Micropora ; but I note that in
Miss E. C. Jelly's Synonymic Catalogue three of d'Orbigny's recent
species are retained under the genus Vincularia (p. 271). In their joint
paper (' Bryoz. de Faxe' ^) Messrs. Pergens and Mennier retain the generic
term Vincularia for species found in the debris of the Eaxoe limestone of
Denmark, and Dr. Marsson in his Biigen monograph also adopts this
genus. In all probability in future classifications the genus will be
disallowed, but no useful purpose would be served, so far as I can judge,
in wholly suppressing the generic term in the present report on the
Polyzoa found in the British Chalk. For the present, therefore, I retain
the genus Vincularia for all those forms which are closely related to,
or characteristically identical with, French ' Bryozoan ' forms as described
in the text and figured in the atlas of d'Orbigny.

    In my last report on Cretaceous Polyzoa I accepted the divisions

--formulated by Dr. Marssou and Dr. Pergens as the latest attempt by

--no means satisfactory to classify Cretaceous Polyzoa. The EJea and

Melicertitina groups have always been very difficult to deal with, espe-

cially the Upper- Cretaceous forms, as the 'closure' cells in the zoarium

closely resemble the ' closm'e' cells of the Carboniferous Pohjpora tuherculata.

Until quite recently it has been customary to place Pohjpora species
amongst the Cyclostomata, but their true position must be left for the

present. Since writing my last report I have had ample opportunity to

study Cretaceous examples of Meliceriiies, which, though very abundant
as individuals in the Chatham Chalk, are by no means abundant as

species. I am now quite prepared to agree with Mr. A. W. Waters in

his estimate of the genus. In a recent paper - that author has shown

that the true Cheilostomatous characters, such as Avicularia, found in

Cretaceous species, are sufficiently indicative as to their natural location

as regards grouping. For the present, however, I can only give a record

of the species already met with.

The genus Eschara holds an important place in the classification of

d'Orbigny and  other  Continental  writers  on  Polyzoa,  but Mr.            Hincks
                                                                          ^

and Mr. Waters, in dealing with recent and fossil species, break up the

group considerably. It is certainly an unmanageable group whenever

reliance is placed upon the bilaminate character for diagnostic purposes.

Yet the genus, as understood and worked by d'Orbigny and others, is a

most interesting one, and so far as I am aware it reached its climax in the

Cretaceous epoch. D'Orbigny describes and illustrates 80 species as

belonging to the Chalk of France. Marsson describes several species as

very beautiful forms which are found in the Maestricht beds. Although
I place the following species under Esclmra, it must not be supposed
that I disagree with modern methods of investigation. In all probability
a rearrangement will take place in the grouping of species of this genus.

    In Mr. W. Whitaker's ' Geology of London and of Part of the Thames

Valley ' (vol. i., pp. 83-85, 1889) will be found a list of fossils from the

--following localities : (1) Lewisham, (2) Charlton and Woolwich, (3)

Gravesend and Korthfleet, and (4) Grays and Pnrfleet (Essex). The
list was compiled by Mr. Jukes-Browne, from the catalogue of the collec-
tion in the Jermyn Street Museum, from Dr. Lavis' paper,' from a list of

--the late Mr. Wetherell's collection, taken by Mr. Whitaker supple-

mented by references from the monographs of the Palseontographical
Society and from specimens in the collections of Mr. Jukes-Browne and

of Mr. W. Whitaker. Only two species of Polyzoa are mentioned in the

--list, but in a MS. note Mr. Whitaker gave me a list probably compiled

ON GEETACEOUS POLTZOA.  319

--from Moi'ris' ' Catalogue of British Fossils ' of six additional species of

Polyzoa, which had been previously recorded from the No. 3 locality

given above. Until 1889 these v^ere all the Cretaceous Polyzoa from

 Gravesend known to the respective authors.

      In June 1890, with the other material already refei-red to,' I re-
ceived from Professor T. Rupert Jones, F.R.S., a small packet labelled

* Gravesend.' This proved to be pickings, or refuse material, which re-
mained after Mr. Jones had selected the Foraminifera and Entomostraca,
In the packet I found a number of minute fragments of well-preserved

-- --Polyzoan remains besides other organisms and the following list is

the result of my labours on this small collection. I have included in the

list the names only of species of whose identity I felt assured but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

there were other fragments which would help me to add to the list if

better material could be forthcoming. I do hope, therefore, that local
students will search for and record their discoveries in this, as well as in

other districts where the Upper Chalk rocks are exposed. Examples of

all the species recorded below are in my own cabinet. Professor Morris'

list is given separately, because, as yet, I have not been able to identify
any of the species named.

is that given by Professor Morris in his ' Catalogue of British Fossils.'

the species catalogued.)                                                                    i

In 1891 I received from Dr. Blackmore, of Salisbury, a very beautiful

series of Polyzoa, -which had been collected from the different zones of

the Upper Chalk in the neighbourhood of Salisbury. The zonal suc-

cessions as characterised by Mr. Westlake I have already adopted in a

previous part (p. 4) of the present report ; but a few other remarks may

be advantageously quoted from the same paper ' by -way of explanation.

' The Upper Chalk is a very pure calcareous sediment. The time -which

elapsed during its deposit was sufficient to allow of a variation in the

Weforms of the shellfish and the replacement of one by another.   cau

trace this in the Upper Chalk of our own valley, f i-om its lowest part (with

Micraster cor-fesiudinarium) in the pit east of Clearbury, to the highest

(with Belemniiella mucronata), which appears in the pits of Redlynch,

Searchfield, Breamore, Outwich, Whitsbury, Brookheatb, West Park,

and Damerham.' In sending me the Polyzoa, Dr. Blackmore gave in his

letters very full notes respecting the various zones from whence the

forms were derived. The BelenimteUa quadrata zone seems to have

yielded the greater number of species, probably on account of its being

60 largely used in the neighbourhood of Salisbury for the purpose of

manufacturing whitingr. The localities specialised by Dr. Blackmore are

East Haruham and Whaddon. Sections of the Chalk have been exposed

in the higher zone, with Belemnitella oimcronata, at Clarendon and

Short End. This zone. Dr. Blackmore remarks, corresponds with the

Norwich beds, excepting those at Tormingham, which are probably

     ' ' Outlines of the Geolofry of Fordingbridge, <tc.,' from MltchelVs Fordinghridge
Almanack and Directory, 1889, p. 7.
                    ON CRETACEOUS POLTZOA.  421

Danian. The zone of Marsupites testudinarius has yielded a few forms,

chiefly from the locality of Highfield, and the zone of Micraster cor-angumum

lias also yielded several very beautifal species, some of which are

unique. The localities are Witherington, Horsebridge, and Quidhampton.

Unfortunately the great bulk of the Salisbury Polyzoa were un-

suited for microscopical examination on account of their size. Since these

were examined and returned to Dr. Biackmore with a temporary list of

species, the mass of Chatham Polyzoa which I was able to mount as

slides have been most carefully studied for the purpose of identification,

and in some few cases I have altered the name given in the temporary list.

It is right that I should make this remark, because it is the intention of

Dr. Biackmore, I believe, to place the series of Polyzoa referred to, when

properly arranged, in the Salisbury and South- Wilts Museum. In the

present list the series is arranged consecutively. In the columns the

zones where the species were found are indicated by the typical letters

already referred to, and on the extreme right the name of the locality as

given by Dr. Biackmore. I have only the broken fragments which be-

came detached in the passage of the Salisbury species, and a few forms

-- --presented to me by Dr. Biackmore Lunulites, &c. so that the present

list is compiled from careful notes and drawings of the species made

during the time that the collection was in my hands. From other locali-

ties I have similar examples of the species indicated in the list, and I have

only placed the usual asterisk (*) against those forms that I have no

Myduplicate of.     identification of these may probably be erroneous, so

that I will advise Dr. Biackmore and other collectors in Salisbury and

its neighbourhood to verify the accuracy in my present list of the specific
names so indicated. I had Polyzoa from four zones only. Zone E not,

being represented.

(The small figures on the right-hand side refer to the habitats on which the species
                           were found. See list at the end of this section.)

In Mr. W. Whitaker's ' Geology of London and Part of the Thames

Valley,' vol. i., p. 76 (1889), will be found remarks on the fossil contents

of the various pits in Beikshire visited by Mr. Rhodes. In the Twyford

and Maidenhead districts Chalk was quarried in many places, and Mr.

ARhodes collected fossils from such pits as were still in use.  list of

fossils procui-ed from these pits will be found at pp. 79 and 80, amongst

--which are several Polj-zoa. The Chalk in all the pits of which locali-

--ties are given is characterised by certain fossils, which are either rare

or absent in the beds below. These are :

    Bourgueticrimis (? ellipticus), Miller.
    Ciilaris peronata, FoT-bes.
    Micraster cor-anguinum, Leske.

    Ostrea acutirostris. Nils.

    Pecten nitidus, Mant., with many Polyzoa and Serpulce.

     There can be little doubt, says Mr. Rhodes, that this Clialk belongs to
the zone of Micraster cor-avguiuuvi, whilst that with the spongeous flint

(Cookham Dean) may be referred to the zone of Micraster cor-testudi-

narium (p. 76).

     In a pit quarried on the Buckingham side of the Thames is a layer of

greyish gritty Chalk in blocky masses resembling Totternhoe stone, with-
out flints, in which are Belemnitella quadrata and Ostrea acutirostris ; and
the presence of these fossils, with a comparative scarcity of flints, suggests
a correlation of this Chalk with the Margate Chalk of the zone Marsupites

testudinnrius (p. 1'?).

     The Polyzoa, partially and fully identified by Mr. Rhodes, are as

follows:

     Diastopora, sp. Idmonea and Escharina sp., Littlewick.
      Diastopora, sp. only, Bisham.
     Entalophora and Membranipora, Pinkneys.

                   VIII. Polyzoa, Hertfordshire and Middlesex.

     Several Chalk pits in the neighbourhood of Rickmansworth and Wat-
ford were examined by Mr. Rhodes, and with very satisfactory results as
regards Polyzoa. In all probability the Chalk of these pita also is in

the junction of the Micrastcr cor-angninum and M. cor-testudinarium zones.
The Polyzoa, identified and otherwise, are as follows:

     Besides the species identified at Watford are the following, indicated
by generic names only :

     Stomatopora (Alecto), Diastopora, Vincularia, Membranipora, and

          Eschara, sp.

     At Harefield, Rickmansworth, Bushey, Letchmore, and Colnej Street,
species (nnnamed) of the following genera have been found, probably in
the ' Flint Meal ' from the hollows of flints :

              Alecto, Diastopora, Defrancia, Cellepora, and Escharina.

     Of the undetermined species I cannot speak, not having as yet' seen
the material (' Geol. Lond. and Part of Thames Valley,' p. 80, vol. i.).

                      IX. Polyzoa, Charlton, near Woolwich.

    I am not awai'e whether any record has been given of Polyzoa having

been found in the Charlton Pit. In 1860 I was living at Woolwich foi' a
short time, when I collected both Tertiary and Cretaceous fossils. Re-
cently, while examining some of the larger forms, I found the following
species of Polyzoa encrusting M. cor-anguinum and Echinocorys vulgaris,
but they are by no means fine examples of colonial growths like those
found on Gravesend or Chatham fossils :

     Stomatopora gracilis, Bronn.
                             Dixoni, Yine.

                       X. Polyzoa, Norfolk, Sussex, and Kent.

    For this section of my labours there only remain now the Polyzoa of

the Upper Chalk of Norfolk and of Suffolk to chronicle. This I must do
on the authority of Professor Morris, as 1 have only a very few fossils on
which I could rely for information. The Polyzoa in Sussex are evidently

Polyzoa belonging to the two sub-orders Cyclostomata and Cheilosto-

mata.

ceus, d'Orb., pi. 704.

    If T am right in my identification, the Millepora (truncata), Woodw.,

which Professor Morris identifies as Betepora. truncata ?, Goldf., is really

the Truncatula truncata, ILag.-^^Osculipora truncata, d'Orb. (1847). I have,
however, a very peculiar species {Reteporidea, d'Orb.) from Norfolk, ad-

herent to Belemnitella mucronata, but the form is too much silicified for

specific distinction.

     In 1882 I received from Miss E. C. Jelly a small parcel of Cretaceous

Polyzoa derived from the cliff's of Beachy Head in Sussex. I have not the
collection at hand to refer to, but as I gave particulars of these in a
former report (' Brit. Assoc. Rep.,' 1883) it may be as well to correct
the few inaccuracies which were unavoidable at the time I wrote.

     The other species given in the Report must be allowed to stand for

the present.

    It was my intention to give descriptions of the new species introduced

into this Report, but as in all probability a monograph of the Cretaceous

Polyzoa will be the outcome of my past and future investigations, it will
be perhaps a better plan to reserve my descriptions until 1 can furnish

figures of the same.

Report of the Gommittee, consisting of Messrs. H. Bauerman,

    F. W. KuDLER, and J. J. H. Teall, and Dr. H. J. Johnston-
     Lavis, appointed for the investigation of the Volcanic Pheno-
     mena of Vesuviios and its Neighbourhood. {Drawn up by

     Dr. Johnston-LaVIS.)

Since the last report nearly all the tunnelling for the great main sewer
is complete, and few additional facts of interest have come to light.
Several little problems of purely local geology have, however, been solved.
In the lower sewer collector, beneath the tramway tunnel of Naples, a pecu-
liar grey trachy tic mass has been met with, and was penetrated for a short

distance. On account of a lawsnit the works do not progress. The mass,

however, is of considerable interest, as it is below the great yellow tuff of
Posilipo and Naples. The rock was ejected rapidly in very pasty or almost
solid fragments, which in some cases blended with the others thrown out
just befoi'e and after, and are flattened out in a pipernoid manner. At
other points the fragments are broken, mixed with dust, and consequently

incoherent. When this deposit is cut through, it will probably confirm
my theory regarding the piperno of Pianura and Soccavo, as being the

result of lumps of lava ejected in great blobs, which falling quite hot around
the vent have become resoldered together, and have even flowed a little.

     Very high temperatures have been met with in the tunnel near the
Solfatara, where I registered myself 59° C. on a day that the workmen

considered a very fresh one for the workings, i.e., with a high barometer

 still rising.

     The statement made many years since by Professor A. Scacchi, that
fragments of leucitic lavas had been found by him at the Foce di Fusaro,
near the Torre Gavetta, led me to suspect the existence there of the
Museum breccia. On examining the locality this was confirmed, and, in

fact, the whole sea cliff" of Mte. di Procida exhibits a most interesting
though complex section of the volcanic series of the Phlegraean Fields.

    We have there a sei'ies of trachytes forming the base of the section,

very various in texture, and often covered with thick beds of their own

scoriae, which are often consolidated into a kind of trachytic breccia quite
analogous to the ' sperrone ' of the Alban hills. This is overlaid by fine

lapilli and pumice beds, which vary very much in thickness. Lying un-

conformably upon these are irregular buried outliers of the grey pipernoid
tuff of the region. In one place the pipernoid tuff is seen in section as
an exceedingly obtuse V-shaped mass, having choked an old valley, and
possessing the following characters : The black scoria fragments are very
 slightly, if at all, flattened, are very spongy, are of good size, and form an

important constituent of the deposit. From this we can conclude that

the distance would well correspond with my supposed eruptive month

to the S.S.W. of Camaldoli, not very far from the Lago d'Agnano, from
 which I believe issued the piperno and the greater part of the pipernoid
tuff of the Campania. The distance was, in fact, such as to allow time for

 only the lighter pieces of scorise, the equivalent to the black flackers of the

piperno, to travel so far, and these to be so cooled that when they fell they
were too rigid to be flattened out by the impact.

     This grey pipernoid tuff has here suffered much denudation, for in
                                        '

ON THE VOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF VESUVIUS.  339

many places it is quite removed. Towards Torre Gavetta the ' Museum

breccia is well developed, 'being composed of very large blocks of the
numerous varied rocks, followed by beds of the woody pumice, woody
looking scoriae and scoriaceous black centred vitreous trachyte fragments
and pumice. Lying with very marked unconformability upon it is a
great thick bed of the compact yellow tuff, either derived from Cam-
pagnone or the neighbouring cone, a slice of which forms Misenum. In
this section we have splendidly exhibited many of the great geological
records in the history of this remarkable volcanic region. Bach of
these stages is defined from those above and below it by more or less long
periods, during which in some cases very extensive denudation had taken

place. At this point also I am satisfied we have products of the erup-

tions of the Procida and neighbouring centres interstratified with those
of the mainland, and in which I hope in time to work out the relative

chi-onology.

    The discoveries, which in so striking a manner confirm my conclusions

regarding the highly complex stratigraphy of this region, induced me once

naore to examine in detail that isolated eminence upon which once stood
the renowned Greek town of Cumse, founded about 1000 B.C.

     Time has favoured the geologist, for here, however much the archaeo-
logist may grieve, it has once more exposed to human eyes sections that
for many centuries were hidden by buildings, but which reveal the fact that
those very rocks that as geologists we look upon as very recent had
nearly 3,000 years ago much the same characters as now. The pumices

that form the uppermost yellow tuff had then already been converted
into a rock which those early colonists cut out and used for the construc-

tion of their walls. When we first visit Cumae, and our thoughts wander

back through historic time, we are impressed by the human associations
with this hill for such a long period ; but when we return with our eyes
and minds geologically cultured, the ancient Greek town sinks into insig-
nificance by the side of the physical history of the mound it stood upon,
when we remember that not only this mound, but the whole region is

post-Pliocene in age.

     The foundation of the Cnmean hill is the well-known trachyte rich in
inclusions of sodalite, of amphibole, and I have detected not uncommonly
crystals of fayalite. Were it more vesicular it would very much resemble
the western mass of ti'achyte of the Cumana railway tunnel at the back

of Naples.

     Above this come some pumice and dust beds, which are probably the
equivalent of the Rione Amedeo tuffs. Superposed on this we find a

dirty grey pipernoid tuff which shows much remaniement. The Museum

breccia is well represented in patches, and is overlaid by a bed of vitreous
trachyte produced by the resoldering of the falling masses into one solid
stratum, where the surface was flat, but where an incline is the fragments
have remained separate. The whole is capped by the compact yellow
tuff. There are also some minor pumice and dust beds which require
further working out.

     The trachyte seems to have oozed forth in a highly pasty condition,
breaking up its scoriaceous surface, which rolled down the sides of the

--dome-shaped mass, and by pressure and heat from the main mass became

again soldered together in fact, a sort of regelation. The brecciated struc-
ture is undiscernible in hand specimens or under the microscope, but is well
etched out by meteoric agencies. Each of the deposits mentioned above

                                                                                                                                      z2

shows more or less nnconformability, which corresponds as they themselves

do with those beds of the Monte Santo Funicular Railway, the Cumana Rail-

way, Pianura, Soccavo, Monte di Procida, Nocera, Castellamare, St.

Agata, Capri, Caserta, &c., which I have described in other reports and

papers.

These are the principal sections which record the later geological

history of the Phlegrsean Fields, and from which I have been able to un-

ravel the stratigraphy of the highly complex Neapolitan volcanic region.

So far it has been explained only in these reports and other disjointed

papers, but before long I hope to be able to place before the scientific

world a far more detailed description of one of the most interesting as

well as the most classic and accessible volcanic regions of the world.

Before quitting the subject, however, I wish to call attention to the

confirmation that the sections mentioned in this report aS'ord of my

Weexplanation of the piperno and pipernoid structure in general.        see

distinctly that the variation in colour and texture of the two constituents

of the piperno, which chemically are identical, is simply due to the greater

saturation with H2O of one portion of the magma than the other in the

old chimney of the volcano at the time of the eruption. The consequence

was that the more aquiferous part was erupted as a fine dust, and the

less aquiferous, more coherent magma was ejected in large fragments or

more or less scoriaceous cakes, which lost their heat the more slowly, the

less H2O contained in them there was to expand. The densest, and at the

same time the slowest to cool, fell near the eruptive mouth, flattened out,

squeezed out those beneath them, and were squeezed out by those above

them, forming, with the included dust, the compact piperno in which the

foliated structure is most developed towards the W. end of the Soccavo
section, where the nearest existing remnant to the old ci-ater is now pre-

served, and where the inclination was greatest, and consequently where

actually slight flow took place. The more scoriaceous of these lava

cakes were carried to greater distances, so that as we travel away from

the eruptive axis we find, first, that the black fragments become less
markedly flattened because they cooled more rapidly from expansion, and

also because they travelled farther, until they no longer show flattening

parallel to the bedding more than what would be due to any of them

being accidentally of flattened or elongated form, and so lying flat on the

surface on which they fell ; second, we find that as their radial distance
from the eruptive axis increased, the fragments at first get lighter ; and
third, when the limit of lightness and cohesion is reached, they get
smaller and smaller, so that at Roccamonfina and Salerno the pipernoid

tulFis chiefly composed of the grey dust with only few and minute frag-
ments of black scorias. This seems to have been modified by strong winds,

and possibly by the eruption taking place along a cleft much like that
formed in the late Tarawera eruption, or as in many cases in Iceland,

such as the Skaptar outburst, though most of the latter locality do not

belong to explosive types of eruptions.

There is in Iceland, at Krisuvik, the principal one of several crater

lakes which exhibits in a striking manner the resoldering together of

ejected fragments, into what might at first appear to be a true lava stream.

I allude to the Groenavatn, in which we have an almost circular conical

hollow nearly filled with water. There is only a very low ring around it,
composed of accidental ejectamenta, being nothing more than the ejected

fragments of the materials, through which it was drilled, with practically
ON THE YOLCANIC PHENOMENA OF YESUVIDS.  341

no essential ejecta, except on one side, where we have a mass of rock that
looks like a lava stream. It seems there must have been at the moment
of the ernption a very strong wind which carried all the lava fi-agments
in one direction, and as they fell they blended together into one fairly
uniform mass, the components of which are only faintly indicated by a
slight variation in colour, somewhat like piperno, but not so well marked.

The top and bottom are less coherent, for at the bottom the fragments fell
on cold ground, whilst the top, although falling on the hot mass beneath,

could not be pressed into contact with it by later falls. No doubt also

the explosions were feebler towards the end and the interval longer

between the fall of the last fragments.

    We find exactly the same thing in the piperno, namely, a spongy

tufaceous-like bottom and top. Besides this, the lulls and accentuations

of the explosive action are well marked, as well as the time that large

masses of the crater edges fell in and were re-ejected. At one time the
eruptive action seems to have been arrested, and the partly or entirely
consolidated plug was blown out into fragments and deposited amongst

the piperno.

    Vesuvius has since the last report, up to the time of my last visit in

May, shown very little variation. It will be remembered that lava was
issuing at the site of the eruption of June 7, 1891, at the foot of the great
cone, more than three hundred metres below the summit at the junction
with the Atrio del Cavallo, and nearly opposite the Punta del Nasone.

--This outpour practically never stopped at times it increased to no incon-

siderable quantities, but flowed only a short distance, on account of the low

gradient, tending to pile itself up into a mound. On other occasions it

seemed to become almost arrested, but it never practically stopped. The
consequence of all this was that at the foot of the great cone in the Atrio,
during the year ftom June 1891 to June 1892, a tremendous mound
or low-pitched buttress had been built up, so that its highest part I
estimate to be 20 m. above the old floor of the Atrio. This thickened
away in all directions, but even under the escarpment of Somma, the

present floor stands for considerable distances over 5 m. higher. In con-

sequence of this many of the dyke numbers which cost me so much

labour to put up some years since have been covered over. These I
hope to be able to replace this winter, and to repaint all the rest that are
now becoming obliterated. It will be remembered that these numbers

correspond with the dykes figured in my geological map of Vesuvius, and

all collectors now adopt these numbers to indicate the locality of the

dyke from which the specimens are obtained. Professor Bassani has
added a new and complete collection of these interesting dyke rocks to

the Naples Museum, and has arranged them according to my numbering.

The great importance of maintaining this numbering intact will be

seen.

     The actual details of the variations in the activity are as follows.
During the summer and autumn of 1891 more crumbling in of the crater
edges took place, followed by black sand and dust-charged vapour. The
outpour of lava from the base of the cone in the Atrio from time to time

almost stopped, to be followed again by fresh gushes. On the first day

of December a marked extension took place to the south and south-east of

the crater by the further crumbling in of its edges. On the last day of
the old year and commencement of 1892 the outflow was much accen-

tuated. During January and February few variations were observable,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but on Marcli 17 and 18 sligtt reflection from the crater was visible for
the first time for nearly a year, showing the rise of the lava in the
chimney, due certainly in part from blocking of the lateral channel, as the

outflow of lava below was markedly diminished. On the 21st. the activity

at the crater was distinctly at the first degree, but on the 22nd the second

degree was attained. On that evening, however, a. gush of lava showed

the removal of the lateral obstruction to its outflow, and the central
activity so diminished that the following night no reflection was visible.

On March 29 and 31 the crater again showed the first degree of activity.

     This was followed during the first week of April by a fresh outflow of
lava, which still more increased during the next week. During the first
four days of the month feeble reflection was from time to time visible

from the crater. On the 12th, black dusty smoke was puffed out from
time to time. On visiting the Atrio, I found the lava that flowed had

formed the mound above spoken of, surmounted by fumaroles.

    During the night of May 3-4 fresh portions of the crater wall

collapsed and blocked the vent, so that during the following day hai'dly

any vapour crowned the summit of the volcano. By the next day the
increased tension of the vapour was suflBcient for it to force its way
through the obstruction, and much black sandy smoke escaped during

the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th. Obstructing masses that had detached them-
selves from the crater sides again plugged the vent on the 27th and 28th
the next day dark, sandy, and dusty smoke was emitted.

     The flowing lava showed few new phenomena, with the exception of

the fine examples of conical and tubular spiracles formed above the lava
exit at the same locality, being above one set figured in the last report,

now buried.
     One is unique on account of its curved overhanging form. As was

seen in the photograph exhibited, it was ejected at the highest point of
the new lava, and quite at the foot of the great Vesuvian cone. I can
only explain its inclination at the lower part, by supposing that the
vapour and lava fragments were projected upwards and outwards in a
plane radial to the volcanic chimney which corresponds with tlie orienta-
tion of the fumarole. This lateral projection seems to have gone on for
some time, so that many of the blobs of lava blown out fell, and formed a
support for the inclined tube. As the blasts escaped more feebly the
edges of the mouth became more solid, and so the lower lip diverted the
column more in an upright direction, until the growth became almost
vertical. The whole efl'ect is to produce a large mass somewhat re-
sembling a recumbent animal with its neck and head erect.

     About twenty yards more distant from the foot of the cone was another
large, obtuse, conical-shaped fumarole, which had been broken away on
one side, and well exhibited the dome-like interior covered by stalactitic
lava, as shown in a photograph exhibited. These two specimens con-

stitute very fine examples of the spiracles which may be built up on
the surface of a coarsely crystalline lava, such as that now issuing from

Vesuvius. They differ very considerably from those described and illus-
trated by Dana and others from Hawaii, and from those formed on acid
lavas at Reunion, of which one or two figures have been published.

     At the summit of the great cone few changes have occurred beyond the
further enlargement of the crater. Wlien slips took place from the edges,

dark dust-laden vapour was puffed out from time to time. On one or

with the snflBciently strong explosions, to project a few lava cakes beyond
the crater edges. The bottom of the ci'ater has been invisible owing to
the large amount of vapour present on each occasion when I visited
the mountain summit.

     Since I quitted Naples an actual crateret has opened in the Atrio at
the point where these fumaroles stood, and several gushes of lava have

taken place. I shall more fully report on these new phases on my

return to Naples.

Report of the Gotnmittee, consisting of Mr. Gr. J. Symons, Mr. C.
     Davison {Secretary), Sir F. J. Bramwell, Mr. E. A. Cowper,
     Professor Gr. H. Darwin, Professor J. A. Ewing, Mr. Isaac Roberts,
     Mr. Thomas Gtray, Dr. John Evans, Professors J. Prestwich, E.

    Hull, Gr. A. Lebour, R. Meldola, and J. W. Judd, Mr. M.
    Walton Brown, and Mr. J. Gtlaisher, appointed to consider
     the advisability and desirability of establishing in other parts
     of the country Observations upon the Prevalence of Earth Tre-
    mors similar to those now being Tnade in Durhayn in connection

     with coal-mine explosions.

During the past year the attention of the committee Ihas been directed
to ascertaining what instruments have been devised in other countries
suitable for the woi'k with which your committee is charged. They
believe that that list is now nearly complete, and in their next report
they propose to fully describe and illustrate these devices, as they are
sure that such a collection of descriptions would be extremely useful.

     This list will certainly contain the following instruments, and probably
others of a simpler and less expensive character.

     1. The nadirane erected by M. "Wolf in the observatory of Paris.
     2. The pendulum with do uhle-suspension mirror employed by Messrs.
G. H. and H. Darwin at Cambridge in their attempt to determine the

lunar disturbance of gravity.

     3. The tromometer used by P. Bertelli at Florence, and by other ob-
servers in Italy and Switzerland.

     4. The tremor recorder of Professor J. Milne used by him in Japan
     Mr. Horace Darwin has recently invented another form of pendulum,
smaller and less delicate than the one referred to above. This instru-
ment has been made by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company,
and Mr. Darwin has generously offered to place it temporarily at the
disposal of the committee. Experiments will be made with it shortly,
an account of which the committee hope to give in. their next report.
     The committee request that they be reappointed, with the addition of
Professor C. Gr. Knott and Professor J. H. Poynting.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. P. L. Sclatee, Professor

     Eay Lankestee, Professor Cossae Ewaet, Professor M. Fostee,
     Mr. A. Sedgwick, Professor A. M. Maeshall, and Mr. Peecy
     Sladen (Secretary), to appoint Mr. Willet to investigate the

     Morphology of the Ascidians at the Zoological Station at Naples,
     or, failing this, to appoint some other competent investigator to
     carry on a definite piece of %vorh at the Zoological Station at
     Naples approved by the Council.

Your Committee have the pleasure to report that the table at the Naples

Zoological Station hired by the British Association has been continuously

occupied since the beginning of October last by Mr. Arthur Willey.

Mr. Willey, who is still in Naples and does not expect to complete his
work before the middle of August, has furnished a preliminary report

upon the investigations he has undertaken whilst occupying the table.
The report in question is appended, and is one to be regarded with

satisfaction.

     The Committee have received an application for permission to use the
table from Mr. Cecil Duncan, who proposes to investigate the efiect of
different rays of light upon Algae containing different coloured pigments

a subject of great interest from both the chemical and the biological
standpoint. Mr. Duncan proposes to commence work at Naples on
August 15. This application has been unanimously approved by your

Committee, and they trust that the Association will sanction the payment

of the grant of lOOL, as in previous years, for the hire of the table in

the Zoological Station at Naples.

     The importance of the work carried on by the Zoological Station at
Naples and the admirable organisation of the institution for the purposes
of research are now so universally recognised that your Committee feel it
would be superfluous to recapitulate the advantages to the Association

--and through the Association to all British naturalists of maintaining the

right to participate in this great international undertaking.

The details extracted from the general report of the Zoological Station,

which have been courteously famished by the officers of the Station,

afford the most convincing evidence of the progress and success of the

institution. The details referred to, which will be found at the end of

this report, embrace lists (1) of the naturalists who have occupied tables

since  the  last  report                               (2)  of the  works  published                            during 1891 by natu-

The progress of the various publications undertaken by the Station is

summarised as follows :

     1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel ' the first three

--monographs mentioned in last year's report viz., on ' Gammarini,' by

--Prof. Delia Valle; on ' Balanoglossus,' by Prof. Spengel ; and on ' Pelagic

Copepoda,' by Dr. Giesbrecht will probably be published at the end of
the present or the beginning of the next year, the text and plates being

now nearly ready. Each monograph will run to about 800 pages of text,
with accompanying illustrations. The delay during the past year in the
publication of this costly series of monographs has arisen solely from the

great extension of the works themselves. All who are acquainted with
the monographs previously issued and with the character of the research

involved will readily appreciate this circumstance. It is doubtful if any
other similar institution has produced so large a sei-ies of works as those
already published within the same time.

     2. Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der Zoologischen Station zu Neapel,'
vol. X., parts i. and ii., with 22 plates, have been published.

     3. Of the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' the whole ' Bericht ' for 1890
has been published.

    4. Of the ' Guide to the Aquarium ' a new English edition has been
published. All four editions--English, German, Italian, and French
are now illustrated.

     I. Report on the Occupation of the Table. By Mr. Arthur Willbt.

      I came to Naples with the object of studying Ascidian development
from the point of view of the close relationship believed to exist between
the Ascidians and Amphioxus. I had already made a study and pub-
lished an account of the post embryonic development of Amphioxus,^
which revealed certain fresh points of contact between the two groups,
especially with regard to the behaviour of the endostyle. Having now
had an opportunity of making personal observations on the development
of some of the Ascidians, I have arrived at certain conclusions which
differ considerably from the position which I assumed in the paper above
quoted, and which I venture to think not only show the relations between
the Ascidians and Amphioxzis to be closer than was formerly supposed,
but also render them more intelligible.

      I attempted at the outset to obtain the embryos of Appendicularia,
bat after a long and wearisome search was unsuccessful, and accordingly

turned my attention to the embryonic development of the curious and

well-marked Ascidian, Gtjnthia papillosa, Linn., which spawned in the
tanks in the month of November.

     The eggs of this form are very opaque, and I had to make use of

transverse, horizontal, and sagittal sections. There is a considerable
quantity of yolk, and the gastrulation is preceded by what Davidoff calls
a 'plaknla-stage.' The mesoderm consists at first of an arc of cells lining
the posterior wall of the blastopore. It does 7<oi form a ring surrounding
the blastopore. It is easy to distinguish the mesodermal cells from the
endodermal on account of the practical absence of yolk in the former,
while in the latter cells the innumerable yolk spheres become very darkly
stained with osmic acid. The notochord arises purely from the endoderm,

and there is no question of a common ' Anlage ' of mesoderm and noto-

ehord.

     It is a curious fact that the eggs of this Ascidian only underwent
segmentation at night, just as is the case with the eggs of Amphioxus,
not that this is anything more than an analogy. Most of the young
tadpoles of this species, while still enclosed within the vitelline membrane,
instead of curving round ventrally, curved round dorsally. Whether it
was a pathological phenomenon or whether it occurred as a variation, I
cannot decide, but it is in any case interesting from the fact that the

dorsal curvature was almost invariably accompanied by what may be

                    ' See Quart. Journ. Microsc. Soi. vol. xxxii., March 1891.
                                                                                                               --

described as a hypertrophy of the anterior end of the notochord, in that
it either extended unusaally far forwards, or, as was more frequently the
case, it bent round sharjjly on itself in front.

     The tail arises as a solid outgrowth from the body of the larva, con-
taining the greater part of the notochord, some mesodermic elements in
the form of two lateral plates of cells, and some endoderm in the shape of
a median ventral cord of cells, two deep.

     The intestine of Ascidians is in all probability entirely homologous
with that of Ampldoxus, including the possession of a caecum ; and its
U-shaped curvature is appai-ently, in accordance with the reflections of

Lang, to be correlated with the sessile habit of the Ascidians. An in-

teresting parallel for this is afforded by the comparison of Cephalodiscus

and Balanoglossus.
     Being unable to rear the embryos of Gynthia papillosa beyond the tad-

pole stage, I commenced to work at the post-embryonic development of

Ciona intestinalis. I have already sent up a short resume of part of my

researches on this form, together with some which I instituted on

Clavelina lepadiformis for purposes of comparison, for publication in the

' Proceedings of the Royal Society.' The paper in question was read

before the Royal Society on May 18 of this year (1892). It contained

an account of what I called a prohoscis cavity, which, on account of its
primary relative position to the endostyle, I homologised with the head
cavity or prse-oral coelom, or, in short, proboscis cavity of Amphioxus taken

in conjunction with the prse-oral pit.
     In Giona as in Amphioxus the primary axis of the endostyle is at right

angles to its deflnitive axis, and it lies in both cases tout-d-fait anterior
that is to say, immediately behind the cavity of the proboscis. The latter

structure in Giona carries at its anterior extremity the three adhering

papillfe.

     The first four primai-y stigmata of Giona arise on each side by sub-
division of one gill-slit, and not, as van Beneden and Julin assumed in
Phallusia scahro'ides, by separate perforations. This gill-slit I have
called the true first gill-slit of Ascidians, and homologised the pair of them
with the first pair of slits of Amphioxus which I have previously described
as closing up in the course of the metamorphosis.

     In Giona the heart arises by the splitting apart of the two layers com-
posing the septum, which at first divides the pericardium into two halves,
while in Glavelina, as shown by van Beneden and Julin, the correspond-
ing septum breaks down, and the heart forms by invagination of the

dorsal wall of the pericardium.

In both Glavelina and Giona the hypophysis is at first in free com-

munication  with the  cerebral  vesicle                                it is,  in  fact,  largely  formed  by  con-
                                                                    ;

striction from the wall of this vesicle. This is in profound opposition to

the account of van Beneden and Jalin, who state that in Glavelina the

hypophysis arises entirely by a caecal outgrowth from the wall of the

branchial cavity. I am absolutely at a loss to explain how they came to

Mythis result.  observations were first of all made on the larvas of

Giona, where the organs are extremely small and difficult to interpret ; but

still I convinced myself of the true condition of things, and immediately

assumed that in Glavelina the formation of the hypophysis occurred in &

rather different manner, which could be explained by the great modifica-

tion which Glavelina shows in its general development. When, however,

I came to examine how matters stood in the larva of Glavelina, I saw at
ON THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.  347

once that the relations of the hypophysis to the cerebral vesicle were
most emphatically the same as I bad found them in Gioiia.

      In the case of Glavelina the difficulty is not to see the connection of
the lumen of the hypophysis with the cerebral vesicle.

    From the observations of Kowalewsky as well as from my own, I

think it extremely probable that the opening of the hypophysis into the
branchial cavity is really the neuroporus, which is carried inside with the
stomodeeal invagination. Further, from a consideration of their respective

relations to the cerebral vesicle, I regard the hypophysis of Ascidians and
the so-called ' olfactory pit ' of A-niphioxus as homologous structures.

    The reason why the ' olfactory pit ' of Amphioxus does not open into
the buccal region of the pharynx is, that the month has been shifted from

its primitive relation to the neuroporus by the remarkable forward exten-
sion of the notocbord, the special character of which, necessitating a
special explanation, was recognised fifty years ago by Kolliker.

     Latterly the larvffi of Amphioxus have turned up in large quantities in
the Bay of Naples, and I have been studying the distribution of the
cranial nerves and the peripheral ganglion cells by means of the methyl-
blue method of Ehrlich, by means of which it is possible to stain the
living larvae, especially the nervous tissue.

    In this way also I have been able to control my former observations

on the metamorphosis of the larva of Amphioxus.

    I am about to publish a full account of the above researches in the

' Quarterly Jonrnal of Microscopical Science.'

    In conclusion, I beg to express my best thanks to the Committee of
the British Association for appointing me to the use of the table at

Naples.

and freshwater Crustacea, and his memoir is in an advanced state of
preparation. It will include those of St. Vincent and Grenada, and it
may be recalled that he has already worked out those groups from

Dominica.

     At the time of the last report Mr. Herbert H. Smith, the collector
employed by Mr. Godman, was engaged in making collections in zoology
in the island of Grenada. This collection has now been received in this
country, and great part of it mounted under the direction of Dr. Sharp.
From this island there are in his custody of mounted Coleoptera 16,700
specimens, of mounted Hymenoptera 1,380 specimens, of mounted Hemi-
ptera 1,215 specimens, of Hemiptera in spirit 400 specimens, of Ants in

--spirit about 600 specimens, of mounted Orthoptera 100 specimens in all

20,395 specimens. From the same island, and in the custody of Mr.
Godman, there are (all of them mounted) of Diptera about 2,620 speci-
 mens, of Homoptera 380 specimens, of Hemiptera 1,195 specimens, of
Neuroptera 112 specimens, of Orthoptera 100 specimens, of Hymenoptera

--227 specimens, of Lepidoptera 860 specimens in all 25,889 specimens

 from this island-- besides collections of land-shells, snakes, scorpions,

 myriapods, arachnida in spirit, &c., not yet examined.

    A small collection of birds made by Mr. Elliott during his visit to

Anguilla (referred to below) has been received and named by Dr. Sclater.

A list of the species will be published in the ' Proceedings of the Zoo-

 logical Society.'

                             BOTANT.

A paper by Mr. J. G. Baker ' On the Vascular Cryptogamia of the

Island of Grenada,' based on the collections made by Mr. R. V. Sherring,

who was sent to Grenada by the Committee during the winter of 1890-91,

has appeared in the 'Annals of Botany,' April, 1892. Among the orchids

collected by Mr. Sherring and named at Kew there are a number of

additions to the flora and several possible new species.

So little result in the way of novelty or additions to o\ir knowledge

of distribution appeared to follow the explorations of the Committee in

the matter of vascular plants that it was determined to devote attention

especially to the cellular cryptogams, of most branches of which an im-

perfect record existed. Mr. W. R. Elliott was accordingly sent to

St. Vincent for a period of six months to collect cellular cryptogams, and

with instructions to visit the little known island of Anguilla. Mr. Elliott

has sent home extensive collections (nearly 1,000 numbers altogether,

each well represented) from both islands, and they are now being worked

Aout at the British Museum.  small collection of flowering plants from

Anguilla which accompanied these possesses little interest. The fungi

have been already described in part by Mr. George Massee in a paper in

the ' Journal of Botany,' and twenty species of this group new to science

have thus far been discovered and here recorded. Mr. Antony Gepp has

undertaken to work out the Musci and Hepaticaa, of which an extensive

series has been collected ; and Mr. George Murray has undertaken the

Algae, from which group comparatively few novelties are expected, since

he has recently catalogued the marine Algae of this region. The Lichenes

have not been allotted. Mr. Elliott, having finished this part of his work,

viz., St. Vincent, has proceeded to Dominica, an island from which a

larger number of new records may be confidently anticipated, since it is
           ON THE FAUNA AND FLORA OF THE WEST INDIA ISLANDS. 355

niTich less cultivated, is covered with dense forest, and possesses a greater
range in elevation.

     The Committee recommend their reappointment with the following

--members: Dr. Sclater (Chairman), Mr. George Murray (Secretary),

Mr. Carruthers, Professor Newton, Mr. Godman, Dr. Giinther, Dr. Sharp,
Dr. Scott, and Colonel Feilden. The Committee also recommend that a

grant of 200Z. be placed at their disposal for the continuation of their
work.

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor A. Newton
     (Chairman), Dr. W. T. Blanford, Dr. S. J. Hickson, Professor
     KiLET, Mr. 0. Salvin, Dr. P. L. Sclater, Mr. E. A. Smith, and
     Mr. D. Sharp (Secretary), appointed to report on the present
      state of our knowledge of the Zoology of the Sandivich Islands,
     and to take steps to investigate ascertained deficiencies in the
     Fauna, with power to co-operate ivith the Committee appointed
    for the purpose by the Royal Society, and to avail themselves of

    such assistance in their investigations as may be offered by

     the Hawaiian Government.

Tour committee met that appointed by the Royal Society, and a joint
committee was formed, with Professor Newton as Chairman, Dr. Hickson,
Treasurer, and Mr. D. Sharp, Secretary. The joint committee decided to

send out a competent collector to the islands, and finally Selected, from

among several candidates who presented themselves, Mr. R. C. L. Perkins,

B.A., of Jesus College, Oxford.

      Mr. Perkins left England in February last, and reached Honolulu in
March. Letters received from him since then give assurance that he is
sparing no effort to carry out successfully the task with which he has
been entrusted, and a case containing the material results of his first two

months' work in Oahu is now on its way to England by sea, its trans-

mission by the nearest route being considered inexpedient.
     The Committee have left considerable discretion to Mr. Perkins in

regard to his operations in the islands, and it being evident that the
birds and some groups of molluscs are those which chiefly attract the
amateur collector, he has rather devoted his attention to the rest of the
fauna, which unless taken in hand by some body, such as this committee,
-would probably not be investigated at all. At the same time, Mr. Perkins
has been directed to pay attention to certain points in Ornithology and
 Malacology which require elucidation, and the Committee are confident
that he will not neglect them. To attend to these points in Ornithology,
to collect the Mollusca with special attention to their local range, and to

make as complete a collection as may be possible of the other invertebrate

fauna will, the Committee consider, occupy Mr. Perkins for fully two

years.

      The Committee have no reason to think that Mr. Perkins is incurring
any unnecessary expenses ; but the cost of living and travelling in the

 islands is very considerable, and, in order to retain that gentleman's

services so as to complete the task in the way the Committee think de-

                                                                                                                      AA2

Birable, additional funds must be found. The Committee therefore request

that they may be reappointed with the same powers as before, and that
the sum of 200Z. be placed at their disposal.

Repoo't of the Committee, consisting of Professor Eat Lankester
     (Chairman), Professor M. Foster, Professor S. H. Vines, and
     Mr. S. F. Harmer (Secretary), appointed for the purpose of
     arranging for the occupation of a Table at the Laboratory of
     the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth.

The amount of the grant placed at the disposal of the Committee for the
present year was V?l. 10s., being the unexpended balance of the grant of

the previous year.

     The Committee have received four applications for the use of a table,
but their funds have not allowed them to make more than three
nominations, of which one was for a shorter period than was asked for.

   --They have nominated

          Mr. F. W. Gamble, B.Sc, of Owens College, Manchester, for

                   two months from August 1, 1892.
            Mr. Edgar J. Allen, of University College, London, for six weeks

                    from June 3, 1892.
            Mr. Gregg Wilson, M.A., B.Sc, Assistant to the Professor of

                    Natural History at the University of Edinburgh, for one
                  month from August 15, 1892.

     As has been the case on previous occasions, the Committee have
included in the above periods the month which belongs to the Association

free of charge.

     Mr. Gamble proposes to work at the Tnrbellarian Fauna of Plymouth
Sound and its neighbourhood. Mr. Allen, who is already at Plymouth,,
intends to use his time there for the study of the development of Decapod
Crustacea. Mr. Gregg Wilson proposes to investigate the Food of

Fishes.

     The Committee expressed the hope in their last report that they
would be able to give in their report for this year some account of the
results arrived at by the persons who were appointed with the assistance
of the grant made at the meeting of the Association in 1890. As these
appointments fell within the months July-September 1891 it was
obviously impossible to incorporate their results in the last report. The
Committee are glad to be in a position to furnish the following infor-
mation with regard to the results of their expenditure of 1 21. \0s. of the

previous grant :

                             I. Report on the Occupation of the Table.

                         By Miss Florence Buchanan, B.Sc.

     Last year, owing to the kindness of the British Association, I was
enabled to spend the month of July at the Marine Biological Laboratory
at Plymouth. I went down intending to work at some points in the
    ON THE LABORATORY OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 357

anatomy of Polych^t worms, and to determine the amount of value to be
attached to chset^ and parapodia of homologous segments as a means of
classification. I found, however, that I must begin by identifying the
difi'erent forms occurring at Plymouth, as very little work had been done
there on Polychsets up to that time. Seeing that every Polychaet has,

on the average, a good many more than half a dozen names, and that
each name belongs to about half a dozen different Polycheets, this is no

very easy task, and it has occupied me, on and off, since my return from

Plymouth in the Zoological Laboratory of University College, London,

and I am afraid is not yet complete. I obtained, altogether, over a

hundred different species, some of them found, I believe, for the first time
on our coast, and a few which seem to be new altogether. With regard

to the collection of them, I have to thank my fellow-workers in the

laboratory, and especially Mr. Garstang, for much help given me. I
must also thank Mr. Cunningham for notes and drawings of some of
the Plymouth Polychaets found there up to that time, which he kindly

placed at my disposal. With regard to the naming of them, I have

received a good deal of assistance from an incomplete and as yet
unpublished ' Synonymous List of Polychget Worms,' by Professor

Haddon, which he has kindly put into my hands for revision and

completion.

     The most interesting of the new forms obtained is a small Eunicid,

resembling the genus Ophryotrocha of Claparede and Metschnikoff (' Z. f,

w. Z.' XIX. p. 184, PI. XIII. fig. 2) in having the larval ciliated bands
persistent in the adult. The shape of the jaws and parapodia (which I
propose to figure in giving a full account of this small worm elsewhere),

the possession of two pairs of prostomial tentacles instead of only one, and
these both provided with stiff hairs not only in the young stages but in
the adult, seem to me, however, to mark it off as a distinct genus,
although certainly more nearly allied to Ophryotrocha than to any other
known Annelid. There is a ciliated band on the prostomium, and one on
each of the following segments. All the segments after the first two

(and the last two or three in small specimens) have well-developed para-
podia, each consisting of a chaetigerous lobe containing both simple and
compound chtetiB, and a small cirrus. In the body-cavity and in the
parapodia of most of the specimens eggs are to be found, which, curiously

enough, like those of Ophryotroclia, are generally double, consisting,

namely, of a large granular part, of a yellowish-brown colour, containing

(in this case, but evidently not in the eggs of Ophryotroclia) the nucleus,
and a smaller colourless part (containing the nucleus in eggs of Ophryo-

troclia) which stains very deeply with carmine. Whether this smaller

part represents a polar body or not remains to be determined. Sections
show that at least one pair of excretory organs is present in the shape
of small tubes blocked up by yellow concretions lying in the second
and third segments and (?) opening at the side of the second to the

exterior.

     The only other form amongst those I have as yet examined which may
rank as a new genus is a member of the family Ampharetea, differing from
Samytha and Amage especially in having a large number of segments (at

least thirty-seven) with uncinigerous pinnules behind those with bundles

of capillary setee. It would either form a new genus with the Samytha

pallescens of Theel (' Kongl. Sv. Vet. Ak. Handlingar,' Bd. XVI.), which
he places doubtfully as a Samytha, or the genus Samytha must be enlarged
.

--358 KEPOET 1892.

to include, not only both these forms, but the genus Amage as well ; or
even both these genera might be swallowed up in the still older genus

SabelUdes.

     The other forms I collected at Plymouth I will here only just briefly

enumerate in so far as I have at present identified them, leaving any re-

marks I may have to make on them for publication in the ' M.B.A.
Journal,' to which the director has asked me to contribute by degrees an

annotated catalogue of the Polychaets occurring near Plymouth. Although

I have several specimens of species belonging to the families Polynoidea,

Lycoridea, and Serpulacea, I have at present identified so very few of

them, except the quite common ones, that I think it best to omit them

altogether in the following list. I will mark with an asterisk those forms

Awhich I believe not to have been found on the British coast before.                '

satisfied with the identity of the specimen in my possession with the

name I have given it, or that the specimen was not complete enough for

    Although I am otherwise leaving the family Serpulacea unmentioned,

I will just note that belonging to the tribe Amphicoridee I found not only
several specimens ofFahricIa, but also two oiHaplohranchus (A. G. Bourne),

hitherto only known to occur at the mouth of the Thames. These were
found in tide-pools not far from the mouth of the Tealm.

    With regard to the second object of my visit to Plymouth, namely,

to find out how great or how little is the range of variation in homo-
logous parapodia, I collected whilst there a large number of specimens

of the only Polychset obtainable in any great abundance, namely, Nereis
diversicolor, and have begun making camera drawings of parapodia of

certain segments in each specimen.
360 EEPOET-- 1892.

     Of course a list of specimens collected during a montli's stay at
Plymouth cannot be taken as by any means a complete list of forms

occurring there, and, while expressing my thanks to tbe British Associa-
tion for so kindly allowing me the use of its table last year, I should

like at the same time to express the hope that on some future occasion

it will enable me to continue the work, and, having got over the drudgery
of mere labelling, to pass on to some of the many interesting morpho-

logical problems connected with Polychsets which I'emain to be worked

out.

II. Heport on the Occupation of the Table. Some preliminary notes on the
    anatomy and habits of Alcyonium digitatum. By Mr. Sydney J. Hick-
     son, M.A., Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge.

     Alcyonium digitatum is one of the most difficult Ccelenterates to kill
in a fully expanded condition. In the first place it is only extremely
rarely that the large proportion of the polypes of a specimen in an

aquarium fully expand themselves, and when they are in that condition

the slightest touch or irritation of any part of the colony causes an

immediate contraction of the tentacles. Again, when a favourable

opportunity arises it is found that all the neutral killing reagents, such

as corrosive sublimate, &c., fail to kill the polypes before they have time
to partially retract. The only method that gives tolerably satisfactory

results is Lo Bianco's No. II. chromo-acetic acid method, and this of

course partially dissolves the calcareous spicules.

    When a living specimen of an Alcyonium digitatum is examined in
an aquarium the polypes may frequently be observed in various stages of

expansion and retraction. Sometimes all the polypes are completely
retracted, but I have never yet observed in any specimen all the polypes

fully expanded at the same time. By far the most frequent condition of

the Alcyonium is one in which a few polypes here and there are fully
expanded; others expanded but with their tentacles contracted, and
others only just protruding from the surface of the colony.

     These two stages are the normal ones that each polype passes through

in reaching complete reti'action from complete expansion. When the

polype is completely expanded both the body-wall and the tentacles are
delicate and transparent.

     The first stage in the retraction is the contraction of the tentacles.
The crown of the polype becomes roughly octagonal in shape with an

obtuse solid knob, the contracted tentacle, at each angle.

     In the next stage the contracted tentacles bend over towards the
mouth, and concurrently with the retraction of the body of the polype

they sink into a circular fold of the body- wall.
     The invagination of the polype then proceeds at the base until the

crown covered by the fold of body-wall sinks below the surface of the

·colony.

    When the crown has sunk below the surface of the colony the aperture

is closed by the folding of the delicate body-wall of the base of the

polype over the  crown                                but when the  colony enters  into a state of  com-
                                                   ;

plete contraction, as it does, for example, when it is taken out of the

water for a few minutes, the tough obtuse surface of the colony contracts

over this delicate base, leaving only a star-like slit to mark the position

of the retracted polype.
    ON THE LAB0RAT0E7 OF THE MAEINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 361

     The ectoderm is in the uninjured specimens composed of several
layers of cells. Under unhealthy conditions the superficial layei's are

apt to slough.

     The stomodfeum of each fully-developed polype opens into a long
coolenteron that passes down to the base of the colony. In a longitudinal
section through a branch of the colony the coelentera spread from the
base in a fan-like manner towards the periphery.

     Between the coelentera there is a dense, clear mesogloea containing
spicules, endodermic cell-cords, a very delicate network of nerve (?)

fibrils and cells.
     The young polypes originate in these endodermic cords, the coelentera

being developed later, and do not communicate directly with the coelentera
of the older polypes until they are nearly full grown.

     The endodermic cords are usually described as canals, but there is no
evidence of the presence of a lumen. Numerous injection experiments
failed to prove the existence of any cavity in these structures.

     The nerve (?) netwoi'k can only be made out in fresh osmic acid

preparations. It consists of a fine network of delicate fibrils connecting
isolated mono-, bi-, and tri-polar cells. It is difficult to trace in the
peripheral parts of the colony, the presence of a very large number of
spicules making it very difficult to cut thin sections of the fresh

tissues.

    When the tide is low in the tropics some forms of Zoophytes, such as

Tiibipora, Glaviblaria, Sarcophytum, the Astrteidfe, and a few others,
remain expanded until the water actually leaves tbe reefs. Others, on
the other hand, such as Heliojjora, Millepora, and most of the Madrepores,
completely retract while there is still a foot or more of water covering
them. Some zoophytes, in fact, appear to anticipate low tide before

others, and it occun-ed to me that this might be due, to a certain extent,

to the development of a rhythm similar to the rhythmic movements of

certain plants.
      In order to determine, if possible, the truth or falsity of this supposi-

tion I made last autumn a series of experiments upon Alcyonium digita-
tum in the tanks at the Plymouth Laboratory.

     I placed a number of sjsecimens of Alcyonmm digitatum, collected
partly in the shallow water of the Catwater and partly in deeper water
ofi' the Eddystone Lighthouse, in one of tbe tanks, and I noticed that
nearly all of them contracted completely twice in every twenty-four

hours for the first three or four days.

     Those that did not contract in this manner soon showed bubbles of
gas in their tissues and commenced to putrefy.

     I also placed a number of specimens in another tank in which I
arranged an artificial tide by means of syphons. It was so arranged that

--the water should run off but not so completely as to leave the Alcyo-

--niums uncovered in twelve hours and fill up again in twelve hours.

The Alcyoniums contracted with tolerable regularity twice in twenty-
four hours for the first two days, and then contracted quite irregularly,
some only once, some twice. At the end of a fortnight two out of the

three that remained in a healthy condition contracted regularly only once

in twenty-four hours.
      These experiments appear to indicate, first, that there is a rhythmic

·contraction of the polypes of Alcyonium digitatum in the normal condi-

tions twice in every twenty-four hours ; second, that a new rhythm may
--362 REPORT 1892.

be induced by an artificial tide of different duration to the natural

one.

     On tbe other hand, the results of the investigation are not altogether
satisfactory, on account of, first, the large number of specimens that

became unhealthy during the pi'ogress of the experiment; second, the
fact that the only three specimens that survived in the tank with the
artificial tide were taken from the deep water off the Eddystone.

     Far more satisfactory results would probably be obtained, if experi-
ments were tried upon a number of Alcyoniums taken from shallow

water direct and placed in the tanks. Many of the specimens collected

from the Catwater were probably taken by the trawlers from deep water
and thrown overboard as they entered the hai'bour, and were in conse-
quence in an unhealthy condition when collected.

    The subject, however, seems to me to be worthy of further investiga-

tion.

   III. Report on the Occupation of the Table. By Mr. Arthur Willet.

     I spent six weeks in the laboratory at Plymouth during the months-
of August and September 1891.

     I was at first engaged in the study of a new genus of compound
ascidians from Japan, belonging to the family of the Didemnidte, and

have already published a short description of it, in conjunction with my

friend Mr. Asajiro Oka, in the ' Quarterly Journal of Microscopical
Science ' for January 1892.

     I also made observations on the tadpoles of Styela grossularia, and of
another small red and white Ascidian which lives on shells and .stones at
the bottom of the Sound, and occurs in mulberry-like masses, and which
I take to be Polycarpa glomerata. In these forms the embryonic
development up to the stage of the free-swimming tadpole takes place in
the peribranchial chamber, a portion of which is converted into a special
brood pouch traversed by vascular trabeculae. The tadpoles of these

Ascidians are remarkable for possessing a complete ring of hollow ecto-
dermic tentacle-like processes which surrounds the anterior portion of
the larva, at the extremity of which are borne the three adhering papillee.

The mouth is not enclosed by this ring of tentacles, but lies outside it.
Similar tentacles occur in the tadpoles of the Botryllidse and the Didem-

nidse.

     Their presence in Simple Ascidians is rather extraordinary, and seems
to occur in correlation with the fact, already mentioned, that in these par-
ticular Simple Ascidians, by way of an exception, the development up to
the tadpole stage takes place in the body of the parent. The large
quantity of yolk which renders the eggs and larvae of these forms so
opaque must also be brought into relation with the mode of development.
It seems to be a general rule that in the Simple Ascidians the embryonic

development is a pelagic one, while in the Compound Ascidians the
development takes place in some part or other of the parent colony. To

this rule, of course, the two species of Simple Ascidians mentioned above
form exceptions.

     In the living tadpole blood can be seen flowing into the tentacles.

They are capable of distension and contraction according to the degree
of turgidity in which they are kept by the blood inside them. Their

actual function is at present that of accessory adhering organs. When
   ON THE LABORATORY OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION. 363

the larva fixes itself in the usual way by the three adhering papilla, the
whole anterior portion of the body becomes drawn in or introverted, and
the body of the larva presents an autero-posteriorly flattened appearance
with a cup- shaped depression in front, round which the tentacles project
and attach themselves by their free extremities to the surface to which
the larva has fixed itself, which may be a rock or another Ascidian of
the same species. I have referred to these tentacle-like processes in the
paper quoted above, and have there figured a larva with a dozen ten-
tacles. They have nothing to do with budding either actually or primi-
tively in any Ascidian.

     I also made some experiments on the larvae of Styela grossularia, in
which I succeeded in very sensibly hastening the change of form (i.e.,
flattening of the body of the larva) which takes place during the meta-

morphosis, by cutting oS" the tails of the larvte. I should say that the
actual fixation of the larva is not an indispensable preliminary to the
commencement of the metamorphosis, the most obvious accompaniments
of which are the abovementioned flattening of the body and the absorp-

tion of the tail of the larva. By keeping a series of normal larvae in one

dish, and a series of larv« with docked tails in another dish at the same
time, I was able to compare the rate of change of shape in the two cases,
and the difference was most striking.

     The work which I commenced at the laboratory of the Marine
Biological Association at Plymouth was continued at the Zoological
Station at Naples, where I also had the privilege of occupying the table

of the British Association, and the results of my work there will be given

in another report.

     The Committee venture to hope that the Association will again place
in their hands a grant of 30^., or of any smaller sum, to enable them to
continue to nominate workers at the Plymouth Laboratory. They believe
that the utility of the grant is becoming more widely appreciated, and
they feel that the grant has been well and usefully employed. Tliey

desire to point out that, even if they should not be reappointed, the

Association should make some permanent provision for nominating a
worker for one month in every year ; a privilege which belongs to the

Association, free of charge, by virtue of its position as a Governor of the
Marine Biolosrical Association.

Sixth Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor M. Foster
     {Chairman), Professor F. 0. Bower {Secretary), Professor
    I. Bayley Balfour, Mr. W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, Dr. H. Trimen,
    Professor Marshall Ward, Mr. W. Carruthers, Professor
    M, M. Hartog, and Mr. W. Gtardiner, for taking steps to

     establish a Botanical Laboratory at Peradeniya, Ceylon.

The Committee report that, no grant having been asked for at the meet-

ing at Cardiff, no accounts have to be rendered.
     Professor J. Bretland Farmer has in the course of the year returned,

after spending five months in Ceylon, and has brought back with him
                      --

364 REPORT-- 1892.

large collections of material for further work. He has sent to the

Committee a report, which is appended :
     The Committee, having at present before them no application for use

of the laboratory, do not propose to ask for a grant this year. Bat as
the Committee are informed that an application will be made, they request

that they be reappointed, with Professor Fai-mer as secretary.

                      APPENDIX I.

           Beport hy Professor J. Bretland Farmer.

    In December 1890 I left England for Ceylon, having received from
the Grant Committee of the British Association the sum of 50Z., to be

expended in apparatus and fittings for the laboratory at Peradeniya.

The chief pieces of apparatus consisted of a ^-plate camera by Watson, a
large Zeiss dissecting microscope and lenses, and a large and sensitive

balance. In addition to these I further took a small supply of glass
apparatus and chemical I'eagents.

    On my arrival at Peradeniya in January 1 891 I proceeded to make

arrangements for storing the apparatus, &c., which I had brought, and
also to make a catalogue of the existing apparatus and fittings at present

available in the laboratory.

     Through the kindness of the Director of the Gardens I was enabled to
fit up a spare room as a photographic dark room.

    For the guidance of those who may in future visit the laboratory

with the intention of working there, I would suggest that it will

probably be necessary to take out such glass apparatus and bottles as

they may require, since, owing to the action of the climate, articles made

of ordinary glass soon become corroded, appearing as if they had been

exposed to the action of hydrofluoric acid.

    During my visit to Ceylon I made the laboratory my working head-
quarters, sorting and preserving my collections thei'e in the intervals

between various expeditions. I paid especial attention to the Hepaticse,

and for the purpose of securing as many as possible of these plants I

travelled over a considerable part of the country, especially the hilly

mydistricts. I hope shortly to be able to publish some of  observations

on the material thus gathered, which includes, besides some probably new

species, several little known and interesting forms.

     I also obtained a quantity of material for working out the de-
velopment and structure of several species of the genus Christisonia,

which occurs as a parasite on the Strobilanths and various species of

Bamboo.

I was fortunate enough, after repeated search, to obtain prothallia

and embryos of Anglopteris evecta, and thus to study the development of
at least one member of a group of ferns concerning whose embryology
we possess at present no information. These results are in course of

mpublication in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' and extenso in the

' Annals of Botany.'

Besides the abovementioned instances I collected a considerable

quantity of material of a varied kind, some of which has been already

worked out in the Peradeniya Laboratory. Amongst this material I may
mention a Podostemon, which appears to be a new form, and one of some

interest.
     ON A BOTANICAL LABORATORY AT PERADENITA.                                         365

    I cannot conclude this outline report of my work in Ceylon without
expressing my sense of the great kindness which I received at the hands of

Dr. Trimen, tlie Director of the Gardens : without this help I should have
been able to take but a small advantage, comparatively speaking, of the
great opportunities I enjoyed during the few months I spent in the

tropics.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Vroiessor A. Newton {Chair-
     man), Mr. John Cordeaux {Secretary), Messrs. R. M. Barrington,
    John A. Harvie-Brown, W. Eagle Clarke, and the Rev. E. P.
     Knubley, appointed to make a digest of the observations on the
     Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Light-vessels, and to

     report on the same.

The Committee are not yet in a position to announce the completion
of the digest of the migration returns, with which, however, great and
satisfactory progress has been made during the past twelve months by
Mr. W. Eagle Clarke, one of their body, on the plan announced in last
year's I'eport. So much having been done, they trust that the Association
will think fit to reappoint them in order that the heavy task may even-

tually be completed.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor A. C. Haddon,

    Professor W. A. Herdman, and Mr. W. E. Hoyle {Secretary),
     appointed for improving and experimenting with a Deep-sea
     Tow-net for opening and closing under water.

The Committee have to report that the apparatus for opening and closing
the tow-net by electricity, which was provisionally exhibited in an un-
finished state at Cardiff, has been completed and is ready for use so soon

as an opportunity for experimenting in deep water shall present itself.

Although the Committee have made inquiries in all directions that
seemed likely, no such opportunity has presented itself during the past
twelve months. Seeing that the kind of conducting cable which would
be necessary for working the apparatus would depend upon the nature
of the dynamo available for generating the electric curi-ent, the Com-

mittee have not judged it prudent to expend the grant in the purchase of
such a cable prematurely, and hence the grant has been returned to the

Treasurer.

     The Committee suggest that they should be reappointed ; they intend
to apply for a new grant at some future date.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. Thomas H. Thomas
     {Chairman), Professors W. Newton Parker, A. Newton, and
     A. Leipner, Mr. E. Poulton, Canon H. B. Tristram, and Dr. C.
     T. Vaghell {Secretary), appointed to consider proposals for the
     Legislative Protection of Wild Birds' Eggs.

The Committee have to report that in consequence of the near approach
of a General Election, it seemed to them quite useless to take any further

steps during the present Session of Parliament, as no Bill of the kind
ON THE rnOTECTION OF WILD TilRDs' EGGS.  36?

could possibly pass both Houses. It also became evident, upon full
examination, that the Bill introduced by Mr. Alfred E. Pease in 1891,
which was suggested as a basis of action by the Committee, would,
although its principle was in agreement with the object for which the
CommTttee was appointed, nevertheless need to be considerably modified

before it could satisfy the Committee.

     Under these circumstances the Committee ask to be reappointed, in
order that they may endeavour to secure the introduction of a Bill in the

new Parliament.
      This report was inadvertently not submitted to Professor Newton,

who is therefore not responsible for its conclusions.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. E. Gr. Ravenstein, Mr.

     Baldwin Latham, and Mr. Gr. J. Symons (Secretary), appointed
     to inquire into the Glimatological and Hydrographical condi-
     tions of Tropical Africa. {Drawn up by Mr. E. Gr. Raven-

       stein.)

1. The work of your committee naturally falls into two branches, viz.,
Jirsf, the collecting and epitomising of all available series of meteoro-

logical observations ; and, secondly, the exercise of a friendly influence

over existing, and the eqaipment of new stations, likely to pro-
mote a better knowledge of the climatological conditions of tropical

 Africa.

      2. As regards the first of these objects, your committee have pre-

 pared abstracts of the records of sixty-seven stations (including forty-two

 at which the observations extended over one year). As the places for
 which there exist records for at least one year number close upon eighty,
 your committee deemed it advisable to postpone the publication of
 these abstracts until it shall be possible to present them in a collected

 form.

      Unpublished series of observations have been received by your com-
 mittee from Captain Chippendale (Upper Nile, 1874-5), Rev. C. Paul
 (Kipo Hill, 1881), Rev. Mr. Wakefield (Ribe, 1886-7), Rev. G. Smith

 (Asuan and Wadi Haifa, 1884-5), Rev. R. S. Hynde (Domasi, 1888-9),
 and Captain Gallwey (Benin, 1891).

      Your committee ai-e likewise indebted for useful information and
 printed meteorological records to Captain Capello, Prof. Neumayer, Dr.
 Tacchini, Prof. Angot, Dr. Etienne, and M. A. Lancaster.

      3. As the funds placed at the disposal of your committee are not

 sufficient for the establishment of independent stations, with paid ob-
  servers, they are constrained to confine themselves to the distribution of
  ' Instructions ' specially adapted for tropical Africa, and calculated to
 ensure the trustworthiness and uniformity of the records, and of blank
  forms intended to ensure uniformity in the record of observations, and,
  in a few cases, to the supply of instruments to approved volunteer

  observers.
            --

 368 REPORT-- 1892.

      The ' Instructions ' direct observations to be taken either thrice daily
 (at 9 A.M., 2 P.M., and 7 p.m.), or once daily (at 9 a.m.), as also at two-

 hourly intervals on certain term-days.

      The ' Instructions ' which are being distributed among all observers

 stationed in Africa are to be supplemented, where necessary, by a copy
 of the ' Hints for Observers,* issued by the Royal Meteorological

  Society.

      4. The instruments supplied include, as a rule, four thermometers-
 (max., min., wet and dry bulb), and a five-inch rain gauge. The
 thermometers are placed within a galvanised iron cage, which they
 have specially devised for use in Africa. Additional instruments are

 to bo supplied as may be required and funds permit, as also a

 standard barometer, where a guarantee can be given for its safe con-

 veyance.

     5. Up to the present, sets of instruments have been granted only to
Mr. J. W. Moir (Nyasa) and Captain Gallwey (Benin), but further

 applications are under consideration.

      6. Your committee have expended 50Z. out of the 75Z. granted, and
they beg to propose that they be reappointed, with the addition of Dr.
H. R. Mill, and that a grant be made of 50Z., being 251. of last year's
grant not drawn, and a fresh grant of 251.

Report of the Covimitteey consisting of Dr. J. H. GtLadstone
     (Chairman), Professor H, E. Armstrong {Secretary), Mr. S.
     Bourne, Dr. Crosskey, Mr. G-. Gladstone, Mr. J. Heywood,
     Sir John Lubbock, Sir Philip Magnus, Professor N. Story

     Maskelyne, Sir H. E. Roscoe, Sir K. Temple, and Professor

      S. P. Thompson, appointed for the purpose of continuing
      the inquiries relating to the teaching of Science in Elementary

       Schools.

The return of the Education Department issued this year enables your

committee to form an idea of the effect which the considerable changes
in the Code of 1890 have had on the teaching of science. It will be
remembered that the principal differences between this Code and that
which had been in force for eight years consist in the optional character
of ' Encrlish ' as a class subject, thus giving more opportunity to the
study of Geography and Elementary Science ; the alternative courses of
these two last subjects ; the separation of Euclid and Mensuration as
specific subjects ; and the abolition of the more theoretical course of
Mechanics.

     The number of departments of schools in which these class subjects
have been examined by H.M. Inspector during these eight years have

been as follows :

It will be remarked tliat the growth in the study of Algebra has con-

tinned                                 that  of  Mensuration   greatly                  exceeds     that                        of     Euclid  and  Men-

Physiology has lost ground somewhat, and that of Botany has gained.

In Physical Science the recent increase in Chemistry has not been main-

tained,                                nor   that  of  Sound,  Light, and                      Heat                             while  Magnetism    and

Electricity are fast regaining their early popularity. It will be seen that

the gross number of passes has largely increased. The returns do not
now give the actual number of children examined in Standards V., VI.,
and VII., but it is possible to arrive at a very close approximation, viz.,

497,300. Adopting this figure, we are able to add this year's percentage

of the number of passes in these specific subjects, as compared with the
number of children qualified to take them, to the returns given in former

reports.

of scientific subjects, and its adoption in the girls' schools has become
very general. They are aware that it is often taught in such a way as to
have little, if any, scientific value ; but they believe it is capable of being
made extremely valuable in this respect: it should be always taught,
as far as possible, experimentally and practically. The simple scientific
principles which underlie ordinary domestic operations, such as laying a

fire, washing clothes, ventilation of rooms, preparation of food, &c.,
should be explained. Then the lessons would be rendered far more in-
telligent and interesting. Arrangements are made by some of the prin-

cipal School Boards for teaching Domestic Economy in this way.

      It goes without saying that the value of the cookery lessons which
are now being so much encouraged will depend largely on the knowledge
of the principles of Chemistry and Physics possessed by the teacher, and

infused into her teaching.                    ,.                   ,            miuhe

     Of course these day and evening schools lead np to the technical schools
of various kinds which are now being rapidly established throughout the

kingdom. These do not strictly fall within the scope of the reference to
your committee ; but it is pleasant to record that the County Councils of

London and Middlesex have now followed the lead of the other councils
in appropriating the Customs and Excise grant, either wholly or iu part,

to the purposes of technical instruction.

ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

Second Meport on the Development of Graphic Methods in Mecha-

    nical iScience. By Professor H. S. Hele Shaw, M.Inst.G.E.

                  [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

Three years ago a preliminary report was presented on the above subject

by the Committee, consisting of Mr. W. H. Preece (Chairman), Mr. (now
Sir) Benjamin Baker, Messrs. W. Anderson and G. Kapp, Professors

J. Perry and R. H. Smith, with the present writer as Secretary, who, at
the meeting in the following year, was requested by the Sectional Com-
mittee to draw up and complete the report. Owing to causes which
were explained in a letter to the Committee last year, he was unable to

do this in time for the following meeting, and now begs to present the
result of his work up to the present time on the subject.

     The preliminary report gave a list of a number of works which
avowedly dealt with graphic methods, but at the same time it was stated
that a large number of standard works based to a great extent on such
methods, or in which such methods were frequently applied, were

excluded from the list.

     It does not require much acquaintance with the subject to realise that

there is scarcely a treatise or publication dealing with mechanical science
that does not employ some kind of graphical expression as a means of

exposition or calculation. How great the range is may be gathered from

a consideration that graphic methods really include every way of repre-
senting numerical quantities by means of drawing, except 1. The repre-

sentation of actual bodies ; and 2. Purely geometrical construction.

Hence we have to go back very early in the history of mechanical science

to find the first graphic treatment of the subject.

   A study of the list of references to graphic applications in the scientific

literature of this country appended to this report will show that gradu-
ally, but with an ever-increasing rate, it has become the custom to employ
representations of numerical results graphically, and to suggest and use
the solutions of various problems by graphic methods.

     These two purposes, viz.

         1. Representation of results by means of plotted curves and auto-

                 graphic diagrams

         2. Solution of problems by graphical methods,

seem to suggest a satisfactory way of dealing with the subject. At the
same time, no hard-and-fast distinction must be insisted on, because a

curve, although chiefly useful for the purpose of representing the general

results of an experiment or calculation, may be employed, by means of

interpolation or otherwise, to effect a calculation.
     (1) It would be quite legitimate in this report to trace the develop-

ment of the represention of results, but the best method of procedure is
to state the results which have been achieved, as this aspect is the
practical and useful one.

     Inasmuch as every possible kind of numerical quantity can be plotted,
it would not be possible, even if it were desirable, to give anything like a

complete list of the subjects which have been, or may be, plotted.

Further, in dealing with instruments used for the purpose, there must be
          ----

374 EEPORT-- 1892.

omissions, because descriptions of many such instruments have not been

published                                               heuce the object of the writer in dealing with this part of the
                                                     ;

report has been to give a concise statement of the progress and present

state of the subject.

     At the same time thte difiBculty of ascertaining what subjects in

mechanical engineering have been treated graphically in current litera-

ture is very great, and nothing less than an examination of every page of
engineering journals and scientific papers suffices for this purpose, since

no intimation of graphical treatment is usually given in the index.

Hence a list of references has been added to this report, arranged under
suitable headings of the more important applications of mechanical

science, wherever such applications have been graphically treated. In

one column the names of the subjects are given under which the article

is found in the journal ; in another, the description of the graphic

diagram ; in another, the author's name. The arrangement of matter
under each heading is in the order of the year of publication, so that
anyone searching for graphical records on a certain subject will see at
once what is old and what is new.

     (2) Very different, however, is the case of the graphical treatment of
problems. This is a subject of very divided opinion, whereas the mere
representation of results has settled down into recognised lines and

methods of operation. Great as the progress has been in this direction,

it will be seen that there is a wide field for discussion in the present

state of the question ; hence in this portion of the report an attempt has

been made to present the views of different schools of thought, and to
state the results achieved up to the present. At the same time, the
question is far too wide to be treated in the present report in a way at all
justified by its importance, and it is a question for the Association to decide

whether a further report, dealing more fully with foreign literature and

practice in graphic methods in relation to mechanical science, is not

desirable.

     To the treatment of the subject thus divided there is prefixed a

statement of the geometrical principles involved in the methods of

graphical representation. This preliminary statement is necessary to

show both the possibilities and methods of graphical records, as well

as to premise the considerations in the second portion, dealing with

calculation.

The foregoing remarks will explain the following scheme of the

report :

                                                        Scheme of Report.

     I. Geometrical considerations involved in (1) the representation of
results graphically, and in (2) gi-aphical calculations :

        1. Use of one dimension of space corresponding to measurement
                from one fixed point in a plane, enabling one vai'iable to be
               dealt with. The use of two dimensions of space corresponding
               to the measurement from two fixed points in a plane, enabling
                two variable quantities to be represented by the position of a
               point. The use of three dimensions, or of representation of
                three variables by the positions of a point, involves the use of
                models or stereotomy, and is excluded from consideration in

                 treating of graphical methods.

        2. Practical distinction between analytical treatment and geometry
              of position. The Graphical Calculus.

                                 I. Geometrical Considerations.

    Let us suppose we have a plane surface, or what may be developed

into a plane surface, e.g., a paper wrapped upon a cylindrical barrel, which
we propose to use for graphical purposes.

     If we take any point upon the surface, we can represent any numerical
quantity by its distance from some other fixed points, the position of
which we suppose to be known, writing beside the point, or representing
by means of some notation, what particular thing the numerical quantity-
is supposed to refer to. By taking a number of points we may represent
any number of numerical quantities by their distances from the fixed
point, and there is no limit to the number of ways in which we may do
this ; for instance, we may take them ranged along one straight line, just

as in the graduation of scales and similar instruments, where each reading
measures the distance from the zero of the scale ; as, for instance, the kind
of graphic record of magnitudes represented by the distances OA, OB,

OC, OD, and OE in fig. 1.

                                                                    Fig. 1.

       Instead of a point being taken alcmg a straight line, i.e., in one direc-

 tion, the same points may be taken in different directions, as shown in
--376 KEPORT 1892.

fig. 2, and the relative distances of each made more obvious upon inspec-

Ation by the line of direction being separate and distinct.  still cleaver

result is obtained by adding a constant length to each distance, which is

    When a fixed point is taken infinitely distant, the arc becomes a

straight line, and the distance measured perpendicular to it and parallel
to each other, as in fig. 4.

     This is the most common and convenient way of popularising

statistics graphically, and enables various numerical quantities to be
compared.

various data about different railways conapared in this way.'

This method of employing only one dimension of space, or using the

scalars of Sir W. R. Hamilton,              Fig. 4.

point on the surface represents by its distance from two fixed points two

numerical facts. By the use of a third fixed point the power of represent-

Aing results is in no way augmented, for the position of is fixed by its

distance from Oi and O2, so that no fresh fact, independent of the two
previous ones, can be represented by its distance from O3. This is not a
mere accident, to be avoided by any geometrical device, but is the result
of using for a gra,phic diagram two dimensions of space in the form of a

surface, either plane or developable into a plane. Hereafter a device will
be noticed by which, representing artificially three dimensions of space,

a third independent variable may apparently, though not really, be repre-
sented. Hence it may be said that two conditions determine the position

of every point, and, conversely, every point represents two conditions,
and two only.

     Just as with one fixed point, when one dimension of space only was
employed, any number of numerical facts could be represented by taking
any required number of points, so with the use of two fixed points, or of
two dimensions in space, any number of facts could also be represented.

Now it does not matter in what way the two measurements are used, so

long as the position of the point on the surface is fixed by them ; and as
for practical purposes the use of the two points in the above manner is
not convenient (one condition, for instance, being that the sum of the
lengths must be equal to or greater than the distance between the fixed
points), other ways of attaining the same results are employed.

   (1) Using one point, say Oj, as a centre, an arc is drawn through O2 ;
a given distance measured round this arc from the latter to a point. A, is
taken for one of the numerical quantities, and through the point a so
formed a radius is drawn from the other fixed point, O,, and along this
radius the second quantity is measured, represented by O, A, fig. 6.

the measure of the angle which the radius vector, or direction of the
polar distance, makes with the line Oi Oo. The direction in which the
distance is measured from any one point to any other point can always
be found and stated numerically with reference to the two fixed points

points. The direction can then always be stated in terms of distance from
the other of the two fixed points at which the arc cuts the radius vector.

    other, but their relative value as affected by lapse of time.

     This continuous line is the result of taking any two quantities which

gradually change, and may be plotted by other methods in other ways

such as those already mentioned. There is no limit to the number of

such lines or rows of points, except the very practical one of convenience.

Hence we might, instead of having the tide for one day, as shown in

fig. 9, have expressed graphically the tides for various different days in
succession, as in fig. 10 (which, together -with fig. 9 and other informa-

tion, has been kindly supplied by Mr. Anthony G. Lyster, assistant-
engineer, Mersey Docks and Harbour Board), which represents the suc-

cessive states of the tide from May 1 to May 12, 1892 ; but in the latter

case it becomes necessary to distinguish each particular curve in some

way, for instance as shown in the figure, by writing the corresponding
day upon each curve, just as it was necessary to do when a number of

distances were employed to represent isolated facts, as in figs. 4 and 5.

The practical limit is placed by the number of curves which can be

recorded on a single diagram without producing confusion ; for instance,
suppose that instead of plotting the tidal results for twelve days, as in

the diagram given, for any date, it had been desired to give them for

--every possible date as, for instance, might be calculated by Lord Kelvin's
--tide-predicter it is quite clear that, even for one year, it would have been

quite impossible to do so without destroying the clearness of the diagram

and taking the time over a suSicient period would have merged the

curves into one another, and covered the surface of the paper.

    The truth is, there are now three variable quantities, the changes in

which it is desired to represent by the changing position of the point in
space, and this can no longer be done in a plane surface. The limit of

what can be represented by a true graphic method has been reached, and

models or some equivalent process of representation, such as shading,

equivalent to the delineation of the surface of a solid occupying three

Adimensions of space, must be employed.   further illustration will make

this point clearer.

    Let fig. 11 represent another way of plotting similar tidal data,
the days of the month being now represented as the abscissae ; tiien for

a given spot (in the case taken, the dock-sill at Liverpool) and for

a given time (November 1888) we can trace for every day the time at

which the tide has reached any particular height at the dock-sill. Take,

for instance, the case of the tide when it is at datum level, which is shown

in the figure by dotted lines, and marked zero. This for the first day of

the month in question occurred at 1.30 a.m., on the 6th at 3.40 a.m., on

the 12th at 1.55 p.m., and so on ; but, moreover, as it occurred four times

in the twenty-four hours, these facts are recorded along the four different

lines, which are distinguished in the way mentioned.

Now, if it be desired to trace the lines for each day at which any

other levels occur, it is only necessary to draw fresh lines. For instance,

let the case be taken at which the height is 4 feet below the sill ; this is
-- -- --shown by a series of curves in dashed and dotted lines, thus
                                                      ·                 · ··

and marked --4.      --4The times at which the tide is at the level of  on the

day abovementioned are: on the 1st, 2.45 A.M.; on the 5th, at 5 a.m. ; but

on the 12th the curves do not intersect the ordinate at all, showing that on

-- --the twelfth day of the month that is, during neap tides the level of the
Atide never falls 4 feet below the sill.
                                          number of heights can be taken,

as shown in the diagram, which gives them for differences of level of

4 feet, and it is clear that if any smaller differences of height are required

I        lines will  be  closer together, and  the  diagram will  tend             to  lose  its

    the
clearness. These results can, however, be transferred to a model, each

difference of level being represented to scale, and the different heights

heing shown as a series of steps. In this case, however, not the slightest
confusion arises in producing every possible variation of height, which
was done in one section of a model exhibited before the Section by
forming a continuous slope by means of plaster. Measurements can be

taken at any point of any of the three variable quantities, namely, the
day of the month, or hour of the day, or height of the tide, when any two
out of the three are given. The model in question shows that the diagram

may be practically regarded as an example of the use of contour lines ; and

just as contour lines are generally employed for giving various heights of
mountains, and indicate the slope or steepness of various parts by their
proximity to each other, so the rapidity with which the tide rises and falls
on certain days of the month is equally well shown by the closeness of the

lines of the tide diagram.

     For instance, the tide rises and falls much more rapidly on the 4th

than on the 11th, for in the former case the intersections of the curves

by the ordinate are much more close together than in the latter.

      This use of contour lines is generally employed on maps, not only
for representing the heipjhts of mountains, but for showing the density of

--population, barometrical readings, temperature, &c. Contour lines are

 also used with Cartesian co-ordinates for instance, with isothermal

curves of air expansion. They are referred to by French writers in various
treatises under the title of ' courbes d'egal element,' and have the same
relation in graphic diagrams with regard to two dimensions of space as
the mere setting up of lengths in one dimension of space illustrated in
figs. 4 and 5, requiring some distinguishing mark or notation, as in fig. 11,

for each particular line or curve employed.

     As contour lines are thus shown to be a special case of curves formed
by the combination of two variable quantities, they need not be further
alluded to, although it is worthy of consideration whether in many cases

--where models have been employed such, for instance, as the surfaces
--used by Professor Thurston in his researches on ' Ternary Alloys ' they

might not be conveniently replaced by the use of such contour lines
which involve only graphic diagrams.

      There are, it is true, ways in which certain relations of three variable

quantities may be represented graphically. Thus the method used by

Professor Clerk Maxwell for the composition of colours was suggested '
by Sir G. G. Stokes for representing the results of Dr. Alder Wright's
experiments on 'Ternary Alloys.' In this case any triangle being taken
(preferably an equilateral triangle), the quantity by weight of each of the

three substances used in the alloy may be supposed to be respectively

placed at the three apices, and the centre of gravity of all three found.
This being always some point in the plane of the triangle, the position of

Athe point on the surface represents the composition of the alloy.

bounding curve, called the ' critical curve,' is then drawn through the
points so found, corresponding to the proportion at which the alloys
refuse to remain in combination, but separate into two substances, by
means of which curve certain important facts are made evident. The

diagram, however, does not really represent three variable relations,
because it is clear that if every possible composition were tried the surface
would be covered with points, those only which lie along the curve in
question actually representing the result of the graphical construction.

     The fact that the results of three variable quantities cannot be truly
represented upon a plane surface has been insisted on, both to clear the
way for what follows and because the references to this are often some-
what misleading thus Favaro, in his ' Lectures on Graphic Statics,' ^ says

                                                                                         ;

truly, p. 147 : ' Every curved surface to really represent with reliefs
requires the three dimensions of space which correspond to the three
variables of which tbey represent the relation,' but goes on immediately
after to say : ' But one can by means of a notation as simple as expressive
replace constructions in space by traces entirely contained in a plane,'
and then proceeds to describe the system of contours, which it has been
shown only partially represent the result of the simultaneous variation of
three quantities ; and, indeed, whatever trace is taken on the plane can
always be developed into two, being the intersection of surfaces of an
irregular cylinder with the curve surface in question. In his translation
of the above work M. Terrier proceeds to give in an appendix a number

       ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.                     385

--Messeclaglia which represents results capable of representation by

ordinary methods of graphical treatment.

Graphical methods of representation are thus seen to narrow down to

the use of points and lines upon a plane surface, at the same time with

an unlimited range of application.

Regarding the geometrical constructions involved in graphical calcu-

lation, it is now clear tliat the whole subject turns on the intersection of

lines, that is to say, on their relative position. Hence, it is not surprising

that when any given thing can be represented, not merely in magnitude

by the length of a line, but also in direction by its position in space,

we have a direct application of that branch of geometry -which deals

with the position of lines and planes, and their intersection with each

other, the relations of which are independent of numerical magnitudes.

This kind of geometry, which is called, under the various names of

'modern geometry,' 'higher geometry,' 'projective geometry,' or, best

of all, ' geometry of position,' has advanced enormously in importance in

recent years, and has become a subject of instruction chiefly on the Con-

tinent, in the poly technical schools, mainly from the fact that the most

-- --important of all numerical quantities in mechanics which can be repre-

sented graphically namely, force being capable of direct and complete

representation by lines, enabled the general applications of the properties

Aof geometry of position to be at once made.  large number of propo-

sitions, which previously had little practical interest, thus assumed a

physical meaning, which makes them of the greatest value, and the

science of graphic statics, which occupies probably the largest place in

Continental engineering schools, owes no small measure of the import-

ance in which it is held to the fact that it afibrds a high mental trainins'

in geometry, which has at the same time direct practical value.

It is a remarkable fact that the teaching of geometry of position as an

object in the curriculum of foreign schools is owing, in a large measure,

to the publication of Culmann's treatise on graphic statics. Weyranch,
--in his ' Ueber die graphische Statik zur Orientirung,' and quoted by
--DuJay
Bois in his ' Graphical Statics,' says :

' After von Staudt, the strict geometry of position remained a long

time disregarded, while the synthetic geometry of Steiner has enjoyed,

without intermission, till the present day a special preference on the part

of mathematicians. Culmann gave the impulse to a change in this re-
spect. In his "Graphical Statics " he rests directly npon the work of von

Staudt, and, with something more than boldness, assumes a knowledge of

the geometry of position among all practical men. Such a course was not

indispensable for the foundation of his method, and impeded the spread

of the graphical statics ; but by it the geometry of position gained. This
last had next, of necessity, to be introduced into the Zurich Polytechnic,

and thus arose the first, until now, only complete text-book upon the sub-
ject, the " Geometric der Lage," by Reye (Hanover, 1868), as the direct
result of the " Graphical Statics ", of Culmann. Since then the modern

geometry has been introduced into all technical institutions throughout

Germany, and thus placed at the disposal of the arts and sciences.'

     This subject is so important that it will be alluded to again in dealing

with graphic calculation. At the same time it may here be pointed out

that while, as in plane projective geometry, the relative position of lines

may be manipulated graphically, their position may perfectly well and

completely be represented by measurement from two fixed points, so that

we may use either geometrical construction or mathematical calculation
of trigonometry and algebra; that is to say, the analytical process may be

employed to follow the same operations and register the same results.

As a result of the increasing introduction of graphical methods, a

science known as the Graphical Calculus has arisen, ihough until a few
years ago there was no complete treatise in the EngHsh language under
this head. Now, thanks to Professor T. Hudson Beare's translation,

there is available for English readers the ' Calcolo Grafico ' of Professor

Cremona.' This work deals with the modern use of lines in geometry,

as initiated by Moebius, and then in subsequent chapters the combination
or addition of a number of segments, which is made use of chiefly for

reciprocal  figures of framework in graphic  statics                                      graphical multiplica-
                                                                                       ;

tion, which is apphed in such important problems as bending moment,

moment of inertia, deflection, and other matters; the extraction of roots;

reduction of plane figures, so as to enable their area to be found

o-raphically ; the finding of the centre of parallel forces, under the title of

' centroids ; and finally some useful propositions on the rectification of
                                                        '

the circular arc. Many of these propositions the author in a preface to
the English translation states are not new, and have been known to

English writers, but there is much that has never been previously written

in English, or brought together in one book.

      It is therefore unnecessai-y to refer in detail to these applications of

geometry treated of in the above work, but it may be remarked that the

more careful use of lines and notation on the principles set forth by

Moebius would often prevent much confusion and unnecessary explana-

-- --tions sometimes not even then leaving the subject particularly clear in

various books dealing with graphical applications.

                      II. Graphical Representation of Results.

                                   1. The Plotting of Diagrams.

     The plotting of experimental results of all kinds, usually by the use
of Cartesian co-ordinates, has become a universal practice. Scarcely a

paper containing numerical results is presented to the scientific world in
which this system is not employed, while in connection with experimental
research in all laboratories in which instruction is given, the operation

has become probably nearly as common as the use of arithmetic. This

has led to the use of ' squared ' paper, which lias greatly facilitated the
process of plotting, and the annexed figure (fig. 12) gives a number of

different examples of squared paper in common use.
     For many purposes where special work is done, ruled paper of a

particular kind is used instead of squared paper. For instance, in
plotting the results of experiments with the Thurston Testing Machine
for torsion the lines are ruled radially, as shown in MacLay's book on

'Loci' (p. 60).

     There are three principal purposes for which plotting of results may

be employed :
     (1) For experimental work, in which the results of a certain number

of experiments are plotted, and the curves drawn through them, so as to

enable the general laws to be determined. Thus we find Regnault, in

his classical experiments on the properties of steam, plots his results, as,
for instance, the ' saturation curve,' which was drawn in terms of pressure
and volume, on a copper plate. Almost all experimental work, such as

that of Ramsay and Young on ' Vapour Tensions,' contributed to tbe
Royal Society, Beauchamp Tower on ' Friction of Bearings,' Kennedy on
' Engine Trials,' Thurston on ' Lubricants,' has been thus plotted; and

amongst numerous examples which might be quoted of the plotting of

results leading to the discovery of a law, we may quote the results of
tests on the strength of cement, which Professor Unwin has shown to

obey comparatively simple laws, the curves of test approximating to a

parabolic curve.'

     The following remark, taken from the preface of the important treatise
of Gangaillet and Kutter,^ well illustrates the advantages of this method
' In studying the subject we made continual use of the graphic method,
and were eventually led to the recognition of the elements affecting the
flow of water, and thus to the development of our general formula.'

     (2) It has become recently more and more the practice to plot the
results of laws, and experimental data, which would always have been
given a few years ago in the form of a table. Thus we find in Moles-
worth's ' Pocket-Book ' plotted results for safe loads on various spans of
girders (p. 125) and for moving loads (p. 162). In Professor Unwin's
book on machine design we find a graphic table of the proportions of
pipes (p. 16, Part II., 1890), and another on the proportions of keys
(p. 171, Part I., 1890), and in a more recent book by Foley ^ we have

--the following examples of the graphical method : Plotting of curves for

the expansion of steam for purposes of actual reference, the proportions
of valves, the extension and loading of springs, of friction, of the propoi"-
tion of the teeth of wheels, of proportions of belts, strengths of ropes, of
the displacements of ships, of the proportions of propellers, bolts, pipes,
boilers, furnaces, tubes, girders, coal consumption, surface condensation,
&c., all of these being on a large scale and elaborately prepared, so as to
enable actual proportions to be obtained by their use.

      Falling under the head of ' graphical tables ' are the constructions
devised by M. L. Lalanne,'* and published under the following title:
' Memoire sur la Table Graphique et sur la geometric anamorphique
appliquee a diverses questions qui se rattachent a I'art de I'ingenieur.'

An example of one of these tables, called by the inventor an ' abacus

(ahaque), was shown as a wall diagram to the Mechanical Section. The
ordinates and abscissae of this diagram are not numbered according to

their actual values, but are logarithmic, exactly as the scale on a slide

rule. By means of this diagram operations of multiplication can at once

be performed, and by a slight modification products such as a^b and the

\/ a^h can be readily obtained.
     Professor Culmann, in his book on graphic statics, gives another

table in which parabolic curves are plotted, by means of which a large
number of questions of earthwork cuttings and embankments can be

readily deterraiued. The ' Pocket-Book ' of Trautwine on earthwork con-
tains a large number of cases in which the results of elaborate tables are
plotted, and can be used much more readily than the tables themselves.

    Many other examples might be cited, such, for instance, as a curve

given by M. Marey,' in which are plotted various data concerning suspen-
sion bridges of a certain type, the weights respectively of iron and other
metals, and wood, as well as the cost, being given for every span within

a certain limit.

   In fact, there is no limit to the possible number of graphical applica-
tions, since they can be employed whenever the result is required of two
quantities which vary simultaneously. It must be remarked, however,
that the result given by their use cannot be regarded as very accurate,
though probably they admit of as close a degree of accuracy as it is
usually possible for an engineer to attain in practical work, and certainly

have the unquestionable merit of preventing any great error which may
occur as the result of calculation, which therefore they may well be used

to check.

     (3) The last, and possibly the most important, object of plotting results
is the regular work of the engineer or naval architect, in which he sets
down the results of a few calculations in order to be able to determine

any others which he may require in the same series. This, as graphi-

cally treated, becomes a very simple process, and amounts to merely draw-
ing a curve through the points which he has found and plotted, and

interpolating all the values that he requires. This, if performed mathe-
matically, would require difficult and often impossible calculations, and
it is just for such purposes as this that the graphical method is indis-
pensable to, and will be invariably adopted by, practical men.

    Mr. Henry H. West, of Liverpool, M.Inst.C.E., Member of the Coun-

cil of the Institution of Naval Architects, has kindly supplied the writer
with the following remarks, which admirably illustrate this point in
connection with naval architecture :

     ' The principal use which naval architects make of graphic methods is
to record in the form of curves the results of calculations made for certain

given conditions, and from these to arrive at similar results for other

vertically up or down, from the points of intersection of perpendiculars to
these two scales at the same draft.

     ' If the two scales are scales of equal value, as they usually are, the
same result is manifestly gained by simply drawing a line at an angle of

XV45° from the maximum draft (as to

through that line at any draft for which

the height of the metacentre, or centre

of buoyancy, has been calculated, and xc,.
then passing a curve through the points

so found. Usually, the curve of centres

of buoyancy is practically a straight line,

except at the lower part. It is difficult

to predicate the form of the curve of

metacentres, as its character varies very

much in different types of ships ; but for

ordinary modern cargo- steamers it is

usually concave upwards from the base
line, and has its greatest values at the XT

 lowest drafts. It is, of course, possible

to devise numbers of other curves which may be serviceable, but the
above are those which are most commonly used, and the data for them
are generally calculated, even when the results are not plotted down

 graphically.

      ' Stability curves (Sg. 17), in which length of righting arm is measured
 vertically, and angle of heel is measured horizontally, are sometimes calcu-
 lated and plotted, but by no means universally.

     ' To be of practical utility they require to be extended by plotting

different curves for different positions of the height of centre of gravity,

corresponding with different conditions of loading.
     ' Speed carves, in which indicated horse-power is measured vertically

and speed horizontally, are commonly plotted for large passenger and
mail steamers, and these are sometimes extended by plotting different
curves for varying drafts ; but these curves, when based upon mere hypo-
thesis, are not of much practical value, and, as the experimental data for
them cannot be obtained without a considerable outlay, they do not occur

in ordinary practice.

     ' The curves which I have elaborated most in the foregoing memoran-

dum are those which are most frequently used. They are often combined

in one diagram, in a way which will almost naturally suggest itself, but

which I need not describe here, as it will be foreign to your purpose. I

have spoken of and sketched roughly the usual character of the curves.
Of course, this must depend in some measure on the ratio of the vertical
and horizontal scales to one another, and I think you would do good
service if you pointed out the desirability of some recognised convention
as to what this ratio should be for any particular kind of curve. I have
myself pressed the importance of this in discussion at the Institution
of Naval Architects, but there has been little response. For instance,
a stability curve drawn with a ratio in the scales of 1 : 1 is a very
different-looking curve from one drawn with a ratio of 4 : 1, and, as
will be seen from a comparison of figs. 17 and 18, might be misleading.

                                                                  Fig. 18.

     ' The literature of curves is, of course, as scattered as the subjects they
relate to. The principles of them are dealt with in almost any work on

naval architecture, but their special applications are treated of in Rankine's

others too numerous to mention.'
     Mr, Brodie, the head -draughtsman of the Mersey Docks and Harbour

Board, informs me that as a regular thing there are plotted in that office

(1) ordinary sections of ground, (2) tidal curves, (3) slopes of tidal sur-

face in the estuary, (4) discharge of pumps under different heads, and
pump performances generally, (5) the stresses in various framed struc-
tures, (6) engine performances, showing total power and losses on the
hydraulic systems of the docks, (7) a number of matters not directly
engineering, such as the amount of cotton discharged on certain quays on

certain days of the year, the discharge of the dock dredgers in certain
places, the capital values of certain property at certain times, the time
worked by the dredgers, and time lost in repairs by bad weather, &c.

    An interesting case of plotting has been largely employed for the

work in the estuary of the Mersey, in connection with a new sounding-
machine devised by Mr. Sutcliffe, one of the engineers of the Docks
and Harbour Board at Liverpool. This apparatus was designed with a
view to the carrying on of an extensive system of soundings at and

about the river-entrances to the New North Docks at Liverpool, and

its use there proving to be so advantageous that it has been matured and
modified to meet the general requirements of river and coast work. By

its means soundings can be taken very accurately, and with much less

labour than is possible by any other existing means. It admits of sound-

ings reduced to any datum level being obtained direct, and witbout any

calculation. And it enables tbe operations of taking soundings and plot-

ting the same to be performed simultaneously and by one person.

The apparatus consists of a sounding-machine, a distance-recorder,

and a section-plotter. The sounding-machine consists of a wheel with a

spiral reel attachment ; around its periphery is wound a wire by which a

lead is suspended, and the spiral reel carries a preventer line, one end of

which passes through a leading-block fixed at the forward end of the

boat on which the apparatus is mounted, and thence it is taken back to

Athe lead, to which it also is attached.  wheel and reel are employed so

proportioned relatively to each other and to the base that they both pay

out or take in the required amount of their respective lines to maintain

the lead vertically under the after-end of the base line at all depths of its

range. The wheel is 10 feet in circumference, and its rim is divided into

feet and tenths of a foot. One end of its axle has a sleeve-bearing, to

which are attached a long pointer and a short one, the longer pointer to

indicate readings on the rim of the wheel, and the shorter one to show the

reading on a fixed disc which is marked similarly to the wheel.

The section-plotter consists of a paper feed-roll, actuated so that the

travel of the paper represents to the required scale the paying out of the

Adistance wire.      block, sliding in guides, carries a marker across the

paper at right angles to the line of its travel ; it is actuated by a cord

from a small barrel clamped to one end of tbe axle of the sounding-wheel,

capable of being turned about the same for adjustment, and so propor-

tioned as to indicate, on the required scale, the rise and fall of the lead

by the motion it imparts to the marker.

     The plotting of the soundings is effected by simply tapping the marker

-- --which is kept clear of the paper by a spring each time the lead is felt to

touch the bottom, and thus there is produced a dotted section to a trial

datum, from which, and from a tide-gauge record, the true datum line

may be plotted, time having been noted at each end of the line. The
position of cross-sights, bearings, &c., may be indicated by holding the

marker in contact with the paper while the lead is being raised, so as to

produce a vertical stroke, the particular mark so obtained being desig-

nated by a note written against it.

Mr. F. G. Baily, B.A., A.Inst.B.E., has kindly furnished the follow-

ing notes on the plotting of curves for practical electrical work :

' In the science of electricity and in the practice of electrical engineer-

ing the employment of graphic methods is very general. The curves
may be used as the numerical interpretation of calculated formulas, or as

a means of giving in a connected form the results of a number of experi-

mental data which frequently are not amenable to mathematical treat-

ment, and cannot be embodied in algebraic form.

' One of the earliest and simplest examples of the latter use is the repre-

sentation of the magnetic field of an electro-magnet or permanent magnet

by Faraday's lines of force, and the method has been greatly developed

of late years in the researches on powerful magnets, and in dynamo-

electric machinery.

' In connection with this a very important curve of the magnetic

properties of metals has formed the subject of much work, carried out

principally by Rowland,^ J. Hopkinson,^ and Ewing,^ and the results

H, and the resulting induction, B.

     ' The same curve continued through a complete cycle of positive and
negative magnetisation gives the value of the hysteresis of the iron, and

the variation of this quantity with the induction is plotted in another

are in constant use in all calculations of electro-magnetic machinery, the

knowledge of the curve of magnetisation of the iron and the dimensions

of the machine, the shape of the curve may be foretold with considerable

accuracy. When developed in a third direction, representing the current

flowing through the armature, a surface is obtained showing the complete
behaviour of the dynamo.

both by indicating where improvements may be made, and in facilitating
the design of new types. By their means also several problems, such as

the Hmiting speed at which a shunt-wound motor will excite itself, are
readily solved. Besides the characteristic a large number of other curves
are in more or less use in dynamo and motor design, such as the curve
showing the relation between the speed of rotation of a motor and the

exciting current round the field magnets, when a constant difference of
potential is maintained at the brushes. The speed being the reciprocal

of the effective induction through the armature, the form of the curve
(fig. 22) is a combination of a rectangular hyperbola with the charac-
teristic of the machine, the saturation of the iron modifying the hyper-

bolic form as the exciting current rises.

     'A development of graphic methods for commercial purposes has been
recently brought into prominence in the plotting of the output of central
stations for supplying electricity to towns, giving the "load diagram."
For this purpose the output of the station with respect to time is made

into a curve showing the annual variations in the consumption.

    ' Some load diagrams for each montli of the year in the Berlin central
stations are given by Professor G. Forbes.' They show the output of the
station and the various components in the cost of working. The import-

ance of this knowledge is demonstrated by Mr. Crompton,^ and in his
paper, and in the report of the subsequent discussion, are a large number

of examples of curves rendering observed data more intelligible. From
the shape of the curve may be deduced what is the most economical size

for the units of the generating plant, and, if direct currents are used,

the best combination of dynamos and accumulators. Other useful curves
are the variation in the coal consumption, and the variation in the cost
per unit of electricity according to the time of year and the nature of
the district ; and the latest development in this line is the use of curves
in the reports of public companies instead of tables of statistics. These
are drawn to show the operations of the year and the increase of

business.'

     ' The curves of the current used on an electric tramcar or locomotive
are very curious, and demonstrate clearly the exceptional nature of the
work required of the motor and supply stations, or batteries. Several

examples have been given by Mr. Reckenzaun (fig. 25).''

lamps have given valuable information on the most economical way of

using them, the most usual form being the relation between the candle-

a moving sheet of squared paper. Voltmeters and ammeters for this

purpose are made by MM. Richard Freres, and are in general use in

central supply stations, serving as a check on the intermittent readings
of the other instruments, and indicating the degree of watchfulness on
the part of the attendants, where a constant current or constant difference

of potential is required. Mention may also be made of Professor Ewing's

magnetic curve-traces presented at the present meeting of the Asso-

ciation.

     ' It will thus be seen that the use of graphic methods is very general in
the practice of electrical engineering, and the range of its applicability is

considerable. In fact, in many cases it is the only available means of

utilising and drawing deductions from experimental data, and in all
cases it is a great help towards a clear comprehension of observational

results.'

     Mr. Malcolm Walker, late manager of the ' Sanogen ' Ventilating
Company, Liverpool, employs in the regular course of his practice a
method of plotting for determining the efficiency of hydro-extractors
in which a jet of water is used in order to exhaust the vitiated air from
a building. Fig. 27 is a specimen of a curve taken from such an
apparatus, and enables the efficiency of the arrangement to be at once

determined.
     It will there be seen that the pressures of water used for the jet are

used as abscissae, and the quantity of air abstracted as ordinates. In
another case the same principle is employed when a fan is used, the
number of revolutions forming the abscissae, and the air extracted the
corresponding ordinates (fig. 28). This also enables the efficiency of
the contrivance to be at once seen, and the proper speed at which the fan
should be worked. These observations are made regularly twice a year.
Mr. Walker also plots regularly every two months the installation, resist-
ance and deterioration of electric surface, fig. 29 being an example of the

curves obtained.

     Another example of plotting, whicli the writer believes to be novel, is
the fall of polarisation of batteries used for telephones, &c., and the
gradual rise of electro-motive force afterwards, as shown in fig. 30.

     This has in one or two cases led to the discovery of the cause of
failure in telephonic arrangements to be due to the batteries, and not to

the telephone, as was at first supposed.
     Before leaving the subject of plotting diagrams, it would be as well

to remark that the examples which have been given must necessarily be

but a small proportion of the cases which might be cited. Thus, in many

treatises in which graphic representations are given the action of forces,

such as diagrams of bending moment, shearing force, moment of inertia,
velocity, efficiency, &c., which may be calculated graphically, is fre-

quently calculated by numerical methods, and afterwards merely plotted,

so as to present the results of calculation in a graphic form.

       2. Instruments for Drawing Known Curves,

The use of the ruler and compass for drawing known curves is

postulated in Euclid, and they still retain the place of honour, as by far

the most important instruments of the kind in graphic methods.

It is often required to draw a straight line, without using a ruler, with

indicator diagrams, and for other work, and then some form of straight-

Aline mechanism must be used.  valuable amount of information on the

subject is to be found in the treatises of Professor Goodeve,' Professor

MacLay,^ Mr. Kempe,^ and Professor Kennedy."*

In an article by the late Professor H. J. S. Smith ·'' in connection with

the Collection of Scientific Apparatus of 1876, the following improve-

--ments in recent years in compasses are noted :

1. The arrangements adapted for very fine work, and known as hair-

compasses, needle-point compasses, and spring-dividers.

2. The proportional, or reducing compasses, by which we are enabled

to reduce or augment in any given ratio the distances which we transfer

from one drawing to another.

3. The triangular compasses, by which the position of three points

forming a triangle can be transferred from one drawing to another, and

which thus serve as an instrument for transferring angles.

4. The beam-compasses, consisting of a beam or bar along which the

two points of the instrument may be moved backwards and forwards, the

distance between them admitting of adjustment with great precision by

means of a micrometer screw.

"With regard to the other instruments for drawing curves he remarks:

' It is by no means an easy matter to invent a good method of

tracing a curve. Even when the theory of a curve is pretty well

known, that theory may fail to suggest any mode of describing it

mechanically ; and not every mode which theory suggests can be made

to work accurately in practice.' He afterwards mentions elliptic trammels

and certain other elliptic compasses, and the conicograph of Dr. Zmurko,

of Lemberg, which describes all three conic sections.

    Since the above date there have been several improvements in instru-

ments for drawing ellipses, amongst them the conograph, which is the

invention of Mr. A. 0. Campbell, of Bridgeport, Conn., U.S.A., described

in the book of Professor MacLay abovementioned, an account of which

is contributed to the ' Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical

Engineers,' vol. viii. p. 145.

     The most important of recent contributions on the subject of ellipto-

graphs is that by Professor Alexander and Mr, A. W. Thomson.' The

--authors mention three modes of generating the ellipse by (1) a point

fixed to the body with two or more studs, and oscillating in straight

Blots                    (2)  a point rigidly fixed to                                                        a            circular wheel, rolling  inside another
                      ;

of  double its diameter                                                                                       (3) a point  describing  an  antisatellite  motion of
                                                                                                           ;

double angular velocity round another describing a circular orbit.

    The first is, of course, the old elliptic trammel ; but they have designed

an important improvement, to obviate the objection in the ordinary

arrangement of the impossibility of obtaining with the ordinary pen a

clean line of uniform thickness, since the pen gets broadside at certain

parts of the curve. Their arrangement consists of a steering-needle,

which always forms the normal to the ellipse being generated, the

principle of a circle rolling in another twice its radius being employed to

attain this result.

    The second improvement they mention Is an example of the anti-

satellite method of describing an ellipse, which is used for teaching

purposes in connection with Rankine's ' Method of the Ellipse of Stress.'

This arrangement, which is used on a blackboard, consists of a T-square

pivoted to the board at the butt, and a pointer pivoted to the blade of the

T-square. At the back of the blade, where the pointer is pivoted, is a

wheel fixed, on this wheel an endless chain is wrapped, which passes

round a wheel fixed to the board at the point where the butt is pivoted

hence, if the blade of the T-square is turned to the right, the pointer

automatically turns to the left, so that the bisector of the angle between

the pointer of the blade is always vertical. By this arrangement the end

of the pointer describes an ellipse.

    They next describe an improved elliptograph, for continuously de-

scribing an ellipse of every eccentricity, by means of a wheel rolling in a

circular rack of twice its diameter. The circular rack may be dispensed

with if a gauged endless chain wrapping round two wheels is used.

Further modifications are also shown, one designed by Mr. Yeates, which

is a frame in the form of a ring standing on four legs, armed with prickers

to pierce the drawing-board so as to hold the frame steady, and at the
same time mark the position of the principal axis. The lower ring,

concentric with the other one, runs in four grooved wheels, one in each

leg. One difficulty in the construction of this mechanism is to make the

lower ring, which runs in the grooved wheels, truly concentric with the

cross formed by the slots in the principal ring.

     Yet another mechanism is described, in which bevel wheels and a
framework form a part, and a steering-needle being always on the radius

of what corresponds to the planet in the anti-satellite motion. This

instrument works with great smoothness, as, with the exception of the
driving bevel wheels, it consists entirely of linkvvork. At the end of the

paper mechanism is suggested for continuously describing bi-circular

quartics.

    The actual problems solved by means of the ellipse will be alluded to
when dealing with the ellipse of stress and other graphical methods.

The parabola is another important curve in graphical methods, the

power of drawing which is indispensable in every problem of bending
moment on girders subjected to any uniform or travelling load, and for

many other problems. From the fact that all parabolas are similar, it is

a simple matter to have parabolic curves of cardboard or other material

of various sizes, and, having used whatever size may be most convenient,

to find the constants for the particular problem. The authors above-

mentioned have designed a mechanism, points in which simultaneously

describe parabolas required in problems of bending moment.' This

mechanism consists of a board, slot frame, compass bars, transverse bar,
distance-piece, and distorting-table. As the slot frame moves across the
face of the board all points in the mechanism describe the same parabola

in different positions. By means of this model bending moment can be

clearly demonstrated for any point of the span, whether for a concentrated

load or for a load distributed over several points, as in the case of a rail-

way train, either longer or shorter than the span of the bridge or girder

under consideration,^

which are the number of teeth in certain wheels, which therefore admit of

only a limited number of changes.

     The most important carves used in the teeth of wheels are the
involute, cycloid, epicycloid, and hypocycloid. Practical modes of de-
scribing these are given by Professor Unwin.^

Another curve which has important properties, and which may be used

for the extraction of roots, is the logarithmic spiral ; it ma^y also be sub-
stituted for table logarithms, as mentioned by Professor Favaro in his

book on graphic statics. The same author describes the gaharit of
Professor Steiner,'* which is an instrument for facilitating the construction
of logarithmic spiral, and may be applied to graphic calculations. The

centre of the curve can be marked upon the paper by means of a pricker
which passes thi'ough a small hole. The apparatus has, according to

Professor Favaro, the following uses :

1. The curve presents a series of curvatures of which the radii cross

      4. Calculations can be readily performed with it.

    A very interesting class of modern instruments, called ' integraphs,'

has been invented by Mr. Abdank Abakanowicz and Mr. Vernon Boys.
These instruments di'aw what is known as the ' integral curve ' when a
pointer is passed round the periphery of a figure whose area is required.'

                                        3. Self-recording Instruments.

     There is no class of instruments which have increased to such a great

extent as those which record their own results in the form of a curve or

mark of some kind. An instrument of this kind may be used for an

almost countless variety of purposes, but many of them have certain

features in common, or difier in certain important particulars, which
enables the subject to be considered under a comparatively limited number

of heads.

     1. All instruments have some kind of markinsr arranjrement, and
some kind of prepared surface on which the record is made.

     2. Almost all instruments of this kind have some contrivance for
giving motion to the surface upon which the record is obtained, and this
motion corresponds to the change in one of the two variable quantities
which are to be recorded.

     3. The marking arrangement, which makes the record, is actuated by
means of some mechanical contrivance so as to correspond in position to
the magnitude to the other variable quantity.

     These facts supply the headings under which the subject may be

 studied.

     1. The arrangement for marking may consist of

        a. Pricker, which makes a puncture or mark of some kind at

                     certain intervals.

          h. Pencil drawing upon ordinary paper.
          c. Metallic pencil drawing upon prepared paper.

                  tact with it.

      Of course, nothing but practical results can decide which is the most
suitable of all these for any particular purpose, and, from inquiries which

the writer has made, it appears that a great difference of opinion exists
on the subject.

ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.  405

     For indicator diagrams a pencil of some kind is invariably used,
generally a metallic pencil, in contact with paper the surface of which is

prepared with lime whiting and size. Messrs. Bailey & Co., of Salford,

who have a very extensive experience on the subject, prefer aniline

pencils, which give an indelible mark, requiring no sharpening, as lead
pencils do, and do not necessitate the use of specially prepared paper.
Figs. 31, 32, and 33 show the arrangement adopted for a very large level-
recorder by Messrs. Bailey ; the pencil is here loaded by the small
weights (A) ; the other details will be alluded to hereafter. They con-

sider metallic pencils have too much friction for the ordinary purpose of

                                                                    Fig. 31.

self-recording instruments, while when using some kind of aniline ink
they find that the ink dries if placed in the engine-house, ^here the tem-
perature is above that of the ordinary atmosphere, especially when a
record is being made at a very slow rate. On the other hand, when in

a moist situation, recording paper becomes damp, and the ink flows too
freely upon it, making too coarse a record, rapidly exhausting the supply

of ink.
      Such, however, is not the experience of another, and probably an

equally well-known firm, Messrs. Richard Freres & Co., of Paris and

London, who, for the vast number of self-recording instruments which

tliey make, never use any other means of obtaining records but a small
pen supplied with aniline ink, which invariably continues to act for at
least tweuty.four hours, and will, under favourable conditions, continue at
work for weeks or even months. Of course, the composition of the ink
used has been the subject of very careful study by that firm, and great

care must be taken to prevent pressure with more than the very slightest
force against the surface of the paper, or it scrapes up a sort of fur, which

 soon stops the action of the pen.

      The spiral has been used with various instruments where it is more
convenient to turn the marking arrangement about its axis than to move
it to and fro ; thus, in the self-recording water-meter devised by the
writer ' this arrangement was used, also in the instrument for giving the

direction of the wind manufactured by Messrs. Bailey & Co. for the
Salford Town Hall. It is clear that the spiral, being in contact with the

paper wound round a cylindrical drum, will mark it at any point along
the drum corresponding to the angle through which it has been turned.

Fig. 34 shows the recording portion of this instrument.
     The last two means of recording to be mentioned, viz., g and h, are

the only two which are suitable for obtaining a diagram where it is im-
pex-ative to have no friction at all at the recording-point.

     Sir William Thomson's siphon-recorder was invented by him as the
outcome of his device for regulating the arrival of an electric impulse
through long submarine cables. It was used by Professors Jenkin and
Ewing ' in their experiments on the friction
between surfaces moving at low speeds. This

contrivance, a small, fine siphon glass, has its

shorter end dipped in aniline blue dissolved in
water, and the longer has its point bent so as

to stand almost touching the surface of the

paper. In order to make the ink run through,

so as to be deposited on the paper, it is con-

tinually maintained in a state of electrification ;
thus a continuous flow is obtained, forming a
fine line, without involving any friction.

      The kind of paper used for graphic records is a very important

&matter, and Messrs. Bailey Co., and others, have found it necessary, to

prevent errors of r.cale, to have them lithographed with ruled lines. Such
paper should always be tested, and, if possible, the actual scale marked
on it.

     2. Coming now to the means of moving the paper or other prepared
surface, it may be said that the almost universal practice is to adopt the
cylindrical drum for carrying the record. Moreover, it may be said
that in the majority of cases this drum is turned by clockwork, although

there is one most important class of instruments in which this is not the
case, namely, the steam-engine indicator.

   --For large instruments such as tide-gauges, anemometers in observa-
--tories a pendulum or weights are used for giving motion to the barrel,

but in the majority of cases this conti-ivance would occupy too much

space, and springs are employed. Continuous papers are frequently used,
enabling records to extend over long periods of time, as with the Edson
steam-pressure recorder ; but the general practice is to have a special
chart for each day.

     The manner of connecting this chart to the barrel is a matter of no

little importance. In the case of the steam-engine indicator the barrel
does not turn through a whole revolution, and hence the projecting clips
do not present a serious objection ; but in barrels which revolve this

matter must be provided for, and special precautions are taken by
Messrs. Richard, Bailey, and others to prevent injury to the recording-

point.

     There are some recorders in which a flat surface is used, such as
Bristol's recording pressure-gauge, on which a circular sheet of paper is
attached to a revolving dial, and the pressures are recorded radially, or
nearly so, while time is measured round the circumference.

   A special feature of Messrs. Richard Freres' recording instruments is

to be found in the fact that the recording-point is almost invariably
carried on a lever working about a centre, and hence the paper on their

                                                                  Fig. 35.

    By having a straight-line motion instead of employing the arc of a

circle, the above kind of ruled paper is not a necessity, and the area of

the curve, when desired, is more easily obtained. With the larger instru-

ments, such as those of Mr. Bailey, a small chariot is often employed for
carrying the pencil, and this runs to and fro on rails above the drum,
which is placed horizontally. The chariot itself is loaded, and the pencil,

as already mentioned, is also loaded, but with much smaller weights.
Figs. 32, 33, and 34 show the kind of chariot which has been largely

used in the case of tide-gauges and reservoir-level recorders by Mr.

Bailey.

    It may be mentioned generally that it has become the custom to

ahvays encase such recording instruments ; usually a glass front is em-
ployed, so that the kind of record being taken can be seen on inspection.

Mr. Bailey has found, after much experience, that it is better to use cast

iron for the case, as the change of form of wooden cases often led to

errors in the instrument.

     3. The means by which the position of the recording point is regu-
lated may be made the basis of classification for self-recording instru-

ments, as follows :

         a. Level of water, mercury, or spirit.

          h. Pressure of steam, air, or water.
         c. Magnetic attractions for electrical purposes.

           d. Velocity.

          e. Temperature.
         /. Vibrations and shocks.
        g. Change of position from loss or gain of weight.
         h. Chronographs, tell-tales, and similar instruments.

    These headings will now be taken seriatim.

     a. This class includes various kinds of tide-gauges, reservoir and
boiler level recorders, recorders for the depths of wells or record of rain-
fall, and for the height of the barometer.

   A large instrument of this kind, which also records velocity, made by

Messrs. Bailey, has been described in a paper by Mr. Hurtzig ' as follows :

    A ball-float moving in a tube actuates a pencil, which records, on a

sheet of paper upon a drum revolving by clockwork, the varying heights

of the water, 2 inches on the diagram being equal to a fluctuation of

--12 inches of water ; the diagram revolves once in twenty-four hours

inch=l hour. For recording the velocity it was determined to register the
angular displacements of a spherical ball which, when at rest, was

suspended in a vertical position, with its centre coinciding with the centre

of the 5-foot culvert. This ball is attached to the long arm of a lever

pivoted to a small bracket fixed to the top of the culvert.

     'The short arm of the lever is connected by a platinum wire and

system of levers, all duly counterbalanced, with a second recording-
pencil upon the revolving drum.

     ' The recording diagram indicates the level and velocity for a period of
twenty-four hours. That portion of the diagi-am referring to level is divided
so as to give actual depths of water upon the sill of the sluice, the conditions
of the clause requiring that when the depth reaches 4 feet 6 inches, and
the sluice doors are closed, pumping must be carried on.

     ' ' Tide-gauge Eecorders,' by A. C. Hurtzig, read at the International Congress of
Inland Navigation.
410 REPOET 1892.

' The determination of the divisions on the diagram, and of the

angular displacements of the ball, corresponding to certain velocities,

were the results of numerous and careful experiments carried out on the

old Bolton and Manchester Canal by the makers of the instrument, and

Mr. Hurtzig was satisfied that the instrument would give all the informa-

tion  required                                                and  since  the  date  it  was  erected  it  has  worked  well,  and  is
                                                           ;

now in perfect order.'

For waterworks such recorders are approximate water-meters,

every increase in the height of the water measuring a known quantity

(say 1,000,000 gallons for every eighth of an inch rise), so that they

form a check upon the water-meters supplying the town.

The late L. J. Crossley, Esq., designed a rainfall-recorder which,

though arranged for ordinary purposes, could, during a thunderstorm or

sudden downfall, be so altered as to cause the drum to revolve once in

an hour instead of once in twenty-four hours by means of a wheel put

in gear by a magnet worked from Mr. Crossley's house, more than a mile

distant. The matter of distance presents no difficulty in the way of

obtaining a continuous record of the height of water in a reservoir or

aqueduct ; thus, Messrs. Richard Freres make an instrument, designed by
M. Grivola, in which only one wire is employed, which may be used to

record the level by electric means at any distance.

For short distances, such as about 50 yards, the same makers have

an instrument which consists of an iron case, perforated with holes, con-

taining an indiarubber bag filled with air. This bag is connected by

means of a copper tube to a self-recording pressure-gauge, and the case

is immersed in the liquid. The air pressui'e, and consequently the height

of the liquid, is indicated and recorded by the pressure-gauge, and as

there exists no contact between the liquid and the air, the latter cannot

get dissolved and the indications are always correct.

The tide-gauge, designed by Sir William Thomson, is well known, and

has the peculiar feature of an inclined path for the slider, which holds the

recording pencil, necessitating a correspondingly inclined position for the

axis of the barrel on which the paper is wound.'

   A more elaborate tide-gauge has been designed by M. Lechatelier, and

made by Messrs. Richard Freres.- This is used to record the height of

the water in the basin of La Villette.

h. Instruments for recording the pressure of steam, air, or water

form probably the most important of all classes of such self-recording

apparatus.

First in importance must rank the steam-engine indicator.

The use of this instrument, since the time of its invention by James

Watt, has continually increased, and so great has been the attention given

to its improvement that a treatise of considerable size might be written

on this subject alone. In essential features the instrument remains the

--same as it was one hundred years ago, consisting, as in almost every re-

cording instrument, of two parts of a moving pencil and moving paper,

whose paths are respectively at right angles to each other. But the intro-

duction of higher pressures and quicker speeds has necessitated numerous

but important changes of detail ; hence some kind of parallel motion is

ased to magnify the movement of the pencil and enable a small motion of
the piston-indicator to suffice, thus avoiding irregularities which would

otherwise occur at high speeds in the indicator diagram.

     The modified indicator which marked the chief change in the type of
the instrument was introduced many years ago to this country from
America by Messrs. Elliott Bros., of the Strand, London, and is known
universally as ' The Richards Indicator.' The details of other types are

given in various journals, mentioned under the title of ' Indicator ' in the
list appended to this report. The following are the principal makers, most

of whom have modifications of their own : Lloyd, Stanley, Darke, Negretti
<fc Zambra, Tabor, Orossley, Maginnis, Schaffer & Budenberg, as well as

many others.

     Recording steam-pressure gauges are employed for giving, as it were,

a history of the pressure in the boiler continuously.
     That made by Messrs. Bell consists of an eight-day clock actuating a

drum which revolves once every twenty-four hoars, the pencil being

moved by a treble tube Bourdon steam-gauge.
     Instruments very similar in design are made by the same firm for the

following purposes : Recording vacuum and hydraulic pressure, and for
use in waterworks in connection with pumping engines ; for chemical
works, to record the dates of absorbing and concentrating columns ; and

for steelworks and blast furnaces, for recording the blast pressures.
They are sometimes made with continuous paper, but this design is not
in particular favour, although it is a feature of the Bdson steam-pressure

recorder. In fact, there are between 2,000 and 3,000 of these instruments

in use, representing no less than thirty different varieties of design.

    Messrs. Richard Freres also make a steam-pressure recorder of this
kind, and there are several other designs, amongst which may be men-

tioned the Edson steam-gauge recorder, largely used in America.
     This instrument, unlike the other two previously described, which

were both constructed on the principle of the Bourdon gauge, has a

corrugated flexible surface, on which the pressure of the steam acts.

    Messrs. Schaffer & Budenberg have made for several years a record-

ing pressure-gauge, although no account of it has apparently appeared

in any paper.

Recording aneroid barometers have been in recent years introduced

in very large quantities, and every French war- vessel carries such an

instrument, records of which are obliged to be always posted with the

ordinary log.

The pressure of air in connection with collieries is of very great

importance,                                particularly in  connection                                          with  the  ventilating     appliances
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

and Mr. Joseph Dixon, H.M. In.spector of Mines, feeling strongly on the

subject, has been instrumental in getting designed, by Messrs. Bailey, most

ingenious mine-ventilating recorders, notice of which appeared in the

' Colliery Guardian.' ^

    Messrs. SchafJ'er & Budenberg make a hydraulic press recorder which

gives several kinds of diagrams simultaneously of the work performed by

a system of hydraulic presses during either twelve or twenty-four hours.

The diagrams show : (1) The times when the several presses were brought

into  action                               (2)  the  rate  of increase                                      of  pressure,  and  the  time  occupied  in

different parts of the day.

   A very delicate pressure-gauge by Messrs. Richard Freres is described

in the report of Colonel Sebert previously mentioned,' which will

measure the variation of the water column by a fifth of a millimetre.

     Recording anemometers for recording the pressure of the wind also

belong to this type of instrument, and one may be mentioned, designed

by Mr. Osier, F.R.S., of Birmingham, an example of which is in opera-

tion in the Bidston Observatory, near Liverpool, also at Kew and Green,

Awich.  disc exactly 2 square feet in section is presented to the wind,

and the pressure is transmitted to a small carrier, having the recording-

pencil attached, in the observatory below, and thus a record is given upon

a revolving drum.

    The last instruments coming under this class which maybe mentioned
are the 'stress and strain recorders,' which have now become a jaart of

the equipment of all engineering laboratories, in connection with machines

for testing the strength of materials, and it is becoming the practice, in

better classes of testing, to take and furnish an autogi-aphic record with

every specimen tested. The forms of these instruments are numerous,

an account of the principal types being given in Professor Unwin's book

on the testing of materials,^ and in a paper by Professor Kennedy..^ An

account of one designed by the writer of this report is given in the

'Minutes of Proc. Inst. C.E.,' vol. Ixxxviii. p. 101.

  --c. Electrical instruments voltmeters, ammeters or ampere meters.
--Watt meters, and galvanometers are all made of the first recording-

type, and are described in the report of Colonel Sebert, already alluded

to, as being manufactured by Messrs. Richard Freres. An example of an

ampere meter record has already been given. They are also described

and illustrated in the catalogue of the makers, in which the record from

these instruments gives everything which is to be known about an
electric station continuously, including the times of starting, maximum
and minimum production of the electric current, and the way in which

the machines have worked.

d. Instruments for recording velocity may be divided into two

classes : (1) Those which actually record the velocity by the height of

the ordinate on a revolving                                                                                            drum                             and (2)  those which  indirectly do so
                                                                                                                                                     ;

by the distance travelled over the surface by the pencil in a given period

of revolution.

The most common method in which the former acts is by some kind

of governor, operated by means of the steam-engine, which raises or

depresses the pencil according to the position of the governor balls.

    An instrument of this kind, which is now well known, is the ' Mos-

crop ' recorder,* and similar instruments have been designed by Messrs.
Bailey and Mr. Edson. The application of these instruments has been

ON GRAPHIC METHODS IN MECHANICAL SCIENCE.                                                                                                                                        413

invaluable, having revealed on various occasions all sorts of defects in

the working of the engines, such as insutficient weight of flywheel, flaws
in the shafting causing extra friction and irregularity, and imperfect
action of the governors. None of these things would probably have been

detected except by a continuous graphic record, which, moreover, enabled

the defects of the changes introduced to be carefully studied by the

diagrams snbsequently obtained.

    An instrument belonging to the same class, but of entirely different

principle of action, has been designed by Messrs. Richard Freres under

the title of the ' Cinemograph,' of which a description is given in the

report of Colonel Sebert.

    An electro-cinemograph for electrically recording the speed or

number of revolutions of one or several engine shafts at a distance is also

described by the same makers as follows :

' This instrument is a combination of the speed indicator, previously

described, with an escapement system actuated by an electro-magnet.

     ' It is set ready for work by merely winding up the string of the train
of wheels which causes the factors " Time" and " IS^umber of Revolutions "

to act upon one another.

' Its installation is eff'ected in the following manner :

' On each machine a simple electric closing circuit arrangement for

each revolution is adopted. To each contact is attached two wires, one of
which is connected to a common return wire, the other being taken and

connected to a switch placed in the engineer's office. The switches are

arranged on a board, in front of which is placed on a bracket the electro-

cinemograph. This instrument is connected to the switches as well as

to the common return wire, and to a battery placed in the circuit. When

the engineer wants to ascertain the speed of any given engine, he, by

closing the circuit of the said engine with the switch, immediately sets

the cinemograph at work, and obtains a record on the diagram paper of

the number of contacts occurring at the     shaft in the unit of time                                                                                                            that is
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

to say, its number of revolutions per minute. The speed of every in-

dividual motor can thus be controlled.

' This instrument is also used for measuring the speed of water-

courses, boats, or yachts by merely connecting it to contacts established

on a turbine of the Wolhmann system, or to an electric log of the

Fleuriais or other system.'

Instruments for recording the flow and velocity of water have been

nsed, and perhaps the most important is the waste-water meter of

Mr. Deacon. This instrument enables any waste to be detected through-

out the whole of the system of the water supply of the City, and in a

continuous record night and day of the quantity of water passing. It

has been fully described in the ' Engineer ' and other jonrnals, to which

it will suffice merely to give reference.'

     (2) The principle of the second, or indirect class of velocity-recorders,
is to observe the slope made by the line as the pencil travels across the

surface moviug at a known rate. This is the case with a large number of

instruments, in which the revolutions of a turning vane move the pencil

over a clockwork drum.

Another well-known type of the Osier anemometer operates on this

is one wMcli, thougli adopting the same principle, is very different in

appearance and deserves a special mention. This is the ' Cyclometer

of Mr. Ransome (manufactured by Messrs. &Manlove, Alliott, Co., of

Nottingham), which gives the time of rotation of any shaft to the ^tyW^^
part of a second; and not only is the total time of each revelation re-

· corded, but also the time taken in turning through any minute angle or

portion of a revolution may be obtained with equal accuracy. The prin-

Aciple upon which this speed-recorder works is very simple.  cylinder

covered tightly with smoked paper is attached to the end of the shaft

whose speed it is required to measure. On one side of this drum is

placed a tuning-fork of known pitch ; one of the arms of the fork carries

a small style, which (when the fork is vibrating) oscillates in a line at

right angles to the direction of rotation of the drum. When at work the

tip of this style lightly touches the smoked paper on the revolving drnm,

and records on it the number of vibrations which the tuning-fork makes

whilst in contact with the paper. It is well known that each vibration

must be made in an equal interval of time, the amount of which is known

from the pitch of the fork. Thus the time taken in seconds for a point

on the smoked paper to traverse one inch will be the number of waves in

that inch divided by the number of vibrations per second corresponding

to the pitch of the fork used. After the record has been taken the paper

is removed from the drum, and the marks are rendered permanent by any

thin varnish. The slope of the waves will be a measure of the speed of

the drum, but it is easier in this case to count the number of vibrations

in a given space.

Under this head is a railway-speed time-recorder used in America.

The object of this instrument is to indicate, not only the speed of the

train when it is I'unning, but the time at which the train stops, how long

it remains still, and the speed at which it has run. The work is recorded

upon the paper ribbon, which is divided into minutes and hours, and is

put in motion by a train of mechanism controlled by an eight-day time

movement, to which it is attached. The motion of the car sets in action a

train of gearing, which in turn gives motion to the pencil mechanism,

which traverses crosswise of the paper, while the paper itself traverses

lengthwise at a uniform speed. The pencil mechanism is put in motion

Aby an eccentric placed upon the axle of the car.  straight line length-

wise on the paper ribbon denotes a stop of the train. The pencil crosses

the paper every half-mile the car travels, and from one side of the paper

and back again indicates a mile ; every fifth mile the pencil travels

farther, so as to make the line higher, in order that the miles may be

counted up with more convenience, and the work done located with

greater ease. This record can be continued for any number of days, the

capacity of the machinery and the paper ribbon being sufficient to record

eight or nine days by one winding. This ribbon, it will be seen, records

the time of reaching and leaving each station, and every part of the

work done.

     e. Instruments for obtaining an autographic record of the rise and

fall of temperature are employed at Kew and other observatories, the

level of liquid in the thermometer being continuously photographed.

But within the last few years very much more convenient self-recording

thermometers have been invented. MM. Richard have designed an in-

strument of this kind, which consists of a curved brass tube, of rather flat

section, hermetically sealed, filled with an expanding liquid. The tube is
                                                '

placed in a sort of cage, so as to protect it, but at the same time to allow
the atmosphere to act upon it, this cage being attached to the box holding
the self-recording portion, so that it can be placed in bath-houses,

breweries, &c. An instrument acting on a similar principle, which

allows a communication with any vessel in which it is desired to register

the temperature of the liquid, is also largely used. Still another variety
of the same class of instrument acting by means of the expansion of the
liquid, is arranged for obtaining the temperature of drying and other

enclosed chambers, a rod containing the liquid being inserted in the

enclosed space, a self-recording portion being placed outside. Probably

one of the most beautiful instruments of this kind is the recording
pyrometer designed by M. Saintignon, and described in the report of

Colonel Sebert already alluded to. This pyrometer acts upon the differ-

ential principle, a reservoir of the water at constant height being placed
about 9 or 10 feet above the place of which the temperature is required.
The water passes first through a filter divided into two parts, the ex-
ternal compartment being that in which the liquid circulates, and which
acts as an envelope to cool the water after it has passed through a hollow
tube placed in the oven or furnace the temperature of which is required
to be known. It then passes out, acting on the bulbs of two air ther-
mometers, one of which communicates with the outer partition of the

vessel above mentioned. By means of a delicate aneroid there is thus

obtained a graphic record of the temperature of the furnace.

    A hygrometer is also described, composed of two thermometric tubes

placed one beside the other ; one rests in the dry, and the other is main-
 tained at constant dampness by means of a cotton wick descending into a
 metal basin by the side of the instrument. The thermometric tubes each
 have the self-recording pencil marking the same drum revolving by
 clockwork ; the difference between the two records is the measure of the
 humidity of the air. To this instrument the name of ' Psychrometer

 has been given.

    A self-recording marine thermometer has been used by M. Pouchet,

 director of a French marine laboratory, which can be submerged to a
 depth of 120 feet, being raised every fifteen days for changing the paper
 of the recording portion. This is also described by Colonel Sebert, being
 made and designed by Messrs. Richard Freres.

      Coming under this head may be classed the various types of sunshine

 recorders, the simplest of which was designed years ago by Sir G. G-.
 Stokes, Bart., consisting of a sphere which focussed the sun's rays upon

 a graduated strip of paper, so as to give the intensity of the sunshine at
 various times. Other and improved instruments of the self-recording
 type have been since designed for this purpose.

      /. In recent years a careful study has been made, by means of self-
 recording instruments, both of the shocks resulting from earth- tremors or
 earthquakes, and of the vibrations in locomotives, vessels, and machinery.
 This work has been done through the agency of various self-recording
 instruments, which have cleared away a great number of erroneous ideas
 regarding earthquake shocks and vibrations generally.

       Self-recording instruments for examining earth-tremors, or seismo-

 graphs, have principally originated with the professors who have been
 fortunate enough to find a field for their labours in Japan," where these
 phenomena occur so frequently as to give tolerably constant employment
 to self-recording instruments. Professor Ewing and Professor Milne
                                  --

have botli made important contributions in this direction. In a paper ·

read before the Royal Society by Professor Ewing the principles of

seismographic construction are unfolded. The author remarks that

the difficalty in earthquake measurements is to find a point which

does not move during the disturbance. The bob of a pendulum, if

suspended by a spiral spring, remains at rest vertically and horizontally,

especially if the pendulum be long and the frame to which it is suspended

rigid but there are two reasons why an instrument on this principle is
                             ;

not efficient. In the first place, the recording portion is not easy to make

in a satisfactory manner; secondly, the motion of the point of suspension

causes a corresponding motion to be communicated to the bob, which, if

the period of earthquake oscillation agreed exactly with the pendulum's

free period, would altogether vitiate the result. He then describes a

seismograph devised by himself, in which solid cylindrical bobs are

pivoted with their axes vertical between steel centres. These centres

are carried by a frame, and attached to the frame is a style with a tracing-

point, so that when the frame is moved forward by a sudden earth-tremor

the inertia of the cylindrical bobs causes them to remain nearly, if not

Aquite, at rest.  plate or recording surface, which is connected with the

frame and moves with it, thus receives by means of the style a mark

corresponding in magnitude to the intensity of the earth-movement which

it is required to record. By placing the two frames carrying the bobs in

position at right angles to each other, the components of any horizontal

motion can be recorded. This instrument is called by the inventor the

' Astatic Horizontal Lever Seismograph.' Since that time Professor Ewing

very much improved bis original idea, and reference to papers describing

the result will be found in the index of subjects appended to the report.

Professor Milne has also devised self-recording arrangements in connec-

tion with earthquakes, many records obtained by which, in the grounds

of the Tokio Engineering College, having been described by him.^

Similar instruments have been used by Professor Milne ^ for studying

the motion of locomotives, in which both the vertical and the horizontal

motion is recorded, the continuous record being obtained on a band of

paper, as on the Gray-Milne seismograph. The authors mention the

following types of instruments :

1. ' For timing trains, and giving general information respecting the

condition of a line. This consists of the double-clock arrangement just

described, driving a continuous band of paper about 2^ inches broad at

the rate of 1 foot per hour. On this band only the vertical motion is

written ; but inasmuch as lateral jei'ks have usually a vertical component,

these also are in part recorded.

2, ' For giving detailed information respecting a line. In this instru-

ment clocks similar to those of No. 1 are employed, but the band of

paper driven by them is broader, and all the components of the motion

are recorded upon it. In addition to timing a train and showing irregu-

larities on the line, this instrument indicates curves and gradients, shows

when brakes are applied, &c.

3. ' For testing locomotives and carriages. This only differs fi-ora

No. 2 in the clockwork, which is arranged to drive the paper at the rate

of about I inch per second for a short interval of time,'

     In the discussion which followed the reading of this paper Mr. Milne
explained instruments made by him for the same purpose ; Mr. Dawson

and M. Kapteyn also mentioned other instruments for a similar purpose.

Quite recently an account has been given by Mr. Yarrow, in a paper '

read before the Institution of Naval Architects, of an instrument, called

by him the ' Vibrometer,' for investigating the results of a new method

of balancing marine engines in torpedo-boats. This instrument consists

of a drum provided with suitable clockwork, a.nd resting on a circular

plate. The circular plate is hung by three indiarubber suspenders to a

frame, which is rigidly connected with the hull of the boat. The circular

plate can slide freely up and down on three guides, and form part of this

Aframe.  pencil or style is attached to the frame, and placed in contact

with the clockwork drum. It is clear that since the pencil partakes of

any movement of the hull, while the barrel of the circular plate has a

free vertical motion, any up-and-down movement of the hull will be

recorded on the revolving drum, the axes of which are, of course, vertical.

By means of this instrument many important facts concerning the

vibration of the vessel were ascertained.

     g. Instruments for graphically recording the results of mathematical
operations have been frequently designed. In the year 1845 Mr. F.

Bashforth read a paper, an abstract of which appears in the British

Association report, and which he afterwards further expanded in a

pamphlet, and by means of lithographed diagrams explained the machine

itself. Concerning the action of the instrument mentioned in the

pamphlet ^ he remarks :

' Persons engaged in testing theory by experiment have frequently

derived great assistance from mechanical contrivances, which give rapid

and near approximations without the trouble in every separate case of

going through tedious multiplications and additions. The proposed

+machine would be capable of giving the values of S {b cos (nft a)} or of

+ --tracing the curve p='2!,{b cos (nO a)} , where n is any +ve or ve,

integer or fraction. It might be employed to find the numerical roots of

equations, correct, probably, to two places of decimals, to trace curves

representing the intensities of the different kinds of light in the rings

given by polarised light, or to illustrate the effect of the several terms

(separately or together) of the value of u in the lunar theory. The

accuracy of the values given by this machine would very nearly corre-

--spond to those of the slide rule the first two figures would be corfect,

the third doubtful.'

Probably the most important instrument of this class is the mechanical

tide-predicter, one form of which was constructed for the Tidal Committee

of the British Association. In this machine, which has been described ^ by

Sir W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin), there are ten shafts, giving respectively

the following tidal constituents :

      It has a hanging weight, consisting of an ink-bottle, with a glass
tubular pen which marks the tide level in a continuous curve on a long

band of paper, moved horizontally across the line of motion of the pen
by a vertical cylinder geared to the revolving shafts of the machine.

    An instrument of a similar kind was afterwards constructed by Mr.

Roberts for the India Office, and it was estimated that, by moving the
handle up and down through the range of a semi-diurnal tide in two
seconds, a year's curve could be produced in twentj'-four minutes. But
this is, however, ten times the speed to which the mechanism actually in
use limits the practical working of the India Office instrument. Sir

W. Thomson has therefore designed a third tide-predicter, which he

describes in the above paper, the general principle of which is therein
represented in an engraving.

     h. There are a variety of self-recording instruments which are
employed for chronographic purposes, such as giving the time of opening
the door of a furnace, or of charging a blast furnace, or of the passing of
a railway train, or of the period at which a watchman passes a certain
point. These are sometimes operated by direct mechanical action, as in

the watchmen's clocks invented by Mr. IBailey. One of the best of these
is an invention by Mr. F. M. Pratt, described in the ' English Mechanic'
These tell-tales are employed for controlling the watchmen of works,

hospital nurses, timekeepers of factories, inspectors of police, weighing-

machine men, gaswork stokers, stablemen (that it may be seen what

time the stable had been opened), domestic servants (to ascertain what
time they got up), fire brigades (to see what time the alarm-bell was
rung), scavenging superintendents, bank porters, dock warehousemen,

prison warders, gatekeepers, &c.

     Mr. Burke has invented a watchman's watch, which is made by Mr.
Bailey, and acts upon the principle of a mark being made on a recording
drum, to do which a key must be inserted, which can only be obtained at
each station which the watchman has to pass. Several different types of
recorders in connection with the time and movement of engines in mills
and factories are also made by Mr. Bailey. Instruments of this kind are
frequently actuated from a distance by means of an electric current.
Messrs. Richard Ereres make a controlling chronograph in which an
electro-magnet, carrying a pen, traces a continuous line. Every time
the process under observation closes the circuit and establishes a current,
the pen traces a vertical line, and the dui'ation of the process, as well as
the exact moment at which the marks are made, are given by the diagram.

     It will be seen that among the self-recording instruments mentioned

ai'e anemometers, barometers, chronographs, hygrometers, dynamometers,

speed-recorders, hydrometers, meters of all kinds, pressure-gauges,
pyrometers, tide-gauges, thermometers, ammeters, volt-meters, galvano-
meters, and chronometers. This is a colerably comprehensive list, and

a large number are also referred to in the accompanying appendix to

Various instruments by probably the two most important makers, Messrs.
Richard Freres, the French firm, and Mr. Bailey, of Salford, have been
referred to, as well as those of others, but a very large number of such
instruments have been designed and made of which the writer is obviously

unable to ascertain any details or give any notice. Tliere are also
numerous instruments made by the above makers of a compound nature,
recording several operations at once, which scarcely come under any
classification, such as instruments for exhibiting at one view time, pres-
sure, speed, and temperature connected with an engine, instruments for
giving a weekly diagram for speed, and pressure instruments for re-
cording the number of checks and the time given in by workmen.

III. Solution of Problems.

The solution of problems by graphical methods, that is to say, by

geometrical construction, has two aspects :

1. The use of known curves or simple plotted figures for problems,

which are well understood, and have become part of the subject-matter

of all engineering pocket-books. The drawing of such curves has already

been dealt with, and the increasing employment of 'graphic' tables

mentioned. Matters which a few years ago were questions of theory

only have now been placed by the light of experience in the catalogue of

cut-and-dry facts which can be plotted graphically. Take, for example,

Athe subject of girders and rolled joists.       few years ago each girder

was a subject of separate calculation by the engineer designing a struc-

ture. To-day, makers of such girders send out lists giving the sizes of

girders and all their proportions (including price) for the various condi-
tions of loading found in practice, and such lists can be, and often are,

put in a graphical form,^ and the engineer or architect, if he chooses to

trust such a table, has only to refer to it and select a suitable girder for

his work.
     Again, take the case of marine steam-engines and boilers. Here

many of the Board of Trade rules have apparently reached a final form

for cranks and crank-shafts, boiler-plates, stays, tubes, safety-valves, &c.,

and might be thrown into graphical form for practical use.

    Now the use of plotted tables is really an expeditious mode of graphi-

cal calculation, because even the interpolation of a value, which is gene-

rally required, and the use of a scale lor measurement, is practically a

graphical process, and is clearly to be distinguished from the construc-
tion and drawing of such a table from given numerical data. For this

reason some remarks are made upon the use of such tables in this divi-
sion of the subject; and for the same reason, under the same heading, the

subject of slide rules is also considered.

    2. But in mechanical science, whatever may be the results hitherto

attained, problems are always arising which require solution, and even
in the face of achievements such as the Forth Bridgoe, the Eiffel Tower.

A number of examples have been already given («ee p. 388).

                                                                                                    Ep2

420 BEPORT-- 1892.

the receut large span-roofs of large stations and exhibitions, the gigantic

floating machines of our navy, the St. Gothard, Mont Cenis, and other
tunnels, no one will be found to dispute the fact that the unknown in
practical science is greater than the known. Thus we have Poncelet
saying, in words which are quoted by Culmann in the first edition of bis
work, ' Die Grapbische Statik,' ' What are we to do with all those

theories which have arisen in the various branches of engineering that
are capable of scientific treatment ; which theories, though enabling us
to solve some certain problems, at a great expenditure of time and
trouble, are far too tedious to be applied to any and every case occurring
in practice, and, for the same reason, are not even suitable as a basis on
 which to work out ready-calculated tables ? ' and proceeds further to

remark : ' This question, no doubt, was in Poncelet's mind when he

endeavoured to invent geometrical solutions for the various problems
presented in engineering.

      ' And, in fact, the constructing engineer will give preference to geo-
metrical solutions wherever an accuracy of results up to three decimals
(one-thousandth), which can be perfectly well obtained, is sufficient ; for

--his drawing-instruments are always at hand. Drawing is his habitual

expression of thought " his language," and, thanks to his topographical
and geodetical training, he is more accustomed to judge as to the exact-
ness of sections, and to define lines and points with great precision, than
the architect or mechanician.'

      ' Poncelet's solutions were, invariably, mere conversions of previously

evolved analytical terms. No doubt Poncelet himself felt that this was
a roundabout way, and that a geometrical construction will much less

readily impress itself on the mind if, in applying the same, it is necessary
to bear in mind an analytically developed formula, the derivation of
which, probably, has meanwhile slipped our memory, than if the configu-
ration of lines presented by the problem does in itself form the basis
from which tbe solution may be evolved on purely geometrical principles.

--It was for this reason, probably, that he devoted himself industriously to

 the study of geometry as if filled with a presentiment of the great use
which the study might afford him. But it was in exceptional instances
only that he applied geometry for the solution of statical problems in the
architectural branch, while otherwise he invariably preferred analytical
solutions, which he subsequently " converted." '

     These remarks of Culmann have been quoted at length because of
the prominent position which he occupies as an exponent and advocate
of the purely geometrical method of treating graphical problems, and are
well worthy of careful consideration.

     They incidentally contrast the two lines of operation, viz. :
         a. The analytical method

                                                                                                                                                                        ;

         h. The geometrical method
upon one or other, or a combination of which, workers in diflPerent coun-
tries, approaching from whatever point of view, have attempted the solu-

tion of such problems.

     It may at once be remarked that the allusions to the geometrical

treatment of problems refer entirely to the representation of forces by
lines, and to one branch of such work, viz., statical problems in structures.
Hereafter other problems, such as those of dynamics and the representa-
tion of velocity, will be dealt with, but for the present the argument

refers solely to that branch of the subject known as graphic statics.

Returning to Calmann's words, it will be seen (1) that he is satisfied

as to the engineer's innate preference for the use of geometrical construc-

tion                   (2)  that  he is  perfectly convinced that geometrical                                                           methods  of
                    ;

solution of such problems are the best ; and (3) that he regards the

work of Poncelet in using so much the analytical method chiefly as

resulting from the want of sufficient geometrical machinery at his

disposal.

    Now Culmann himself, satisfied not only of the natural readiness of

the engineer to use geometrical methods, but of the inherent benefit of
purely geometric solutions, found in the growth and development of pro-
jective geometry the very machinery he could avail himself of, and which

he did, with results best described iu the language of a great thinker,
whose impartiality is undoubted. Cremona, in a preface to the Italian

--treatise of Sairiotti on graphical statics, writes : '

     ' Little more than twenty years have elapsed since Culmann published
the first edition of his immortal work, " Graphic Statics," and the
treatises and articles which have successively appeared in various parts
of the civilised world on the same subject are innumerable. By that

work, complete in its kind, the learned professor created a wonderful
combination of graphic methods based on projective geometry, and
demonstrated that by them the most varied problems of engineering

could be solved more simply and rapidly than appeared possible by the

use of mathematical analysis.

' For some time both professors and engineers were cool and sceptical

as to the promises                held   out  by the  new doctrine                                                              either  on  account of

their inveterate faith in the omnipotence of (Calculation, or because the

constructions of projective geometry had not yet become familiar, or,

finally, because the work of Culmann itself was not written in a style and

form susceptible of superficial study. . . .
     ' Germany, England, France, Scandinavia, and America were not

long in recognising the great efficacy of Culmann's studies. Books more
or less elementary were compiled, and courses of graphic statics were
established in the polytechnic schools and in other institutions for the

education of engineers.'

     The views above quoted of Cremona fairly represent those held in

Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and perhaps, to a less extent, in France.

That they have not taken root in England may be well illustrated by the

following extracts from English writers :

  --Professor Sydenham Clarke, in the preface of his book on graphic

statics,^ says :

     ' The study of graphic statics, as a subject sui generis, has made but
little progress in England, though the great value of numerous graphic
methods has long been fully acknowledged. While in many of the great
engineering schools of the Continent the subject is deemed worthy of a
professorial chair, in England it is left to be gleaned almost haphazard.

A method, more or less, is thrown into a course of teaching, according to

the predilection or dislike of the teacher for graphic modes of procedure.*

      Mr. James B. Chalmers, in the preface of liis treatise on the same

 subject,^ writes as follows :

      ' The following treatise is confined to the more valuable applications
 of the graphical method, the creation of Professor Culmann, of Zurich.
 "Were a preference for this method once established, it might then in
 England, as now in Germany and Italy, be built up into a systematic

 discipline, remarkably fitted to exercise the intellectual powers. Begin-
 ning with projective geometry as founded by Poncelet, followed by geo-
 metric statics as taught by Mobius, the Gahul -par le trait of Cousinery,
 the properties of the Funicular Polygon of Varignon, so remarkably
 extended and employed by Culmann, and their application to the Elastic

 Line by Mohr, we should have a course of engineering mechanics so
 invigorating to the mind that our students, having undergone its disci-
pline, would feel themselves men well pi'epared for work, capable of
 appreciating the conditions and reasoning upon the data of a large class
 of practical questions to which they might require to address themselves.

      ' From its birthplace in Switzerland, 1860, this method has passed

 into Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia, and Denmark, where, after Cul-
mann, Wilhelm Hitter, Cremona, Favaro, and many others, have com-
 municated their enthusiasm to their pupils, through whose superior

 discipline their respective countries may soon rival in engineering fame
that of the country which we fondly regard as its cradle, and as its most

 able instructress.

      ' The reason we apprehend lies, first of all, in its geometric character.
 The designs of an engineer are geometric conceptions ; his structures are
 geometric forms, within which forces statically combined act along geo-

 metric lines, so that it is natural that he strive to follow a train of geo-
 metric thought.'

     Still another writer may well be quoted, representing an American

--point of view. Mr. Jay Du Bois says, in his work on graphic statics : ^

      ' For the practical engineer the importance of graphical methods
 needs, indeed, to-day no demonstration. Such methods are everywhere
in use. But a simple and general system, which shall include all such
 solutions, and fi'om which they all flow, is, at least in this country,
unknown. Even in English literature there is to be found little more
than the very elementary deductions of our first chapter, so that it

may justly be said that the entire method owes its existence and develop-
ment to the labours of German scholars, and the enlightened appreciation
of German engineers.'

     Now it is to be noted that all these are writing, not of the actual

solution of problems by graphical means, but on the general adoption of
the geometrical basis of approaching such problems, though this is not
so clearly indicated as it might be in the first portion quoted of Mr.
Chalmers's remarks. Indeed, no one would deny that not only in graphi-
cal representation, already dealt with, but in the mechanical treatment
of, at any rate, one class of problems, viz., framework, English engineers
are in nowise behind, and it is a usual thing in engineering journals in

this country for graphic diagrams of stress to be given when illustrating

a new bridge or roof. Cremona ^ says of this branch of graphical methods,

' No section of graphical statics is more brilliant, or shows more effectu-

ally the services that geometry is able to render to mechanics, than

the one dealing with reciprocal figures and framed structures with constant

load.' It is in the use of purely geometrical methods of reasoning as the

bases of graphical construction that the English engineers do not at

present claim much interest.
     That one or two leading minds have here and there made important

contributions to the subject, notably the late Professor Clerk Maxwell

in giving the world the theory of reciprocal figures, does not in any way

vitiate the general truth of the foregoing remarks.

The fact is, that very few engineers in this country understand even

the nature of projective, modern, higher geometry, or geometry of

position, by all of which names it is variously called. This is not to be

wondered at, since it is scarcely taught at our colleges. Even at Cam-

bridge it has so insignificant a place as to be honoured with only one or

two questions in the Tripos. At Oxford the attention devoted to it is a

little more extended. Professor Henrici, whose article in the ' Encyclopaedia

Britannica ' places the elementary propositions of geometry clearly before

English readers," has always made the subject part of his mathematical

course of instruction, but it takes little, if any, part in the course of the

ordinary mathematical education of an engineer.

     But England does not stand alone in this respect, for the French

-- --translators of Culmann's work three engineers ^ remark :

' The reading of this work requires the knowledge of what was termed

recently higher geometry, and which is now called geometry of position,

or projective geometry. Although this science is not officially taught in

our schools, we hope this will not prove an obstacle to the spreading of
graphic statics.' And Culmann himself said in the preface of the first

edition of his work :

   We' have experienced unspeakable difficulties in securing for the

students attending our lectures a possession of the requisite preliminary

knowledge, by ensuring that geometry of position was made by the

Weeducational authorities an obligatory subject of study.                                                               have

lectured on graphic statics as long ago as 1860, yet it was not until

1864 that the students were provided with the requisite preliminary

instruction in geometry by means of an obligatory six-months course of

lectures.' But he goes on further to remark : ' For the engineer, and

for the technical man generally, geometrical instruction is no .less

important  than  analytical  instruction                                                     he  has  always  to  deal  with  the
                                                                                          ;

it be to him to have his stereographic perception trained and developed

to a certain extent, thus enabling him to resolve with ease plane pro-

jections into solid bodies, and to conceive in his mind a stereoscopic

view of the whole work of construction or machinery which is to be

executed. How much more progress might be made in graphic geometry,

or at least in geometry of situation, if the student could treat the

first named as a special application, to a given case of the latter ; how

man}' superfluous definitions and demonstrations would be spared to the
lecturer if they had already been grafted into the student's mind, so as
to be completely mastered by him, as parts of a more comprehensive
whole !

      This subject is thus shown to be one woi'thy of discussion, and th.e
question seems to turn on two points :

      1. The real intrinsic value of purely geometrical methods.
      2. The practical value of such methods to the ordinary engineer.
      1. That projective geometry leads to wide and important generalisa-
tion there can be no doubt, but that the benefit is so great as to make it

inexpedient to apply the analytic process to arrive at geometric results
 is quite another question.

      Culmann, not altogether unnaturally, criticises those who employ his
 results, but arrive at the understanding of them by other channels than
his own ; but can the statement in the preface to the French translation of
 his work be sustained in which he says

      ' Our publication was followed by a great number of elementary
 statics, in which, by reproducing even the most simple of our construc-

 tions, mostly without changing anything in them, the authors have
 striven to give analytical demonstrations of them.

   We --' imagine that the truth is not there that one will never succeed

 in tracing the lines of a construction, and execute simultaneously alge-
 braical operations which carry the explanation of that construction.
 Neither can one easily understand the signification of each line, and re-
 present to themselves statical relations, if one limits oneself to translate
 the formula whose developments are no longer clear to the memory.'

      If there is any truth in the preliminary remarks in this report, it is,
 after all, merely a question of regarding either the actual position of lines
 or the measurement of that position as representing the same thing to

 the mind, and it is certain that much that is useful in even Culmann's

 works has absolutely no necessary connection with projective geometry

 while some of his admirers, who quote his views at the beginning of their
 works on graphical statics with some amount of favour, actually employ

 largely the analytical methods, and, indeed, scarcely employ the methods

 of higher geometry at all. Professor Jay Du Bois ^ may be quoted as a

 good example of this.
       But, after all, the practical problems of engineers lie almost entirely in

 two dimensions of space, and it is perfectly possible to arrive at an under-
 standing of the ordinary problems which arise, by a due harmony of
 analytical and graphical methods.

      2. The second point is one which can only be answered by reference
 to the actual education of the engineer. Culmann's preface to the German
 edition of 'Die Graphische Statik,' speaking of the professors of South
 Germany, says :

      ' They were, indeed, totally opposed to the idea of regarding bodies in
 which forces are in equilibrium and lineal forms which represent these
 forces in magnitude and direction as correlative geometrical representa-
tions, and then applying to these the geometry of position, in which
the relations of such allied representation lay completely worked out.

I One man remarks that ' the interesting and practically useful results

   which statics afford would already have found common use if the scientific
   methods of modern geometry had not withheld many engineers from the
   study of this subject.' The much -respected professor wishes to make

    it more elementary, but he cannot bring that about without d and J ; and

    yet a knowledge of d and f requires a greater exercise of brain-power

    than the elements of the geometry of position does.

         The question is, if the d and f have to be learnt (as they certainly

    should be) for a great number of other applications, and the engineer
    finds it more easy to employ a method of reasoning with which he is

    familiar, will he not certainly do so ?
          Lastly, there is the argument, so often adduced, of the intellectual value

    of general methods, and doubtless it is true tliat a higher mental effort is
    required to reason from the general to the special, such as is required in
    the methods of projective geometry. However, teachers are almost
    unanimous in agreeing that the average student finds it far more easy to

   reason from the special to the general ; nay, it may be truly said that the
    number of students who have the power of grasping generalisations,

    such as are expected in the study which has just been discussed, is
    extremely limited, and that the result of trying to introduce this method

    is frequently disheartening to the majority of students, who would

    otherwise acquire sufficient knowledge of the subject for all the practical

    application they would ever have occasion for.

         So much space has been given for the setting forth of these views,

    and to bringing forward various views on the subject because of its im-
    portance, that the writer is unable for want of time to proceed further

     in time for the presentation to the Association in the present year.

         The object in view at the commencement was to collect and summarise
     all the problems of mechanical science for which graphical calculation
     and methods were employed. That he is unable to do for the present, and

     can only offer the following brief outline of the subject, dealing fully with
     two sections, indicated below, leaving it for the Committee of the Section
     to say whether they think it desirable that a further report should be

      presented.

            Summary of Graphical Problems.

1. The addition of parallel segments, including sliding calculation and

slide rules (which latter are dealt with in the present report).

2. The addition or combination of non-parallel segments.
3. The applications of graphical multiplication, including planimeters

and integrators, which are also dealt with.
     1. The first of these, as far as regards sliding calculation, has been

dealt with at tolerable length, and brought as far as possible up to date.

     There are numerous other applications of the addition of parallel

forces. The most important of these are the treatment of loads, including

the load on a beam, and the weight and buoyancy of a ship.

These problems are dealt  with  in  numerous  works                                for  example,  the
                                                                                ;

subject of shearing forces, the construction of diagrams of which for

every possible kind of loading might form a subject of somewhat lengthy

treatment.
--

426 EEPOET-- 1892.

     2. The second division, viz., the addition of non-parallel segments,
·covering, as it does, the whole range of the most fertile branch of graphic
statics, is worthy of a separate report. It must suffice here to give the
following as amongst the different headings nnder which it might be

treated :

(a) The study of reciprocal figures.

(h) Diagrams of forces for framed structure.

(c) The polygon of forces, and its application to arches and suspen-

    sion bridges.

(d) The subject of internal stress and the ellipse of stress.

(e) Machine problems dealing with the efficiency of machinei'y, as
        proposed by Fleeming Jenkin, and the ' method of instan-

    taneous centres,' applied with such effective results by Pro-

    fessor Kennedy in his ' Mechanics and Machinery.'

(/) Velocity of machine parts.                                 ,
(g) Hydro-mechanics.
(h) Crank effiart diagrams, &c.

     3. As to the thiz'd division almost a wider range opens out, com-
mencing with the principle of what Culmaun calls ' the rope polygon,' or
' funicular polygon,' and which he treats in his book under the heading
of ' Summation.' By means of this be shows how not only single but
whole series of lines of different ratios may be multiplied together, and

which, under the title of ' Culmann's Method,' is employed for the purpose

of bending moment, moment of inertia, finding the central ellipse and

the kern of sections, and still further applied in problems of deflection
and continuous girders.

    How fertile this graphic method may be made may be seen from

the following remark in Cotterill's ' Applied Mechanics,' second edition,

p. 303 :--

     ' Thus it appears that the curves of deflection, slope, and bending
moment are related to each other in the same way as the curves of bending
moment, shearing force, and load.

     ' The five curves, in fact, foi-m a continuous series, each derived from

the next succeeding by a process of graphical integration.'
     These are only a few of the problems to which graphical method

lends itself, and in connection with which there is abundant scope for

investigation and original research.

Addition of Parallel Segments, Sliding Calculation, and Slide Rules.

     Shortly after the invention by John Napier, in 1614, of logarithms,

Edmund Gunter, Gresham Professor, laid them down on a scale, so that

by means of a pair of compasses arithmetical questions might be solved.
Mr. Heather, in his work on mathematical instruments,' gives a full
explanation of the use of ' Gunter's lines,' as they were called, which
included not only logarithms of numbers, but other lines graduated so as
to represent logarithms of the sines, tangents, &c., and other calculated

values useful to navigators.

     Gunter's scale and its uses are also described. The slidinga: Guntei-'s

^Bcale appears to have been the first sliding rule ever made, and has since
^B>een followed by a very large number of others.'
Bp Writers on graphic statics recognise the slide rule as an example of

    the graphical method of calculation. Culmann, in the second edition of
    his book, gives a treatment of the subject (which he did not do in his first
    edition), and states in the preface that ' the chapter on sliding calculation

    was added to that on graphical calculation. It consists really of many

     treatises on sliding calculation. Addition of logarithms is not considered as

    a consequent row of lines, but rules are given on independent figures
    placed opposite each other, by whose means the number of rules is
    immensely increased. Moreover, this very useful little instrument is
    much too little used, and I thought to add to its extension by introducing
    its theory in graphical calculation, to which it properly belonged.'

         The use and theory of the slide rule are fully described in the English
    treatises mentioned in the footnote below,^ and need not be further dealt

     with.

         It is also treated, in addition to Culmann, by various other foreign
    writers, in works on graphic statics. Favaro, amongst others, states that
     Sedlaczek ^ mentions sixteen different kinds of instruments using log-

     arithmic division, as follows :

            1. The ordinary sliding rule.
              2. Rule of d'Aesterle.
             3. The calculating-rule of Lenoir.
            4. The rule of Schwind.

               5. Engineer's sliding rule,

             6. The rule of L. C. Schulz.
             7. The inverted slide rule.
             8. The rule of Higgison.
             9. The improved calculating-rule.

        A10. rule for millwrights.
        A11. rule for marine use.

    This list suffices to show that almost every kind of variation may be
made in the form of slide rules ; there are a few others, which do not
appear to be described in any book in this country, which may be

mientioned, viz. :

     1. Boucher's patent calculator, which is only of the size of an ordinary

watch. It has faces back and front. On the front is a logarithmical

scale in four lines, being on the whole equal to 15 inches of straight scale.
This produces a more open scale than the ordinary slide rule. There are
two index hands, one on the central axis, and one fixed upon the side of
the case. The central hand revolves by the turning of a milled head at
the side of the case. The entire dial revolves by the milled head upon
one face ; any operations in addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,

and proportion can be performed to four places of figures. And upon the

other face trigonometrical calculations, viz., logarithms, powers, and

roots.

    2. Hudson's horse-power computing scale may be mentioned as a con-
venient little pocket instrument with two sliding scales. By this means

--the following quantities can be easily calculated : (a) Horse-power of an

engine, (6) the necessary size of an engine for any desired power, (c) pis-
ton speed, (d) the mean pressure of a simple or compound engine, (e)
ratio of compound cylinders.

     3, Professor Fuller's spiral calculating rule is specially described by

both Culmann and Favaro, and consists of a cylinder that can be moved
up and down upon and turned round an axis, which is held by a handle.
Upon this cylinder is wound in a spiral a single logarithmic scale. Fixed
to the handle is an index. Two other indices, whose distance apart is the

axial length of the complete spiral, are fixed to the cylinder. This
cylinder slides in like a telescope tube, and thus enables the operator to

place these indices in any required position relative to the cylinder. Two

scales are provided, one on the piece carrying the movable indices, the
other on the cylinder. The inventor remarks that it must be remembered
that all calculations founded on measurements of length, weight, and
time can only be approximate, as the data for them are so. Except,
therefore, with the most refined measurements, it is a waste of time to

carry results beyond the fourth figure. The new rule possesses advan-
tages over the old form besides that of increased length of scale. The
setting and reading are performed by indices, and not by scale against
scale, and this is very much less troublesome. Also, multiplications and
divisions containing a series of factors can be worked with the greatest
facility, and as the logarithms of numbers by the use of scales are easily
read, the powers and roots of numbers are within the capacity of the

instrument.

     4. Thacher's cylindrical slide rule. The ordinary sliding rule in use is
12 inches long, with radii of 11 and 5^ inches, the divisions of which are
cut by hand, copying from a machine-divided plate. In Thacher's instru-
ment the radii are 60 and 30 feet, the divisions of which are printed
directly from machine- divided plates. These plates contain over 33,000
divisions, calculated to seven places of decimals from Babbage's tables by

using a common multiplier, every line being subjected to coi-rection for

error of screw and temperature variation, so that possibly every line-
centre is within -0001 inch of its true place. The plates contain ovci-

17,000 engraved figures. The scales, being of great length, will give

results correctly to four, and usually to five, places of figures.
     The instrument consists of a cylindrical slide provided with a knob at

each end, and which admits of both rotary and longitudinal movement

within an open framework or envelope of equidistant bars of triangular
section. The bars are connected to rings at their ends, which admit of
rotation within standards attached to the base. The surface of the slide
is exposed in the openings between the bars, the lower edges of which

are in contact with it.
     The scales for this instrument have a length forty times as great

as for an ordinary slide rule of the same length, and more than sixty-five

times as great as for the ordinary slide rule in use.

     With this instrument directions are given for not only performing

the ordinary arithmetic operations, but for the conversion of foreign

weights and measures, calculations and action with money matters,

mechanics, specific gravity, timber mensuration, gauging, railway woik,

weights of metal, calculations for plate girder bridges, truss bridges, &c.

    Planimeteks and Integeators.

     The first recorded idea of the planimeter is attributed to Hermann, of
Munich, who worked it out with Lammle. The idea of Hermann's,
which was published in 1814, seems to have fallen into oblivion; while
in 1827 Oppikofer, of Berne, constructed a planimeter which was called
by his name. Professor T. Gonella, of Florence, in 1829 re-invented a
similar instrument. Oppikofer's planimeter was accorded a prize at
Paris in 183G. Improvements were made by Wettle and Starke in 1849.
In England, Sang, Moseley, and others also devised planimeters. All
these depended on the principle of recording the area by revolutions of a
roller which worked by frictional contact, sometimes on a disc and
sometimes on a cone, its distance from the centre of the disc or the apex

of the cone being proportional at every distance to the breadth of the
figure whose area was to be measured, the revolution of the cone or disc
depending at the same time on the length of the figure.

     In 1856 Professor Amsler-LafiTon invented and brought before the
world the well-known Amsler planimeter, which has proved up to
the present day to be the simplest and best of all such instruments, in
spite of ail attempts that have been made to improve upon it and obviate
its one or two defects. The action of the Amsler planimeter, as is well
known, depends upon the principle that a roller, if moved obliquely across
a smooth surface, turns through an amount corresponding to the distance
it has moved perpendicular to its axis. Hence the breadth of a figure
being measured by the inclination of a bar carrying the roller, and the
length by the distance which the wheel moved, the actual turning of the

roller gives a record of the area.

     The following measurements made by General Peaucellier, cited by
Favaro, give the results of the measurements of a quarter of a circle ten
millimetres radius divided into ten segments by parallel ordinates, and
show the accuracy of the Amsler planimeter as compared with other
methods :

variation which occurs owing to different kinds of paper being used for
Adiagrams on which the planimeter has to operate.
                                                       class of instruments

has therefore been invented called precision polar planimeters, the first

mattempt in this direction being by Mr. Hohmann, of Bamberg, in 1882,
coujunction with Coradi, of Zurich. In this planimeter what corresponds

to the rolling wheel of the Amsler planimeter works on a prepared

disc, which in°turn is driven by rollers from the paper, so that the result
is very much magnified. At the same time the roller itself always works
Aupon the same surface.      number of such instruments have since been

devised, many of which were exhibited among the scientific instruments
at the international Inventions Exhibition at London, 1885, and the
more important have been described in a paper on integrators by the

     In all these planimeters the roller slips over the surface, but there is
another totally different class of instrument in which no slipping of the
roller as it moves to and fro is supposed to take place. Such a plani-

meter was suggested by the late Professor Clerk Maxwell. ^ On such a

principle also the disc, globe, and cylinder integrator of Professor James
Thomson has been designed. This mechanism has been used by Sir
William Thomson in his tide- calculating machine already referred to,

and obtains the harmonic analysis of the tides for subsequent operations

with the tide-predicter.
Instruments of this class have been designed by Professor Vernon

Boys, Mr. Abdank Abakanowicz, and the writer. These instruments

mare referred to in the paper by the writer already mentioned, and also
a recent treatise on ' Integraphes.' ^ This treatise commences with an

explanation of the properties of the integral curve, and then proceeds to

describe integrators in which the area of a figure is measured by the
height to which a roller rises in the curve of its movement round the
Aperiphery of the curve to be integrated.

instruments for drawing an integral curve, designed by Mr. Boys, M.
Zmurko, and Mr. Abdank Abakanowicz, are then described. The work,
which contains 150 pages, then proceeds to describe the application of

these instruments to various mechanical problems, such as bridges, earth-
works, naval arcliitecture, electric machines, and for obtaining the work

performed by engines.                                                                                                                                                                                           , . , ,,

   A mnew planimeter is made by Messrs. Richard Freres                                                                                                                                                     which there

to be noted that the theory of the instrument is the same as that of the
VVettle- Starke, being simply a disc and roller integrator.

      Closely allied to instraments for obtaining the area of the surface

are the moment planimeters. There are two possible ways of employing
planimeters for this purpose. The first of these ways was suggested in

connection with the disc, globe, and cylinder integrator by Sir William
Thomson,' and amounts to the integration of a simple linear differential
equation. This method has been treated in a paper- in connection
with sphere and roller mechanism. Another principle is to cause the
measuring roller to be directly turned at a rate which is made to vary,
not, as in the simple planimeter, with the value of the ordinate (y), but
with its second or third power. Though no method of directly doing
this has apparently been suggested, yet the same result is practically

effected by the beautiful application of a mathematical principle in the

' moment integrator ' of Professor Amsler.

     This instrument can be employed for obtaining the contents of
embankments and the material moved in cuttings for civil engineering
purposes, in which not only the cross-sections vary, but the slope and
surface of the ground. These and other matters are described at length,
and also the limits of accuracy of planimeters are given, in a paper
already alluded to on mechanical integrators, in the ' Proceedings of the
Institution of Civil Engineers,' vol. Ixxxiii. For the history of plani-

meters the following paper by Favaro may also be cited : ' Beitriige zur

Geschichte der Planimeter,' von Dr. Antonio Favaro, 1873, published by
V. Waldheim, Vienna.

Shield Tunnelling in Loose Oround under Water Pressure, with
    special reference to the Vyrnwy Aqueduct Tunnel under the

    Mersey. By GtEORGE F. Deacon, M.Inst.G.E.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso among

                                                              the Reports.]

It is impossible, within the limits of a British Association paper, to give

anything like an historical account of the tunnel which has recently been

successfully completed under the river Mersey for connecting the Lanca-

shire and Cheshire portions of the Vyrnwy Aqueduct. A romantic and

instructive account might well be written of the battles with the elements,

of the repeated failures and successes, and of the hairbreadth escapes,

with ultimate pronounced success, which attended this subterranean and

subaqueous work.

From first to last the operations, including stoppages, occupied forty-

seven months. At the end of twenty months the first contractors had

completed the work of driving and lining the tunnel from the Cheshire

shaft to a distance of 57 feet out of a total of 805 feet required, when,

having also sunk the greater part of the Lancashire shaft, they ceased

work. The second contractors, rather than reopen the disturbed ground

of the old workings, began, with permission, at a higher level on the

Lancashire side. At the end of a further period of twenty-one months

they had driven and lined 182 feet from the Lancashire shaft. They

then relinquished the work, and it was taken up by the Corporation of

Liverpool, most of the men being retained and one of the contractors

continuing to superintend them. After this the remaining length, about

620 feet, was driven and lined in four and a half months, the maximum

progress being 57 feet per week of 110 hours.

In the case of the first Thames Tunnel the practical difficulty of

carrying on the operations successfully, either by contract or piecework,

impressed itself upon the mind of the elder Brunei. It was, indeed, the

only evil against which, with marvellous foresight and ingenuity, he

could not make provision. The same sort of difficulty has very forcibly

shown itself in this case, and there appears to be no doubt tha.t if the
work had been taken up in the first icstance on the basis ultimately

adopted, the whole of it would have been as successfully and economically

performed as the last length of 623 feet, which was carried out, without

the intervention of a contractor, in four and a half months.

The general particulars of the Vyrnwy Aqueduct Tunnel are as

follows :                                                     Ft.

     The shafts are lined with cast-iron cylinders, the tunnel with cast-
iron segments bolted together and planed on the abutting edges.

     The peculiar difficulties of this work arose from the fact that, while
the whole of the material (except certain small lenticular masses of clay)
through and beneath which the tunnel was driven was perfectly loose
and full of water under direct pressure from above, it constantly varied

in the size of its component parts from the finest mud to the coarsest
shingle, containing comparatively little sand. In homogeneous mud the

operations would have been comparatively easy, but the face of the exca-
vation was quite commonly composed of three totally dilFerent materials,
such as open shingle, sand, and mud, all three under the full and varying
pressure of the tidal water above, and all three behaving in a totally
different manner ; while in some cases a band of hard clay was met with,
impervious in itself, but surrounded by water under pressure, never
covering the whole face, but sometimes in the bottom, sometimes in the

middle, and sometimes in the top.

     The following considerations will make the great difficulty thus pre-
sented more obvious. In sinking a shaft under air pressure we free the
ground by excavation within and beneath the circular cutting edge
attached to the lovsrest cylinder. That edge being horizontal, we are

generally able to maintain the air within the vertical cylinders at such a

pressure that the water is kept back at every point of the cutting edge.

The cylinders, then, owing to their own or to a superimposed weight, sink
farther. They are from time to time lengthened by adding cylinders at

the top ; and by freeing the ground below the cutting edge this lining is

sunk to the required depth.

    In 1825 Brunei began the use of the first iron tunnelling shield. By

--this marvellous adaptation of means to ends of mechanical methods to

meet every physical difficulty that great personal experience of tunnelling

--could suggest we find an advance in the science of tunnelling which,

having regard to the materials then available, was greater than any
advance since made. The shield was, like the brickwork forming the
twin tunnels, rectangular. It supported the ground in front. It sup-

ported the ground overhead, not only by an inverted slipper travelling
with the shield, but by an extension backward, consisting of a wrought-
iron plate attached to the slipper and resting upon the top of the finished
brickwork, over which it was drawn as the shield advanced. For the
rest, the shield was divided vertically into twelve vertical frames, each
capable of being advanced alternately or in any other order ; and each of

these vertical frames supported against the face of the excavation forty-

-- --four timber shields, each as long as the frame was wide viz., 3 feet and

6 inches deep ; and each of these minor shields could be removed or

advanced separately.
                              ----

534 REPORT-- 1892.

    Next came Mr. Peter Barlow, who more nearly imitated, in horizontal
driving, the sinking of a cast-iron cylinder. He acknowledged his
indebtedness to Brunei, the great originator of shield tunnelling. He
substituted cast iron for brickwork, made his tunnel circular, and sur-

rounded his circular shield by a cylinder which overlapped the tunnel,
not merely at the top, but all round. For the screws used by Brunei to
propel his great frames and minor shields Mr. Barlow substituted
hydraulic rams, and he pushed the shield forward in stages to a sufficient
extent to enable him to add ring by ring to the forward end of the tunnel

lining.

     This device was explained by Mr. Barlow in a pamphlet published in

1867, ' On the Relief of London Street Trafl&c, with a Description of the
Tower Subway, now shortly to be executed.' According to his method,

he carried out with complete success the Tower Subway, eight feet in
diameter, beneath the Thames. Since that time Mr. Greathead has
introduced many ingenious improvements and additions.

      In applying this method directly loose materials under water pressure

are met with the much greater difficulty of driving horizontally than of
smking vertically is experienced. If artificial air pressure is employed

--and in many cases it has not yet been found practicable to dispense with

it new difficulties arise.
     The conditions of equilibrium between the air pressure, within the

tunnel and the water pressure without the tunnel are obviously diffei'ent
at different levels of the face. Such equilibrium as permits the work to

be continued is difficult to attain, and when attained is highly unstable.
To meet this difficulty Mr. Greathead has devised many ingenious
arrangements, in one of which he excavates by means of hydraulic jets in
front of the closed shield or diaphragm (still surrounded by the annular
shield overlapping the finished work), and removes the fluid ground by a

pipe passing through the shield to the tunnel.
      But the great variety of material met with in the Mersey Aqueduct

 Tunnel, including large shingle and in many cases heavy oak timber in

 good condition, lying prostrate across or parallel with the axis of the
 tunnel, rendered the use of any such methods impracticable.

      In order to understand rightly the nature of the problem, regard must
be had to the following considerations :

      Imagine a face with loose material at the end of the finished portion
 of the tunnel subject to the pressure, let us say, of 30 feet of water to the
 top, and of 40 feet of water to the bottom of the tunnel, the tunnel being
 charged with air to balance, let us suppose, the 40 feet. One of two
 things immediately takes place. Either the air pressure, overbalancing
 the water pressure where at the higher part of the face it has only a
 head of 30 feet, rushes out in such quantity as to form an upward funnel
 through the strata, in which case water rushes in below where the pres-
 sure in front of the shield is 40 feet ; or the air simply displaces the water
 in the interstices of the porous ground. This latter action is also very
 rapid. The wet surface of the face seems instantly to dry up ; in fact, so
 complete and rapid is the drying that in a few seconds.it is difficult to
 imagine that the face has been wet within the last twenty-four hours. But
 with this change the whole condition of equilibrium is altered. The head

--of water at the face is partly displaced by a head of air a great bubble

 in the interstices of the ground, having the form of a balloon, continuously
 supplied with air, from the end of the tunnel, which it dissipates from its
ON SHIELD TUNNELLING IN LOOSE GROUND.  535

upper surface into countless smaller bubbles, so that the total pressure at

the face is suddenly much diminished. The flow of air through the inter-

--stices of the material continues, and only attains a normal rate equal to
--the supply of air to the tunnel when the pressure in the tunnel has so

far fallen as to exactly balance the static head of air and water above the
face, plus the friction of the moving air in the interstices of the ground.
This state of things lasts, and the ground continues to be held back in a
visibly dry condition, until, by a change of resistance to the passage of

the air upwards thi'ough the ground, the equilibrium is again disturbed
With every rise or fall of the tide such a change occurs, and in the case

of the Vyrnwy Aqueduct Tunnel under the Mersey it took place in virtue

of a change of the strata at every few yards driven. In a vertical shaft

such changes are comparatively unimportant, but in a horizontal tunnel

the case is clearly very different.

     Even in ground of uniform porosity it is generally difficult to keep
the water back at the lower edge of the shield, and obviously this must
be so, because at this point the water when quiescent has nearly the full
hydrostatic hea,d, notwithstanding the great bubble of air moving in the

interstices above it. It is therefore generally necessary to permit a small
inflow of water to take place at this point, and thus to allow the friction
of the water through the ground to bring the pressure in the ground at

the bottom of the shield down to the lower pressure in the tunnel re-
quired to balance the pressure higher up the face ; but, if the flow at this
lower point is allowed to become sufficient to disturb the ground, the

resistance to that flow is reduced, the equilibrium is upset, the great

bubble is displaced and lifted by the moving sand and water below, and

an inrush instantly occurs.

     So much for strata of uniform porosity. But, as already stated, the
Vyrnwy Aqueduct Tunnel had to be driven through rapidly varying
strata. From time to time, without any warning, the resistance to the

inward passage of water at the lower edge of the shield suddenly fell.
Almost instantly the great bubble of air was lifted bodily, and the face
of dry ground became a surging current of liqiiid mud. Occasionally
the same change began at a higher level of the face, owing to the resist-
ance of a higher stratum to the passage of water rapidly falling. But

however it arose, the result was an instant upsetting of the equilibrium,
and a dangerous rush of liquid ground into the tunnel.

     The shield employed by the second contractor for driving the Vyrnwy

--Aqueduct Tunnel was of the Barlow form a cylinder with its forward

end carrying a cutting edge, and its backward end overlapping the

finished work all round, and a diaphragm across it provided with many

covered openings, through which the excavation was performed. But

the construction of the shield was much too light, and when the work

 was taken over by the Corporation, the cutting edge had collapsed and
 bent inwards for about one-fourth of the circumference to an extent in
 one place of about 15 inches. Moreover, there was a longitudinal crack
 near the bottom of the annular shield, extending from the tail nearly to

 the diaphragm.

      As usual in such cases, it was at this stage commonly asserted that
 the work was impracticable, and would never be finished. It had most
 seriously delayed the completion of the Vyrnwy Aqueduct; but even at
 this late period the necessity for obtaining an Act of Parliament to
 deviate the line of aqueduct was in some quarters seriously contemplated.
536 REPORT-- 1892.

Familiarity -with the subaqueous workings had, however, only served to

confirm the author's opinion of the feasibility of the undertaking, which
at an earlier stage he had offered to carry out without the intervention of

a contractor, and this course was now decided upon.
     To have to conduct the work with a shield insufficiently strong and

in such a condition was not a satisfactory beginning. The author had no

doubt whatever that with a properly designed shield it could have been

rapidly performed. He was not certain that it could be done with the

existing shield, but all things considered, and rather than attempt to
replace it in the disturbed ground in which it then lay, it was thought
better to repair and strengthen the existing shield, and at least to make
an effort to proceed with it. The repairing and strengthening of the
cutting edge was successfully performed, and 42^ months after the com-
mencement of the first contractor's work the tunnel was recommenced.
The most effective method was found to be to remove the lower part of
the diaphragm, as shown in the model exhibited, to regulate the air

pressure as nicely as possible at such a point below the hydrostatic

-- --pressure that, while so long as the shield was kept moving it was

 generally insufficient to blow a funnel from the upper edge of the
 shield to the river above, it was just sufficient to prevent an inflow
 at the lower edge of the shield sufficiently rapid to carry the ground

 with it.

      At intervals round the cutting edge steel teeth were added before the
 work was recommenced, and the author is disposed to think that they
 were of great use in penetrating shingle. Several feet behind the main
 diaphragm was placed a partition projecting upwards to a level above
 that of the underside of the remaining portion of the main diaphragm.
 This proved to be exceedingly useful when a blow of sand and water oc-
 curred. It did not materially hinder access to or from the front of the
 shield, while there can be no doubt that when a blow took place it choked
 itself more readily than if such an obstruction had not existed. The
 author was indebted to Sir Benjamin Baker for suggesting this device,
 and that of the teeth.

      During the latter part of the progress the longitudinal crack already
 mentioned near the bottom of the shield became worse, another crack
 worked from it circumferentially behind the diaphragm, and the plates of
 that portion turned down like a ploughshare from their proper position.
 This caused a delay of twelve days, included in the 4h months. The
 ground at the time was as bad as it could be, but the piece, 6^ feet long
 and 9 feet wide, was successfully cut away and replaced in situ. The por-
 tion cut av.ray could not be removed, but was left behind by the advancing
 shield when the work was recommenced.

       In judging of this work it is not to be supposed that it was under-
 taken in a foolhardy manner. Such an operation was never contemplated
 when the parliamentary plans were deposited, but, on the contrary, the
  aqueduct jnpes were shown by those plans to be laid in the bed of the

 --river, and the softest bed was chosen for the purpose the very worst

  place, in fact, for the construction of a tunnel. For reasons which it is
  not necessary to recount, the question of the depth at which the aqueduct
 should be laid was referred to the Board of Trade. The Board would
 probably have been more merciful if it had foreseen, as the advisers of
  the Corporation of Liverpool foresaw, the pending difficulties ; but, as a
  matter of fact, the decision required the aqueduct to be laid at such a
ON SHIELD TUNNELLING IN LOOSE GROUND.  537

depth that tunnelling became a necessity. The necessity having arisen, it
was not shirked, and the work has been saccessfully accomplished.

     In conclusion, the author desires to draw attention to the fact that the
condition of unstable equilibrium to which he refers, and which creates

most of the difficulties in shield and pneumatic tunnelling, rapidly in-

creases with the diameter of the tunnel. He has no doubt whatever
that a shield may be constructed in any particular case to meet all the
contingencies that can arise ; but it is from works like the Vyrnwy

Aqueduct Tunnel under the Mersey, in which the means of meeting
difiBcnlties are not sufficiently provided, and where success is nevertheless

attained, that the most valuable lessons are to be learnt.

Report of the Comrrdttee, consisting of Sir W. H. Flower

     {Chairman)^ Dr. J. Gr. G-arson {Secretary), Dr. J. Beddoe,
     Greneral A. H. L. Pitt-Rivers, Mr. Francis Gtalton, Dr. E. B.

    Tylor, and Mr. E. W. Brabrook, appointed for the purpose of
     editing a new Edition of ' Anthropological Notes and Queries.^

The Committee have to report that, in accordance with previous

Reports, the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland has

now completed the task entrusted to it of editing and publishing a second

edition, consisting of 500 copies, of ' Notes and Queries on Anthropology,'
at a cost of 86L, which includes the cost of partially stereotyping the
work for use in a future edition. This expenditure has been met as

--follows : Grants from the British Association, 701. ; donation by the late

Dr. Muirhead, of Glasgow, 101. ; and the balance by members of the

Committee.

     The work as published consists of 242 pages, as against 146 pages in
the previous edition ; a double-coloured plate and three other new plates
have been specially prepared for this edition, and the illustrations of the
former edition have been again used as far as the editors have thought it

desirable. All the sections have been thoroughly revised, several of
them have been rewritten, others which were left blank in the first edition

have been filled up in this, and several new sections have been added.
     As the Committee considered that the object for which the work is

published is to enlist the co-operation of as many workei's as possible, as

well as to guide and direct them in their observations, the Committee
have arranged with the Council of the Anthropological Institute that,
notwithstanding its increased size and cost of production, the publishing
price of the new edition shall be the same as that of the first edition,
namely 5s., and that a discount of Is. &cl. shall be allowed to members of
the British Association and Anthropological Institute, making the nett
price of the work 3s. 6J. for cash, at the office of the Anthropological

Institute, 3 Hanover Square, London, W.

      The Committee consider it very important for the advancement of
anthropological science that means should be taken to bring the work
under the notice of travellers and others who are willing to undertake
anthropological research, and in some cases to make direct application
to persons in a position to collect information on various subjects included
in the scope of the work. To do this the Council of the Anthropological
 Institute possess far greater facilities than any committee of the British
538 REPOET-- 1892.

Association. The Committee therefore recommend that this duty be

delegated to the Institute, which, they have ascertained, is willing to

undertake it for the  Association                                                       and  they further recommend  that  the
                                                                                     ;

Institute be entrusted Avith the distribution of this second edition by gift

and by sale in the way it may consider most conducive to the objects for

which the work was designed, on the understanding that the sum realised

from sales be kept by tiie Anthropological Institute in a sepai'ate account

towards defraying the cost of hereafter preparing and publishino- a third

edition of the work when necessary. The Committee have, in the mean-

time, placed 150 copies at the disposal of the Institute for this purpose,

for review, and for presentation to the editors and the authors of Sections,

whose labours have been entirely gratuitous. The Anthropological Insti-

tute has undertaken to advertise the book gratuitously in its journal.

The Committee have to report that during the past year a large amount
of information has been collected by Mr. and Mrs. Bent during their
travels in Mashonaland, and submit the following account of their journey,

by Mr. Bent, as their report.

            Report to the Committee on Investigations in Mashonaland.

             By Mr. J. Theodore Bent, Secretary of the Committee.

     The principal feature of our work in Mashonaland consisted in study-
ing, making measurements and plans, and excavating in the ruins called
Zimbabwe in Mashonaland. For three months after this work was over
we travelled through the country, visiting the native kraals and collecting
a large mass of anthropology from the habits and customs we saw around
us. In the following report I shall deal more at length on the subject
of the rnins, as they formed the main object of our work.

     The ruins of the Great Zimbabwe, which name I have given to dis-
tinguish them from the numerous minor Ziuibabwes scattered over the
country, are situated in south latitude 20° 16' 30" and east longitude
31^ 10' 10", at an elevation of 3,300 feet above the sea-level, and form
the capital of a long series of such ruins stretchiug up the whole length
of the west side of the Sabaj River, the southernmost which we visited
being that on the Lundi and the northernmost in the Mazoe Valley there

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

are also many other ruins on the Limpopo, in the Transvaal, in Mata-
beleland, at Tati, the Impakwe and elsewhere, all of the same type and
construction, which time would not permit of our visiting. Some are
equal to the ruins of Great Zimbabwe in workmanship ; others, again, are

very inferior, and point to the construction and occupation of this country
having continued over a long period, probably centuries ; and then all
would seem to have been abandoned at one time in the face of some over-
whelming calamity, for all the gateways at the Great Zimbabwe and at
                                                                          ON THE EUINS OF MASHOXALAND.                                                                    539

Matinclela, the second ruin in importance, eighty miles north-east of it as

the crow flies, have been carefully walled up as for a siege, and a forcible

entry had been effected into the Great Zimbabwe by a gap in the weakest

part of the large circular building. Doubtless at this captui-e of the

fortresses a wholesale massacre of the inhabitants took place, and a com-

plete destruction of the people and their objects of art.

The Great Zimbabwe ruins cover a vast area of ground, and consist

of the large circular building on a gentle rise, with a network of inferior

buildings extending into the valley below, and the labyrinthine fortress

on the hill, about 400 feet above, naturally protected by huge granite

boulders and a precipice running round a considerable portion of it.

From the plan and model exhibited a fair idea of the lower building can

be obtained. It is built of small blocks of granite broken with the

hammer into a uniform size, but bearing no trace of chisel-marks what-

soever, and no mortar had been used in the construction. In parts this

encircling wall is 30 feet high and between 16 and 17 feet in thickness,

and the courses of small stones are carried out with surprising regulai'ity,

arguing an excessive amount of labour, at a time when slave labour was

abundant and time no object, and an accurate knowledge of levelling.

There ai'e three entrances on the north side of the circle, carefully

rounded off and protected on the inside with buttresses : that to the north,

facing the fortress on the hill, would appear to have been the principal

one, the small space inside being floored by strong reddish cement.

Five passages led away from this entrance amongst the labyrinthine

buildings inside : the one to the left went down some cement steps, and

was carefully protected by a doorway consisting of two buttresses with

apertures on either side to receive some form of door, which seems to

have been universally employed in the buildings, but which at the time

of the siege had been removed and their places supplied by walls carefully

constructed of the same kind of stones as the outer walls ; then it led

into the long narrow passage which conducted between high walls to the

sacred enclosure.

    When we got to the Great Zimbabwe all the entrances were closed
up. By climbing over fallen debris we reached the interior, only to find

ourselves impeded by a maze of thick tropical vegetation which entirely

concealed the ground plan of the building, and which took us some days

to clear away.

The above-mentioned long mysterious passage led, as I have said, to

the sacred enclosure, where                                               stand                the  two  towers                                         the  largest  is  now
                                                                                                                                                     ;

32 feet high, with a girth of 53 feet 10 inches, and had presumably a few

more courses                                                              a few courses below  the  summit ran                                          a  pattern formed by
                                                                       ;

the stones in one course being placed edgeways. This tower is really a

wonderful structure, of perfect symmetry, and with coui'ses of unvarying

regularity. By working underneath it and by extracting as many stones

as we dared from two holes in the side, which we afterwards replaced, we

satisfactorily demonstrated that it was solid ; it was built on no other
foundation but the hard clay of the place, and covered nothing, and the

foundations only go down about two feet below the present level and a foot

below a floor of cement which presumably covered this enclosure. It

has been preserved to us simply by its solidity and the way in which the

stones have supported one another. Its religious purport would seem to

be conclusively proved by the numerous finds we made in other parts of

the ruins of a kindred nature.
540 KEPOET-- 1892.

There are several points of interest connected witli this sacred en-

closure. The inner wall in front of the tower had been decorated with

courses of black slate                                                                                                 a curious conduit  about a foot   square  and  regu-
                                                                                                                    ;

larly constructed runs right through the thickness of the outer wall at

its thickest point. Similar and equally inexplicable conduits we found

about the temple on the fortress. Then there is the raised platform, ap-

proached by cement steps and a gateway just in front of the tower,

covered itself with a thick cement, into which a monolith had been

stuck                                  this platform must have been for                                                                   the  king  or  officiating  priest.
                                    ;

The whole of the sacred enclosure had been most carefully protected by

gates and buttresses : it is sunk a little lower than the rest of the build-

ing, and the outer wall is here at its strongest and thickest, and is, more-

over, decorated on the outside with the pattern which stops abruptly at

the place corresponding with the termination of the sacred enclosure in

the interior, and the summit of the wall for this portion only had been

decorated with large monoliths.

The rest of the enclosure would appear to have been occupied by

private buildings also enclosed with circular walls, according, as Doughty

tells, to the ancient Arabian custom of combining their temples and

fortifications in one ; and El Masoudi also tells us that most of the

Sabsean temples were round.

The monoliths form a marked feature : two over 13 feet in height

stand near the north-western entrance ; a third lay prostrate a few yards
away. The summit of the walls, too, was interesting ; it had been ap-
proached by steps from the pi'incipal entrance, was originally paved, and

hence formed a fine broad promenade with that curious decoration of

monoliths along it.

Externally the walls are very fine, and the courses, from their extreme

evenness, give the building a neat and compact appearance. The pattern

which only decorates the part outside the long passage and the sacred

enclosure is in two rows let into the wall and formed by stones placed in

a chevron pattern, and must have required considerable skill to execute

as the building was proceeding. The circle of the walls is by no means

true, and the nature of the building is different ; as I have already men-

tioned, the portion from the main entrance and I'ound the sacred en-

closure is higher, thicker, and more carefully built; the rest was either

constructed at a later period or in a more careless manner ; it is impos-
sible now to walk on this portion of it, and it is rapidly falling into I'uins.
The middle entrance was evidently only a hole in the walls, or sally port,

probably of later construction, with wooden beams supporting the super-

incumbent structure, and which have entirely given way.

Our excavations in this circular building were not attended with

success. It bore traces of Kaffir habitation up to within a recent date,

and they had evidently cleared out all traces of an earlier occupation ; in
some kitchen middens outside we came across traces of minor importance.

The principal part of our work and our most interesting discoveries

took place on the hill fortress, to which we will now proceed, and the

labyrinthine nature of which can be best realised by a plan made by

Mr. R. W. Swan, and published for me by the Royal Geographical Society.

The hopje itself is of great natural strength, being protected on one side

by gigantic granite boulders, and on the south by a precipice from 70

to 90 feet in height, and on the only accessible side the inhabitants

constructed a wall of massive thickness like those of the ruins below :
                              ;

it is 13 feet thick on the summit, with a batter of one foot in six ; it is
30 feet high in parts, and the flat causeway on the top was decorated on

--the outside edge bj a succession of small ronnd towers seven in all we

--made out about 3 feet in diameter, alternating with tall monoliths
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

a most peculiar and unique form of decoration.
     To open out the approach to this fortress town was a work of con-

siderable time and labour. It is exceedingly intricate, protected at every
turn with traverses and ambuscades, and then commences at the bottom
of the precipice a flight of steps, leading up. The ai'chitects have availed
themselves of a narrow slit in the granite boulder, up which the steps
led, the passage being exceedingly narrow ; then the path divided into
two, one path turning abruptly to the right, and at the turning a pretty
little bit of wall with the stones placed pointways for about a yard
relieved the monotony ; then it led along a narrow ledge over the preci-

pice, and in spite of the impossibility of attack at such a point it is never-
theless protected by traverses even here ; in fact, the redundancy of
fortification all over this naountain, the useless repetition of walls over a
precipice itself inaccessible, the cat-e with which every hole in the boulders
through which an arrow could pass is closed, prove that the occupants
were in constant dread of attack, and lived like a garrison in the heart
of an enemy's country.

     At the summit of the mountain are huge boulders about 50 feet high
immediately below the highest is a curious little plateau which had
been decorated by the ancient occupiers : it is approached by narrow
passages and steps on either side and a curious passage through the wall
below covered with huge beams of granite to support the superincumbent
weight. The steps on one side were made of the same strong cement,
and the wall to the left was decorated with the same design of stones
placed edgeways for six rows that we had at the angle of the approach.
The little plateau itself was adorned with huge monoliths and decorated
beams of soapstone, the patterns on which were chiefly of a geometric
character, and one of which was 13 feet in height. Here, too, we un-
earthed many crushing stones of diorite and a curious stone with lines
carried round it with great regularity ; we found another similar one

in the temple itself.

    The large semicircular space below this was a dense jungle when we

started to work, consisting of nettles of extraordinary pricking powers
and other obnoxious plants which our natives cleared away ; but here,
again, were evident signs of fairly recent Kaffir habitation, beneath which

further relics may be found, but our time and resources would not per-

mit us to conclude this work. However, Mr. Cecil Rhodes has kindly
consented to have the work carried on, so there is every hope of further
material coming to hand. The view from this spot is magnificent over
the Livouri and Bessa Mountains, and situated as it is far above the
level of the marshy ground it would be healthy and habitable during

all seasons of the year.

    Time will not now permit me to enter into details concerning all

the intricacies of this fortress ; its narrow gullies protected for no con-
ceivable reason with walls and traverses ; its huge granite boalders with
every slit through which an ariow could pass carefully walled up ; but
a glance at the plan will show its chief points better than any descrip-
tion by words can give.

    The corner of the fortress which yielded our principal finds is now

used as a cattle kraal by the petty chief on the hill. This building was

anciently the temple of the fortress, and was luckily not so much dis-

turbed as the one below. The aspect was the same, namely, south-east,

and the outer decoration, the pointed or edgeways pattern, ran around

the same portion of the building as on the round one below. Tliis

temple among the granite boulders was supported by a very elaborately

constructed system of under- walls filled up with large stones, on which

the cement floor rested, as was the case in the raised platform below. The

temple was approached by a narrow passage and a staircase of consider-

able architectural merit,  which we laid  bare                             the  steps are formed by a
                                                                        ;

continuation of the rounded courses of the outer walls, and have the

effect of two miniature amphitheatres opposite to each other which acted

as steps from the passage below to the level of the temple itself.

The outer wall of this temple was decorated with birds carved on the

summit of soapstone beams five or six feet in height. Of the six we have

all are different, and all archaic in  design only                            one is  perfect, and from
                                                                           ;

its beak we can easily see that it is intended to repi'esent a vulture. Two

have decorations down the back and round the neck, and one has four

circles cut on it, two on the wings and two below, presumably to repre-

sent incubation and fertility. Egyptian archa?ology teaches us something

of the attributes anciently supposed to pertain to the vulture. Amongst

other things Horapollo tells us (i., ii.) that it was emblematic ' of Urania,

a year, or mother.' ^lian goes so far as to suppose that all vultures

were females, to account for their character as emblems of maternity. This

is a curious confirmation of the statement of Herodotus, that the Arabians

Weonly worshipped Dio7iysus and Urania.   have seen how the attributes

of Dionysus were worshipped in the tower below here we have Urania
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

as the presiding deity. In the soil of the temple we found numerous

soapstone objects corresponding to the Lingams of India, and a tiny bird

on a pedestal, the miniature representative of the larger emblems.

    An altar stood in the centre of the temple on the cement floor, which

unfortunately fell to pieces after the earth which supported it had been

a short time removed. Supporting walls gradually led up in steps to the

boulders, and of two gullies between these boulders at the back of the

temple one led to another enclosure with two huge monoliths in the

centre, and a terrace above overlooking the temple, and the other led

through into the native kraal on the other side of the wall of rock.

Adjoining the temple, and approached by a flight of steps, was a space

shut in by boulders, and walled in with great care at tiae extremities.

Two caves ran beneath the boulders, and in these we found most of our

treasures.

Of these the most attractive are the numerous fragments of soapstone

bowls, perhaps used in temple service and when broken cast out hither.
One represents a hunting scene, in which a man, rather of a Hottentot

type, with an arrow, is in pursuit of a herd of zebras ; behind him he
drags a dog with a leash, which has turned round to growl at two hippo-

potami. There is a bird, too, rather rudely executed, but this is the

character of all the bowls with figures on them. The workmanship of the

bowls themselves is excellent, and made with the chisel geometric patterns
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

also are executed with great cai'e, but the figures are rather grotesque.

Another bowl gives us a portion of a procession ; another is decorated
with a row of bulls. Different animals and different patterns were found

on all the fragments, no two fragments of the same bowl ever occur-

ring. Several of the best finished bowls were perfectly plain, notably one
ON THE RUINS OF MASHONALAND.  543

very lai'ge one, whicli is almost intact, and has a very finely chiselled sur-
face and well-rounded edges. There is one fragment on which I take it

some letters are rudely sci-atched, resembling somewhat the Ogham

characters or strokes on either side of a line to give them value. I have
not yet found anyone who can suggest any solution of this problem, and
I should have felt inclined to consider it hopeless had not Mr. Anderson

shown me a sketch of a stone fi'om Bechuanaland, taken thirty years ago,

whicli has characters on it closely corresponding to these.

    Many fragments of pottery of excellent glaze and workmanship were

also found the patterns on these are mostly geometric, but executed with
                                                                   ;

absolute correctness with a stamp, and there appear to be wheel-marks at

the back. Of the numerous implements of war we found many are

doubtless Kaffir and of a later date. One, however, is' an assegai with a
heavy plating of gold on it, which must belong to an earlier period, and

the spear-head of copper, heavily barbed, corresponds to weapons now
found amongst natives not at a great distance from this spot. The iron
bells, too, which we found in the ruins occur now on the Congo, hundreds
of miles away ; but the uniformity of design all over Africa and the con-
servative nature of these designs make it difficult to attach any date to
them. Everywhere in the ruins we turned up circular whorls of pottery,
some decorated and some plain, which at first we took to belong to

spindles for cotton, but some are too small and could never have been
used for that purpose. The circular soapstone object with knobs thereon,
which was brought, together with the bird shown to the Section,
by a Dutchman from Zimbabwe two years ago, Mr. Trimen, of the
 Cape Museum, has kindly lent for exhibition in England. The first

 impression it gives is that of a quern, but soft stone like this can never
 have been used for the purposes of grinding, and all objects of soapstone
 found in the ruins would appear to be for decorative purposes only.

     In one corner of this same part of the fortress, near the surface, we

 found several fragments of Persian and Celadon china, doubtless used as

 barter goods by the Arab traders who came up from the coast ; but no-
 where during all our excavations could we come across any signs of coins

 or traces of a cemetery for the burial of the dead.
      Perhaps the most interesting of our finds in this portion of the ruins

 were those in connection with the manufacture of gold. Close under-

 neath the temple stood a gold-smelting furnace, made of very hard
 cement, with a chimney of the same material, and very neatly bevelled
 edges, portions of which are now on their way home. Hard by, in a
 chasm between two boulders, lay all the rejected quartz casings from
 which the gold-bearing quartz had been extracted by exposing them to
 heat prior to the crushing, proving beyond a doubt that these ruins,
 though themselves far removed from any gold reef, were the capital of a
 gold-prnducing people, who had chosen this hill fortress with its granite
 boulders owing to its peculiar advantages for strategic purposes.

     Near the furnace, too, we found many little crucibles of a composition

 of clay, which had been used for smelting the gold, and in nearly all of
 them exist small specks of gold adhering to the glaze formed by the heat
 of the process. There are tools also amongst our finds for extracting
 gold, burnishers, crushers, &c., and an ingot mould of soapstone of a

 curious form, which is still in use amongst the natives much fui'ther

 north for ingots of iron.

      An interesting parallel to the ancient gold workings in Mashonaland

 is to be found by studying the accounts of the ancient gold workings of
--544 REPORT 1892.

 the Egyptian gold mines in "Wadi AUaga. The ancient Egyptians also
 extracted gold from quartz by means of crushing and washing, as we see
from the process depicted in the paintings on the Egyptian tombs, and
 in any gold-producing quarter of Mashonaland, near old shafts and by

 the side of streams, innumerable crushing-stones are stiU to be seen,
 used anciently for a like purpose.

      Diodorus tells us of the gangs of slaves employed in this arduous
labour, and of the long dark shafts into which they descended. In the
Mazoe district we entered several of these ancient shafts, and it is obvious
 here that not only for working the mines but for the construction of the
 massive buildings similar gangs of slaves were employed.

      After describing the process of crushing and washing Diodorus con-
cludes : ' They then put it into earthen crucibles, well closed with clay,
and leave it in a furnace for five successive days and nights, after which
it is suffered to cool. The crucibles are then opened and nothing is found

in them but the pure gold, a little diminished in quantity.' Here we

have an exact parallel to our clay crucibles at Zimbabwe. Also the
heavy plating of metal with gold which was practised in Egypt was also

known to the people of Zimbabwe, as the gilding on our spear-head

demonstrates.

     As Mr. and Mrs. Bent propose to follow up their investigations in

Mashonaland by visiting Abyssinia during the ensuing winter, with a
view to clearing up certain jDoints connected with their recent expedition,
regarding which more information is required, the Committee ask to be

reappointed, and that a sum of 501. be placed at their disposal for carry-

ing on these researches.

     up by the Secretary.)

The work of registering the localities of the prehistoric and ancient
remains of Glamorgan has proceeded, but owing to the inability of
several members of the appointed Committee to act, and delays in conse-
quence, few meetings have been held. All those objects or remains, how-
ever, which are known have been named on the register, and particulars
concerning them will be filled in later.

     Important help to the Committee's work has been rendered by two
local scientific societies, viz., by the Cardiff Naturalists' Society, under
whose auspices a valuable paper was recently read on the ' Ancient In-
scribed Stones of Glamorganshire,' by Mr. T. H. Thomas, and also one
by Mr. E. Seward on the formation of this record.

     The Cardifi' Amateur Photographic Society, by means 6f prizes offered
to their members, have produced some hundreds of valuable original
photographs of prehistoric and ancient objects in the county, most of

such objects within the county having thereby been illustrated. This
collection, which is believed to be the most extensive yet formed in any
district, is stored at the Cardiff Free Library. The Corporation have
given good aid to the work by important grants to the Prize Fund.

MemarJcs on Linguistic Ethnology : Introductory to the Report of Dr.
      A. F. Chamberlain on the Kootenay Indians of South-Eastern British

     Golumhia. By Mr. Horatio Hale.

The report of Dr. Chamberlain derives a special interest from the fact
that it is a monograph devoted to the people of a single linguistic stock,

or in other words to a people differing totally in speech from all other

branches of the human race. In my ' Remarks on ITorth American

Ethnology,' prefixed to the Fifth Report of the Committee (1889)

--Tvhich I venture in this connection to recall to mind the fact was

pointed out that ' in America the linguistic stock is the universally ac-

cepted unit of classification.' After explaining how, in my opinion, such

stocks had originated, namely, ' in the natural language-making faculty

of young children,' who in the earliest settlement of a new country had
been left, orphaned and isolated from all other society, to frame a new
language, and ultimately a new social system and a new religion of their
own,^ I added : ' From what has been said, it follows that in our studies
of communities in the earliest stage we must look, not for sameness, but

for almost endless diversity, alike in languages and in social organisa-

tions. Instead of one " primitive human horde," we must think of some

two or three hundred primitive societies, each beginning in a single
household, and expanding gradually to a people distinct from every

other, alike in speech, in character, in mythology, in form of government,
and in social usages.'

 . Since these remarks were written three publications relating to
American ethnology, each of peculiar value and authority, have ap-

peared. The earliest and in many respects the most important of these

is the volume on ' The American Race,' by Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, Pro-
fessor of American Archaeology and Linguistics in the University of
Pennsylvania. The general scope of the work is shown by its second
title: 'A Linguistic Classification and Ethnographic Description of the
Native Tribes of North and South America.' The author has con-
densed within the limit of 400 pages an immense mass of informa-
tion concerning the numbers and locations, the physical, mental, and
moral traits, and the languages, religions, and social systems of the
tribes of the western continent. It is the first and the only compre-
hensive work embracing all the septs of the new world, and will doubt-
less long remain the standard and indispensable authority. Of 'inde-
pendent stocks or families,' we are told, ' there are about eighty in North,
and as many in South America. These stocks,' the author adds, * offer
us without doubt our best basis for the ethnic classification of the

--American tribes the only basis, indeed, which is of any value. The

efforts which have been heretofore made to erect a geographic classifica-

tion, with reference to certain areas, political or physical ; or a cranio-

logical one, with reference to skull forma ; or a cultural one, with

reference to stages of savagery and civilisation, have all proved worth-

less. I select, therefore,' he concludes, ' the linguistic classification of

the American race as the only one of any scientific value, and, therefore,

that which alone merits consideration.'

     The ' introductory chapter ' of Dr. Brinton's work contains many
valuable data and interesting suggestions. But I am disposed to think

that his view of the general resemblance pervading the American tribes

in their social institutions is rather a reflex of earlier opinions than a

deduction from the facts collected with judicial and impartial accuracy

in the subsequent chapters. Thus, while holding that Mr. Morgan's

assertions on this subject were too sweeping, he yet remarks (p. 45)

that ' Morgan was the first to point out clearly that ancient American

society was founded, not upon the family, but upon the gens, totem, or

clan, as the social unit.' In the next page, however, further considera-

tion leads him to observe that this ' gentile system ' is by no means
universal, and that ' it is an error of theorists to make it appear so.

Subsequently (on p. 99), in treating of the Dakotas, he states that

some of the tribes of this stock had no geute.9, while others possessed

them with, widely differing systems of descent ; and he then adds his

final decision on this point in terms which completely dispose of the

elaborate theories of Morgan and his disciples. He holds that, accord-

ing to the evidence we possess, ' the gentile system is by no means a

--fixed stadium of even American ancient society, but is variable present

or absent as circumstances may dictate.'

Another recent publication of great importance is the paper of Major

J. W. Powell, the distinguished Director of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology,

on ' The Linguistic Families of America north of Mexico,' which appears

in the ' Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau,' nominally for 1885-86, but

published in 1891, and actually coming down to that date in its informa-

tion. The terms ' linguistic families ' and ' stocks ' are used by the author

as synonymous. He finds the total number of such stocks on the conti*

nent north of Mexico to be fifty-eight ; and while he thinks it if) not im-

probable that this number may on further study be reduced by the fusion

of some of these stocks, it is equally likely, in his opinion, that the num-

ber in the list will be made good by the discovery of new stocks in

Aportions of the region which have not yet been fully explored.  cata-

logue as complete as can now be obtained is given, not only of thefamilies^

but of their tribes and dialectical subdivisions, with their leading names

and the various synonyms by which they have been known. Major Powell

does not think it necessary to give a reason for adopting the linguistia

classification. He evidently regards the question as settled since the

appearance of Gallatin's great work, the well-known ' Synopsis of Indian

Tribes ' (1836), by the general acquiescence of ethnologists. His pre-

liminary remarks are chiefly, but not entirely, devoted to linguistic

--Bubjects, and present many facts and conclusions the result of twenty
--years' study which students of ethnology will find of special value and

interest. It should, of course, be kept in view that in reminding his

readers that, ' after all, the Indian is a savage, with the characteristics of a

savage,' he must be regarded as referring in strictness only to the tribes-
              ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                                                 547

north of Mexico, and that Be is too experienced an ethnologist to hold

that all savages are alike in their characteristics.' His paper, it should

be added, is illustrated by a 'linguistic map,' which in clearness and ful-

ness is a model of what such a map should be.

    The third recent work of special importance in connection with this

study is the monograph of Mr. A. S. Gatschet, the eminent linguist of

the Bureau of Ethnology, on ' The Klamath Indians of South-western

Oregon,' which fills two quarto volumes of over 700 pages each in the

series of ' Contributions to North American Ethnology.' The work bears

date in 1890, but was not distributed until the following year. It is

doubtless the most complete and scientifically exact account of the

character, language, and mythology of a people coniposing a single ' stock '

that has ever been published. Of their social organisation less is told.

The author had made large collections on this subject, but lack of space

has compelled him to defer their publication. He has, however, told

enough to enable us to compare the main features in the social life of

these Indians, who are surely ' primitive ' and ' typical ' savages, if there

are any such, with the systems devised by McLennan, Bachofen, Morgan,

and other ingenious theorisers. Mr. Gatschet, as becomes an investigator,

is  strictly  impartial, and  has  no  special  system  to  maintain                                            but by  a
                                                                                                             ;

simple statement of facts he is able in four lines to upset as many theories.

' The Klamath Indians,' he tells us, ' are absolutely ignorant of the gentile

or clan system as prevalent among the Haida, Tlingit, and Eastern

Indians of North America. Matriarchate is also unknown among them.

Everyone is free to many within or without the tribe, and the children

inherit from the father.'

    To those who possess Mr. Gatschet's volumes the comparison between

their contents and those of Dr. Chamberlain's equally authentic and

careful observations will be highly interesting. But probably to most

students the comparison of this report on the Kootenays with the no less

careful and accurate descriptions of the coast tribes of British Columbia

belonging to the Tlingit, Tsimpshian, and Kwakiutl-Nootka stocks, as

furnished to our committee by Dr Franz Boas in his successive reports,

will be still more instructive. The notable difference of character which

    · I may be allowed to quote here a note from my ' Ethnography and Philology ' of

the U.S. Exploring Expedition (p. 13), which has been thought worthy of citation by

--various writers on anthropological subjects: 'Nothing is more common in the

writings of many voyagers than such phrases as the following : " These natives, like

all savages, are cruel and treacherous " ; " The levity and fickleness of the savage-

character " ; " The tendency to superstition which is found among all uncivilised

tribes"; "The parental affections which warm the most savage heart," &c. These

expressions are evidently founded on a loose idea that a certain sameness of charac-

ter prevails among barbarous races, and especially that some passions and feelings

Aare found strongly developed in all.  little consideration will show that this view

must be erroneous. It is civilisation that produces uniformity. The yellow and

black races of the Pacific, inhabiting nearly contiguous islands, differ more widely

from each other than do any two nations of Europe. The points of resemblance

between the negroes of Africa and the Indians of America, even under the same lati-

tudes, are very few. In delineating the character of the different races of the

Pacific an attempt will be made, by contrasting them with one another, to show

more closely the distinguishing characteristics of each.' And further on (p. 198), in

--the description of the tribes of Oregon, a remark to the same effect is made : ' To

one ascending the Columbia the contrast presented by the natives above and below

the Great Falls (the Chinooks and Wallawallas) is very striking. No two nations of

Europe differ more widely in looks and character than do these neighbouring sub-

divisions of the American race.'

                                                                                                                NN2

is pointed out in my remarks introductory to the Sixth Report (1890),

on the authority of missionary records and official documents, is fully con-
firmed by Dr. Chamberlain's observations. The contrast between the
very complex social system of the coast tribes and the simple organisation
of the Kootenays is particularly striking. The whole social life and frame
of government of the coast stocks are wrapped up in their totem or clan

systems and their secret societies. Among the Kootenays, according to

Dr. Chamberlain, ' totems and secret societies do not exist, and probably

have not existed.'
     It is satisfactory to be able to add that both Dr. Brinton and Major

Powell, in their recent publications, have referred to the reports presented

to the Association by our committee as records of the best authority. I

may venture to affirm that they will retain this authority vrith a consfeintly

increasing reputation, not merely from my knowledge of the talents and

experience of the authors of these reports, but from the fact that they

--have based their researches and classifications on the only scientific

foundation, that of language or, more strictly speaking, of comparative

--philology a basis which in modern anthropology is too often dis-

regarded.

     Two points of minor importance, but still of much interest, in

 Dr. Chamberlain's report seem to merit notice. His statement that, ' as
compared with white men, the Indians, with rare exceptions, must be

considered inferior physically,' may be misunderstood. As regards those
Indians to whom it was intended to apply, namely, the Kootenays and

their neighbours, it is undoubtedly correct ; but the author had certainly

 no purpose of including in his statement all the aborigines of America.

He is well aware that these, like the communities of the eastern continent,

 vary physically as well as intellectually, not only from stock to stock, but

--from branch to branch. Of the Iroquois Dr. Brinton, in his ' American

 Hace' (p. 82), states: 'Physically the stock is most superior, unsur-

 passed by any other on the continent, and, I may even say, by any other

 people in the world ; for it stands on record that the five companies (500

men) recruited from the Iroquois of New York and Canada during our

 civil war stood first on the list among all the recruits of our army for
 height, vigour, and corporeal symmetry.' The other recruits, it should

 be remembered, comprised great numbers of emigrants from almost all

 the nations of Europe.
      In the First and Third Reports of the Committee (1885 and 1887)

 are given the reasons for believing that the Kootenays formerly lived east

 of the Rocky Mountains, and were driven thence by the Blackfoot tribes

 in comparatively recent times. Dr. Chamberlain's account of the
 Kootenay traditions confirms this opinion, and adds a curious and signi-

 ficant circumstance. ' The Kootenays,' he states, ' believe that they came
 from the east, and their myths ascribe to them an origin from a hole in

 the ground east of the Rocky Mountains.' My early studies of the myths

 of the Pacific islanders disclosed the true origin and meaning of the

 legendary stories which have been common among many peoples in

 ancient and modern times, from the early Athenians to the Marquesans
 and Iroquois, who have ascribed to their ancestors an autochthonous
 origin, briuging them literally from underground. These legends origi-
 nate in the double, or we might rather perhaps say the threefold, meaning

 given in most languages to each of the words ' above ' and ' below.' This

 point is fully explained in an article contributed to the ' Journal of
ON THE NOKTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.  549

American Folk-lore ' for July-September 1890.' It will be sufiBcient to
say bere tbat tbe words in question, wben used by any islanders (and
sometimes by coast tribes) in a myth ascribing a celestial or an under-
ground origin to their ancestors, are found to have meant originally

' from tbe windward ' and ' from the leeward.' When used by inland

tribes they have usually signified, in the first instance, ' down-stream ' and

'up-stream.' Thus the Iroquois have two traditions of their origin,

--the one purely historical and the other merely mythical the latter

derived from the former by a perversion of the sense of these terms. The
former describes their ancestors as ascending the St. Lawrence River in
canoes from the neighbourhood of Quebec to the southern coast of Lake
Ontario, at or near Oswego. The mythical legend makes them literally
' come from below ' by finding their way through an opening which led
upward from a subterranean abode beneath a mountain near Oswego.
So the curiously combined tradition and myth of the Kootenays inform
us that, in their opinion, their ancestors formerly dwelt in some locality
east of the Rocky Mountains, and had arrived at that locality by an
earlier ascent, doubtless up the Saskatchewan River. That they had

been steadily forced westward by their persistent enemies and supplanters,
the warlike Algonkians of the powerful Blackfoot confederacy, seems

clear from the concurring traditions of both parties.

     The present report contains a summary of the results of the investi-

gations of the writer on behalf of the British Association for the Advance-

ment of Science during the summer of 1891 in South-eastern British
Columbia. The Indians visited were the various tribes of the Ki'tSna'Qa,

or Kootenays, about whom comparatively little was previously known.

They were studied in regard to physical characteristics, sociology, folk-
lore, and language.

     The investigations were conducted under all the difficulties incidental
to scientific research in a new country, and the writer takes this oppor-
tunity of thanking Mr. Michael Phihpps, the Indian agent, and his good
friends in the Kootenay district who did all in their power to make his
sojourn pleasant and to advance the objects of his visit. Particularly
does he desire to express to the Hon. R. L. T. Galbraith, ex-M.P.P., of
Fort Steele, his gratitude for the many courtesies shown him, and for
the hearty manner in which he endorsed and encouraged the writer in
his movements amongst the Indians ; to Father Coccolo and the Sisters
of the Mission of St. Eugene he returns thanks for their hospitality and
the willingness with which they used their influence with the Indians on
behalf of science. To Mr. David McLaughlin, of Idaho, his thanks are
also due for turning to good use, in favour of the writer, the great
influence which he possesses over the Lower Kootenay Indians, and for

useful information concerning these aborigines.^

550 REPORT-- 1892.

     As material is lacking for comparisons in certain directions, whicli

naturally suggest themselves, viz., with the Shoshonian tribes of the
region to the south, as regards language, and with these, and with cer-
tain Salishan peoples, with respect to physical characteristics, these ques-

tions must be deferred for consideration at another time. It may be

stated, however, that from the examination of his material (only partially
arranged) there appears to be no reason to displace the Kootenay from
its position as a distinct family of speech.

                                                                                                              I. BTHT^O GRAPHICAL.

     The Ki'tdna'Qa, or Kootenay s, inhabit the country included between
the Rockies and the Selkirks, stretching from the forty-ninth to the fifty-

second parallel of north latitude, and watered by the Upper Kootenay

and Upper Columbia Rivers and their tributaries. They preserve, how-

ever, a distinct recollection of having formerly lived east of the Rocky

--Mountains. The ethnic and tribal names are as follows :

    An Indian is called dqkts'md'lcinik,^ and a Kootenay Indian, tsEn

dqkts'md'kimk, i.e., ' the Indian.' The names possibly have reference to

the origin of the Kootenays, according to their legend, from a hole in the

ground, as the latter part of the word, 'md'kinik, may be explained as con-

sisting of dmdk (ground), a-?'-, connective vowel, and the suffix -nik,

signifying ' people originating from, dwelling at, &c.' The Kootenay also

call themselves Ki'tond'aa, the etymology of which is unknown. One
Indian connected it with ho'tond'qEne, '1 am lean.' They are generally

divided into two groups, viz.. Upper Kootenays and Lower Kootenays,

the subdivisions of these being as follows :

I. Ki'tdna'Qa, or Upper Kootenay : (a) Aqki'sk'Enu'kinik (i.e., ' peo-

ple of the two lakes '), the tribe of the Columbia lakes, with chief settle-

ment at Windermere, on the Lower Lake (b) Aqk'a'mnik (i.e., ' the

people of A'qk'am,' as the region of Ft. Steele is called), the tribe of Ft.

Steele and the Mission of St. Eugene, of whom a large number camp at

a place called Bummer's Flat, Takikats ; (c) Ta'k'et aqkinu'qtle'et

aqkts'ma'kinik, or Indians of the Tobacco Plains (Ya'k'et aqkinu'qtle'et)

these are better and more properly termed Aqk'aneqii'nik (i.e., 'Indians

on a creek or i-iver ')                                                                                       (d) Aqklye'nik  (' people of the leggings ' ?), Indians

in the United States. The reports of the Canadian Indian Department

from 1880 to 1886 give the number as about 400. Mr. A. S. Farwell, in

--a special report to the Legislature of British Columbia ^ in 1883, makes

the following statement : ' The Kootenay tribe of Indians number about

800 men, women, and children, and are divided approximately as follows :
450 British Indians domiciled north of the international boundary line,

and 200 American Indians residing in Idaho and Montana Territories

annuities paid by the United States Government, at its agency on the
Jocko River, in the Flathead Reservation, Montana Territory, and claim-
ing to be British Indians when they wander north of the boundary line.'
About 300 of the British ladians inhabit the valley of the Upper

Kootenay and Columbia, the remaining 150 belonging to the Lower
Kootenay. The Lower Kootenays, according to Mr. Farwell, whose in-
formation was derived from Mr. D. McLaughlin, ' number 157, divided

as follows : 35 men, 34 married women, 39 boys, 32 girls, 4 widows, with

   boys and 3 girls between them, and 4 widows without encumbrances.'
      In 1887 Mr. Michael Philipps, the Indian Agent amongst the Cana-

dian Kootenays, estimated their number as follows :

The Kootenays call the surrounding tribes with whom they have

come into contact as follows :

      (a) Blackfeet. Santla or Saha'ntla (bad Indians). In the past the

Kootenays had many wars with the Blackfeet, but joined them often in
their buffalo hunts on the plains to the east. The Blackfoot country is
called Tla'watinak (i.e., 'over the mountains'). The Blackfeet often
·visit the Kootenays now, and are hospitably received. Such a visit

·occurred in the summer of 1891.
A(b) Cree. Gu'tskia'we (liars).
                                         few Crees occasionally visit the

Kootenays, chiefly in company with the Blackfeet. In the old days of

the Hudson's Bay Company these two peoples came more into contact.

(c) Stonies. These Indians have a very bad reputation with the

Kootenays, and are named Tlu'tlama'Eka (cut-throats). Also Gutlu'puk.

      (d) Sioux. Ka'tsk-agi'tlsak (charcoal legs).

     (e) Shushwap. Tlitka'tuwu'mtla'Et (no shirts). This name was

given because, when the Kootenays met. the Shushwaps first, the latter

bad no buckskin shirts (aqka'tuwu'mtla'Et).
     (/) Okanagan. O'kina'k-gn. Some of these occasionally visit the

Kootenays. About ten years ago several came to A'qk'am. They are

also known in Kootenay as KohEwuIk'he.

     ' This information I owe to the courtesy of Mr. Vankoughnet, the Deputy Super-

intendent of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.
552 KEPORT-- 1892.

      (g) Kalispelm. Ka'noqtla'tlam (compress the side of the head).

Some years ago the Kootenays and Kalispelms were very unfriendly

towards each other.

     (/i) Colville Indians. Kqoptle'nik (those who dwell at KQoptle'ki).
Some intermarriages with these have taken place.

    A(i) Yakima. Yaa'kima. Kootenay explained this as meaning 'foot

     The Kootenay name for ' white man ' is silyd'pT, in all probability a

borrowed word (in ' Parker's Journal,' 1840, p. 381, the Nez Perce word
for ' American ' is given as sueapo). Another and an old word for white

man is uutlil'qEve, i.e., 'stranger.' The Indians employ also (but rarely)

the term Tidmnu' qllo aqTcts^ind'hinik ('white man'). For 'negro' the
word is JidmJc'dk-d'kdfl (lit. ' black ').

    A Chinaman is called Goo'ktlum. The Kootenays are much given to

lording it over the Chinese, and not a few practically live on what they
make out of them.

                               Senses and Mental Chakacter.

     As compared with white men, the Indians, with rare exceptions, must
he considered inferior physically. The European, when inured to the
climate, is capable of as great physical exertion and able to endure as many

and as lasting hardships as the Indian. In running, jumping, wrestling,

and other tests of strength, a good white man is more than the equal of a

good Indian. There are, of course, exceptions, but the European, given
equal chances at the start, can, as a rule, equal, if not always outdistance,

his aboriginal rival.

    Many of the Indians have large bands of horses, and some of them

are farmers. The chief of the Fort Steele Indians is comparatively well
off and has a good ranch. Some of the Lower Kootenays do a little
farming also, but are much more migratory and restless.

     As a rule, the moral character and behaviour of the Kootenays are very
good, and the writer, from his residence amongst them of nearly three
months, can confirm the good words that were spoken of them years ago by
Father De Smet. They are moral, honest, kind, and hospitable, and it is only
when imposed upon by bad Indians of other tribes, or by bad whites, that
any of the worse traits of Indian character appear. But it is exceedingly
difficult to judge of the nature of the Indian, and to determine wherein
he differs from the white man. The mental character of the Kootenays
is rather high, and the efforts that have been made to educate them are
not without fruit. Too much credit cannot be given to the Government
of the Province of British Columbia for the firm manner in which, aided
by public opinion, they have enforced the law prohibiting the giving or
selling of intoxicating liquors to the Indians. This is the first and most
necessary basis for any development or betterment of the aborigines.
Next comes the freedom from contact with lewd and dishonest white

 men, which the Kootenays have enjoyed to a much greater extent than
 have many of the neighbouring tribes.

      To educate a moral and sober people ought not to be too difficult a
 task, if the right methods are employed. The founding of the industrial

 school for Indian children at the Mission of St. Eugene, a few miles from
 Fort Steele, has already been productive of good results. The writer
 paid a visit to this school, and had the pleasure of inspecting the teaching,
 as well as of examining the building and the various appliances connected
 therewith. The English language is taught in this school, and the young
 Indians learn to read and to write in a remarkably short time under the

 guidance of the nuns who have charge of the school. There were about

 two dozen boys a.nd girls in the school at the time of the writer's visit
 they were neatly dressed, polite, and intelligent-looking, and the progress
they had made during the few short months they had been there was
 very encouraging. This school well deserves all the support given to it
 by the Government, and it is to be hoped that the project of extending
 its usefulness so as to reach the children of the Lower Kootenays will
 meet with a proper measure of success.

      The great difficulty in civilising the Indian has been to prevent the
 relapse into old tribal habits when the school is left behind. The career
 of the future graduates of the industrial school at St. Eugene will be
 watched with interest by all friends of the Indian, and Father Coccolo,
the head of the mission, and the Sisters in charge of the school may be
 relied upon to do their share towards making the end good.

     No opportunities ofiTered themselves for making psychological tests

upon the Indians, but quick perception and rapid judgment are charac-

 teristic of the better portion of these Indians, as their actions in hunting
 and travelling plainly show. The Indian A'mElii, although forgetting

very often to take away some of the articles from a camp when a new
start was made, had a remarkable memory for places. One day he left a
knife belonging to the writer about halfway up a mountain some 7,000 feet
high. The incident was forgotten by him for the time being ; but, on being
asked many hours afterwards where he had left the knife, he described
the place in great detail. On another occasion he left a knife in the
woods by the side of the trail, and after we had made a journey of 150

miles an,d back, and had been absent from the spot a whole month, he
was able, on our return, to pick up the knife with hardly a moment's

hesitation.

     The Kootenay Indians, especially the young men, ai-e gay and lively,
enjoying themselves as much as their white friends, fond of horse-racing
and bodily exercise. They are of a very inquisitive nature, and the
Indian A'mElu would run down to the river-bauk and stand staring for
almost an hour at the steamboat every time it passed the camp. The
rest of the Indians were just as curious. The Indian A'mElfi went (for
the first time in his life) on a trip up the river on the steamboat with the
writer, and the young fellow was so proud that he could hardly contain

himself. No doubt he is now whiling away the winter hours by relating

bis experiences to his friends.

     The writer had occasion to notice two excellent exhibitions of Indian
character; in one case of pride and triumph, in the other of anger and

disappointment.

    A young Indian had been convicted of a crime and sent to jail at New

Westminster, where he remained some months. Owing to the exertions
.554  .  BEPORT-- 1892.

of a clever lawyer, bis conviction was quashed on a technicality, and the
authorities were obliged to return him to Fort Steele, where he belonged.

The writer saw him the day after his arrival. He was dressed in all the

finery he could command, and took the greatest pleasure in parading

himself about and letting people see that he knew he had won a triumph

over the whites. He was in the very highest state of pleasurable excite-

ment, and continued in this frame of mind for a long time.

    The other case was that of an Indian of about sixty years of age whom

the writer was measuring. The Indian, however, after two or three

laeasurements had been taken, demanded a large sum of money, and, on

being refused, pushed the instrument away from him, and, angrily

muttering, went outside the store, where he had been standing, sat down

on the verandah in front, where he remained all the afternoon, glowering

and muttering, and doing his best to impede matters. He continued in

this morose mood for days, and even at the expiry of a month would not

have anything to do with the writer.

There is also another case in point. While the writer was at Barnard,

B.C., he visited Mr. David McLaughlin's often, and one morning, while

seated parleying with the Indians, a middle-aged Indian suddenly entered

the house, threw his hat on the floor in a most excited manner, and for

twenty minutes poured a perfect flood of abuse and threatening on the

head of the writer, accompanied by most expressive gestures. After he

had unburdened himself of his wrath, he picked up his hat and departed.

Several similar, though not quite so animated, exhibitions of anger came

under the writer's notice during his stay in the Lower Kootenay, most of

them being traceable to the Indian trouble at Bonner's Ferry, Idaho,

which had aroused the resentment of the Kootenays.

      While in the territory of Chief San Piel, of the Lower Kootenays, one

day the chief and some dozen Indians came into the writer's tent and,

seating themselves around him in a circle, demanded a large tribute for

Ahaving intruded into their territory.  refusal to comply with the

outrageous demand led to a very interesting display of Indian resentment

and anger, as made known by speech and gesture, the faces of some of the

savages being given at times an almost demoniacal expression, and their

gestures just stopping short of actual assault. Still, in spite of these

disturbing outbreaks, which sometimes occur, the white man who behaves

himself is perfectly safe amongst the Indians, and need fear no treachery.

      The Indians have a keen sense of the ridiculous, and go so far as to

laugh at the misfortunes which befall their fellows. If an Indian is

thrown from his horse, misses the animal he shoots at, trips up and falls

Adown, his mishap is always greeted with laughter by the bystanders.

few hours after the excited speech of the Indian at McLaughlin's, the

writer was engaged in measuring another of the same tribe, when the

Indian suddenly rose to his full height, drew his knife from his sheath,

and made a motion to strike the measurer, which somewhat disconcerted

the latter, who, however, was almost immediately reassured by the loud

laughter of the Indians who were present. The Indians take great

delight in tricks such as this.

   A favourite amusement of the Lower Kootenay Indians on Sundays is

furnished by horse-running. All the horses are assembled in a large open

space near the camp, and the Indians form a large circle round them,

and, provided with long whips, they drive the horses to and fro for an

liour or so, laughing and yelling to their hearts* content. Even the little
                                                                     --

 boys take part in this sport. They also take great delight in breaking

 stubborn horses, and the whole camp looks on until the young man has

 succeeded in controlling his animal, guying him tinmercifuUy if he makes

 mistakes.

      The Kootenay Indians have marked artistic ability, although picture-
 writing upon rocks, &c., appears not to be found in their territory, or, if

 found, is not attributed to them. Their skill in ornamentation appears

in their various objects of dress and the implements of the chase. The
writer took the care to have a series of drawings made by Indians (young
and old) who had in no way received from the whites instruction in the
draughtsman's art. Very good maps of the country in which they lived
were made by these Indians, who seemed quite to have grasped the idea
·contained in such a delineation. Some of them were also able to recognise

with ease the various physical features prominent in the printed maps of
the Kootenay district. Their drawings of weapons, implements, &c.,
were excellent, and those of the Indian A'mElu, in particular, would never

be suspected of being the product of aboriginal genius. Pictures of
houses, railway trains, &c., have a certain conventionality that is charac-

teristic of savage races. Several of the Indians were able to draw an
excellent and easily recognisable picture of the little steamboat that plied
up and down the Columbia River. In their drawings of human beings
especial stress is laid upon the distinguishing features, and any peculiarity

or abnormality is brought out with full force. Thus a Stony Indian

woman has no nose, a Chinaman has an immense single braid of hair, a
white man an enormous beard, a certain Indian a colossal nose, and

the like.

     The colour perceptions of these Indians would appear from these
names to be fairly well developed. The explanations of these colour-names,
which are no doubt compounds, have not yet been possible. The prefixes
kdm- and yd- are worthy of note, and the words for ' white ' and ' black *
may possibly be related to those for ' snow ' and ' fire ' respectively.

    The following colour-names for horses may be given :

                                Social Organisation.

The social system of the Kootenays seems a simple one. As far as-

could be learnt totems and secret societies, so characteristic of some other

British Columbian peoples, do not exist, and probably have not existed,,

amongst them.

     The head of each tribal or local community was the chief (ndsu'kwen,

'the good one '), whose office originally was hereditary. Women were

not allowed to become chiefs, and it is probable that the age of thirty had

to be reached before the chiefship could be held. One method of selecting

the chief appears to have been this : All the men, women, and children
gathered together around a large fire. The medicine men then conferred

with the spirits, and in some mysterious way the chief was named. In
the time of the great buffalo hunts a ' buffalo chief ' was elected, who

had authority overall daring the expeditions. The selection of the chiefs

by direct election has been of late years introduced by the authorities of

the Roman Catholic Church, whose influence is now greater than that of
the old chiefs, and whose power is much more feared by the Indians than
theirs. When the chief wished to consult with his people he called them

in a loud voice to come to his large tepee. It is probable that from early

times a sort of advisory council existed. Each of the divisions

(Columbia Lakes, Fort Steele, Kootenay Lake, Tobacco Plains) has its

own chief ; in the case of the Kootenay Lake tribe there is a deputy-chief

also, and the Tobacco Plains Indians possess two chiefs.

Isidore, the Fort Steele chief, inherits his dignity from bis father

Joseph. The chief (by right) of the Lower Kootenays is said to have
refused the position, giving as a reason for his action that wars were now

all over, the buffaloes were dead, and there was now nothing left for a chief

to do.

Slavery {g-dlnaad'ka, 'a war-party,' tci'kuotE'mdtl, 'a slave') was

customary in the old days, and the Kootenays had amongst them many

Blackfeet women and children, who were captured in their wars with

Athat nation.  curious custom, which has existed from time immemorial

amongst the Kootenays, is the payment by the relatives of the debts of a
deceased person. Debts outstanding for ten years have been known to

be paid in this way.

    As far as ascertained, the Kootenay ^terms of relationship are as

follows :

                Marriage (hdnd'tldtli'tine, I am married).

The social position of woman amongst the Kootenays seems to have

teen about the same as that which she held in the surrounding tribes.

In the old days polygamy seems to have been in vogue, and wives were

purchased by presents of horses, &c. The marriage age for girls was

fifteen ; for young men, twenty. Intermarriage of first cousins appears

not to have been allowed. The preliminaries to marriage were as

--follows : The young Indian went at night to the lodge where slept the

object of his affections, and quietly lifting up the blanket, to make sure,

lay down beside her. The girl's people soon found him there, and threats

were made. The young man's father meanwhile inquired where his son

was, and, on being told that he was in such-and-such a lodge, went

thither with his friends and discovered the young people together. The

girl then left, and went with her husband to his own people. The latter

was at liberty to send back his wife to her relatives within a year if she

turned out to be bad or he was dissatisfied with her. When guilty of

adultery she was punished by having one of the braids of her hair cut

Aoff by her husband.         divorced woman was allowed to marry again, and

widows also. Descent seems to be traced through the mother.

                              Children (tlkd'mu, young child).

     The Indians are fond of their children, and rarely punish or beat
them. The children are usually very shy of white men, but amongst
themselves are merry and lively. Parturition is easy amongst these
Indians. Delivery was hastened by the efforts of several old women,

who seized upon the pregnant woman and shook her. The after-birth
was always hung on a tree. Mothers carry their children either in

shawls at their backs or in cradles. The Kootenay cradle (aqkink-o'indtl)
is made of deerskin drawn over a thick board, about 3 feet long, and
tapering from IJ foot at the widest to 6 inches at the lower end. Near
the top is a flap which can be fastened over the head of the child, which,
when in the cradle on the mother's back, is in an upright position. The
558  '                      KEPOET-- 1892.

cradle is often ornamented with beads, bits of far, silk, &c. In olden
times the cradle was a piece of board to which the child was fastened'

with buckskin thongs. The cradle is supported by straps around the
breast and a band around the forehead (see fig. 1.)

                            Adoption.

Adoption into the tribe by marriage, or by residence of more than a

year, was in practice. When the parents of small children died the

relatives came, each taking a child and bringing it up as his own. The
Aelder children seemingly had to take care of themselves.
                                                           very friendly

feeling between brothers and sisters existed, and the latter were well

taken care of on the decease of their parents.

                                   Property and Inheritance.

     Private property in land was unknown, the country belonging to the
tribe collectively. The Lower Kootenays still make, through their chief,

a demand for money of any stranger who intrudes upon their domain.
     The hunter had no absolute right in the product of his skill in the

chase ; it was distributed amongst the camp in order that all might have

food.

    Women could hold property as well as men. The horses were the

property of the grown-up male children, as well as of the father, and
could be gambled away by any one of them. The lodge seems to have
been secured to the widow and children on the death of the father ; the

women inherited also the kettles and other utensils, besides their saddles,
blankets, 'parfleshes,' &c. The horses, canoes, weapons, &c., went to the

male children, if of age. In early times it seems that the dead man's

relatives swooped down npon the lodge, soon after his death, and appro-
priated the property pretty much as they pleased. The exact nature of
this seizure could not be ascertained. If the dead man left no relatives a
' strong man ' of the tribe took possession of his property.

                                                         Crime.

     Stealing {na'iine, he steals) is little practised by the Kootenays ; and
though amongst them for months, when they had every chance to pilfer

from him, the writer never lost even a trifle. In the olden times it seema

not to have been punished, and probably existed but to a very slight

extent. Adultery was not severely punished. In case of murder the

relatives of the victim were bound to avenge his death on the slayer.

AMembers of the murderer's family were also liable to be killed.  wer-

gild was customary ; the compensation depended upon the rank and

importance of the victim. This compensation did not, however, entirely

relieve the slayer from danger of being killed by members of his victim's

family.

             Religion and Supebstition.

The sun-worship of the Kootenays, as described by Dr. Boas (' Report,'

1889, p. 848), which seems to indicate a belief in an over-ruling and

-- --beneficent spirit though this is not certain is confirmed. The belief

that the dead go to the sun was strong with the ' pagan ' Indians. They

also believed that the dead would come back from the sun at Lake Pend

d'Oreille, where the Indians will meet them some time in the future.
     The Kootenays believe in the existence of spirits in everything

animate and inanimate ; even little stones, bits of rag, shavings of wood,

have their nipi'k'a or tcdk'd'ps, as these spirits are called. These spirits

can go anywhere, through glass, wood, or any substance, as through air.

The touch of the nipi'k'a causes death and disease. At the death of
Indians their spirits may enter into fishes, bears, trees, &c. ; in fact, into
anything animate or inanimate. While a man is alive his nipi'k'a may

exist in the form of a tomtit, a jay, a bear, a flower, &c. The nipi'k'as of

the dead can return and visit their friends ; and while the writer was at

Barnard, B.C., one Indian declared that the night before the spirits of hiy

children had come to see him. The spirits appear very frequently in the

folk-tales.

In the olden times sacrifices appear to have been made to the nipi'k'as

of the mountains and of the forests to secure success in hunting, and to

appease them when angered. The language of the nipi'k'as differs

somewhat from the ordinary Kootenay, but the writer was unable to

Aascertain in what respects, or to obtain examples of it.  great or strong

man has many spirits (see also p. 562 of this report).

b Medicine-men, or SnAMArs.
        In the old days there were many medicine-men amongst the Kootenays,,
    and they were very powerful, as it was their business to commune with
    the spirits. In the camp they had special lodges, larger than the rest, in
    which they prayed and invoked the spirits, who often would make theii*
     appearance in the form of a bird or the like in response to their

      entreaties.

         There existed, until recently, a tree in the Lower Kootenay region, in
     Northern Idaho, from which, on two successive occasions, Indians had
    jumped off in obedience to the promise of the medicine-men that they

     should be able to fly like the birds if they did so. In the presence of the

    assembled camp, men, women, and children, several Indians were hardy
    enough to do this, which was, of course, certain death to them. The
    invocation of spirits by the shamans now survives amoi gst the Lower
     Kootenays only.

          These shamans were also the doctors of the tribe. They treated the
560 BEPOBT-- 1892.

sick by pressure npon various parts of the body, by pincliing, &c. They
also practised blowing upon the patient, and extracted the supposed cause
of the malady by suction with the mouth. Blood-letting at the wrist
was also in use. The shaman was called ni'pik'ak-d'k-\l, from his having
to do with the nipi'lvas.

                                       Death and Burial.

     The Kootenays usually buried their dead in shallow holes amidst the
rocks and boulders, and often left them exposed to the air. Sometimes
they buried them on low lands, subject annually to be covered by the
Tiver at high water. In the early days the Indian was buried with all his
finery, and the members of the tribe seemed to have followed in the
funeral procession. Before the Church authorities put a stop to it, the
Indians used to betake themselves to the hills and shriek terribly over the
dead. They appear to have taken good care of their dead, and never

disturbed the graves of their people. It is impossible to obtain osteo-
logical material on account of the strong prejudice the Indians have in.

this matter.

                                       PAINTI^fG AND TATTOOING.

     The Upper Kootenays do not now paint {gi'tEnu'stih) or tattoo (hatlku)

their faces or persons, except in very rare instances. In the past, however,
they practised the same very much. It is said lovers' wooings and

challenges to fight were made known by painting the face in a peculiar
manner, and the answer was conveyed by the same means. Some of

the Indians are tattooed on the arms with small black dots, often
accompanied by black lines. In one case, which the writer investigated,

it turned out that the tattooing was done by Lum Kin, a Chinese doctor,

to cure a sore arm. The Indians, however, admitted that in the past
they had similar practices.

     Numbers of the Indians have on their arms one or several circular
scars, evidently made by burning. These, the Indians said, were

produced by pressing a hot tobacco-pipe of stone to the flesh. No reason

for so doing was assigned.

     The Lower Kootenays are still much given to painting the face, ears,
neck, and exposed portions of the breast in gaudy colours. Many, whom

the writer saw, had their whole faces, necks, and ears daubed thickly over

with bright red paint. Some had the face painted red and the forehead

yellow ; others, again, had the colours laid on in bands of red and yellow,
giving them a weird appearance as they danced by the huge fire at night.

     Not the men alone, but the women also, were thus decorated, and with
the same variety. The children, as a rule, seem not to be so much
bepainted as their elders. Some of the Indians contented themselves
with a few daubs here and there. One metis, who assured the writer

that he was a ' Boston man,' and not an Indian, was seen the very next

day with as much paint on as the most Indian of them all.
     The red ochre used for paint is called nami'ta. Other terms for

' paint ' are : kdnd'su'mme, red paint ; kdmcl'ktsu'mrne, yellow paint. The
word gi'te,nu'stik, ' to paint,' is derived from nfis or nos, the radical of

kdnd'hos, ' red,' that being the colour.

Music and Song {lio'ndwasad'^meh, I sing).

The absence of musical instruments is very noticeable amongst the

Upper Kootenays, but they appear to have possessed several in the past.

Among these were a sort of reed pipe and a kind of flute (?) made of the

leg-bone of a large species of bird. The Lower Kootenays still possess
--Athe Kootenay drum, made as follows :
                                         rather large stick is bent into a

circle by the aid of fire, and over this is stretched, tambourine fashion, a
piece of deer-skin. The Aqk'aye'nik Kootenays are said to be the only

oneswho now make these drums (A't<«i)2y'/iLi<Z); they are beaten with a wooden

stick called kitCi' niohd'motl. In their gambling songs the Lower Kootenays

use wooden sticks, called dqse'et, with which they beat upon a log.
    In the old days the Kootenays had very many gambling, dancing, and

medicine songs. The Indians, under mission influence, have abandoned

most of these, their places having been taken by the religious exercises of
the Church. The children at the mission sing well, both in Indian and

in English. In the evening the older people sing mission songs in their

native tongue. Amongst the Lower Kootenays some of the old songs

still survive.

     While travelling on horseback some of the younger Indians sing re-

frains like this : To to to to! turn turn turn ! td td td td ! tai tai tai tai!
accompanying it with rhythmic motions of the hands or with slaps with

the hand upon the flanks of the horse. Another refrain, chanted with

an infinite variety of inflexion and intonation, is tt.he following :

               Hai yd ! hd he yau !

               E yd ! hd hd hai yau !

               He yd! ho yd ! &c.

     The Indian A'mElii was very fond of repeating in rhythmic fashion the
word tcma'tlue'tEm, which he declared to be nothing but ' cultus wawa '
(Chinook jargon for 'mere chatter' or 'idle utterance'), having no

signification.

    The Lower Kootenays are very much in love with gambling, which

vice, through the efforts of the missionaries, has been entirely suppressed

amongst the Upper Kootenays. In the gambling dance they chant
Hai yd ! hai yd ! hai yd he, repeated an infinite number of times, inter-

spersed with yells of ho ho ! hd hd ! he he hai hai ! hu hil ! &c. Another
gambling refrain \s,l%% ! yd e e e !

     The gambling consists in guessing in which hand one (on which a
ring of bark is left) of two sticks of wood is hidden. The players sit in
two rows facing each other, and a number of them keep beating on a log
in front of them with sticks, while the sticks are passed from hand to hand.
From time to time some of the players sing or contort their limbs in various
ways. In its essentials the game is the same as the Chinook game
described by Paul Kane ('Wanderings of an Artist,' p, 193), who has not
failed to note ' the eternal gambling song he hah ha!'

     The following songs were obtained from Paul, a Tobacco Plains
Kootenay, and were stated by him to be very old :

Indian, who then flies away on high ; by-and-by returns, and, sitting under

the blanket, causes the spirit to depart again.

    This song Paul explained as follows :--The Indians cross the mountains

to go to the distant Blackfoot country, where there are great prairies and

many buffaloes. The Indians are much afraid of the Blackfeet. The
youths form circles and sing. The Kootenays are much afraid of the
Blackfeet. They are going to steal horses. They sing for a long time.
Then they hasten to return across the mountains, having finished killing

buffaloes.

  --Paul gave the following explanation of this song : The children join

hands in a circle, and bending the knees assume a sitting posture, the
whole weight of the body resting on the legs below the knees. They
keep rising up and sitting down, never actually sitting on the ground,
however. One of them closes his eyes, and the game consists in the
others stepping on his toes, &c., and pretending to be women, snakes,

ganS) or the like.

                                 Hunting {ho'nana' qS, I hunt).

     The Kootenays have always been great hunters. In former times they
used to cross the Rockies to join the Blackfeet and other tribes in the

great annual buffalo hunt. Since the disappearance of these animals they
have been forced to confine themselves to the pursuit of bears, deer,

wolves, and the smaller fur-bearing animals. The Indians are very skil-
ful in the chase, and it is said that in the old days certain families hunted
only some particular animal ; the bear or the beaver, for example. The
flesh of most of the animals killed is eaten by the Indians, and the hides
are disposed of to the whites. The Upper Kootenays kill a large number
of skunks (Qd'aas), which they sell to the Chinese miners, who use them

for medicinal purposes.

                                                                                                                           oo2
564 KEPOET 1892.

     Since the introduction of firearms amongst the Indians, the old bows
and arrows have in great part disappeared. Some of the children use
them to shoot birds, and here and there may be still seen a few old men
with bow and quiver slung across their backs (the quiver being made of
skin, and often profusely ornamented with beads, strips of fur, &c.). In
using the bow the Kootenays hold it sometimes horizontally, sometimes
perpendicularly. The arrow rests between the first and second fingers of
the left hand, which grasps the bow- stick, while the notch-end of the
arrow is held between the thumb and first finger of the right hand.

     The bow-stick (dqJdld'huo) was made of cedar {itsEiul'Et, Thuya
gigantea) or maple {mitshik, Acer glabrum). The bow-string (t'dwu'm'kd)

was made of the sinews (dqkinJc'd'tlka) of various animals (chiefly of the
deer), and sometimes of strips of skin. The arrows used for shooting
birds were entirely of wood, with a thick, blunt end. Other arrows
(dqk) had points (ndtlko'tsap) of bone or stone, and, latterly, of iron
obtained from the whites. The stone arrowhead (ndtlko'tsap) was of flint
(dqkd'tsko) obtained by the Lower Kootenays from a mountain about
twenty miles from Barnard, B.C., and by the Upper Kootenays of the
reo-ion about Fort Steele from the vicinity of Sheep Creek. The point of
the arrow is called dqkink-d'kd, the feather dqk'd'n'kd, the notch
dqk-d'n'k-dk, the quiver idts'dk, or d'qkank'd'nam, the whole bow and
arrows dqko'k'mdtUhet t'd'ivo. Long ago the Lower Kootenays are said to
have caught ducks by means of a pole, to which was attached a net made
of the fibre of the plant known as d'qkotla'kpis. The Indians used to
 lasso the 'fool hen' (kld'wdts) by means of nooses made of the same

 material.

      It was customary for the hunter to distribute the product of his
 prowess amongst his relatives and friends, and this hospitality was almost
 a law of the tribe. It is not quite certain whether an Indian would kill a
 bear or a fish into which he thought one of the spirits of his departed
 relatives had gone.

                                Fishing (ndtlu'ktlauwa'te, he fishes).

      The Lower Kootenays are, to a great extent, canoe and fishing Indians.
 The Upper Kootenays, for the most part, on account of their situation,
  are less given to travelling by water or to the procuring of fish, except-

 ing salmoji (sfiwd'kEmo), as a food supply. Many methods of catching

 --fish are in use, of which the following are the chief :

       Befoi-e the advent of the whites, the Indians fished with a hook
  (tco'tvdk) made of a bit of bone fastened to a piece of wood, the whole

  havino' much the shape of an ordinary hook. To this was attached a line
          ON THE NORTH-WESTEBN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                                               565

made of tlie fibre of d'qkofla'Jcpis. For liooks to catch small fish the

spines of a species of gooseberry called hisyl'tin were sometimes em-

ployed.

     Fishing through the ice was practised thus : Over a bole cut in the
ice was laid a branch or stick of wood, upon which was let down a branch
having two prongs, the ends of which were tied together, and from them

hung the hook and line of d'qlc6tla'l-/pis. This method of fishing was

termed nd'usdntlu'ktluhwd'tsene.

Another mode of obtaining fish in the winter time was to pound on the

ice with a club or heavy piece of wood, and so drive the fish into the

shallows near the shore, where repeated blows stunned or killed them.

This was called gd'Tcpalci' toivi! Ieqo' motl.
     Gaffing (giid'kdmi't'wuink-o'mo) by means of a large hook attached to

a slender branch or pole is now much practised by the Indians, who are

very skilful at it.

     The Lower Kootenays, depending upon fish as a chief source of their
food supply, have certain devices for obtaining them in large quantities.
The chief of these are the dam or weir and the basket-trap.

    The first of these (dqli'wu'hQu) is a sort of dam of sticks and wicker-
work built across a stream or at the entrance of a ' slough,' so as to pre-
vent the escape of the fish when the water falls. Attached to these dams

are often wicker-work traps, cone-shaped, sometimes 10 feet long by

3,feet wide, into which the fish fall and are caught. Fishing by means

of this is called wd'fkd'tlik.

     The basket-trap (yd'ka) is of wicker-work and cone-shaped (often as
large as 10 x 8 feet) : within it is ingeniously placed or worked another

cone, called d'qkitlivl'is yd'ka ('the heart of the yd'ka'), or yd'ka na'na

('little yd'ka^), which effectually prevents the exit of the fish, while

affording them an easy entrance. Along one side of the yd'ka are placed

rings of  bark,  generally three  in  number                                         to  these  are  attached  stout
                                                                                  ;

strings, which are held by three or four Indians. To fish with the yd'ka

is nd'witskd'eiie.

     There are three kinds of fish sjjears in use amongst the Kootenays.
The first, called dqktla' Qa, closely resembles the spear of the Eskimos

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the second, d'qkinu'kmdk', has three fixed points like a trident ; the third
has a point of wood, headed with metal, shaped like an arrow-head, to

which is attached a string, so that the point is released when a fish is
struck and canjbe retrieved. The third sort is used for salmon and other
large fish. To spear fish is called gu'dk'o'mo.

     The Lower Kootenays dry immense quantities of the fish called md'ti I
and opd't" for use during the winter. The fish are dried (Jci'tkani' tltlitV)
on stages called d' cjkuwd'sko, which are erected near the lodges.

of  pine  or  spruce  bark ;  sta'tldm,  a  ' dug-out                                           ydk'tso'metl,  a  term  for
                                                                                            ';

Aother than dug-out canoes.              steamboat is d'qJciiiJc'd'h'o ydh'tso'metl

(' fire canoe '), and a large ferry-boat is called std'tldm.

    The bark canoe of the Kootenays is of peculiar construction. It is

made for the most part of white pine (d'qkdm) or spruce (gi'sitslc-d'dl, Picea

alba) bark (dqk'wok), with the outer side turned in and chipped off, so as to
be fairly smooth. The upper rim, of about 4 or 5 inches in width, is made of

birch bark. The Lower Kootenays use the bark of the tree called d'qlcdm

to make their canoes. The sewing is done by needles of bone {did), and

split roots serve as thread. The pitch (i'dlmvas) used is obtained from
several of the coniferse. The boat is much shorter at the top than aloug

the keel, and at both ends runs down towards the keel, terminating in
sharp points (d'qkd), thus rendering it quite aiuique in appearance. The

rim around the top is made of bent strips (dqko'k'yu) of hard wood, and

is well secured by lashings of split roots and bark fibre. The edges of

these strips cross at the ends. From the ends to the keel run two binding

strips (dqku'nwok) for each end of the boat, which are fastened in the

same way. The boat, besides being pitched, is often plastered over with

a sort of mud (d'mdk). The inside framework consists of longitudinal

strips (dqki'kdluk) on the bottoms and along the sides, and the curved

strengtheners (dqku'dhnd) running from top to top along the bottom and

--Fig. 4. Canoe of Lower Kootenay Indians. This drawing is after a model made

     by Chief Eustan. The model canoe is 22 inches from tip to tip by 4^ inches

     wide at the centre, and is perfect in its details.

up the sides. The bark fibres or strips used for tying and lashing the
various parts together are called ndpHsu'nad. The thwarts, three or four
in number, are called d'qkE. The paddle (dl-i'sin) is generally of cedar
the blade is called dqkd'm, and the handle dqkd'n. The paddler kneels
upon a number of flat pieces of cedar or other similar wood tied together
termed gol'nidl.

     These canoes are very ' cranky,' but the Indians can navigate one of them
in the wake of a large river steamer with ease. The canoe is anchored

by sticking the handle of the paddle into the mud of the shore and tying

the boat to it by a string of bark, &c. The Lower Kootenays make very

good models of large canoes, reproducing in miniature the features of the

original (see fig. 4).

                                                      Houses.

     The houses (d'qkltld'nam) of the Kootenays consisted of a framework
of converging poles {aqkits) over which were laid the skins of various
            ON THE NOBTH-WESTEEiN TRIBES OF CANADA.               567

wild animals. The number of poles used varied from five or six to nine
or ten. There was no particular separation of men and women in the
lodt^es ; communal houses were unknown. In the old days it was

considered a grave offence to let the fire in the tepee go out. Larger
lodges for the chief and for the medicine-man were the rule. Lodges

were also constructed of the rush called tibmtl.

            Sweat-houses.

The sweat-houses {wise' ydtT) were made of willow sticks bent over

one another so as to form a dome-shaped structure from 2\ to 4 feet high

and some 4 feet in diameter. This dome is covered with blanket, grass,

Abark, &c.  hole is dug in the ground in the centre, in which the bather

crouches. Near to the sweat-house is built a firft, in which stones are

heated red-hot and placed within the wise'ydtl, when water is poured

upon them, and the naked Indians stand the almost suffocating tem-

perature for a long time, until suddenly they rush out and plunge into

the stream close by. The Kootenays are very fond of these sweat-baths,

and the writer has seen more than a dozen of the wise'ydtl in close

proximity on the banks of one of the many creeks of the country.

                                                 Implements, &c.

     The use of the name dqkii'tdtl for both ' flint ' and ' axe ' seems to
indicate of what material the Kootenays made axes in the past. Axes
were also made of dter or elk horn called d'qJcdtle'et. Knives (^dqktcd'm&tl)
were of similar materials. Needles and awls {tlo'o) were made of the
sharpened small bones of the leg of the moose (iiets'na'pliiv) and other
animals. Hammers {pu'pu) of stone are still in use.

            Manufactures

     Water-tight baskets, made of split roots and known as yi'tslcl, are still
manufactured by the Lower Kootenays, but the art appears to be nearly

varieties of these ' kettles ' are called yl'tskl, the smaller yi'tski na'na.

The terms yitshl'mt, d'tcu, and cl'gatla'Ek are also in use, the last amongst
the Lower Kootenays. These root vessels are often stained and orna-
mented in carious fashion. The Kootenays also make baskets or ' kettles '
of birch bark. These, which are sometimes very large, are called nd'lielc.

    All the Kootenay women make moccasins, gloves, and shirts from the

skins of various animals, and these are often artistically embroidered and
ornamented with silk and beads ; also pouches, bags, &c., of like

material. The skins used, after being deprived of the flesh and fat
adhering to them, are stretched over hoops of willow and a fire built
under them. After this treatment they are tanned with deer's brains, so
that they become very soft and pliable.

                              Dress (d'qkoldld'ntes, his clothes).

     The dress of the Kootenays varies considerably. Very many of the
women and a large number of the men have, to a greater or less extent,
adopted civilised attire. But perhaps the majority of the men still cling

to the old blanket-legging (dqk'atu'ktluk), the blanket (se't) formerly so

much in use, and the customary moccasins (tld'Eu). The shirt of

buckskin (^dqlal! tuu'mtldEf) is replaced by one procured from the store,
which, as a rule, is worn over the breeches and not tucked in. The Lower
Kootenays in dress, as in several other respects, are more primitive than
the Upper. Some few of them dress like white men, but in summer most
of them go bare-foot and bare-legged, having frequently no other garment

than an old shirt. In this guise they wade through the swampy meadows

or urge their horses over the grassy plains.

    The girls and women are, as a rule, attired like the whites. The boys

wear nothing but a shirt and a very narrow breech-clout, tEskdp'ukwd-
nl'mo. In the winter the dress of the Lower Kootenays varies, some
clinging to the old blanket, others dressing like the white man.

     Those Kootenays who do not go bare-headed wear felt or straw hats
ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                            569

(dqlcd'iyfihwd'nam, felt hat; dtla'tlqo, straw hat) adorned with various

charms or ornaments. The Indians frequently pierce these felt hats with

many holes or whiten them with a sort of pipeclay.
     In the olden time the dress of the Kootenays was different. The skin

of the moose fM){ne' ts\id' furnished them with shirt and leggings. They
also made ornamented shirts of buckskin, and the women had a special

dress for festal occasions. The Lower Kootenays still make these fine

shirts, which are often punctured with holes and highly ornamented with
bead-work, bits of silk, and strips of otter and weasel skin. The
moccasins were made the same as those in use now. The Lower

Kootenays used to make them out of the skin of the horse. No hats

were in use. The Indians wore broad bands of wolf (Jcd'qkin) or coyote

{slci'nhuts) skin around the forehead and sides of the head, leaving the
top bare. This probably survives in the narrow band of cloth which
some of the older Indians still wear in like manner. More recently, the
Upper Kootenays made little caps of skunk {ad'aas) skin, and very

beautiful ones from the skin and feathers of the loon (nottlu'kwen).

    Very many of the Indians wear a breech-clout even when they assume

the European dress.

Haik-dkessing (hotcu'ktldmd'mek, I comb my hair).

Many of the Kootenays wear their hair long and flowing. Numbers
of the Lower Kootenays wear their hair cut short : this is less common

amongst the Upper Kootenays, although favoured by the Mission. Most
myof the adult Kootenays braid (Jio' nitl'i! tltliikwa' tcktland'mek, I braid
myhair) their hair in one or more braids {kd' tltUikwa' tcktldm,
                                                                  braid),

and ornament these with silk, bits of fur, &c. Three braids, one down

the middle of the back and one over each ear, are common. In the old

days the rule for both men and women was two braids, one over each

ear. The hair was not cut.

                                    Ornaments and Charms.

                                                                 a

     The Kootenays are profuse in the ornamentation of their persons.

From the hats, belts (dqk'd'mtam), shirts, and leggings of the men are sus-

pended twisted silk, beaded cords, gay ribbons, strips of fur, &c. Strings
of weasel (md'iyuk) fur appear to be most in favour, one Indian having as

many as twenty dangling from various parts of his dress. Around the

hats strings of beads, silk, strips of fur, and bands of bright-coloured
cloth are worn. The belts, pouches {d'qkvtld'ko), moccasins, &c., are
often finely worked with designs of leaves of plants, animals, &c., in silk

or beads. From the necklace {d'na) and belt are suspended bits of ore or

ments. Earrings (d'qkokwd'tsJi'ak'u'ndm) of shells with serrated edges are

much worn by both men and women, and some seem to have their ears

disfigured by reason of these ornaments.

    Many of the Indians still carry about their persons the horse-shoe
steel (dqkte'mdtl) for striking fire, which the Hudson's Bay Company

distributed long ago, and the nippers (tluqtlu'tldhdlpkine'mdtl) used for
extracting the hairs on the face and body.

     The Indians are fond of brass finger-rings (^ci'qhohwa'tsitsqa'i'na'ni).
One young fellow wore six : three (on first, third, and fourth fingers) on
the right hand and three (on first, second, and fourth fingers) on the left.

    Many of the ornaments are undoubtedly charms, and the Indians are
very loth to part with these. One blind Indian had more than a dozen
bits of stone, wood, fur, &c., besides a sort of needle made of the small
bone of the leg of a grizzly bear. Bear's teeth and claws are much worn,

either in necklaces or pendent from the hair or some part of the dress.
     In the olden times necklaces of dqku'p'malc, a shell found in the rivers

of the Lower Kootenay region, and wristlets of the same material were
worn. Men, women, and children wore earrings made of these shells, the

child's ear being pierced very early in life. No evidence of the existence

of labrets, nose ornaments, or the practice of knocking out certain of the

teeth could be found.

                                                   Tobacco, Pipes.

    The Indians call store tobacco yd'k'et, and their own sort, made of the
leaves of certain willows and plants, tcakd'u. They have a remembrance
of having obtained tobacco from the south-east. The principal plant
which they use for making their native tobacco is that known as tcakd'woh
(the kinnikinnik plant, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). The pipe-stems {dqhu'tla)
are made oi a' qJcumo" wok (Viburnum opulus) and other woods. The pipe
itself (kos) is made of stone procured from the Lower Kootenay. These
pipes difler very much in form and size, and are but little ornamented.
Very few of them are now made. The Indians are very fond of cigarettes
(iyu'q'd'iit), and in making them prefer to use printed paper (see figs.

13,14).

                                            Food (kiketl).

    Much of the food supply of the Kootenays is now purchased. They

are very fond of such sweet things as sugar, sweet-meats, jellies, and pre-
serves. The Upper Kootenays obtain the refuse when cattle are killed by
the Chinamen and the ranchers. The Lower Kootenays will eat horses, and
have been known to eat the dead bodies of cattle that have been drowned
and have remained for days in the river. The Kootenays do not eat
skunks (fta'Qas), cats (pits), frogs (we' tdk), crows (aa'aa), ravens (ko'kwen),
certain hawks, various kinds of woodpeckers, owls, robins (tci'kEku),
plover (Au'fse'is), jays (k-ok'-u'sk-'i, blue jay; ivd'koks, white jay), although
the children occasionally eat the red woodpecker (md'Eka), and a few
Indians will eat the owl (k'ii'pt), and the hawk called i'ntldk (Accipiter
Gooperi). The Indians eat the eggs (d' qkimu' qan) of a few birds whose
flesh they do not use as food, such as the yi'kets'nd and the took' tldtltld.
The Kootenays have the reputation of being enormous eaters, and the
writer's experience fully corroborates this. The Kootenays have the
disgusting habit of eating the vermin (h6"ke) which infest their heads,
and even the chief has been seen picking the lice from one of his tribes-
men's head and devouring them with evident relish.

                                           Food Plants.

   A large portion of the food of these Indians is of a vegetable nature,

consisting of berries, roots, moss, &c. The following are the principal :

     Berries : sk'o'md, service-berry (Amelanchier alnifolia) ; hisyi'tin (Bibes
oxycanthoides), wild gooseberry; dqko'ho and gdtsfMgo'ko, raspberry;

   left in the ground under a hot fire for some days.

                                           Plants used Economically.

       From the fibre of a species of hemp d'qkotla'kpis (Apocynum canna-
   hinum), fishing-lines, ropes, &c., are made. The spines of the hisyl'tin, or
   wild- gooseberry, served as hooks for small fish. The bark of gldnuqtld'uwok
   (Elcegmcs argentea) is used to make ropes for catching horses. The wood

   of the maple, mitskek (Acer glabrum), was in the old days used to obtain

   fire by friction. From the plant emgo'tlnd (Evernia vulpina), by boiling,

   a red dye for moccasins, root-baskets, &c., is obtained, and the little seeds

   called gdku'tlwan of the plant gdkH'tlwanmo'os (Purshia tridentata) furnished

   a reddish dye.

                            Plants Admired for their Smell or Beauty.

       The plant called dqku' oktlu' aund'Etet is much admired by the Kootenays
   on account of its scent. They may often be seen applying it to their

   nostrils, or, where it is found in great abundance, rolling about on the
   ground in evident delight. They fill bags with the plant called and'nam
   (Matricaria discoidea), and use them as pillows. The flowers of the

   k'so'Vno'k'yok (Arenaria pungens) are much admired. The plant nisnd'pd'tl

   (Oryzopsis asperifoliens) is thrown on the fire in large quantities on account
   of its good smell.

                               Medicinal Plants.

   The principal vegetable remedies of the Kootenays are as follows :

   For sore eyes : The inside bark of the birch, dqk'ud' tluwok (Betula

   papyrifera), boiled ; the peeled and boiled root of the ndho'kowok, or

   Oregon grape the bark of the shrub mo'kvjo'k (Cornus stolonifera) boiled
                                                                           ;;

   the root  of  the  wu'mdtl  macerated    and boiled                                                     the plant ndmtld'sUk

   (Cicuta maculata ?) pounded in a mortar ; the burnt leg bones of deer
   pounded in a mortar.

   For horses the Indians chew the tops of the plant mitsko'kdtli't'nd

   (Apocynum androscemifoliens), and spit it into the animal's eyes.

Disease (^sd'nitlqo'mi, he is sick).

   A very stringent and well-enforced law of the Province, which has the

cordial approval of the settlers and of the Roman Catholic missionaries,

keeps the curse of liquor from the Kootenays, and not a little of their pre-

sent good character is due to this fact. By the common consent of travellers,

missionaries, and settlers, the morality of these Indians is veiy high, and
they are practically free from venereal diseases, and the licentiousness
prevalent amongst some of the coast tribes is unknown. The experiences

of Mr. Robert Galbraith, who for some years acted as the medical adviser
to these Indians, bears out to the full this statement. The institution of

the sweat-bath and other helps to personal cleanliness has its good results.

     The Indians suffer most from consumption and allied affections, and
diseases of the eye. The latter are mostly caused by the smoke of the

lodges, and terminate not infrequently in complete blindness. Scrofula is

also prevalent. Some cases of goitre have been noted (one, that of a

woman, came under the writer's observation), due, it is said by the settlers,

to the immoderate use of snow-water. The Indian dogs are stated to be

subject also to goitre.

Running sores on the face and neck and in the ears are rather com-

mon, especially with the children, and the cause of a recent death was given

as cancer of the brain supervening upon a sore in the ear. Some of the

Indians are disfigured by  warts                             one  deaf and  dumb  individual  had  his

hand covered with them, and in the case of a little boy the face, thick

with warts, was gradually being eaten away by cancer.

Toothache, though very rare, is not unknown, and Mr. McLaughlin

stated that he had known several Indians to suffer terribly from it.

Besides their numerous native remedies, the Indians have frequent

recourse to the supplies of the white man and the Chinaman.

The writer met with two deaf mutes and two blind Indians. Amongst

the Lower Kootenays there is said to be an hermaphrodite, who keeps

constantly in the society of the women.

              II. Mythology and Folklore.

  --Astronomical. The moon (natu'nik, Ftd'tlml'ijit natd'nih) is regarded

as a man, the sun (natd'nik) as a woman. There was no sun in the begin-
ning, and after the Indians had vainly endeavoured to discover it the
coyote [ski'tilcuts) was successful in making it rise above the mountains.
Another version makes the chicken-hawk (i'ntldk) cause the sun to rise,

and the coyote, getting angry, shoots an arrow at the sun, but misses,
with the result of setting the prairie on fire and making him run for dear

life.

    The moon is said to have been found by the chicken-hawk. The man
in the moon is an Indian, who once chopped wood all the days of the
week (including Sunday), whereupon the moon came down and seized
him, and he has been in the moon ever since. This myth may be of

European origin.

    The stars are mostly Indians, who from time to time have got up into
the sky. The Great Bear is called tld'utld {i.e., grizzly bear), and

was an Indian woman. Being a female grizzly she is at times very

angry, and the stars in the tail are Indians, upon whom she has seized.

WayThe Milky  is dqkEmd'is ad'Etltsin,' ' the dog's trail.'

The thunder (nu'ma) is caused by a great bird that lives far up in the

sky. The lightning (ndqkd'tlimu'qudti'tlek) is made by the shooting of

its arrows.

     At first there were no clouds (dqk'dtl). The daughter of the coyote

married the thunder, and her father gave her the clouds for a blanket.

  --Ethnic Origins, Sfc. The Kootenays believe that they came from the

East, and one of their myths ascribes to them an origin from a hole in

the ground east of the Rocky Mountains. Another account says the

Kootenays sprang up from the hairs of the black bear (ni'pko), which fell

on the ground after he came out of the belly of the great fish which had

swallowed him. There were no women at first. By-and-by an Indian
went up into the mountains, and from a spirit who lived there received

--the first Kootenay woman.

    Horses were made as follows : A medicine-man took a piece of stick,

made it into the shape of a horse, and threw it away, whereupon it became

a horse.

    The Indians have a belief that the white men get their cattle from the

sea. They say the white men go every year to the shore of the Pacific

--Ocean to receive the cattle which come out of the waters.
     Deluge Legend. Sukpe'kd (a small grey bird, species ?), the wife of
i'ntldk (Accipiter Cooperi), is forbidden by her husband to go to a certain

lake, to di'ink of its waters, or to bathe in it. One day her husband goes

out after deer and repeats the warning before leaving. Sukpe'kd busied

herself picking berries, and, what with climbing the mountain and being
exposed to the hot sun, she feels very warm, and goes down to the lake.
Suddenly the water rises, and a giant called ydwuEnek comes forth, who

seizes the woman and ravishes her. I'ntldlv is very angry when he learns
of this, and, going to the lake, shoots the monster, who swallows up all

the water, so there is none for the Indians to drink. I'ntldk's wife pulls

the arrow out of the giant's breast, whereupon the water rushes forth in

torrents, and a flood is the result. I'ntldk and his wife take refuge on a

mountain, and by-and-by the water sinks to its proper level.

In a variant of this legend the ' giant ' is a ' big fish.' I'ntldk sees the
                                                      --

 conduct of his wife, kills her and the monster ; it is the blood of the fisb
 that causes the deluge ; and i'ntldh escapes by climbing to the top of a
 tree. The scene is localised as the Kootenay River, near A'qTcdm (Fort

 Steele).

      In another variant the ' giant ' is a ' lake animal,' and i'ntldh stops the
 deluge by placing his tail in the water, the flood ceasing to rise when it
 had reached the last row of spots on his tail. Hence the spotted tail of
 the chicken-hawk.

   --Flsli swallows Bear. Long ago there was in the Kootenay River, near

A'qk'am (Fort Steele) a huge fish. One day this fish swallowed the black
bear {ni'pko), who had been an Indian (?). The bear remained in the
belly of the fish about two months, when he was vomited out. The bear
lost all his hairs, which, falling to the ground, became Kootenay Indians.
The big fish is finally killed by the bird called ydma'kpdtl, a species of

woodpecker.

                              ANIMAL TALES.

     The folklore of the Kootenays consists mainly in animal tales. Fol-
lowing is a sketch of the principal characters and their actions :

                                                       Animals.

      Bear (black).-- Given above.

   --Bear (grizzly). Appears frequently in tales ; is often deceived by the

coyote, who induces him to attempt to cross a creek on a log, and when
the bear is half-way over shakes the log, causing him to fall into the
water and be drowned. Then the coyote boils the grizzly in his kettle,
which tumbles over, and the coyote, getting angry, throws the whole intO'

--the river. In another tale the grizzly (tld'utld) is killed by the spirits.
     Beaver (si'nd). Appears in tale with turtle. Throws turtle into river.

--Beaver grease is a dainty of frequent mention in the stories.
     Buffalo (ni'tltsik). Appears often in tales with the coyote. Asks the
coyote to smoke his (buffalo's) pipe, which he does, and gets his mouth
burned in consequence. Buffalo-skulls (inhabited by spirits) lying on the

--prairie are often mentioned in the tales.
      Caribou (na'aane). Appears in tales with the coyote or the wolf. Is

--killed by the coyote, and in another tale by the tomtit.
    Chipmunk. Two species of chipmunk appear in the tales. The one
called k'o'tcdtc is killed by the owl and the frog, who put him into ' sour
dough.' The other, known as nd'mtldEt, appears as an unimportant per-

--sonage in the tale in which the toad and eagle take part.
     Coyote (ski'nkfds). The coyote is the chief figure in Kootenay mytho-

--logy. His principal exploits and adventures are as follows : He sets

out with the chicken-hawk to find the sun, gets angry, and shoots an
arrow at the sun, thereby starting the first prairie fire ; kills the caribou,

Hethe owl, the white-tailed deer, the grizzly, the cricket, the moose, &e.

is thrown into the fire by the chicken-hawk and gets his coat singed.
Smokes the buffalo's pipe and gets his mouth burned. Quarrels with his
wife, the dog, and kills her. Is represented as carrying his younger
brother, the cricket, about with him. The cricket has a broken leg,
and one day the coyote breaks his own leg to be like him. The cricket
tries to injure the coyote, who finally kills him. After being for a long
time supreme amongst the animals the coyote is beaten and killed by the
          ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                                 577

fox, who takes his place. Among the services rendered by the coyote to

the Indians was the appeasing of the spirit of the mountains, who became
angry and killed all those who started to hunt in his domains. In return

for this benefit he was giv^en a wife from the tribe, and from that time to

--this the Indians have been allowed to hunt in peace.
     Deer. The white-tailed deer (tcu'plcd) is killed by the coyote. The

--young deer are cheated in a race by the frogs.
    Dog. The dog (ad'Etltsin) appears as the wife of the coyote, who kills

--her in a fit of anger.
     Fox. The fox (nd'^hEyu) is often represented as carrying a root-

basket. Scares the skunk by whistling ; kills the wolf and restores him

to life again ; induces the wolf to try to beat the shadow of the sun ; kills
the coyote, and becomes chief of all the animals.

  --Moose (nets' 7id'pJcu). The male moose {nets'nd'-plcu) is killed by the

--coyote, and the female moose (tld'wo) by the tomtit.
    Mountain Lion. The mountain lion (sud'E) is feared by many of the

--other animals, especially by the skunk, whom he at last killed.
     Babbit. The rabbit {gl'anu'qtlu'm'nd'), with the snow-bird (niskd'Et),

--kills the female moose and brings some of the meat to the frog.
     Shunk. The skunk (nd'aas) is represented as a very clever animal,

and is associated often with the fox. He carries a root-basket, and is

afraid only of something that whistles ; is scared by the fox's whistling
and runs oE, but afterwards tries to kill the fox ; is finally killed by the

--mountain- lion.
     Squirrel. The squirrel {t'a'Jcdts) appears a few times, and in one of

the tales is killed by the spirits.

   --Wolf. The wolf {Icd'qkin) appears often in the tales. Kills the tomtit

and the caribou. Is occasionally carried by the coyote ; is killed by the

fox and   brought  to  life  again                              wagers  the  fox  that  he  can  outrun  the
                                                             ;

shadow of the sun, but fails to do so ; and a long quarrel with the fox

results.

                                                           Birds.

  --Duck. Some ducks (gid'qtld) are seen by the coyote on a little lake
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

by-a,nd-by they rise up, and the lake dries up. The coyote afterwards pulls

--out some of the ducks' feathers, so that they cannot fly too high.
     Eagle. The eagle (gid'k'dnu'kildt) appears in a tale along with the
toad and hawks. Is found sitting on a tree by a star, and is killed by

the latter.

  --Goose. The goose (kdau'tlok') is represented in one tale as a child

eating dirt.

   --Grouse. The ' fool-hen ' (ktd'wdts) has a large family of young ones :

these are stolen by the coyote, who puts them in his sack. They escape,
however, by scratching holes in it. The ' ruifed grouse ' {t'd'nkuts) takes

--the place of the ' fool-hen ' in another tale.
     Hawks. The male chicken-hawk (i'ntldk, Accipiter Cooperi) is a very

important character in these tales. He is the companion of the coyote in

the search for the sun ; in a fit of anger he thi-ows the coyote into the fire.

He is the hero of the deluge, which is indirectly caused by the infidehty

of his wife, sukpe'kd, whom, in one version of the story, he kills.
Associated with him, sometimes, is a young hawk (gt'dkd'tldk). His wife
is a small grey bird called sukpe'kd. It was her amours with the giant

ydwo'Evek that brought on the deluge.
578 REPORT-- 1892.

   --Magpie. TLe magpie, called dndn, tries to pick out the eyes of the
--coyote while the latter is lying down apparently dead.

     Owl. The owl {hu'pi) is represented often as an old woman who

steals childi-en. She helps to kill the chipmunk, and is herself killed by

the coyote, who helps the children she carries in a basket at her back to

escape.

   --8now-hird. The snow-bird (nishd'Et) is represented as the wife of the

rabbit, whom she helps to kill the moose.

   --Tomtit. The tomtit (mitskd'Jcas) is the grandson of the frog ; after

killing the caribou he is killed by the wolf. In another tale be induces
the moose to come across the river to him, and then kills him with a

knife.

                                                              Fish.

  --Trout. In one of the tales the coyote changes himself into a trout

(g'u'stet), and is caught by the Indians, who are about to hit him on the
head with a club, when he calls out that he is the coyote, and not a fish

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

--whereupon they laugh much and let him go.
     Whale, or Big Fish. The big fish {guwi'tlkd gid'hqo) swallows the

black bear. He is finally killed by the bird called yamd'hpdtl.

                                                             Insects.

  --Btitterjly. In one of the tales the coyote tries to run off with the

butterfly (Jcoli'M), thinking it to be a woman. The butterfly, however,
turns out to be a man, and the coyote is ridiculed.

  --Cricket. The cricket (dqlco'Mldkd'wdm) is represented as the younger

brother of the coyote, who carries him about with him, and is at times
advised by him. He is sometimes mentioned as having a broken leg,
and in one story the coyote breaks his own leg so as to be like his brother.
The cricket seeks to kill the coyote, but is at last killed by him.

  --Mosquito. There was originally one mosquito {gdtsfsd'tld), who was

fed with blood by the spirits until his belly became so large that it burst,
and from it came forth the myriads of mosquitoes that exist to-day.

                                                         Reptiles.

   --Frog. The frog (wE'tdJc) is the grandmother of the chipmunk. In

one tale he takes to wife two of the children of the grouse (t'd'nkuts).
The most interesting exploit of the frog is the race with the deer. The
method of procedure is the same as that by which the tortoise wins in

the ' Uncle Remus ' story. The frogs, in large numbers, are stationed in
hiding at various points in the track, and when the deer approaches them,
hop on ahead, so that the deer always sees the frog ahead of him. They
look so much alike that he never suspects the trick, and consequently the

frog wins the race.

   --Toad. The toad {Icd'ho) appears in a tale with the eagle, and is killed
--by the chicken-hawk.

     Turtle. The mud-turtle (lid' ad') appears in a tale with the beaver

chief, whom he kills by cutting off his head. He is afterwards thrown

into the river, and escapes.
      Other characters appearing in these tales are Indians, white men,

giants, spirits, the heavenly bodies, &c.
                                                                                  --

             ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                        579

    Most of the tales are old, and in but two or three the white man

appears, and in these he is represented as doing something ridiculous or

obscene.

     The Indians and the animals are so confused at times that it is
impossible to say where the human and where the animal character pre-

dominates. Old men and women appear very often.
    The spirits, who appear with great frequency, are represented as

giving advice, being consulted by, or interfering with the actions of, the

various characters. In one tale a mountain spirit is represented as
harassing the Indians very much, depriving them of game, and killing

the hunters who ventured up the mountain. He is finally outwitted by

the coyote.

There are several giants, the principal being the monster ydwo'Eneli,

who is represented sometimes as human, sometimes as a fish, and some-

times as a huge lake animal. He is shot by the chicken-hawk for

outraging his wife, and this brings on the deluge. One of the giant tales
--Ais as follows :
                                                 woman was out picking berries, and her child was

Alying on the ground near her.                   giant (^ehd) came along, and said to her,

' How is it that you have made my brother {i.e., the child) so white and

smooth ? '   ' Oh                                I roasted him,' said the woman.  Then said the giant,
                                              !

' Roast me too ; I want to be white and smooth.' So she set the giant to

work to dig a big hole, put plenty of wood into it, and lay stones on top.

On this grass was placed, and the giant lay down, and the woman piled

grass, earth, and stones on him, so that in spite of his efforts he could

not rise, and was roasted to death. The woman then went home, saying

to her people, ' I have killed the giant.'

As mentioned above, the moon and the stars (d'qMtlno'hds) are repre ·

sented as occasionally visiting the earth. In one tale the star kills the

eagle, who is found sitting on the branch of a tree.
    Two very interesting tales are those of ' Seven Heads ' and ' Lame

--Knee.' The first tale in abstract is this : There was a young man,

and his name was 'Bad Clothes' (Sd'mlk'dld'Ent), and he determined

to find 'Seven Heads' (Wistddld' dldm) and kill him. After searching

for some time he met him, and the two fought, and ' Seven Heads '

was slain. The youth returned home in triumph, carrying with him the

tongues of the monster as a trophy.

    The outline of the story of ' Lame Knee ' is as follows : Ko'mdtllia'nlcd,
ov ' Lame Knee,' runs off with the wife of a chief and outrages her. The

chief pursues, and, overtaking ' Lame Knee,' cuts off his head with a

knife and throws it away, but as it rolls along the ground the head

appears to laugh very much. He then cuts off one arm at the shoulder,

and afterwards the other and also the two legs are cut off one after the
                                                                                                                                                           ;

other. Only the ti'unk of the body is left, and this the chief gashes all

over with his knife. At night singing is heard, and ' Lame Knee,' having

risen to life again, kills the chief and departs, taking the latter's wives

with him.

     Regarding the relations of Kootenay mythology to the mythologies of

other Indian tribes, not much can at present be said. The coyote myths

seem to point to the mythic cyclus of the Indians to the south-east, from
the Nez Perces to the Navajos ; the Deluge legend has an Algonkian
aspect ; and some of the other legends point to the Sioux, and the
tribes of "Western British Columbia. But more study is necessary to
niake out definitely any points of contact.

                                                                                      pp2
----                                                                       '

--580 EEPORT 1892.

     I might here add a note on bird-cries. The Kootenays claim to

interpret the following :

Owl says : Icd'tskdld'tl pd'tlke ; or, ktse'tlJcenetl pd'tlke.
The bird called yi'kitsnd calls out: iske'tlo kd'ndqyil'qQd=' no more

buckskin horses.'                                                     (No

   =The tomtit says : tlo'matyet ! tlo'inaiyet ! ' spring ! spring !

more snow ! no more snow !).' The Indians like this bird very much.

   =The robin says : okwd'nukte'tlamtcl'yd ! ' by-and-by plenty of rain !

                             SIGN LANGUAGE.

     Sign language is still in use to a considerable extent amongst the
Upper and Lower Kootenays. The writer was able to obtain the

following, known to members of both tribes :

  --1. Across. Same as first sign, described under ' Across,' in Clark's

   --2. Afraid. Hands extended in front of body, back of hand outwards,

index finger extended, rest of hand closed ; the hands, which approach
quite close to each other, are withdrawn with a downward movement to
a distance, and in a degree corresponding to the fear to be expressed (see

--Clark, p. 25).
     3. All. Right hand held in front of breast, palm downwards, moved
ai'ound horizontally. Same as Shushwap sign for ' all ' (see * Report,'

--1890, p. 039).
     4. Angry. Right hand closed, moved rapidly before and close to

--forehead, keeping back of hand always to right {see Clark, p. 31).
      5. Axe. Left forearm extended in front of left side of body, hand
bent at wrist and fingers inclined downwards ; then right hand witli
thumb and forefinger (rest of hand generally closed) seizes left hand just

above wrist (see Clark, p. 56). Downward motion of hand to imitate

 chopping.

   --6. Bad. Same as sign described by Clark, p. 58, except that the

 downward motion is not very marked.

   --7. Bark. Index of left hand held up stifSy, rest of hand closed or

 fingers drooping ; right hand, limp, is then passed around index finger of
 left. The idea is ' stick-around ' (see Clark, under ' Grass ' and ' Tree,'

--pp. 192, 383).
      8. Basket. Elbows resting against sides of body, bring points of
 fingers together, so as to form rude half-circle (see Clark, under ' Kettle,'

--p. 227; 'Basket,' p. 62).
       9. Beads. Bring right forearm horizontally in front of body above
 breast, thumb touching index near the end of the latter pass hand to and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

--fro across neck, other fingers drooping. Compare Clark, p. 63.
       10. Bear {Grizzly). Close the hands (or sometimes let the fingers
 droop) and hold them close to side of head, near ears, with backs towards
 head. Sometimes the hands are shaken or moved about slightly, to
  indicate better the 'ears,' which are the basis of the sign. Clark says a

 --similar sign is used by the Crows (p. 63).
       11. Bear {Black). Same sign as for grizzly bear, with the addition of
  raising hands, with thumb and index placed together, to the level of the
  eyes, and pointing to the outer corners of the latter. The conception

  ' small eyes ' is at the base of this sign.

    --12. Beaver. Same as Shushwap sign described by Dr. Boas in
            ON THE NORTH-WESTEKN TEIBES OF CANADA.                                                                                 581

' Report,' 1890, p. 639, with the addition that the right hand is given an

--up-and-down motion to imitate the movement of the animal's tail.
     13. Bell. Right hand, with fingers drooping, brought close in front

--of neck and given a wagging motion.
     14. Belt. Bring the hands (flat) together at middle of waist, then

move them gradually backwards across body.

   --15. Berries.- Same as sign described by Clark under 'Rosebud,'

p. 321. Sometimes, however, the sign for ' small ' is made with right hand,
hj bringing thumb and index of right hand together a short distance from

end of index; then the motion of picking something off the back of the

--left hand is gone through.
     16. Bird. Crook arms at elbows, hold hands up with palms turned

somewhat outward, and give hand an upward and downward motion,

--fingers drooping, gradually increasing the elevation of the hands.
     17. Black. Touch hair with right hand, and rub back of left hand

with right hand.

  --18. Blanket. Same as sign described by Clark, p. 73.
  --19. Blind Shut eyes, bend the head slightly, and with hands closed,

backs turned upwards, touch the eyes with the thumb and forefinger of

each hand.

   --20. Blood. Hold hands together (forefingers parallel, other fingers

and  thumb  drooping)  near mouth                                                                  make  slight  motion  of hands  forwards
                                                                                                ;

--and upwards {see Clark, p. 74).
     21. Boat. Both hands brought close together in front of body, and

then moved alternately to right and to left and downwards.

  --22. Bone. Rub with forefinger of right hand the left hand at bony

--part of wrist.
    23. Bow and arrows. Left hand extended in front of body, palm

towards breast, then pass right hand backwards over left, for motion of

--drawing arrow and shooting. Compare Clark, p. TQ.
     24. Bread. Hold hands, fingei-s closed, palms up, in front of body,

then alternately move hands together and open and shut them.

  --25. Break. Same as sign described by Clark, p. 81.
   --26. Bullet. Hands extended in front of body, fingers and thumb

drooping, forefingers held parallel ; then right forefinger is made to touch

--left forefinger, and to pass quickly forward, touching its whole length,
    27. Colour. Same as sign for ' black.'
  --28. Gome. Same as sign described by Clark, p. 122.
  --29. Gome here. Raise right hand, palm down, above head, give hand

an up-and-down motion, and then move it backwards more or less

quickly.

  --33. Evacuate the bowels. Assume stooping position, pass right hand,

index extended, rapidly across region of buttocks in the direction of the

ground.

  --34. Fish. Same sign as described by Dr. Boas for the Shushwaps,

--' Report,' 1890, p. 640.
    35. Fly. See ' Bird.' Same sign used for both.
  --36. Great, large. Hold the arms extended at full length, fingers

stretched in front of body, so as to give idea of large half-circle.

582 EEPOKT-- 1892.

--37. Hungry. Toucli or rub abdomen ; or open moutb and move

fingers of right hand, so that the ends, fingers drooping, are just within

the mouth.

  --38. Lake. Same as Shushwap sign, described in 'Report,' 1890,

--p. 640.
     39. Length. Extend the left arm in front of body, and with index

finger of right hand mark off on the left arm, beginning with the ends

of the fingers for small objects, portions corresponding to the distance

43 Red. Move right hand, palm inwards, towards cheek, rub cheek

with ends of fingers. This sign arose from the red paint used by the

Kootenays. Another sign is to touch the tongue with the forefinger ot

the right hand, to which is added sometimes the sign for 'colour.'

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

     The Kootenay Indians are physically well developed, and between the
various groups there appear to be no well-marked differences. Their
stature places them amongst the tallest tribes of British Columbia, nine
out of thirty-six adult males, or one-fourth, having a height of more than
1,739 millimetres, and one individual actually measuring 1,846 milli-
metres, while three others were 1,767, 1,760 and 1,770 millimetres
respectively. Two-thirds of the individuals measured are included be-
tween 1,660 and 1,779 millimetres, with an average approximately at 1,690.
The women, if we may judge from the few cases here recorded, are much

shorter than   the  men                             three females, aged  14, 18, 40, measured respec-
                                                 :

tively 1,557, 1,570, and 1,582 millimetres. There appears to be not so
great a difference between the heights of the boys and girls.

The index of finger-reach seems to be slightly less than that of the

Bilqnla and some other tribes, two-thirds being found between the indices

102 and 106, but nearly one-third falling below 102.

The index of height, sitting, is also lower, two- thirds having an index

of from 50 to 53, and but ten cases out of thirty-five having an index of

more than 53.

    The index of length of arm has the largest number of cases at 45, and
two-thirds of the total come within the limits 43 to 46.

The indices of height and width of shoulder are more variable. The

index of height of shoulder shows the greatest grouping (ten cases out of

thirty-four) at 85, and between 82 and 84 two-thirds (twenty-two cases)

occur. Of the indices of width of shoulder two-thirds (twenty-one cases)

are found ranging from 18 to 20.

The indices of face show a range from 11 to 93, with the gi'eatest

accumulation (nine cases out of thirty-two) at 88, and having nearly one-

half (fifteen cases out of thirty-two) the number of cases with an index

of between 86 and 89. The facial index of the Kootenays is therefore

higher than that of the western tribes of British Columbia.

The indices of the upper part of the face have their greatest grouping

at 55 (eight cases out of thirty-three), and nearly two-thirds are contained

between 52 and 57, while eight cases, or nearly one-fourth, are above 57.
     The nasal indices show the greatest grouping (six cases out of thirty-

four) at 70, and there is none below 58.

    Thus far we have dealt with adults alone. It seems allowable in the

case of the cephalic index to include all individuals of five years and over.

This gives us, of pure blood Kootenays, seventy males and fourteen

females. Of the females, thirteen have an index of over 78 (correspond-

ing to 76 on the skull), and eight have an index of more than 83 (81 on

the skull). If one is to judge from these fourteen cases, the Kootenay

women are brachycephalic ; a fact which would correspond witli their
seemingly much shorter stature. This apparent brachycephalism may,

however, be the result of the comparatively small number of individuals

measured.

The cephalic indices of the males range from 72 to 86 (corresponding

to 70 and 84 on the skull), with the greatest grouping at 11 (75 on the
skull). Fifty-five cases are found below 80 (78 on the skull). More

than half are thus mesaticephalic. It is just possible that we have here

an intermixture of a brachycephalic type, but this would perhaps be sus-

tained if several hundred measurements had been taken.

The cephalic indices of the half-breeds show considerable variation,

and the females tend towards brachycephaly, as was the case with the

pure Indians.

It is usually impossible to obtain the weight of aborigines owing to

the lack of weighing apparatus ; hence the few cases here recorded will be
of considerable interest. They are presented on next page rearranged

according to age :

     These measurements were taken when the Indians had a normal
amount of summer clothing on.

The average weight of thirteen adults (from nineteen to fifty-nine years

of age) is 161 pounds.

ON THE NOETH-WESTEBN TRIBES OF CANADA.  585

having seen but a single case of caries, and that in a boy. The chins are,
as a rule, well formed, both in raen and women. The foreheads appear to
be broad and straight. In the case of an Indian (Andre) aged sixteen
the distance from chin to the hair-line was 187 millimetres. The glabella
is generally 3 to 4 of Broca. The superciliary ridges are quite prominent
in many cases. The faces seem broader than they really are, and the
cheekbones often prominent. The limbs appear to be well-shapen, but
in not a few cases the hands are rather large, the shoulders stooped, or

the legs bandy.

     To distinguish a Kootenay from an Indian of some other tribe maybe

at times difficult : mix one Shushwap amongst a few dozen Kootenays,
or vice versa, and he may remain perhaps undetected ; but arrange twenty
Kootenays in a line facing twenty Shushwaps or twenty Stonies, and the
great difference that really exists between them will flash on the observer
in a moment, and if another Shushwap or a Kootenay happens to come
along he will unhesitatingly be assigned to his proper place. The writer
had no difficulty in picking out two Crees from a number of Blackfeet,
who were in a line opposite a number of Kootenays. The ensemble of the
Blackfeet was broken by the presence of these two Crees, and the convic-
tion that they were not Blackfeet came at once. Many of the mistaken
theories of Indian origins and of the exact resemblances of far distant
tribes may arise from the fact that the observer who relates his experi-
ences has never seen, say, a hundred individuals of each, tribe drawn up
in line opposite each other, and been able to get, as it were, a mental

composite photograph of each ethnic group. When twenty Chinamen

and twenty Kootenays are placed opposite each other in like manner, no

one would for a moment judge them to be the same, or even similar.
     The tables opposite contain measurements of forty Upper Kootenays,

forty- nine Lower Kootenays, four Kootenay Metis, eleven Kootenay-
white Metis, making a total of 104 individuals, of ages ranging from two
 to seventy years, and coming from all parts of the Kootenay country.

      The measurements were taken in a manner similar to that described
 by Dr. Boas in 'Report,' 1891, p. 425, and the indices calculated in like
manner. Very few females could be measured on account of the prejudices

 of the Indians.

     The measurements were as follows :

Height, standing.                  Distance from naso-frontal suture to
     ,, of acromion.                   chin (height of face).
    ,, ,, point of second finger.
                                   Distance from naso-frontal suture to
Finger-reach.                         between the lips (height of upper
                                       part of face).
Height, sitting.
                                   Width between zygomatic arches
Width between acromia.
Length of head.                        (width of face).
                                   Height of nose.
Breadtb of head.
                                   Width of nose.

     The length of the arm is obtained by subtracting the height of the
point of second finger from the height of the acromion. The weight,
which was obtainable in but few cases, is given to quarters of a pound,
from an excellent scale in the store of Mr. Galbraith.

    The ages, especially of the Upper Kootenays, may be relied upon as

being as nearly correct as possible, the margin of doubt being very small.

     The Kootenay seems to possess, therefore, a case-inflection in -s or -es, a plural             j
in ·ni'ntik, a collective in -Id ntik, a dual in -Jd'stik, a distributive in -M'ntik. The
following examples will serve as illustrations :

       D'2>Qane dqkinmi'tuhs shi'iikuts, the coyote sees the river.

      o'pwine iid'Hyu yd'tvos n-u'vs, he sees the fox down in the water.

       ipi'tlns ne'ls na'aanl-s, he kills (him) the caribou.
        Mna'ofi sld'nMts nutlQu'nc M'qhens, the coyote goes along, carrying the wolf.
       o'pQam ni'tltsiJis sM'sl, he sees the buffalo bull coming.
       Mna'Qe d'qldtlnv'hus, nu'pQCvne tlM'mvs ni'lixi d'mdk.t, a star is going along, [and]

               sees a little child eating dirt.

      dqhina' woks ItWvsa'kd'ne ku'tsutu, the chipmunk sits on the willows.

        ta'aas Mntld'tlte sld'nMits tld'utlds, the coyote struck the grizzly bear.

       nd'naldsQd,' vine ne tlhl'muld'stek, these two children go away.
      nu'p(iane yv' lul k'ci'psi tlhl'mrininte'kes, lie sees many children.
       M'ndM'sakd'tlhl nipi'kdni' ntik ? where are you gone, spirits?

      tinaofflmrie yu'ndk'd'psi tlM' muni'ntik, many children enter.

Combined with the possessive pronouns, nouns are declined as follows :

myk'dti'to,  father (father of man).  kdti'tond.'tla, our father.
                                      titvni'sketl, your father.
tito'nis, thy father.                 titui'sU, their father.

tito'is, his father.

    When declined with the possessive pronouns, some nouns sometimes lose one or

more of their prefixes, thus :

                                                        dqkltld'ndin, house.

                                      hlkftlu, my house.

                                                        d'qkitld'sM, his house.

     The word for ' horse ' presents some peculiarities. The Upper Kootenay form is
KdtlaQo,'Etltsin, the Lower Kootenay g-itlkWtlaQd'Edltsin, the latter being the more
primitive. The etymology is apparently ' elk-dog,' ' elk ' in Upper Kootenay being
gitnid'tle, and in Lower Kootenay gi'dllid'dle. In declension, however, the word for
' elk ' drops out entirely, and w,e have only Quntltsiii (dog) left. This does not always

occur, however.

                                                         horse, Kd'tland,'Etltsin..
                                                   our horse, hlQdBtUsinruVtla.

        OlS THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                    593

    The noun denoting the object possessed, or in the genitive, may precede or follow

the governing noun. Thus :

                 TVE'tah tite'is ko'tsatc, the frog, grandmother of the chipmunk.
                  gi'sin' yu'hvd titu'nis ? is that the hat of your father ?
                   ene sind aqko'tdtls, it is beaver grease.

                                              COMPOSITION.

    Some compound nouns are formed by the simple juxtaposition of two substantives,

thus
                           d'qldnkd'k-d ydktsu'metl (fire + canoe), steamboat.
                           k'tcitlml'yit natd'nili (night + sun), moon.

The qualifying noun precedes.
    In otlier cases the compound consists of radicals,* prefixes, and suffixes. For

example :
klhlntld'tltemu'tl (that with which striking is done), whip, from Mntld'tlte ' strike,'

       prefix ki-, instrumental suffix -motl.
uqhlnu'gtlu'tldm (its head is white), white-headed eagle, from xaAicdls nu'qtlu, white,

       tldm, head, and prefixes dq- and Ifi-.

                NOUN AND VERB.

     The following examples will serve to show the relation between the noun and

verb as regards matters of derivation :

Bark (of tree)  dqkitslcd'tl.

                Iwtstlutskdtlqu' nc , I take the bark off a tree.

Bread (baked in pan) Mnhu'ptce.

                hotcd' nkitjrtce'te, I bake bread.

Bridge          dqliO'kff.
Brush
                hu'tsitkO'Jiophi' ne, I make a bridge.

                MipW niMllid' motl.

Comb            liO'tsujyTi' omatlQo' ne, I brush.
                tcuk'tluirmnlydtl.

                Uvtcu'k'tldmd' mdli, I comb.

Heart           uqM'tlwl.

                h'uMthvl'ne, I think.

Peel            tlutliV Etimd'tl.

                hd'tlutld'timO'ne, I take the peel (rind) off (an apple).

 DIFFERENCES OF FORM IN NOUNS AVHEN USED INDEPENDENTLY,

                       AND WHEN IN COMPOSITION.

    One of the peculiarities of the Kootenay language is the existence of different
forms when the word is used in composition, and when it is used independently.

                     KEDUPLICATION AND ONOMATOPCEIA.

     Formations by reduplication and by onomatopceia seem to be very rare in Koote-
nay. But a few examples can be given :

d'Tidn       magpie.
k'vk-u'tlfl  blue-jay. (This imitative word, in various slightly differing forms, is

siiksuk         found in many Salishan dialects.)

pu'pu
put          rook.

             hammer of stone.

             cat.

     It is worthy of note that tlie word for ' cat ' is not reduplicated, as in the
Chinook jargon (pUsjnts).

                                             Personal Names.

    No name-feast appears to have existed amongst the Kootenays. The relatives
gathered together, and some old man or old woman bestowed a name (d'qkttlVyam)
upon the child ; often, however, the parents named their own child. Frequently tlie
child was given the name of his parent, and thus many names are now in existence,

the signification of which has been forgotten, but which have been hereditary in the

family for generations. The custom of dropping a word which resembled, or was
the same as, the name of a chief, &c., who had just died appears to have existed
amongst these Indians in the past, but the writer was unable to obtain any examples
of its application. The Indians are very loth to tell their names, and it is often
even difficult to get an Indian to name a particular individual who is pointed out to
him. Many of the Kootenays now use their 'mission names,' to the exclusion of

their real Indian ones.

     The following examples of Kootenay personal names may prove of interest :
     Upper Kootenays: Guivi'tlkii, KiVhen (Big Wolf); K'ka'tlsilEii Ma.'iyuk (Three
Weasels); Guwi'tlktlh (Big Horn Sheep); Jl/S/i' (Bone); Ktsa' ETvtld'Em (^Caily

Head).
     Lower Kootenays : ^LVh/uk M'dlh) (Weasel Iron) ; Nu'liT; (Stone) ; Ni'dlko Dli'sin

(Iron Paddle); Su'k'nipS'k-u, (Good Spirit): KiVdhanukma' Btm (Three Bird-tails);
DJiiQu'm'ni (Pismire) : KdmU'Moano'ds (Yellow Star).

     Children are often called after their parents : thus, Ku'mu Na'na (Little Ko'mo) ;
 Oia'tld. Na'na (Little Swallow), until coming of age, when they assume other names.

    An Indian may have several names referring to personal peculiarities, deeds

accomplished, and the like. One old fellow, called Patrick, had more than twenty
names. The writer was able to obtain only ten of these, as follows :

                  1. Gdnhl'tlfimmd'tlaJt. His head is hurt.

               2. Gd'tldnQd'nltu. He carries trees.
               3. Gdn'u'ktlTitla'Qa. He has hair on his chin.
                4. Gdiiu' qtlotlHtla' Qa. He has a white beard.
                5. Giyu'ndtld'M. He has many pockets.
                6. Kv'psltHluni'tlctl. He is feared by all.
                7. G'd'hltli'sdli. He has no long braid of hair.
                8. Gd' tlEmd'kastld' skdli. He has big nostrils.
                9. KKind'tWt. He turns in his toes when walking.
              10. Gd'tldgn-a'ctniydu'wc. He has little food, and is very angry.

      Following are a few names of females : Gd'k'tse, TUkltest, KKpaJiM, Tlditltul'tlok-

mit, Ktsu'Mn.

     Some of the names given by the Indians to white men are interesting : Ski'nMts
(Coyote), Kd'kutshd'iyu'knvl (Bad Hat), Kdhd' qtliqltV nnuli (the man who takes out
his eye, i.e., who has a glass eye), KdliTi' mltdli (blind of one eye), Kdnv'qtlTih (bald).

     The name given to the writer by the Upper Kootenays was KlM'ndJd'nhdnd'
 lunn/V inig, which was said to mean, 'he uses the long stick,' in reference to his

 anthropological measurements.

                     Place-names.

The Rocky Mountains, the Columbia River, the Kootenay Lake, are usually called

by the Indians: Aqlui'Mutld'et, AqMnmi'tnlu .Vqhu'liEniik,vf\\\ch mean simply 'moun-

tains,' ' river,' ' lake ' respectively. The two Columbia Lakes (Upper and Lower) are

\vi\ovin a,s Aqld'sltBnuk ( = two lakes near each other ?), the Kootenay River, ^./to/;-

fld.'Qdtl. Other names of interest are : Ainsworth (B.C.) Aqli'niJ'htlc'H na'na (Little

Plain), Barnard (B.C.) AqM'noh, Bonner's Ferry (Idaho) Td'ltTtkrvd' ska or Aqho'h-

jmiimitn'kQo, Fort Steele (B C.) Jl '(^ /''«/«. Cranbrook {B.C.) A'qkMrfd'ktleet, Kicking

Horse River, A'qldnu'lctluli, Sand Point (Idaho) Kdmdnku'luJtl.

The Kootenays call their country Ki'tuiid'aa dmd'kis (the Kootenays' land). The
DWLower Kootenays call the United States
                                           nr (the other side) or Bo'stEn dmd'kis

(country of the Americans), Canada being denominated Kindjdfo dmd'kis (the coun-

try of the British), the two words Bo'stEii and Kindjdtc having been adopted from

the Chinook jargon.

                     Seasons, Months, &c.

The names of the seasons are as follows :

Spring.  Tlv'mdiyH. ' When the snow leaves.' Also tldtlVttlo (no more snow).
         Gdlmi'kit. ' When things are getting warm.' Also tlumd'iydt nd'mu.
Summer.  K'tcfipnd'krif. 'When the leaves, &c., fall.'
Autumn.  Wd'mifnd'mu. ' When snow and rain come.'

Winter.

(January ?) may count for two. The word now used for month is natd'nik (moon)

    The days of the week, introduced by the missionaries, are known as follows in
Upper Kootenay :

-me'yet.

    The name for a clock is natd'nik (sun), and a watch is natd'nik na'na (little sun).

                                                       Adjectives,

     Adjectives usually precede the noun ; the exceptions, such as the words for
' male, female ' (not always), ' small ' (the adjective na'na always), to this rule are

few. The adjectives may be classed as follows :

     1. Disjunctive adjectives, which cannot properly be regarded as mere affixes ; as,
liE'shu (male), na'na (small), Ud'ye (all), &c. Examples :

                                                     Qd'Etltsin kr.'skv, dog.
                                                        Qd'stltsin stv'kndtl, bitch.
                                                  Vd'j>e a'mdk, all the earth.
                                                      td'mii na'na, revolver.

598 REPORT-- 1892.

--2. Those used with the verbals -nc, -ine, -Jid'nc

mansfi'kine ti'tk'ut, the                                                                                                        is good,

wi'tllul'm, he is large, tall.

si'qine, he is fat.

yv'nuM'nc timl'mv, there is plenty of grease.

iva'qhic, ii is tliick.

Ki'tltldiul'mnc, he has many houses.

3. Those used with the prefix gu- (gu-), and with or without a suffix :

                          gun-i'tllid ndm'liwen, a big chief.
                          gumi'tlhl WE'tdk, a big frog.
                         guwi'tUfuwdt, mule (lit. ' big-eared ').
                          gu/vo'ko/iiiii'tuk, a long river.
                         gumi'tlktle, mountain sheep (lit. ' big horn ').

4. Compound adjectives :

                             team na'na, few (cp. tmmu'ketl, ' very ').

                                   k'jm'ktsl na'na, thin.
                                   go'lio na'na, short.

                           »a'nitlqo"ne, sick (lit. ' bad-bodied he is ').

     6. Adjectives of colour. These appear to be mostly compounds, and to contain
a separable prefix, kl-, or kdm- (Jidm-). Thus :

Mmnu'qtlu, white. A'qkinuqtlv/tldm,, white-headed eagle. Perhaps the radical is

    tlu (snow).
Itii'mkoh-o'lwtl, black.
hamfi'qtse, yellow.

                               lid'mholvb'Mtl, negro.
                              Mmd'hos, species of dragon-fly with reddish body.

     As far as ascertained at present, diminutives proper do not appear to exist in
Kootenay. Their place is taken--

--1. By special words :

                         dqldu, a bear one year old.
                         d.'qldnku'mdtl, calf.
                         tlM'mv, little child.

2. By nouns followed by the adjective na'na, small, young :

tla'utld, grizzly ; tld'utld na'na, little (young) grizzly.

ydktsd' metl, canoe                                                                                   yalvtsu'mUl na'na, small model                  of a canoe.
                                                                                                   ;

womantiavi'te,  ;        ndu'te na'na, girl.

tlo, awl ; tlu na'na, needle.

gwvi'tltldm na'na, little big-head (bird, spec. ?).

Kv'mu (personal name)                                                                                                            Jiu'mu na'na, young  Ko'mo.
                                                                                                                              ;

gas na'na, the young of the fish called ij)dt pus na'na, kitten, ikc.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

     Although Qd'Etltsin na'na, and k'd'tlaQd'jstltsin na'na are in use, the ordinary
word, both for 'pup' and for ' colt,' appears to be tei'tE 7ia'na, evidently a compound
                             --,

ON TUE NORTU-WE:>TERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                           599

with na'na. For ' colt ' the word mi'staku'dUl (in which k-a'dla = horse) is colloquial
amongst the young men of the Lower Kootenays.

    Diminutives form their plural and dual as nouns. E.g. :--

                                         ndii'te na'iia ki'stik, two girls.
                                           nau'te na'na ki'ntik, girls.

     In certain cases the letter n-, or g- (Ji-), is prefixed to the numerals ; the reason
for this is not known. Thus :

                                 fjuhi-r iiatd'nilt na'na, one o'clock.
                                QutlQu'iw aqksa'kes ku'hves, he carries one leg.
                               nilsite Hi'pine, two are dead.
                                   ne'tt'Dvu'ne ni'tlko, ten dollars.

    Regarding the numeral system of the Kootenays, the following remarks may be

made. The words for three, four, six, contain a suffix -sa {^-su). Four and eight axe
clearly related, the latter being possibly the second lour. In the decades a suflfix
·wo (-n-u) is found, which makes it appear that ' twenty,' a'iwo, is ' two tens.*
This is confirmed by the fact that a word ai {ai) = ' two ' does really exist, though

--only in certain phrases and compositions. E.g.

            Mima'hrvut, two years ; nuHman mitn'kine, there are two rivers, &c.

     In certain locutions : two rivers running into each other, two trees, mountains,
side by side; two sticks, and especially when speaking of two plates, cups, pails,
---- -- -- --                                               --

forks, boxes, ice, set one within the other, or of two pairs of breeches, two coats,
hats, &c., worn one over the other, ai {di) is used. Examples :

         na'iman mitii'kinc. There are two rivers.

         ,, M'xne.                       ,, ,, ,, sticks.

         ,, itsQld'Eiie.                 ,,,,  ,, trees.

         ka'iman li-u'nun. Two teeth.

         na'imatli'ldnc. There are two tracks in the snow.

         na'imanQu'me. Two logs lying side by side.

The ordinal numerals are :               Ordinals.

               v'smiJi ; u'smek, first.           ithia'haJt ; iM'iyah-d'wusa'ae, third.
              Mso'sd'tl, second.                   a'nitlnd'hali, fourth.

     These ordinals take the inflectional -s like adverbs.
     The words for ' third ' and ' fourth ' are closely related to Ulltd'hali, ' far, at a

distance.'

     Above ' fourth,' and sometimes for all above ' one,' the cardinals are apparently in

nse.

                         PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

The disjunctive pronouns are :

kd'niin, I.                                                 ka'mind' tld, we.
                                                            ni'nM'niskc'tl, you.
ni'nM, thou.                                                ninkoi'sis, they.

ni'nlio'is, he, she.

7ie = he.

    The word for ' he ' looks like a genitive of ni'nku, ' thou.'
     These pronouns are used where the verb is not expressed, in answer to questions,

&c. ; e.g. :

      ta'aas ni'nko ! you [have said] enough I
       kake'ne i'ntldk ' b'smik kd'min: Says the chicken-hawk, ' I [will go] first.'
      Mdts kd'min ! Not I !

The pronoun nr, in the objective case form ni'is, is very frequently used as the
                --: --                      -- --: :

                ON THE NORTH-WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                 601

object, or as the complementary object, of verbs, where the incorporated pronoun
does not occur ; thus :

                       ipi'tlne ne'is thVntlas. He kills him the grizzly.
                       ipi'tlnd nS'is na'aanus. He kills him. the caribou.

The subject pronouns used with verbs are :             =ho . . . 7iatld'(ne') -vr&.

          =ho . . . we I.                             -- =hin . . . nishe' tine yon..
                                                           ... we = they.
     --hin . . . «e = thou.
               ... =716' he,

  --It is interesting to note that, in the past and future tenses of the verb, the first

personal pronoun seems to be gu- (Jtii), e.g. :

                                gutsQd'tlij?, ' I will kill ; md'Mdstld'ketl, ' I loved.'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         '

    The incorporative forms of the personal pronouns as objects have been given by
Dr. Boas (' Report,' 1889), and the examples given below in treating of the verb will

suffice to illustrate their use.

                                  ADVEEBS.

The position of adverbs in the sentence varies, as the following examples show :

 Pi'hahs i'pine kd'md. Long ago my mother died.
 O'paane dll'nis 7ia'Qanes. He sees the caribou on the other side.
 Ta'cias tcina'Qd tvVtlnann. He went off early in the morning.

 KaM'ne shi'nMts : 'u'smihlia'min.' Said the coyote : ' I [will go] first.'
 Klt'dnmV yit wVtlndm MM'tlne ti'tlndmu'is sld'nMlts. The next day early the

         coyote spoke to his wife.
 Kana'QB ski'nMts o' smelts. The coyote goes first.

    Adverbs may or may not take the inflectional suffix -s. One can say, for example,

pi'hdk Valine kd'md oi jii'kaks i'j)ine kd'md. The exact rule for the use of this suffix is
not apparent.

I. Time :                                             tld'a, outside.

      Pe'Mk or fJi'Mk, long ago.                      na'Etd, high, up.

                                  Negation.

     There are two disjunctive adverbs of negation, md'ets (or mats) and wa'aa. The
distinction between them seems to be this : wa'Qd is equivalent to the English ' no, not
that ; that is not right ; don't do tliat ; while vid'sts is used with pronouns and verbs

                                                                                                                                                                                                       '

in tlie imperative, and also in cases where a contradiction and a correction is intended.
Following are examples :

     Md'ts kd'min! Not I ! (i.e., someone else may do it).
      Md'Etsithi'nin! Do not do it 1

       Md'Ets lilo'ne, tlo'ne. Not hlu'ne but tlo'ne.
       Tcin nitllid md'sts uqTtukjJu'u. The iron [barrel of the gun] not the stock.
       Kinu'was ? wa'Qd. Are you hungry ? No.
       Kdlie'ne tld' utld : 'iva'Qd!' 8aid the grizzly bear : ' Don't do that 1
       Kdlce'm i'nthlk : ' D'smik kd'min.' Kdhe'nc ald'nMts : ' iva'qd.' Said the chicken-

            hawk : ' I [will go] first.' Said the coyote : ' No.'

     In conjugation and word formation the negative particles k'd, 'not,' and tUt,
' without,' 'deprived of,' are employed. They are sometimes prefixes and at other
times infixes. Examples :

K-di'nB si'nd. It is not beaver.                 ho'hdi'ltine. I do not eat.
Ito'Tfdd'paa/m. I do not see.
                                                 myha'k-di'sinetld'ne. It is not  house.

             hdtU'ttdwu'te. I have no gun.

             Iwfli'stu dqktcd'mdtl. I have no knife.

             tli'ttlHl, blind (-tletl = eyes).
             tli'ttldtli'tit, unmarried man (tldtli'tit = married man).
             tlittsE'md'kd"ne, it is light {tsE'mdlid'nB = it is strong).

The radical tlit is seen in tli'tliKm ' worthless.'

There is still another particle, tlb (probably = ' none left ') used as follows :

ilu'iie ni'tlko. There is no money.              tlo'ne Ha'psin. Nothing.
tlo'ne. There is no ... .                        tlo Vd'i)sm. Nothing.

tlo'sl,  ,,

                                                     Conjunctions.

    Few conjunctions have as yet been determined. The equivalents of some English

conjunctions are :

     ^'j'/i!, and, more. Kd'min d'qM ni'nko. I and you. A' qld ni'nko. Yo\x too. 'And'
in the numerals is expressed by tld ; etu'wotldo'k7v5 (ten and one), eleven.

    K'd'jjsin, why. Kdo'pQane h'd'jysin tsi'tlep. He does not know why she is dead.

     Pd'tlh, because. Pd'tlk'si'tlep. Because he was dead.
     Nd'pet, if. Nd'iiet Mntsi'ndm. If you go.

                                  Interjections.

ABut little was learnt regarding these words.     few are real interjections ; the

rest are parts of speech used interjectionally.

Ud'E ! hd'E = aha I (expression of surprise.)
(( / = Get out of the way (used to dogs). For human beings tlu'nu ! (go away !)

       is employed.

d'hd he'l ! Ah, that is good ! I like that.

ha'i I ! That is not good I I don't like that.
hd'l yu ! Hallo 1 That's strange !
[lohu I Hurry up I (from English ?)
iim'Mk I Hold on 1 Not so fast 1
Ta'aas ! Stop I Enough I

                                                  VERBS.

                                         The Veeb ' To Be.'

    The duties of the substantive verb appear to be performed to some extent by
Ine, -ine (-«e). Thus :
-- -- --! : :                                                                          --

                    ON THE NORTH-WESTKRN TRIBES OF CANADA.                                 603^

JIuiii'ne Ki'twia'aa = I am a Kootenay.
Kalii'nh 'IwnVm ski'nkfds' = he says ' I am the coyote.'

I'/w si'nd uqlw' tails =11 is beaver-grease.

Nl'nii sfiyd'jn = he is a white man.
TlakaVnsl sJd'nkvts H'tlnamu'is g'il'stet = the coyote is not the wife of the trout.
=iXi'nu ti'tlnamo'is g'u'stet it is the wife of the trout.

    Often no verb or suffix is employed, as ku'min ski'nkfits = l am the coyote.

  --This me, -inc (-Me) seems to be the same as the suffix -Inc, -ne, -m, found in adjec-

tives and some intransitive verbs, e.g.

svM'iii = it is good.                                          i'pine = he is dead.
=si'qi7il it is fat.                                           wa'qine = it is thick.

                                   The Yeeb ' To Have.'

The verb 'have ' appears in some cases to be expressed by the suffix -<g ;

                      ho'ie'M'ta Fa'tlaQa'jstltsin = I have five horses.
                       Mnash-a'tlte = I have two children.
                    =huiid'te dqltu'tdtls l have an axe.
                      hD'yilnd'te nil'mus = I have many beads.
                       Mtli'tdn-u'te = I have no gun.

                             Past Tense.

     The tense-sign for past time is md-.  The following examples will serve to indicate

it!< use :                                             mdkl'ej) = he died.
                                                       mdktsekutl = he drank.
         md'kutstld'kStl = I loved him.
        md'kod'^aanis = I saw you.

                                               FUTXTRE TeKSE.

--The future tense-sign is Qdtl

hd'tsQdtU'kine = I shall eat.                 tSQd'tlnma' aS = it will go.
                                              hOtSQd'tli'ne =1 sh&H he . . .
=ku'tsQdtli'pitl 1 shall kill.                gu'tsadtlMMtl = I shall telL

tSQdtli'2ntl = he will kill.
hoisad'tleku'tlnS = 1 shall drink.

The desiderative coincides with the future :

tSQd'tldna'Qe = he wants to hunt.          =Jio'tsadtli'Une I want to eat.
khitiiQd'tWt = do you want to eat ?        k'tsd'tli'taa = he wants to bite.

                                     Imperative.

    In this mood, as is the case in many languages, the radical of the verb is easily-

seen. The following examples will suffice :

i'ke{n) = eat thou !                          =j?i.iki'7w let go !
                                              tcelid'to = look 1
owb'ken = get up 1                            hd'mdti'ktcu = give !
                                              tld i'tQunu = hite me again I
tcekd'tcn = take care 1                       isd'kindn = sit down I
                                              =i'Mtl eB.t ye I
ska' kin = give me !                          nu'pkctl = sleep ye !
                                              kdmne'kiitl = sleep ye I
itki'nin = do it                              tsind'ketl = hurry up I

mats unl'tlin -- don't be afraid I

k'ko'mne{n') = sleep thou 1

tld'ne  --          come  !
                 ·

tlu'nu = go away !

     There appear to be several endings for the imperative, but the chief are -l, -en, -o-
for the singular, and -HI for the plural.

604 KEPOET-- 1892.

                                                   iNTEEEOGATIVE.

    The interrogative form of the verb is made up of the particle Mn (you) and the

radical of the verb, with tense-signs :

                         hineh ? = do you eat 1
                         kintsQci'tlck ? = do you want to eat ? Will you eat ?
                         IdnliuItVul 1 = do you think ?

                     Mn akOwitl ? = do j'ou dance
                     Mn e'tla ? = do you cry ?

                         Mntsi'tQa'ndj)l' = 'wonl(\ you bite me?

                     Mn I'ne Ki'tunWoa ? = are you a Kootenay 1

     The inflection of the voice, as in English, indicates that a question is being asked,
thus :

                              I'ne si'nd =aqli'u'tdtls ? \s it beaver-grease ?
                               I'ne Pol a'qkltld'is? = \s, it Paul's house?

                                                     Negative.

    With verbs in the imperative the negative vidts is used :

                                      mats itM'nin ! = don't do that I
                                    mats i'M-tl = don't eat 1

     The particle Tfa is prefixed to the third person of the verb in the indicative mood,
and inserted between the personal pronoun and verb in the other persons. Thus :

                        ]f& i'ne si'nd = it is not beaver.
                         Jed o'jjQane sM'nMts = he does not see the coyote.
                        k'd tdqd"na = \t is not raining much.
                       ho'kdO'pQane = I do not see.
                         hokd'wasQu'mek = I do not sing.

    INCORPOKATION OF OBJECT.

   A peculiarity of Kootenay is the incorporation of noun-objects in the verb, thus :

hotstlu'tsk-dtlQu'nS -- 1 take the bark ofE a tree (hsii]s. = dqMtskd'tl).

go'tsuMvd'tldmM'nmiih^l smooth down my hair with my hands {dqhd'tldmo'hM.Y).

hd'k'drm'mdtl -- to cut open the belly {dqlw'wum = belly).
tlu'Ti'tsdtld'ine = he cuts o£E end of nose (d'qMnuk'tsd'tld = end of nose).

goKd'ntlih=l move my foot about (d'q?itlik = toot).
nd'tltldmM'ne = he takes [carries] the head in his hand.

mdnku'tldmM'ne = he shakes the head in his hand.

     Following are examples of the incorporation of the object pronoun in the verb :

Mtsi'taani'sine = I bite you (liu-ts-itQa-n-is-i-ne). Eadical is i'taa, ' bite.'
                                      / hite you

hutSQdtlk'd'ntldtli'sine = I will strike  you  (jM-ts-Qdtl-Ti'dntldtl-is-i-ne).         Radical is

    hdntldtl, ' strike.'                       I strike you

nH'pQond'pine = he sees me (^n-fipaa-n-dp-i-ne). Radical is u'jxia, ' see.'
                                            see me

hdnu'paani'sine =·= I see thee (Jw-n-upaa-n-is-i-ne'). Radical is u'paa, ' see.'

                                                 PREFIXES.

The  prefixes    7i-  and               (Jtr-),  perhaps  the  same  as  those  appearing  in  the         numerals,
                                   ff-

are found with certain forms of the verb. In others they do not appear. Their

siijnilication is not known. The following examples will illustrate their use :

     Pi'MJiS i'pinS M'ma. Long ago my mother died.
     Ta'aas n-a'sne n-i'pim thtutlils. Two grizzly bears died.

     Sld'nMds ipi'tlm ne'is Ji'u'pis. The coyote kills him the owl.

     KaWnS hunipi'tlne ku'pl. He says [said] ' I kill [killed] the owl.'

    This n- appears in the third person singular of very many verbs, and also in the

first person singular. Examples of the prefix k- (ff-) as compared with n-, and the
verb without prefix are

            ff-O'ku skumo, month of July (lit. ' when the service-berries ripen ').

               n-v7iu'inV. dqM'Dktle'et, the berries are ripe.

                giitWlttUu old {senex).

              mitlil'liim, he is old, an old man.
                U'tE7iu'stih, to paint the face.

           huni'tMm'stik, I paint my face.

               nu'uwa'ne, he barks.
                M'wii sJn'nhlts, the coyote barks.

      Other prefixes are s-, k-, y-, as exemplified in the following :

    Juinka'mek sJcinJifits, the coyote sits on his haunches.

   yanJi-il'men, sit down !

    M'tsank-a'vieli, I sit down.
   hVusaM'ne i'ntUlk aqlu ti'thulmu'is, the chicken-hawk and his wife are there.

language has progi-essed further. The following examples, however, may be given :

HeKa'tlul'ne k'tSQiltli'pitl ski' n7i fits.               thinks to kill the coyote.

Ka'tlm'ne tsaatli'pitla'ps. He thinks to kill me.
Eosa'Utlkd'kinT: nV hOka'ep. I am very glad that I am not dead.
K-a'upQane kd'psins tsi'tlc.p. He does not see why he is dead.
Katlul'rifi hotli'ldmUl aqkdktU-'tles fki'nkuts jJMlk'si'tlep. He thinks : I will eat the

eyes of the coyote because he is dead.

Ka'tlul'ne ke'ep's. He thinks she is dead.

An infinitive or perhaps a participial form in -si [-«('] seems to be indicated in

the following :

Hotl/pa'tlne Kv'pin tatlu'hl tliVne. I hear the owl saying ' come.'
AKuna'ae a'qkitliiu'hus, mVpaand tlktl'mfis ni'ltsi a' muks.
                                                                                star comes along [and]

   sees a child eating dirt.

O'pnane shl'si tWutlas. He sees the grizzly bear coming.
O'pctane ni'tUsikx shl'se. He sees the buffalo bull coming.
O'paane tUpsha'sd pdptl'is. He sees his grandmother coming.

Occasionally a form in -sin occurs :                           lie sees the wolf coming.
                    O'paanS ska'sln ka'qh'-ns.
                                        --

--(506
                                        BEPORT 1892.

     These forms in -si [-«e] may, however, be dependent forms of the indicative.

    The following show another verbal form :--

           Kake'ne ta'psin gotWthin. He says : what shall I do ?
           K'ao'paane Ifd'pnns tli'tkin. He does not see (know) what to do.

     Following are examples of the verb in the most indefinite form, corresponding
jjcrhaps to a verbal noun or an infinitive :

    It will be observed that many of the radicals, e.g., I (to be), d (to rub), a (to go),
ij) (to die), it (to do), We (to speak), are monosyllabic, and it is possible that many <>f
the other and dissyllabic radicals, such as u'pqa (to see), utlpatl (to hear), dmdts (to

laugh), dwuh (to rise), unitl (to be afraid), omits (to break), uwas (to be hungry), uliu,

(to be ripe), uth (to be warm), otluq (to be tired), omas (to be diy), &c., may be com-
pounds, i'he occurrence of the o- in so many of these radicals is worth notice.

     As will be seen from the following list, the suffixes which express the idea of per-
forming an action with a certain portion of the body have nothing etymologically to
do with the name of that member :

    The above list of words is not arranged according to any known principle, but

merely to illustrate the variety of compositions with dq- in Kootenay.
      It is evident that -k, -ke-, -kin-, -ko-, -kits-, (Ji)itl-, &c., are qualifying affixes,

but at present it is impossible to state with certainty their several meanings. In
the last group of words in the first column there is the idea of 'tree, branch,' at the
bottom of most of them, and in the case of ' star ' and ' sky ' a correlation is certain.
But of the rest of the list nothing can be stated with certainty.

     However, d'qkinfi'tldm, ' snake,' and dqku'tldm, ' eel,' seem related, as perhaps are
also the words for ' belly,' ' cricket,' ' fly.'

     It might be mentioned that several words have more than one form, thus :

             tree = d'qkitstld'in ; d'qkinitstld'in.
             head = dqktldm ; dqku'tlain.
             cloud = dqkdtl ; d'qkinlvd'tldk.
             sand = d'qkinko'tl ; d'qkhikuko'tl.

             name = d'qkltll'ydm ; d'qkutWyam.

    On another occasion the writer may be able to further discuss this interesting

feature of the Kootenay language.

     The suffix -motl is a very important one, and is combined with other particles,
which have the function of further specialising the instrument. The following list

         The following list of derivatives from one radical will serve to show the power of
    word-formation which the language possesses, and the distinction which it is able to
   make between somewhat similar objects, while considering them all at bottom from
   the same fundamental root :

                                   From radical k'tcok or k'tsuk, to pierce :

                                                         auger, k'tcuktld'ink'u'mvtl.

                                                              fork, Ktcfi' ku' ne' motl.

                  DIALECTIC DIFFERENCES.

     It can scarcely be said that there are two well-marked Kootenay 'dialects.'
Considered in the light of the fact that the entire grammar of the two tribes is the
same, such differences as do exist between the speech of the Upper and that of the

Lower Kootenays might better be termed ' provincialisms.'
     The peculiarities of the Lower Kootenay language as compared with the Upper

Kootenay are as follows :

  --I. Phonetics. The Lower Kootenays speak more rapidly and have a tendency to

syncopate words, which retain a purer form amongst the Upper Kootenays. This is
seen in the words for coat, leggings, skunk. In some cases monosyllables with long
vowels are produced by the contraction of dissyllables, e.g., tds = ta'Qas (enough).
Certain vowel-substitutions are made. Thus, in all the Lower Kootenay words in
which the suffix -niu'yit of the Upper Kootenay appears, it is uniformly pronounced
-mOiiit or -tim'yit. This -mu'yit is, however, occasionally heard amongst the Upper
Kootenays. Another case of vowel difference is Upper Kootenay o/^tZ'i = Lower

Kootenay ipd't (white fish).
    The tl (explosive I) of the Upper Kootenays is represented always in Lower

Kootenay by dl (palatal-dorso-apical ; see ' Report,' 1889, p. 802). Thus :--

Upper Kootenay.   Lower Kootenay.              English.

       tle'ne            dlv'ne           across
      oni'tlne            dni'dlne        afraid (he is)
      gu'tlwd             gii'dlwd        apple
      aqk-u'tldk         uqko'dldk        beef
      nnse'ydtl           n-ise'yddl      sweat-house

--612 EEPOKT 1892.

    When tlie Lower Kootenay half-breeds speak Indiati, they tend to make this dl a
simple I. English half-breeds of the Upper Kootenay tend to make it kl, as do most

Europeans trying to speak Kootenay.

  --II. Grammar. The grammatical differences are few indeed. The persistence of

the suffix -ndmi in tiWu'tEndm (man) and padlM-'num (woman) is worthy of note.
The suffixes -taiya in Qdstaiya (skunk), and -ndk in viii sM' ksnuk do not appear in
these words in Upper Kootenay. In Upper Kootenay ' to do ' is Idthi'nitl, in Lower
Kootenay Idti'dlmddlM' nidi, and the insertion of -idlmddl- continues throughout the
conjugation of this verb in Lower Kootenay speech.

   --III. Vocahulary. Some difference is caused by names of things which are not

found in the Upper Kootenay region, trees, birds, and the like. There are, however,
a number of words, e.g., blanhct, fish, glove, goose, mallard, many, partridge, plate, sit
down, silk, sleep, swallow, which in Upper and Lower Kootenay are derived from two
distinct roots, having no relation whatever to each other. Thus :

         English

   blanket (my)

     fish

    glove
    great

     The two tribes of the Kootenays, Upper and Lower, converse with each other
with apparent ease, as each knows by heart most of the expressions which are differ-
ent in the speech of each. Those Upper Kootenays who never visit the Lower
Kootenay territory are very ignorant regarding this dialectic difference.

     The result of our linguistic investigation has been to fix the place of the Kootenay
thus :

         Ki'tona'QE, or Kootenay. An independent linguistic stock, with two dialects,

               differing slightly in phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary :

                                                 A. Upper Kootenay.
                                               B. Lower Kootenay.

                        KOOTENAY JAEGON.

    As usually happens where intercourse with the whites takes place, a jargon has
sprung up, although its development has been hindered by the use of the wide-
spread Chinook. Many of those who speak this ' Kootenay jargon ' imagine they

are acquainted with the real aboriginal tongue ; but it consists, in fact, of Kootenay
words changed in form and sound to conform to English grammar and phonetics.

A few examples will suffice to indicate its general character :

       Jargon                  English            Kootenay

Tub' tlaha' loin        horse                k'dtlaQd' Etltsin.

    By means of this jargon, which consists of a Kootenay vocabulary mutilated to
suit European ideas of phonology and grammar, a number of the settlers manage to

get along with the Indians, and to obtain a reputation for speaking the Kootenay

language.

                        SLANG.

    Amongst the young men of the Lower Kootenaj's a number of slang words are

used, such as

                                              k'u'dld or He' did = horse.
                                          7ui'stak'E'dla = colt.

                 PUNNING AND WORD-DISTOETION.

     The Kootenay Indians are certainly acquainted with the art of punning, and the
Indian A'mElu took great delight in repeating over and over again the distortions of
certain words. Following examples will show the nature of these puns :

The Indians are very much amused at the mistakes made by whites in trjdng to

Alearn their language, and laugh long and heartily at their expense.   few of these

errors which came under the writer's notice might be chronicled here.

the Indians of fdnk'uts, ' grouse,' and set them in a roar of laughter. The same

                    SHUSHWAPS. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS.

    The measurements of the three females here recorded were made at the mission of
St. Eugene, where they were attending the mission school. The measurements of the
Shushwap Antoine were made at the penitentiary of New Westminster, B.C., by Dr.
F. Boas, and were kindly placed at the writer's disposal by him. From so few cases
nothing absolute can be determined. The stature of the women resembles that of
the Kootenay women, and the cephalic indices of the three individuals are practically
identical 84 (or 82 on the skull), the index of the male being 82-9 (or 80-9 on the

skull), all being brachycephalic. These data go towards strengthening the view
that the Shushwaps resemble the coast tribes {sec ' Reijort,' 1890, p. 632). The
females belong to the colony of Shushwaps on the Columbia, within the Kootenay
country.

northern India, from the Bay of Bengal to the frontiers of Afghanistan.

     The cost of this important work has been defrayed by the Indian
Government, and the ' OfBcial Edition,' from which this report has been

compiled, has been circulated for criticism.

     Through the agency of the district officers, supplemented by a good

deal of personal inquiry and correspondence, Mr. fiisley was enabled to

secure the services of 190 correspondents scattered over every district

of Bengal, and communicating in their turn with an indefinite number
of representatives of the tribes and castes which formed the subjects of

inquiry.

     The measurements were taken almost entirely by three Indian gentle-

-- --men two Hindoos and one Mahomedan who had been instructed by

Mr. Risley himself in the use of the instruments. The following obser-

vations were recorded: (1) Name of subject; (2) district of birth; (3)

in grammes; (17) facial angle. The data thus obtained enable us to

distinguish three types, called, by Mr. Risley, Aryan, Dravidian, and

Mongoloid.

     The Aryan type, as we find it in India at the present day, is marked

by a relatively long (dolichocephalic) head ; a straight, finely cut (lepto-

rhine) nose ; a long, symmetrically nai'row face ; a well-developed fore-
head, regular features, and a high facial angle. The stature is fairly

high, ranging from 1,716 millimetres in the Sikhs of the Panjab to

1,656 in the Brahmans of Bengal; and the general build of the figure
is well-proportioned and slender rather than massive.

     In the Dravidian type the form of the head usually inclines to be
dolichocephalic, but all other characters present a marked contrast to

the Aryan. The nose is thick and broad, and its index is higher than

in any known race except the Negro. The facial angle is comparatively

low ; the lips are thick ; the face wide and fleshy ; the features coarse
and irregular. The average stature ranges from 1,562 to 1,621 milli-

metres the figure is squat and the limbs sturdy.
                                      ;
    The Mongoloid type, which in some respects may be looked upon as

intermediate between these two, while in other, and perhaps the most

important, points it can hardly be deemed Indian at all, is found along

the northern and eastern borders of Bengal. Its most prominent charac-

ters are a relatively                                                                                     short  (brachycephalic)                                                                       head                              a broad face ;                        a short,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

wide nose, very low in the bridge, and in extreme cases almost bridgeless ;

high and projecting cheekbones, and eyelids peculiarly formed so as to

give the impression that the eyes are obliquely set in the head.

    By applying to the entire series the nasal index, which Professors

Flower and Topinard agree in regarding as the best of race distinctions,

some remarkable results are arrived at. The average nasal proportions

of the Male Paharia, one of the most characteristic of the Dravidian

tribes, are expressed by the figure 94*5, while the pastoral Gujars of the

Panjab have an index of 66'9, the Sikhs of 68'8, and the Bengal Brah-

mans and Kayasths of 70'4. In other words, the typical Dravidian, as

represented by the Male Paharia, has a nose as broad in proportion to
                                                                         ON THE NATIVES OF INDIA.                                                          617

its length as the Negro, while this feature in the Aryan group can fairly
bear comparison with the noses of sixty -eight Parisians, measured by
Topinard, which gave an average of 69-4. Even niore striking is the
curiously close correspondence between the gradations of racial type

indicated by the nasal index and certain of the social data ascertained
by independent inquiry. If we take a series of castes in Bengal, Behar,
or the North-Western Provinces, and arrange them in the order of the

average nasal index, so that the caste with the finest nose shall be at
the top, and that with the coarsest at the bottom of the Hst, it will be

found that this order substantially corresponds with the accepted order
of social precedence. The casteless tribes, Kols, Korwas, Mundas, and

the like, who have not yet entered the Brahmanical system, occupy the
lowest place in both series. Then come the vermin-eating Musahars and
the leather-dressing Chamars. The fisher castes of Bauri, Bind, and

Kewat are a trifle higher in the scale; the pastoral Goala, the culti-
vating Kurmi, and a group of cognate castes from whose hands a Brahman
may lake water follow in due order, and from them we pass to the
ti-ading Khatris, the land-holding Babhans, and the upper crust of Hindu
society. Thus, it is scarcely a paradox to lay down as a law of the caste

organisation in Eastern India that a man's social status varies in inverse

ratio to the width of his nose. Nor is this the only point in which the

-- --two sets of observations the social and the physical bear out and illus-

trate each other. The character of the curious matrimonial groupings
for which the late Mr. J. P. McLennan devised the happy term ' exoga-

raous ' also varies in a definite relation to the gradations of physical type.

Within a certain range of nasal proportions, these subdivisions are based
almost exclusively on the totem. Along with a somewhat finer form of

nose, groups called after villages and larger territorial areas, or bearing
the name of certain tribal or communal officials, begin to appear, and

above these, again, we reach the eponymous saints and heroes, who in

India, as in Greece and Rome, are associated with a certain stage of

Aryan progress.
     It deserves notice that the data obtained by the most modern anthro-

pological method agree in the main not only with the long chain of
Indian tradition, beginning with the Vedas and ending with the latest
vernacular treatise on the theory and practice of caste, but also with the

rationahsed and critical story of the making of the Indian peoples, as

it has been told by Sir William Hunter in the 'Imperial Gazetteer.'
Here the historian shows how, through the veil of fable and miracle, in

which prehistoric India is shrouded, traces may be discerned of a pro-

tracted struggle between a lower and a higher race, which would have

tended to produce much the same results as our statistics bring out.

Studied in the light of these statistics, it would seem that the standard

Indian theory of caste may deserve more respectful consideration than

has been accorded to it of late years.

The observations conducted by Mr. Risley include fifteen tribes and

castes of Bengal Proper ; five of the Chittagong Hills ; ten of the Dar-

jiling Hills                                                             ten of Behar ;  seventeen of Chota  Nagpur                                        twenty-three of
                                                                      ;                                                                                 ;

the North-Western Provinces and Oudh ; and nine of the Panjab.
    It is hoped that, within a reasonable time, the inquiry may be ex-

tended throughout the remainder of our Indian empire, and, with this

object in view, your committee ask for reappointment, with a renewal of

the grant.
618 REPORT-- 1892.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor W. H. Flower
    (Chairman), Dr. J. Gr. Gtarson (Secretary), Mr. Gr. W. Bloxam,
     and Dr. Wilberforce Smith, for the purpose of carrying on
     the work of the Anthropometric Laboratory. (Drawn up by

    GDr. ARSON, Secretary.)

The Committee have to report that at the Cardiff meeting of the Asso-

ciation last year excellent accommodation near the Reception-room was
provided by the Local Committee for the Anthropometric Laboratory.
The services of a clerk were, as previously, placed at the disposal of the
Committee, and by the kind permission of Mr. Francis Galtou, F.R.S.,
Sergeant Randall was again lent to your committee for the purpose of

measuring the members of the Association who visited the laboi^atory.
The Committee desire to express their high appreciation of Mr. Galton's
assistance in thus from year to year closing his own laboratory at South

Kensington during the meeting of the Association, so that Sergeant

Randall may be able to give his time to the work of the laboratory of

the Association, under the direction of Dr. Garson. Having the same
measurer from year to year is of the utmost importance in securing
uniformity of results, and will, it is hoped, make the collective statistics
of several years' observations, when presented to the Association and
published, of greater value than they would otherwise be.

     The number of applicants for measurement was very often considerably
greater than could be measured by the staff during the hours the laboratory
was open. The Committee regret that members of the Association had

often to wait, sometimes for a considerable time, before their turn for
measurement came round, especially during the last few days of the

meeting. To obviate this inconvenience as much as possible, it is de-
sirable that those who intend to visit the laboratory next year should do

so as early in the meeting as they can, since during part of the first and
second days the laboratory is open it often happens that the staff is not

fully occupied.

     The schedule of measurements and observations which can best be
made in the laboratory has now been fairly settled by experience of former
years, so that there is no material change in it to mention in this report.
The time which can be allotted to each candidate is necessarily limited,
and it has been the aim of the Committee to select tlie measurements and
observations which are of most importance and occupy least time, so as
to obtain as much information as possible. To this circumstance must be
attributed the absence of many tests, particularly those of a physiolo-
 gical nature, from the schedule, which might have been made had time not
 been an object of importance. The schedule includes the age, sex, birth-
place, colour of eyes and hair, the profile of the nose, height when stand-
ing, sitting, and kneeling, vertical distance from the vertex to tragus,
mouth, and chin, length and breadth of head, length and breadth of nose,
length of cubit and of hand, span of arms, weight in ordinary clothing,

 strength of pull with each hand, vital capacity of lungs, strength of vision

 with each eye and sense ef colour, and in males the maximum and mini-

mum circumference of the chest during inspiration and expiration respec-

ON THE WORK OF THE ANTHROPOMETRIC LABORATORY.                       619

Atively.  duplicate of the schedule with the measurements recorded on

it is handed to each person measured. The metric system is used, and

all measurements are expressed in millimetres except the weight, pull, and

vital capacity of lungs, which are given in pounds and cubic inches,

owing to the instruments not being graduated to kilogrammes and cubic

centimetres. The total number of persons measured during the Cardiff

meeting was 103, of whom 73 were males and 30 were females. This is

somewhat fewer than during the previous meeting, and is partly to be

accounted for by the fact that during the first few days of the meeting

comparatively few persons visited the laboratory, although towards the

end there was far more work to do than could be got through. The

meeting was also a small one, and the weather was exceedingly bad.

Since the close of the meeting the statistics of the observations then

made have been carefully worked up under the direction of the Secretary

after the plan which has been adopted in dealing with those of former

--years, and are as follows :
     Age. The males examined varied in age from 18 to 69 years. Of
theseonly 3 were 18 and under 20 years, 15 between 20 and 30 years,

23 between 30 and 40 years, 17 between 40 and 60 years, 11 between 50
and 60 years, and 4 between 60 and 70 years. Of the females 2 were under

18 years of age, and are not included in the statistics, 2 were between
18 and 20 years, 10 between 20 and 30 years, 7 between 30 and 40 years,

4 between 40 and 50 years, 4 between 50 and 60 years, and 1 between 60

--and 70 years.
     Birthplace and Residence. Only 18, that is about 25 per cent, of the

males, and 10, that is 33 per cent, of the females, were born in or near
Cardiff, or are Welsh by birth. The remainder of both sexes came from

various parts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, the percentages from each,
place being small, on account of tlie number of counties represented. As

regards residence the number of dwellers in large towns and the country

--were about equal in number.
     Occupation. The larger proportion of the males measured were pro-

fessional men ; the minority were engaged in commercial pursuits.

  --Colour of Eyes. The colour of the eyes was tested with Mr. F. Gal-
--ton's set of standards light, medium, and dark in colour. According to

this scale 43-9 per cent, of the males were light- eyed, 27'3 per cent,

medium or of grey colour, and 28-8 per cent, were dark-coloured, includ-

ing the various shades of brown. Of the females 10 had light eyes, 8

medium, and 9 dark eyes out of 27. On account of the smallness of the

--numbers the latter have not been reduced to percentages.
   Colour of Hair. Dividing the hair into the classes of dark, medium,
and light, with special classes, if required, for red and albino, and omit-
ting all cases of grey hair due to senile changes, 48-2 of the males had

light hair, 111 had medium, and 407 per cent, had dark hair. As there

was no standard to give to the observer of the limits of each class the
figures just given are his own ideas as to the different shades, and it is

evident that many cases of medium-coloured hair have been included

amongst the light-haired group. For this reason comparison of the fre-

quency of the various combinations of colour of eyes and hair has not been

attempted. This defect in the observations on the colour of the hair will

be remedied in future, as the standards of eyes and hair have since the last

meeting of the Association been published in the new edition of ' Notes

and Queries on Anthropology.'

620 REPORT-- 1892.

--Profile of Nose. The outline in profile of the nose has been recorded,

according to Broca and Topinard's standards, published on plate iv. oppo-

site page 20 in the second edition of ' Notes and Queries on Anthropology '

just referred to. The straight form (fig. 1) greatly predominates, but the
booked form (fig. 3) is also met with. As it appears uncertain whether

or not a little confusion has arisen in some of the forms, further analysis

--is omitted.
     Height. For the sake of convenience persons were measured with

their boots or shoes on their feet, but to ascertain their actual height the

thickness of the heels was also measured and subtracted from the total

indicated height.

     The stature of the males at the 25th grade is 1,688, at the 50th 1,740;
and at the 75th, 1,774 ; the 'Q ' or half the difference between the stature at
the 25th and 75th grades is 43 mm., giving a corrected mean stature of
1,731. The stature of the females is at the 25th grade 1,562 ; at the 50th,

Q1,612 ; and at the 76th, 1,662 ; ' ' is therefore 50, making the corrected

     Length of Leg and Height of Foot. This is obtained by subtracting

the kneeling height from the standing height. The latter is at the 25th

figures of the standing height previously given we find the length at the

Q' ' equals 6-6, and the corrected mean 394. This case illustrates the ad-

vantage of using the corrected mean as well as the calculated mean. It

will be observed that the latter is considerably higher in the kneeling

height than the former ; hence in the length of the lower segment of

the limb the length at the 25th and 50th places is the same, which is not

the case, and what it should be is shown by the corrected mean. No

doubt this anomalous condition arises in part from the small number of

females measured, and in part from the fact that the estimate has
been made by subtraction and not by actual calculation from the figures

themselves.

     Proportions of the Head. The cephalic index in the males varies from

71 to 91 ;                 at the 25th grade it is                                                766 ;        at   the     50th,                                                      78-5                       at the  75th,
                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

Q79'9 '                    ' is 1"6, and the corrected mean is 78"3. It will be seen from
                        ;

this that the 25th and 75th grades lie in the mesaticephalic group.

According to the international division of the cephalic index on the

skull, 8 of the series are dolichocephalic, 44 are mesaticephalic, 19 are

brachycephalic, 1 is hyperbrachycephalic, and 1 is ultrabrachycephalic.

In the females the cephalic index varies from 73 to 84 ; at the 25th

Qgrade it is                                                                                                                                                                                  ' is 17, and the
                              76-5                       at  the    50th, 78-6 ;                           at  the      75th,                                         80               '
                                                      ;                                                                                                                             ;

corrected mean 78*2. The index in the two sexes at the different grades

agrees very closely. By the international division 2 of the females are

dolichocephalic, 18 are mesaticephalic, and 8 are brachycephalic. There

is thus less variation in the form of their heads than in the males. The
height-length index in the males is 64'5, taken from the corrected mean

measurements of length and projection from vertex to tragus. The

module of the head, obtained by adding the length, breadth, and height

together, adding to their product 15 in the case of males and 13 for

females, and dividing the whole sum by 3, is, in the males, at the 25th

Qgrade,

the corrected mean is 161"5. The index of the relative proportion which

the length of the head from the glabella to the occiput bears to the length

from the vertex to the chin (the latter being taken as 100) is 93 ; that

of the breadth to the vertical projection of the head is 72'9 in the males.

If the glabello-occipital length is taken as 100, the index it forms

--with the total projection of the head is 107'5.
     Nasal Index. In the males the nasal index is 56'5 at the 25th

at the 75th, 118 ; ' Q ' equals 6, and the corrected mean 112. This index

is calculated from the bizygomatic breadth and nasio-mental length of

the face, the latter being taken as 100.

  --Length of Cubit. In the males the length of cubit at the 25fch grade

is 452; at the 50th, 4647 ; at the 75th, 478 ; 'Q' equals 13, and the

corrected mean is 465. The corrected mean length of cubit is 26'8 per

cent, of the corrected mean stature. In the females the length of the

Qcubit at the 25th grade is 404 ; at the 50th, 419 ; at the 75th, 431 ; ' '

equals 14, and the corrected mean is 417. The cubit in them is 25"9 of

--the stature.
     Lengtlt of Hand (right). In the males the length of the right hand at
the 25th grade is 1866; at the 50th, 192-6; at the 75th, 199-6; 'Q'
equals 6-5, and the corrected mean 193. The corrected mean length of
hand is 11-1 per cent, of the corrected mean stature. In the females

the length of hand at the 25th grade is 170; at the 50th, 177-8 at the-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

the corrected mean stature ; in the males the 41-5 per cent, of the cubit,
and in the females 42-5 per cent. Subtracting the corrected mean length
of the hand from the corresponding length of the cubit, the mean length
of the forearm proper is 272 in the males and 239 in the females ; the

length of the hand is to that of the forearm in the former as 71, and in

the latter as 74-3 to 100.

   --Span of Arms. In the males the span of the arms varies from 1,575

to 1,900 ; "at the 25th grade it is 1,738 ; at the 50th, 1,771 ; at the

Q75th, 1,814 ; ' ' is 38, and the corrected mean is 1,776. In the females

it is at the 25th grade 1,550; at the 50th, 1,601; at the 75th, 1,644;

Q' ' equals 47, and the corrected mean is 1,597. The proportion which

the span bears to the stature (the latter being taken as 100) is in the

males as 102-6, and in the females 105-2. The span of the arms exceeds
the stature in 10 cases out of 70 in the males, and in 13 out of 26 in the

females, or in 14-3 per cent, of the former, and in 50 per cent, of the

latter.

  --Weight. In the males the weight at the 25th grade is 144 lbs.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

at the 50th, 162-5 lbs. ; at the 75th, 167 lbs. ; 'Q' equals 11-6, and the

corrected mean is 156 lbs., or 11 st. 2 lbs. In the females it is at the

25th grade 116-7 lbs. ; at the 50th, 122-5 lbs. ; and at the 75th, 131-7 lbs.

Q' ' equals 7-5, and the corrected mean is 124-2 lbs., or 8 st. 12 lbs., that

and the corrected mean is 37-6 lbs. In 32 cases out of 71 in the

males the pull with the right hand is the stronger, in 33 the left is

the stronger, and in 6 cases the two hands are of equal strength. In

2 7 females the right hand is the stronger in 9 cases, the left in 14, and in

--6 the two hands are equal.
      Vital Capacity of Lungs. In the males the vital capacity at the

25th grade is 188 cubic inches ; at the 50th, 221 cubic inches ; at

the 75th, 254'5 cubic inches ; Q' ' equals 33-2, and the corrected mean

is 221'2 cubic inches. In the females it is at the 25th grade 101'4;

and the corrected mean is 124*8 cubic inches. The vital capacity of

the chest was ascertained by means of Stanley's spirometer, kindly

lent for the meeting by the manufacturers, Messrs. Tallack & Co., of

28 Hatton Garden, London, to whom the Committee express best thanks

for having placed at their disposal, for two consecutive years, this very

--excellent instrument.
     Circumference of the Chest. This dimension was only ascertained on

the males. At the 25th grade, during forced inspiration, it measures

932  millimetres ; at     the       50th, 970             millimetres                                               at     the  75th, 1,017

millimetres ; Q' ' equals 42, and the corrected mean 976 millimetres.

The difierence between forced inspiration and forced expiration is at the

25th grade 41 millimetres ; at the 50th, 52 millimetres ; at the 75th,

Q69 millimetres ; ' ' is 14, and the corrected mean 55 millimetres. By

subtracting half of this latter sum from the corrected mean circumference

of the chest during forced inspiration, we get 968 millimetres as the

Liirth of the chest when the lungs are midway between forced inspiration

--Mild expiration.
     Vision. The power of vision was tested with Snellen's test-types
placed at a distance of 6 metres from the eye. The number of males who

could read No. 6 type with both eyes (each eye being tested separately)
was 38 out of 73, that is 52 per cent., and 14 of these were able to read

No. 5 at 6 metres. Of the females 13 out of 26, or 50 per cent., had
normal vision ; that is to say were able to read No. 6 test-type at 6
metres ; indeed, all but 4 of them were able to read No. 5 at 6 metres.
In several cases the vision with one eye was normal, while that of the
other was more or less defective. The time which could be devoted to
each candidate was too short to permit of any investigation as to the

--cause of the deficiencies in vision being undertaken.
     Colour Sense. This was tested by asking the candidate to pick out
first the greens and afterwards the reds from a series of cards which con-
tained the various confusion coloui-s for green and red blindness, and

several other colours. Three of the males were found to be colour-blind.
     For purposes of comparison a table of the corrected means of the

different measurements dealt with in this report has been made out, and
placed side by side with the corresponding figures obtained from the

laboratory in the previous year.

    The Committee desire to be reappointed, and to have a sum of 51.

again placed at their disposal.

TEANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.

   Section A.--MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE.
--President of the Section Professor Arthur Schuster, Ph.D., F.B.S., F.R.A.S.

                          THURSDAY, AUGUST 4.

The President delivered the following Address :

In opening the proceedings of our annual meeting the temptation is great to look back

on the year which has passed and to select for special consideration such work

published during its course as may seem to be of the greatest importance. I fear,

however, that a year is too short a time to allow us to form a fair estimate of the

value of a scientific investigation. The mushroom, which shoots up quickly, only

to disappear again, impresses us more than the slow-growing seedling which will

live to be a tree, and it is difficult to recognise the scientific fungus in its early

stage. But, although I do not feel competent to give you a review of the progress

made in our subject during the last twelve months, there is one event to which

some allusion should be made. It has been the sad duty of many of my pre-

decessors to announce the death of successful workers in the field of science, but

I believe I am unique in having the pleasure of recording the birth of a scientific

man. At the beginning of this year there came into the world a being so brilliant

that he could, without preparation, take up the work of the most eminent man

amongst us. Believers in the transmigration of souls have speculated on the fact

that Galileo's death and  Newton's birth fell within  a  year  of  each other                                                     but no
                                                                                                                               ;

event has ever happened so striking as that which took place on the 1st of January,

when the mantle of Sir William Thomson fell on the infant Lord Kelvin. Those

who have attended these meetings will feel with me that the honour done to our

foremost representative, an honour which has been a source of pride and satis-

faction to every student of science, could not altogether remain unnoticed in the

section which owes him so much.

    We are chiefly concerned here with the increase of scientific knowledge, and

we derive pleasure in contrasting the minor state of ignorance of our own time

with that which prevailed a hundred years ago. But when we contrast at the

same time the refined opportunities of a modern research laboratory with the

crude conditions under which the experimentalist had to work at the beginning of

the century, we may fairly ask ourselves whether it is possible by means of any

Agress into the dark continent of science.  number of serious considerations arise

in connection with this subject, and though I am not going to weary you by

attempting an exhaustive discussion, I should like to draw your attention to a

few matters which seem to me to be well worthy of the consideration of this Asso-

ciation. Changes are constantly made or proposed in our existing institutions,

                                                                   ss2

and new ones are suggested wliich are to serve the purpose of a more rapid accumu-

lation of knowledge. I need only allude to the alterations in the curriculum of the

science schools in our old Universities, made partly for the purpose of fitting

their graduates for the conduct of original research, or to the national laboratory

proposed by my predecessor in this chair for carrying out a certain kind of scien-

tific investigation, which at present is left undone, or is done by private enterprise.

Even our own Association has not escaped the evil eye of the reformer, and, like

other institutions, it may be capable of improvement. But in choosing the direc-

tion in which a change may best be made, I think we may learn something from the
Weway in which Nature improves its organisms.
                                               are taught by biologists that

natural selection acts by developing those qualities which enable each species best to
survive the struggle for existence ; useless organs die off or become rudimentary.

Nature teaches us, therefore, how a beautiful complex of beings, mutually depend-

ent on each other, is formed by improving those parts which are best and most

useful, and letting the rest take care of itself. But in many of the changes which
have been made or are proposed the process of reform is very different. The
weakest points are selected, our attention is drawn to some failure or to some-
thino- in which we are excelled by other nations, and attempts are made to cure

what perhaps had better be left to become rudimentary. The proceeding is not

objectionable as long as the nourishment which is applied to develop the weaker

organs is not taken from those parts which we should specially take care to pi-eserve.
To apply these reflections to the question with which we are specially concerned, I

should like to see it more generally recognised that although there is no struggle
for existence between different nations, yet each nation, owing to a number of cir-

cumstances, possesses its own peculiarities, which render it better fitted than its

neighbours to do some particular part of the work on which the progress of science

depends. No country, for instance, has rivalled France in the domain of accurate

measurement, with which the names of Regnault and Amagat are associated, and
the International Bureau of Weights and Measures has its fitting home in Paris.^
The best work of the German Universities seems to me to consist in the following

up of some theory to its logical conclusions and submitting it to the test of experi-
ment. I doubt "whether the efforts to transplant the research work of German

Universities into this country will prove successful. Does it not seem well to let

each country take that share of work for which the natural growth of its character
and of its educational establishments best adapts it ? Is it wise to remedy some weak
point, to fill up undoubted gaps, if the soil that fills the gaps has to be taken from

the hills and elevations which rise above the surrounding level ?

     As far as the work of this section is concerned the strongest domain of this

country has been that of mathematical physics. But it is not to this that I wish
specially to refer. Look at the work done in Great Britain during the last two

centuries ; the work not only in physics, but in astronomy, chemistry, biology. Is
it not true that the one distinctive feature which separates this from all other
countries in the world is the prominent part played by the scientific amateur, and

is it not also true that our modern system of education tends to destroy the

amateur ?

    By amateur I do not necessarily mean a man who has other occupations and
only takes up science in his leisure hours, but rather one who has had no aca-

demical training in that branch of knowledge which he finally selects for study.

He has probably been brought iip for some profession unconnected with science,

and only begins his study when his mind is sufficiently matured to form an entirely

Weunbiassed opinion.  may, perhaps, best define an amateur as one who learns his

science as he wants it and when he wants it. I should call Faraday an amateur.

He would  have  been  impossible  in  another country                                                                perhaps he would be  impos-
                                                                                                                  ;

    ' Much of the good work done by this Bureau remains unknown, owing to the
miserly way in which their publications are circulated. No copies are supplied even
to the University libraries. The explanation, of course, is ' want of funds.' In other

words, England, France, and Germany, together with other nations, unite to do a

certain kind of work, but cannot afford to distribute a few copies of the publication

to the public for whose benefit the work is undertaken.

Jiscuss why distinguished amateurs have been so numerous in this country, but 1
am anxious to point out that we are in danger of losing one great and necessary

factor in the origination of scientific ideas.                  .

One of the distinctive features of an amateur is this, that he carries not the
weight of theories, often not the weight of knowledge, and, if I am right, there is
a distinct advantage in having one section of scientific men beginning their
work untrammelled by preconceived notions, which a systematic training in science
is bound to instil. Whatever is taught in early years must necessarily be taught
in a more or less dogmatic manner, and, in whatever way it is taught, experi-
-ence shows that it is nearly always received in a dogmatic spirit. It seems
important, therefore, to confine the early training to those subjects in which pre-
conceived notions are considered an advantage. It is to me an uncongenial task to
                                                                                       which
sound a note of  warning to our old Universities, for the       chief ditficulties in
they are placed  at present are due to the fact that they                              much
                                                                have given way too

to outside advice ; but I cannot help expressing a strong conviction that their liighly
specialised examinations for entrance scholarships are a curse to all sound school
education, and will prove a still more fatal curse to what concerns us most nearly, the
progress of scientific knowledge. If school education could be more general, it
scientific theories could only be taught at an age when a man is able to torm an
independent judgment, there might be some hope of retaining that originality ot
ideas which has been a distinctive feature of this country, and enabled our amateurs

to hold a prominent position in the history of science. At present a knowledge ot

scientific theories seems to me to kill all knowledge of scientific facts.

     It is by no means true that a complete knowledge of everything that has a
bearing on a particular subject is always necessary to success in an original inves-
tio-ation. In many cases such knowledge is essential, in others it is a hindrance.
Different types of men incline to diflerent types of research, and it is well to pre-
serve the dual struggle. The engine which works out the great problems ot nature
may be likened to a thermodynamic machine. The amateur supplies the steam

and the Universities supply the cold water ; the former, boding over often with ill-
considered and fanciful ideas, does not like the icy bath, and the protessioual
scientist rebels against the latent heat of the condensing steam, but nevertheless
the hotter the steam and the colder the water the better works the machine.
Sometimes it happens that boiler and cooler are both contained in the same brain,
and each country can boast of a few such in a century, but most of us have to
remain satisfied with forming only an incomplete part of the engine of research.
     But while it is necessary to recognise the great work done by the amateur,
iistfuptspheoeerymtsofvnoerortsstuuecpnhtitomhfeeiltryheltieorgidtthrieamowaritetehsebiaorsunahdtaatvreeinetnisoo,tnarnteodcetiehvseepeddcaitmahlealgyaepipfdrotonhveeayltosoteettkhheompssoeepluwvlheaosr

are competent to judge. An appeal from Philip sober to Philip drunk will not

prove successful ia the end.                                                                  -

The gradual disappearance of the amateur may be a necessary consequence ot
                                                we must inquire whether any marked

seem at first sight, at any rate, that a proper course of study could do mucli to

facilitate the progress of research.

    On another occasion I pointed out that two parties are necessary lor every

advance in science, the one that makes it and the one that believes in it. It
the discoverer is born, and cannot be made, would it not be possible to tram

the judgment of our students so that they may form a sound opinion on the
new theories and ideas which are presented to them ? It is too early as yet to
judge in how far our generation is better in this respect than the one that has gone
before it, but on closer examination it does not seem to me to be obvious that any
marked improvement is possible. Every new idea revolutionising our opinions

on some important question must necessarily take time before it obtains a proper Hold

on the scientific world. Is it not true that anyone who can at once see the lull
630 EEPOET-- 1892.

importance of a new theory, and accept it in place of the one in which he has

been brought up, must stand at a height almost equal to that of the originator ?

The more startling and fresh the new conception the fewer must be those who are

ready to adopt it. But looking back at the history of science during the present

century, is there much evidence that great discoveries have been seriously delayed

Weby Avant of proper appreciation ?     may hear of cases where important papers

have been rejected by scientific societies, and occasionally a man of novel ideas-

may have been too much neglected by his contemporaries. I doubt whether

such cases of apparent injustice can ever be avoided, and, considering the great

changes involved in matters of primary importance, such as the undulatory

theory of light, the conservation of energy, and the second law of thermo-

dynamics, I cannot admit that there is much reason to be dissatisfi.ed with

the rate at which new theories have been received. Those wlio experience a tempo-

rary check, owing to the fact that public opinion is not ripe for their ideas,

are often fully rewarded after the lapse of a few years. The disappointment

which Joule may have felt during the time his views met with adverse criticisms

liom the official world of science was no doubt amply compensated by the pleasure

with which he watched the subsequent progress of research in the new domain

which his discoveries have opened out.

The point is not one of academic interest only, for the fear of repressing some

important new discoveiy has a disastrous influence in another direction. The-

judgment of the scientific world seems to me to be tending too much towards-

leniency to apparently absurd theories, because there is a remote chance that they

Amay contain some germ of real value.   new truth will not be found to suffer

ultimately by adverse and even unreasonable criticism, while bad theories and bad

reasoning, supported by the benevolent neutrality of those to whose judgment the

scientific world looks for guidance, are harmful in many ways. They block the
way to an independent advance and encourage hasty and ill-considered generalisa-

tions. The conclusion I should draw from the considerations I have placed before

you are these : I believe that a reasonable censorship exercised by our scientific

societies is good and necessary ; that those whose fate it is to be called on to

express anopinion on some work or theory should do so fearlessly according to

their best judgment. Their opinion may be warped by prejudice, but I think it is

better that they should incur the risk of being ultimately found to be wrong than

that they should help in the propagation of bad reasoning. There is one matter,

however, on which all opinions must agree. AVorse than bad theory or logic is

bad experimental work. Should we then not rigorously preserve anj' influence

or incentive which encourages the beginner to avoid carelessness and to consider

neither time nor trouble to secure accuracy ? There is no doubt to my mind that

the prospect of admission to the Royal Society has been most beneficial in this

respect, and that the honourable ambition to see his paper published in the

' Transactions ' of that society has preserved many a student from the premature

publication of unfinished work.

One of the principal obstacles to the rapid dilTusion of a new idea lies in the

difhculty of finding suitable expressions to convey its essential point to other minds.

^^'ords may have to be strained into a new sense, and scientific controversies

constantly resolve themselves into diflerences about the meaning of words. On

the other hand, a happy nomenclature has sometimes been more powerful thaa

rigorous logic in causing a new train of thought to be quickly and generally

accepted.

   A good example is furnished by the history of the science of energy. The

principle of the conservation of energy has undoubtedly gained, by the introduction

of the term ' potential energy,' a more rapid and general acceptance than it would

Aotherwise have received.  great theorem, which in itself seems to me to be

an intricate one, has been simplified by calling something energy which, in the

first place, is only a deficiency of kinetic energy. The only record I can find on
the history of the expression is given in Tait's ' Thermodynamics,' wherein the
term 'statical energy ' is ascribed to Lord Kelvin, and that of ' potential energy ' to
Baukine. It would be of interest to have a more detailed account on the origin of
                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                        631

an expression which has undoubtedly had a marked influence, not only on the

physics, but also on the metaphysics of our time. But whUe fully recognising the
very great advantage we have derived from this term 'potential energy,' we ought

not, at the same time, to lose sight of the fact that it implies something more than

can be said to be proved. It is easy to overstep the legitimate use of the word.

Thus, when Professor Lodge ' attempts to prove that action at a distance is not

myconsistent with the doctrine of energy, he cannot, in  opinion, justify his position

except by assuming that all energy is ultimately kinetic. That is a plausible but

by no means a necessary theory. Efforts have been made to look on energy as on

something which can be labelled and identified through its various transformations.

Thus we may feel a certain bit of energy radiating from a coal-fire, and if our
knowledge was complete, we ought to be able to fix the time at which that

identical bit of energy left the sun and arrived on the surface of the earth, setting

up a chemical action in the leaves of the plant from which the coal has been

derived. If we push this view to a logical conclusion, it seems to me that we
must finally arrive at an atomic conception of energy which some may consider a)i

absurdity.

Let, for instance, a number of particles Pj, P^, &c., in succession, strike another

Howparticle, Q.       can we in the translatory energy of the latter identify the parts

which Pj, P.J, &c., have contributed ? According to Professor Lodge's view, we

Qshould be able to do so, for if the particle  in its turn gives up its energy to

others, say Rj, R^, Kg, &c., we ought to be able to say whether the energy of Pj has

ultimately gone into Rj or into R^, or is divided between them. It is only by

imagining that all energy is made up of a finite number of bits, which pass from

one body to another, that we can defend the idea of considering energy as capable

of being 'labelled.'

In the expressions we adopt to describe physical phenomena we necessarily

Wehover between two extremes.  either have to choose a word which implies more

than we can prove, or we have to use vague and general terms which hide

the essential point, instead of bringing it out. The history of electrical

theories furnishes a good example. The terms positive and negative electricity

committed us to something definite ; we could reckon about quantities of electricity,

and form some definite notion of electrical currents as a motion of the two kinds of

Nowelectricity in opposite directions.  we have changed all that ; we speak of

electric displacements, but safeguard ourselves by saying that a displacement only

Wemeans a vector quantity, and not necessarily an actual displacement.  speak of

lines and tubes of force not only as a help to realise more clearly certain analytical

results, but as implying a physical theory which, at the same time, does not

commit us to anything. I do not find any fault with this, for it is a perfectly

legitimate and necessary process to state the known connection between physical

phenomena in some form which introduces the smallest number of assumptions.

But the great question, ·' What is electricity ? ' is not touched by these general

considerations. The brilliant success with which Maxwell's investigations have

been crowned is apt to make us overrate the progress made in the solution of that

question. Maxwell and his followers have proved the important fact that optical

Weand electrical actions are transmitted by means of the same medium.   may be

said to have arrived in the subject of electricity at the stage in which optics was

placed before Young and Fresnel hit on the idea of transverse vibrations, but there

is no theory of electricity in the sense in which there is an elastic solid theory of

     It the term electrical displacement was taken in its literal sense, it would mean

that the electric current consists of the motion of the ether through the conductor.

This is a plausible hypothesis, and one respecting which we may obtain experimental
evidence. The experiments of Rayleigh and others have shown that the velocity

of light in an electrolyte, through which an electric current is passing, is, within
experimental limits, the same with and against the current. This result shows that
if an electrical current means a motion of the ether the velocity of the medium

                      » Phil. Mag., vol. xi. 1881, p. 36.
632 EEPORT-- 1892.

cannot exceed ten metres a second for a current density of one ampere per square

centimetre. This, then, is the upper limit for a possible velocity of the medium.

Can we iind a lower limit ? The answer to that question depends on the inter-

pretation of a well-known experiment of Fizeau's, who found that the speed of light

is increased if it travels through water which moves in the same direction as the

light. If this experiment implies that the water carries the ether with it, and if a

motion of the ether means an electric current, we should be led to the conclusion

Anthat a current of water should deflect a magnet in its neighbourhood.                                     experi-

ment made to that effect would almost certainly give a negative result, and would

give us a lower limit for the velocity of the medium corresponding to a given current.

iSuch an experiment, together with that of Eayleigh, would probably dispose of

the theory that an electric current is due to a translatory velocity of the medium.

This would be an important step, and it would be worth while to arrive at a

final settlement of the matter.^ The whole question of the relation between tlie

motion of matter and motion of the medium is a vital one, and we shall probably

not make any serious advances until experiment has found a new opening. But we

must expect many negative results before some clue is discovered. Nor can we

attach much importance to negative results unless they are made by someone in

Wewhose care and judgment we place full reliance.                                         should all the more, there-

fore, recognise the courage and perseverance of those who spend theii" valuable

time in such investigations as Professor Lodge has recently undertaken. That

ultimately some relation will be found between moving matter and electrical

action there is no reasonable doubt.

One of the most hopeful openings for new investigations has always been found

in the pursuing of a theory to its logical conclusions, and there is one result of

the electromagnetic theory of light which has not, in my opinion, received the

share of attention which it deserves.

    When sound passes through air it is propagated more quickly with the wind

than against it, and we may easily find the velocity relative to the earth by com-

bining the ordinary sound velocity with the velocity of the wind. Similarly, when

any waves pass through a medium moving with uniform velocity, the waves being

due to internal stresses in the medium, we may treat of the velocity of the waves

independently of that of the medium, and say that the wave-velocity in the direc-

tion of motion of the medium, and relative to a fixed body, is the sum of the wave-

velocity calculated on the supposition that the medium is at rest and the velocity

of the medium. Professor J. J. Thomson,'^ applying Maxwell's equations, has

arrived at a different result for electromagnetic waves, and has come to the conclu-

sion that in order to get the velocity of light along a stream of flowing water we

have to add to the velocity of light only half the velocity of water. The follow-

ing considerations suggest themselves to me with respect to this result. Maxwell's

theory is founded on certain observed effects, which all depend on the relative
Amotion of matter.
                    result such as the one referred to implies actions depending

on absolute motion, and appears therefore to point to something which has been

introduced into the equations for which there is no experimental evidence. The

only assumption clearly put down by Maxwell is that electromagnetic actions are

transmitted through the medium, and it is possible that that assumption necessarily

carries Professor J, J. Thomson's result with it. If a careful examination of the

subject should show that this is the case, we are brought face to face with a serious

difficulty. It is .said, with justice, to be one of the great advantages of Maxwell's

theory that  it  does away with action  at  a  distance                                   but what  do  we  gain  if we
                                                                                       ;

replace action at a distance by something infinitely more diflicult to conceive,

namely, internal stresses of a medium depending on the velocity of the medium

     ' Fizeau's result must either be due to the motion of matter through the medium
or to the fact that moving matter carries the ether with it. If it is due to the
former cause, and matter does not carry the ether with it, may we not consider that
matter moving through the ether, that is a relative motion of matter and ether, must
produce effects equal and opposite to those of ether moving through matter ? In

that case the reasoning in the text would, mutatis mutandis, hold good.

Maxwell's medium is not homogeneous, but consists of two parts, and that if we
speak of the medium as moving we mean the motion of one of these parts relative

relation between what we call electricity and the medium, we must not lose sight

of another avenue, namely, the relation between electricity and chemical efifects.
The passage of electricity through gases presents us with a complicated problem
to which a number of physicists havs given their attention of late years. There

seems no reasonable doubt that electricity in a gas is conveyed by the diffusion of
particles conveying high charges, probably identical with those carried by the
electrolytic ions. The fact that this convection is a process of diffusion with

comparatively small velocity is shown by the experimental result that the path of

the discharge is affected by anv bodily motion of the gas which conveys the current.

Even the convection currents due to the heat produced by the discharge itself are

sufficient to deflect the luminous column which marks the passage of the current.

The most puzzling fact, however, connected with the discharge of electricity
through gases consists in the absence of symmetry at the positive and negative

poles."' There must be some diflereuce between a positively and a negatively charged
atom which seems of fundamental importance in the relation between matter and
Awhat we call electricity.
                            discussion of the various phenomena attending the

discharo-e of electricity through gases seems to me to point to a conclusion which

may possibly prove a step in the right direction.

   A surface of separation between bodies having different conductivities becomes

electrified by the passage of a current, while at the surface between two chemically
distinct bodies we have, according to Helmholtz, a sheet covered at the two sides
with opposite electricities. These surface electrifications are not merely imaginary
layers invented to satisfy mathematical surface conditions. They can be proved

to be realities. Thus, when one electrolyte floats on another, the specific resist-
ances being different, we often observe secondary chemical eftects due to the action

of the ions which carry the surface electrification.
    If the passage of electricity from the solid to the gas involves some work done,

we must expect a double sheet of electricity at the boundary, the gas in contact

with the kathode becoming positively, and that in contact with the anode negatively,
               priori we can form no idea how a layer of gas, the atoms of which
Aelectrified.
carry charges, will behave. The ordinary proof that all electrification must be
confined to the surface implies that all forces act according to the law of the

inverse square ; but where we have also to consider molecular forces, I see no reason

why the electrification at a surface may not stretch across a layer having a thick-
ness comparable with the mean free path of the molecule. It is here that there

seems to be the fundamental difference between positive and negative electricity.
A negative electrification of the gas, like that of a solid or a liquid, seems always
confined to the surface, and no one has ever observed a volume electrification of

negative electricity. The case is different for the positively electrified part of the

gas. Wherever from other considerations we should expect a positively electrified

surface sheet, we always get a layer of finite thickness. The result implies a
different law of impact between positively and negatively electrified ions, but I see
no inherent improbability in this. That the kathode let into a gas is surrounded
by a positively electrified laver of finite thickness extending outwards must be
considered as an established "fact, and several of the characteristic features ot the

discharge are explained by it. The large fall of potential at the kathode can also
be explained on the view which I have put forward, for in order to keep up

the discharge there must be a sufficient normal force at the surface, and if this lorce

is not confined to the surface, but necessarily stretches across a finite hiyer,

the fall of potential must be multiplied a great number of times. Similarly

Goldstein has shown that some of the phenomena of the kathode are observed at

every place at which the positive current flows from a wide to a narrow part of

a column of gas. At such places we should expect a positive surface electrifica-
tion, and here, again, the whole appearance tends to show that we are dealmg
634 BEPOJRT-- 1892.

with a positive volume electrification. No corresponding phenomena are ohserved
when the current passes from the narrow to the wide part.

     The fact that in all cases experimented upon positive volume electrifications

are observed hut never similar negative electrifications is surely of significance.

Some of the results recently brought to light by investigations on the dis-

charge of electricity have interesting cosmical applications. Thus it is found that

such a discharge through any part of a vessel containing a gas converts the whole

gas into a conductor.^ The dissociation which we imagine to take place in a

liquid before electrolytic conduction takes place must be artificially produced in

Wea gas by the discharge itself.     may imitate in gaaes which have thus been

rendered conductive many of the phenomena hitherto restricted to liquids : thus I

hope to bring to the notice of this meeting cases of primary and secondary cells in

which the electrolyte is a gas. There are other wa^s in which a gas can be put

into that sensitive state in which we may treat it as a conductor, and we have

every reason to suppose that the upper regions of our atmosphere are in this state.

The principal part of the daily variation of the magnetic needle is due to causes

lying outside the surface of the earth, and is in all probability only an electro-

magnetic effect due to that bodily motion in our atmosphere which shows itself

Ain the diurnal changes of the barometer.  favourite idea of the late Professor

Balfour Stewart will probably be thus confirmed. The difference in the diurnal

range between times of maximum and times of minimum sun-spots is accounted

for by the fact that the atmosphere is a better conductor at times of maximum

sun-spots.

    The mention of sun-spots raises a point not altogether new to this section.
Careful observations of celestial phenomena may suggest to us the solution of
many mysteries which are now puzzling us. Consider, for instance, how long it

would have taken to prove the universal property of gravitational attraction if the

record of planetary motion had not come to the philosopher's help. And surely
the most casual observation of cosmical effects teaches ua how much we have yet

to learn.

    The statement of a problem occasionally helps to clear it up, and I may b&

allowed, therefore, to put before you some questions, the solution of which seems

not beyond the reach of our powers.

     1. Is every large rotating mass a magnet ? If it is, the sun must be a powerful
magnet. The comets' tails, which eclipse observations show stretching out from
our sun in all directions, probably consist of electric discharges. The effect of a
magnet on the discharge is known, and careful investigations of the streamers of
the solar corona ought to give an answer to the question which I have put.'

     2. Is there sufficient matter in interplanetary space to make it a conductor of
electricity? I believe the evidence to be in favour of that view. But the con-

ductivity can only be small, for otherwise the earth would gradually set itself to

revolve about its magnetic pole. Suppose the electric resistance of interplanetary

space to be so great that no appreciable change in the earth's axis of rotation could

have taken place within historical times ; is it not possible that the currents in-

duced in planetary space by the earth's revolution may, by their electromagnetic

action, cause the secular variation of terrestrial magnetism ? There seems to mo

to be here a definite question capable of a definite answer, and as far as I can

iudge without a strict mathematical investigation the answer is in the affirmative.

    3. What is a sun-spot ? It is, I believe, generally assumed that it is analogous

to one of our cyclones. The general appearance of a sun-spot does not show any
marked cyclonic motion, though what we see is really determined by the distribution
of temperature, and not by the lines of flow. But a number of cyclones clustering
together like the sun-spots in a group should move round each other in a definite

    ' An experiment by Hittorf (Wied. Ann., vii. p. 614) suggested the probability of

this fact, which was proved independently by Arrhenius and myself.
     " The efforts of ]\Ir. Bigelow have a bearing on this point, also some remarks

which I have made in a lecture before the Royal Institution {Proc. Boy. Inst., 1891),

but nothing decisive can be asserted at present.

way, and it seems to me that the close study of the relative positions of a g^oup of

spots should give decisive evidence for or against the cyclone theory.

4. If the spot is not due to cyclonic motion, is it not possible that electric

discharges setting out from the sun, and accelerating artificially evaporation at

the sun's surface, might cool those parts from which the discharge starts, and thus

produce a sun-spot ? The efi'ects of electric discharges on matters of solar physics

have already been discussed by Dr. Huggins.

5. May not the periodicity of sun-spots, and the connection between two such

dissimilar phenomena as spots on the sun and magnetic disturbances on the earth,

be due to a periodically recurring increase in the electric conductivity of the parts

of space surrounding the sun ? Such an increase of conductivity might be produced

by meteoric matter circulating round the sun.

6. What causes the anomalous law of rotation of the solar photosphere ? It

has long been known that groups of spots at the solar equator perform their revo-

lution in a shorter time than those in a higher latitude but spots are disturb-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

ances which may have their own proper motions. Dun6r ^ has shown, however,

from the displacement of the Fraunhofer lines, that the whole of the layer which

produces these lines follows the same anomalous law, the angular velocity at a

latitude of 75° being 30 per cent, less than near the equator.'^ As all causes

acting within the sun might cause the angular velocity of the sun to be smaller

at the equator than at other latitudes, but could not make it greater, the only

explanation open to us is an outside efl'ect either by an influx of meteoric matter,

as suggested by Lord Kelvin, or in some other way. If we are to trust Dr.

Welsing's result that faculaj which have their seat below the photosphere revolve

in all latitudes with the same velocity, which is that of the spot velocity in the

equatorial region, we should have to find a cause for a retardation in higher lati-

tudes rather than for an acceleration at the equator. The exceptional behaviour of

the solar surface seems to me to deserve very careful attention from solar physicists.

Its explanation will probably carry with it that of many other phenomena.

In conclusion, I should like to return for an instant to the question whether it

is possible by any means to render the progress of science more smooth and swift.

If there is any truth in the idea that two types of mind are necessary, the one cor-

responding to the boiler and the other to the cooler of a steam engine, it must also

be true that some place must be found where the two may bring their influence

to bear on each other. I venture to think that no better ground can be chosen

Wethan that supplied by our meetings.  hear it said that the British Association

has fulfilled its object ; we are told that it was originally founded to create a general

interest in  scientific problems in  the towns in which it  meets                                and now that popu-
                                                                                              ;

lar lectures and popular literature are supposed to perform that work more satis-

factorily, we are politely asked to commit the happy despatch. There is no need

to go back to the original intention of those who have founded this institution,

whicii has at any rate adapted itself sufiiciently well to the altered circumstances

to maintain a beneficial influence in scientific research.

     The free discussion which takes place in our sections, the interchange of ideas
between men who during the rest of the year have occupied their minds, perhaps
too much, with some special problem, the personal intercourse between those who

are beginning their work with sanguine expectations, and those who have lost the

first freshness of their enthusiasm, should surely one and all ensure a long prosperity

to our meetings. If we cannot claim any longer to sow the seeds of scientific

interest in the towns we visit, because the interest is established, we can at any

rate assure those who so kindly oflTer us hospitality that they are helping power-

fully in the promotion of the great object which we all have at heart.

        1. On Leahy Magnetic Circuits. By Dr. H. E. J. Gr. DU Bois.

     In order to obtain some generally reliable result on this question the particular
case of a split-ring, magnetised uniformly and peripherically, was investigated
theoretically as well as experimentally. The values of the demagnetising factor
were found to approximate more and more towards the theoretical values as the

--magnetising field is increased as, indeed, they should by a general saturation

theorem, first given by Kirchhoff. For a lower range of magnetisation, up to about
half the saturation value, the factors are constant, and smaller than the theoretical

values. It may be shown that the leakage coefficients, as defined by Hopkinsou,

 are proportional to the reciprocals of the above factors ; it thence follows that
leakage decreases for high magnetisation, contrary to what has hitherto generally
                                                                                       ;

been supposed to occur. This unexpected behaviour may be explained by the

proper physical theory, but cannot be accounted for by the ohmic law for magnetic

circuits,

2. On M. E. Branlys Experiments on Electrical Resistance.
                       By Dawson Turner, M.I).

    The author had the pleasure, when in Paris, of seeing some of M. E. Branly's

experiments on the influence of currents of high potential upon electrical resistance
(an account of which has been published by M. Branly in the ' Comptes Rendus,'
November 24, 1890, and January 12, 1891 ; also in the 'Bulletin de la Soc. Int.

des Electriciens,' No. 78, May 1891). The author has repeated some of these.

It is well known that metallic powders present a very great electrical resistance.

This can be lowered to an extraordinary degree by the passage of a spark in
their neighbourhood. The author, following M. Branly, has tried, amongst

other substances, powdered aluminium, copper, annealed selenium, iron filings,

small shot, mixtures of aluminium and resin fused into a solid stick, &c. The
Abest results were obtained with the first two.
                                                 short glass tube is filled with

powdered aluminium, and placed, by means of copper wires passing through corks,

in circuit with one or two cells and a galvanometer. The resistance of the

aluminium is very great, and the needle of the galvanometer will remain at zero.

If, however, a spark from an induction coil be passed anywhere in the vicinity, the

resistance will become at once very much diminished and the galvanometer needle

will be deflected. Thus, though there was at first no appreciable current, there

may now be one of 250 m.a. The powder will, if undisturbed, remain a conductor

for some little time ; but if the table be shaken, or the glass tube be moved, the

initial resistance at once returns and the needle passes back to zero. After the

resistance has been once lowered in this way the powder gets into a very sensitive

condition ; a spark at a great distance lowers the resistance, and the slightest jar

restores it. The author was not successful with ordinary iron filings, perhaps

because they were not sufiiciently finely divided. Mere shaking does not restore

the resistance of the solid stick of aluminium and resin, but the application of a

little warmth is sufficient.

     The experiments would appear to suggest that the molecules of the powders
become arranged in such an order as to conduct electricity when an electrical

discharge occurs in their neighbourhood, and that the slightest mechanical jarring

suffices to destroy this arrangement. It does not appear to matter which way the

induction current is passed.

                               3. On Electrical Discharges.
               By Professor Eilh. Wiedemann and Dr. H. Ebert.

     The object of the experiments to be described was to study the phenomena ol
electrical discharges in rarefied gases under the influence of electrical oscillations of
a well-defined period, so as to get a deeper insight into their nature. For pro-
ducing regular electric motions the authors adopted the method of Lecher, but
tbey substituted for the induction coil, with its complicated form of discharge, a
Tcipler machine of twenty rotating plates, purchased out of a grant given by the
Elisabeth Thompson fund. The Lecher wires were between 6 and 14 metres long
bv means of bridges resonating circuits of definite period were formed ; the ends of

--the wires were connected with the plates of a Kohlrausch condenser the ' End

Condenser.'
      Like other experimenters, the authors found in the beginning a great difficulty,

sometimes impossibility, in getting a luminosity of the tube laid between or at the

sides of the end condenser, if it was of small diameter. Larger tubes were much
more easily excited. But it was found that tubes, not too small, with inside coatings

of platinum, always gave luminosity, and that if they were brought near other in-
sensitive tubes these also began to glow, and even did so after the exciting tube

had been removed.
--638 REPORT 1892.

     The phenomena are described wliich occurred in different tubes and in different
positions, especially curious dark spaces in the neighbourhood of the condenser's
plates in the vacuum tubes, through which the oscillations passed unabsorbed.
Some cases were discussed in which the discharges ceased in a singular manner by
improving the vacuum.

    The paper is to be published in full in Wiedemann's ' Annalen.' An account

of some of the experiments, with an explanation of them, has been published
«,lready in the ' Verhandi. der Societas Physico-Medica ' of Erlangen, 1892.

4. On Primary and Secondary Batteries in which the Electrolyte is a Gas.
                           By Arthur Schoster, F.Ii.8.

If a current of electricity passes through a vessel which is partially exhausted,

the whole gas contained in the vessel becomes a conductor in the ordinary sense,

and a single cell will send a measurable current through it. This phenomenon,

which may conveniently be called 'secondary conduction,' has been investigated
A"by the author and Professor Arrhenius.
                                          more detailed study during the past

year has brought some interesting phenomena to light. If the secondary electrodes

are platinum and the gas is a hydrocarbon, phenomena of polarisation are observed

·exactly similar to those found when water is decomposed. The electromotive force

of polarisation in that case amounts to about three or four volts. No polarisation

or traces only are found with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, cyanogen, aqueous

vapour, ammonia, and other gases experimented upon, but phosphoretted hydrogen

shows the phenomenon.

    When the electrodes are made of copper or iron no polarisation is observed in

hydrocarbons. On the other hand, when aluminum or magnesium is used it
rises to very high values. Magnesium electrodes, in wliich the secondary current

from thirty Clark cells was allowed to pass for some time, showed a polarisation of

35 volts.
     The polarisation effects are studied just as in the case of liquids by interrupting

the polarising current and connecting the secondary electrodes with a galvanometer

or electrometer.

    When a hydrocarbon is used both electrodes become covered with a thin film,

which shows the colours of thin layers of metallic oxides or sulphides. The fact
that the electromotive force depends so much on the nature of the metal tends to
show that a metallic carbon compound is formed by the action of the primary cur-

rent, and that the effects are analogous to those of the secondaiy battery.

    The author has also studied the currents observed when electrodes of different

metals are inserted into a gas rendered sensitive by the electric discharge.
Arrhenius had already shown that zinc and platinum in air give a permanent
difference of potential under these circumstances. The author finds that, whatever

the gas which has been converted into a conductor by a primary discharge, perma-

nent currents may be obtained from magnesium and platinum electrodes, the
magnesium always being electro-negative. The electromotive force is, however,

different in different gases, and higher, for instance, in oxygen than in hydrogen.

By Professor A. W. Reinold, F.B.S., a?ii Professor A. W. RiJCKEB, F.E.S.

     The authors have found that the specific conductivity of liquids formed of soap
and water, and containing a considerable proportion of glycerine and a small per-
centage of a metallic salt, is the same whether the liquid is in large mass or is
drawn out into a film not thicker than one two hundred thousandth of an inch.
This is not the case if the liquid be formed of soap and water only. In that case
the specific electrical conductivity increases as the film becomes thinner, until for
the thinnest films which have been observed it is about seven times greater than
in a large mass of the same liquid. Newton observed in very thin films (which
appear black) two shades corresponding to two difl'erent thicknesses. The authors
find that this phenomenon is only observed when the liquid consists of soap and
water only, and they have some reason to believe that the ratio of the thicknesses
corresponding to the two tints is about two to one.

 By Magnus Maclean, M.4., F.R.8.E., and Alex. Galt, B.Sc, F.B.S.E.

     The quantity of electricity induced in a secondary circuit by a ')nake in a
primary circuit is equal to the quantity of electricity induced in the same secondary
by a break in the primary. This fact was first experimentally proved by Faraday,
and subsequent experiments and theory corroborate the statement. If, however,
there is a non-metallic gap in the circuit, whether of air at ordinary pressure or
at much reduced pressure, as in vacuum tubes, the break impulse causes
a flow in one direction, and the make causes either no flow, or a much

less flow in the opposite direction ; because the short intense impulse

of the former breaks down the resistance, while the comparatively long and
less intense impulse of the make either does not break down the resistance at all,
or only does so to a much less degree, so that the effective resistance is much
greater in one direction than in the other. To obtain the average diflerence of

quantity of electricity set in motion in one direction above that in the other a
copper electrolytic cell was put in circuit with a vacuum tube and the secondary
coil of a small Ruhmkorff" coil. The solution in the cell was sulphate of copper of
density 1-17 with one-half per cent, of commercial sulphuric acid added. The

electrodes were No. 36 B.W.G. copper wire [0-0102 centimetre diameter] ; and

they were immersed in the solution as little as possible so as to get the best current
density for the deposit. The mean of seven experiments lasting from two to four

hours gives the average electrolytic current, calculated from the gain of the cathode
electrode, as one-sixth of a milliampere. The gain of the cathode electrode was,

in six of the seven experiments, greater than the loss of the anode electrode.

An electrolytic cell was also put into the primary, and the mean ratio, in three

experiments, between the gain of the cathode in the primary and the gain of the

cathode in the secondary was 6,000. The mean current in the secondary was still

about one-sixth of a milliampere.

    Two experiments were also tried without a vacuum tube in the secondary

--circuit simply the electrolytic cell. Both electrodes showed loss. Again, a long

thermometer tube full of sulphate of copper solution was substituted for the
vacuum tube. The resistance of this tube would be comparable to that of the

vacuum tube. [A Thomson multicellular electrometer which was put at the
terminals of the vacuum tube showed 165 volts. This would give the effective

resistance of the vacuum tube to disruptive discharges as 165^^^^=! megohm.]

The few experiments made with this thermometer tube in the circuit are inconclu-
sive, as sometimes both electrodes showed loss, and in an experiment lasting five or

six hours neither electrode showed either gain or loss. These last experiments are

to be continued, with slight modifications. It is also intended to attach a tube to
an exhaust pump, and try these electrolytic experiments at different pressures from

atmospheric pressure down to very low pressures.

A10. Contribution to the Theori/ of the perfect Influence Machine.

                                By J. Gray, B.Sc.

     The theory of the perfect influence machine has been shown by Clerk Maxwell
to be analogous to Oarnot's theory of the perfect heat-engine. Maxwell points
out there is a loss of energy in the ordinary influence machine through sparking at
the contacts, which would render the machine inefficient even though losses from
leakage and the like were completely done away with. Maxwell has described a
machine in which sparking and the loss due to it are eliminated. This is done by
causing the carrier of electricity always to make contact with charging and dis-
charging conductors when the former is at the same potential as the latter. In
the case of the discharging conductors this is done by prolonging the contact
springs to meet the carrier. In case of the charging conductors this is not sufficient
it is necessary to surround the end of their contact springs by two additional con-
ductors charged to an equal and opposite potential, and of such a capacity as will
just reduce to zero the potential of the small quantity of electricity left from the
previous discharge. These additional conductors were called by Maxwell regene-

rators, as being analogous to regenerators in the heat-engine.

     The object of the author is to investigate the efficiency of an influence machine
constructed according to Maxwell's design, and other designs less perfect. This is

--done by drawing a QV (quantity-potential) energy diagram for one revolution of

the carrier. The results obtained are as follows :

British Association in Belfast in 1852, and reprinted in ' Mathematical and Physical

Papers,' art. Iv. In that article it is stated ' that a feeble continued current,
passing out of an electrolytic cell by a zinc electrode, must generate exactly as

much more heat at the zinc surface than the same amount of current would

develop in passing out of an electrolytic cell by a platinum electrode, as a zinc
platinum pair working against great external resistance would develop in the
resistance wire by the same amount of current.'

     In the first set of experiments two equal and similar glass vessels were used
with about 500 c.c. of dilute sulphuric acid in each. The pairs of elements were
Zn, Zn ; Zn, Pt. The rise of temperature, due to currents of from 4 to 14 milli-
amperes, obtained from the Smee cell, was observed at intervals of a few minutes
for about four hours. There are many sources of errors in this mode of experi-
menting, but generally the rise of temperature of the Zn, Zn cell was greater
than that in the Smee cell. In some of the experiments the Smee cell showed a

higher rise of  temperature                                                   but  this  latter result  is  no  doubt  due  to local causes,
                                                                           ;

such as polarisation, &c.

     In the second set of experiments a current of 39 milliamperes was obtained
from the Smee cell, and in every case the rise of temperature of the Zn, Zn cell
was greater than the rise of temperature of the Smee cell, and the average rise
corroborates the statement of Lord Kelvin quoted above.

     In the third set of experiments the two elements in each cell were separated
by a piece of blotting-paper, and four thermometers used to indicate the rise of
temperature at each electrode. It was found that the rise of temperature at the
iinc anode plate was greater than at the zinc cathode.

      In another series of experiments with four cells containing dilute sulphuric

acid in which the pairs of elements were Zn Zn, Pt Pt, Pt Zn, Zn Pt, currents
from an external source of ^, 1, and 2 amperes, were allowed to flow for about an
hour, and the rise of temperature in each cell recorded. Tables of results are
given showing that the rise of temperature in the cell in which the current flowed

from platinum to zinc is in every case higher than the rise of temperature in the
·cell in which the current flows from zinc to platinum. Taking the average of a

number of experiments fairly agreeing among themselves, it is found that the
mean rise of temperature in the four cells above the rise of temperature of the

laboratory is

across the sensitive surface of ordinary gelatino-bromide dry plates. Discharges

(1) from a Wimshurst influence machine, (2) from an induction coil, and (3) from
a Tesla high-frequency coil were among those shown. The entirely distinctive

character of figure produced by positive and bv negative discharges respectively

was very noticeable in all the photographs, the former being of an irregular

description somewhat resembling some forms of seaweed, the latter forming^

straight lines or sweeping curves with feather-like extremities. In fact, while the

negative figures point to something of the nature of momentum in the discharge,

and give the idea of a stream issuing from the electrode and splashing over the

surface of the glass, the positive figures, on the other hand, seem more nearly

allied to streams flowing fi-om the glass to the electrode and sucking from all

Aportions of the plate.  remarkable similarity was noticeable between some of

the figures and organic forms, such as some descriptions of seaweed in the case of
the positive, and feathers or palm-leaves in the case of the negative. The figures

in fact present another curious instance of the remarkable manner in which under-

favourable conditions inorganic matter will assume the structural forms generally

associated with organic life. The figures appear to be accurate representations of

the actual discharges produced by the ordinary photographic action of the lumino-

sity of the latter, and the gelatine film seems to have no appreciable eflect in

altering the form of the discharges, which are the same as those obtained on

plain glass.

6. Slow Oscillations produced on discharging Electric Condensers of great

                    Gapacitij. By James H. Gray, M.A., B.Sc.

About the end of last winter Lord Kelvin asked the author to try to obtain

oscillations on the discharge of a condenser through inductive resistances which
would be slow enough to be observed by means of a mirror-galvanometer. For-
that purpose use was made of a set of eleven large condensers (total capacity about
140 microfarads) which are in the Physical Laboratory of Glasgow University.
The capacity being so large, the author hoped to be able to detect oscillations of

periods comparable with one second without making the ratio of damping in-

conveniently great. Applying the now well-known differential equation

                         d^ Hdq l^ Q
                         GlJhdt''
                         dt           '

where the symbols have their usual meaning, we see that, in order to get slow

oscillations, the resistance of the discharging circuit must be as small as possible
compared with its self-induction, and the capacity of the condenser as great as

can conveniently be made. The author endeavoured to obtain these conditions,
and succeeded in so far that, though the ratio of damping was considerably
removed from unity, it was found possible to record at least three semi-oscillations

on each discbarge. When the frequency of the oscillations is very great (for

example, about 10,000 -per second, as in the experiments of Feddersen, Paalzow,
Blaserna, and others), it is very easy to make the ratio of damping practically

unity ; but when the frequency is only two or three per second, this is very
diificult, and the only way to obtain results is to make the capacity and self-

induction as large as possible. In order to obtain a high self-induction, a large

electro-magnet which formerly belonged to a dynamo was used as part of the
discharging circuit. The diameter of the iron core was 13 centimetres, the
length of each coil of wire being 28^ centimetres. There were on each coil about
44 lbs. of No. 20 B.W.G. covered'copper wire, 7,300 turns, and 28 layers, the
outside diameter of the coils being 18| centimetres. The resistance of each was
about 95 (B.A.) ohms. It was found difficult to adjust the mirror galvanometer

to detect the oscillations, but they were observed by means of a telephone of low
resistance, and distinctly seen when, at the suggestion of Mr. C. T. Littlewood, B.Sc,
a thin strip of sheet iron was placed with one end about 5 millimetres from one

pole of the magnet, so as to vibrate freely. At each semi-oscillation the sheet
iron was attracted. To prove that this was not due merely to the free period

of the strip, the latter was clamped at different distances from the end, and this

was found to make no difference in the time which elapsed between each attrac-

tion as long as the discharging circuit was not altered. When, however, the

resistance was increased without correspondingly increasing the self-induction, the

time between successive attractions was diminished. In order to obtain a perma-

nent record of these attractions, the end of the strip was placed in contact with

sooted paper, which revolved uniformly on a small roller rotating about a vertical

axis. The results obtained showed usually three attractions, and showed very

clearly the effect of including more resistance and more self-induction, with

one or both coils of electro-magnet. This method, however, did not demonstrate

that there was actually a reversal in the current at each semi-oscillation, and

therefore it was abandoned. The recording apparatus of a siphon-recorder was

then used, but it was found to be too delicate for the rough apparatus employed.

Ultimately a long thin permanent magnet was fixed so as to vibrate, with one end

over a pole of the electro-magnet. By this both an attraction and repulsion could

be registered.                                                              The tracings shown give the compound harmonic motions made up

of the free vibrations of the permanent magnet and of the oscillations. The

different tracings show the effect of having both coils in the circuit and of in-

cluding extra coils, some being wound non-inductively and some inductively.

The free vibration of the magnet is also shown. The charging potential was about

no volts.                                     This method and                   the curves are, of  course, not  intended to be used for

quantitative purposes, but are given simply as a verification of the theory of the

oscillatory discharge, and as of interest on account of the oscillations being so

elow.

                                              6. Inducto-Script. By Rev. Frederick J. Smith, M.A.

The well-known breath figures of Moser, Eiess, and Karsten suggested to the

author the idea of producing similar figures on photographic plates; in 1878 an

experinient to determine the action of a discharge from a coin on to a photo-plate

wa8_ tried. The image was produced on development, but very imperfectly.

During the last two years an inductorium or transformer has been under constant

trial. It occurred to the author that probably its high potential might be used to

produce figures similar to those of Karsten : plates of glass were cleaned with care,

and operated on in the way suggested by Karsten, but no results were to be got

Aout of   it                                  probably the potential difference was not great enough.
                   ;

          photo-plate was used in the place of the glass, and on development the

exact pattern of the medal used was produced; this showed that a potential

difference, greatly under that of a jar discharge, or that of an electrical machine,

would upset the chemical equilibrium of the photo-plate. Several factors appeared

to be_ contributing to the result--the potential difference, the gas in which the

experiment was performed, the pressure under which the experiment was done,

the temperature, and the history of the plate previous to the experiment.

It is to be noticed in reading the work on breath figures by Grove and Karsten

that Grove tried to set the image by coating an electrised plate with collodion and

nitrate of silver, and then developed out the word Volta (Grove, ' Correlation of

HePhysical Forces,' 1870, p. 404, § 4).                                         did not let the electrical discharge to act

on the silver salt. Again, Karsten did not succeed in producing a fixed picture on

a daguerreotype plate. He writes : ' If an iodised plate is taken, and a picture

produced thereon, the vapour of mercury will not bring it out, although the image

IS really on the plate, as may be shown by breathing upon it.' Moser appears to

have got out pictures by means of water vapour, but they were not permanent

effects.

Summary of results :

     I. The different gases used were oxygen, carbonic acid gas, air, coal-gas. Far
the best results were obtained in oxygen. Experiments with other gases are now
being made.

II. The effect of pressure. No picture could be obtained in a good vacuum,
                            ;

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  645

only the circular shape of the coin ; as the pressure increased towards the normal
the pictures became more perfect.

     III. The output of the transformer was regulated by resistances put into the
primary circuit, also by the rate at which the reversing commutator was driven

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the reversing commutator is similar to those used in the early Siemens machine,

and driven from a belt in the laboratory.
     IV. The temperature varied between 5° 0. and 100° 0. Perhaps the effects

may have been produced more quickly at the higher temperature, but no very

significant change was apparent.
     V. Similar experiments are about to be performed in many other gases, and

under considerable pressure, up to 10 atmospheres.
      VI. In addition to pictures on photo-plates, good impressions have been

obtained on bromide paper and other papers direct. Pictures can easily be got
from woodcuts after they have been well covered with plumbago and other
conducting substances.

     VII. Impressions can be produced upon photo-plates which have been exposed
to full sunlight previous to an inducto-script experiment. The development of the

electrical picture appears to be independent of the condition of the plate due to

light. Thus an ordinary photograph and an inductograph may be produced on the

same plate.
     VIII. In some cases the plate, on which a good image was formed, was very

carefully insulated, so that it was as far as possible only subject to a quickly
changing potential difference.

     IX. In one experiment a metal pointer was attached to the coil of a siphon
recorder, and nearly touched a ribbon of bromide paper ; on development the
trace was evident. The experiment is now being repeated, under somewhat altered
conditions, to determine the speed at which such signals can be made perfectly.

7. On a Periodic Effect which the Size of Bubbles has on the Velocity of their
    Ascent in Vertical Tubes containing Liquid. By Fred. T. Trouton,

      M.A., D.Sc.

    An account was given of some determinations made of the velocity with which

bubbles of air of difierent sizes ascend vertical tubes containing water. The chief
peculiarity brought out by these experiments is that the velocity of ascent is a
periodic function of the size of the bubbles. The form of the curve, obtained by
plotting the size, i.e., the volume of the different bubbles used as abscissae, and the
corresponding values of the velocity of ascent as ordinates, was exhibited. This
showed that at first, as would be expected, increase in size diminished the velocity,
but that on reaching a certain size the velocity begins to increase in value, then
comes to a maximum (in value about twice that of the minimum velocity), after
which it again diminishes, and so on two or more times, depending on the diameter
of the tube employed. The oscillations in the curve die out in much the same
fashion as that for a pendulum swinging in a viscous medium. The form taken by
the bubbles was also described, being almost spherical at the first minimum
beyond this ' the bubble is pointed at top, and is so until reaching the second
minimum, when it is again rounded at top, and has a waist-like appearance,
having thus a somewhat dumbbell shape, and so on, presenting in this way
similarities to the breaking up of a liquid column through surface tension.

     Experiments were described where liquids which do not mix with water were

--employed instead of air such affording more simple conditions. Also some

experiments similar to those with water, but made with other liquids.

                            8. Experiments on Flame Spectra.
                      By Professor Arthur Smithells, B.Sc.

     The author exhibited his apparatus for separating the two cones of combustion
which constitute a Bunsen flame, and showed how it afl'orded a means of ascer-
                                    --

646 REPORT-- 1892,

taining which part of the flame took part in the production of the spectra ohserved

when metallic salts are introduced into non-luminous flames. The main conclusion

derived was, that spectral eflects are dependent, in the cases investigated, on
radiations produced during chemical change, and not to molecular vibrations

induced by external heating. An experiment was shown in which a spray of a

solution of a copper salt was introduced into the two separated cones of a non-
luminous flame. Decomposition of the salt took place in the inner and hotter
cone without the production of a spectrum, whilst the products of decomposition
on reaching the outer flame tinged it a brilliant green. This spectrum was thus
shown to depend on chemical action, and not merely on external heating, the
action in this case being evidently the formation of copper oxide. The formation
of copper chloride, which could be efi^ected by introducing a thread of asbestos,
moistened with hydrochloric acid, into the outer cone, gave a beautiful blue
colour. Gold chloride similarly employed was decomposed also in the lower cone
without producing a spectrum. The separated gold passed into the upper flame,
which was faintly tinged ; but if a little hydrochloric acid were introduced, a
beautiful green colour (due to gold chloride) was observed. The action between
gold and hydrochloric acid at a temperature above that at which gold chloride
dissociates, and below that at which hydrochloric acid dissociates, seemed highly
anomalous. The author did not wish at present to draw any final conclusions, but
considered that his experiments disclosed the necessity for a thorough study of the
chemical reactions taking place when metallic salts are producing spectra in non-
luminous flames.

       The author exhibited metallic discs constructed for the purpose of illustrating
 the singular theorem that the curve, described by any point in the plane of an
 ellipse, which slides between rectangular guides, can be described by a definite

guides, generally inclined to the former.

     The theorem takes a curiously interesting though obvious form in the simplest
case, -viz., when the ellipse is a hnile straight line ; and then the apparatus also

takes a correspondingly simple form.

6. On Conjugate Circle Oroups. By Lieut.- Colonel Allan Cunningham,

                             R.E., Fellow of King's College, London.

     "When three circles whose centres are SI, a>, Q' are coaxal, and are placed so

Qthat 0) bisects the distance fl', the two circles 12, i2' are said to be conjugate with
respect to the circle w. With several conjugate pairs it is shown that

1. The join of the centres of two non-conjugate circles is equal and parallel to

the join of the centres of their conjugates.

2. The radical axis of two non-conjugate circles is also that of their con-

jugates.

3. The radical centre of any three circles is also that of their conjugates.

A group of four conjugate pairs of circles, arranged in a certain way about a

ABC,triangle     is styled a Bi-conjugate Quartett. Take as example the eight

circles which cut three given circles A, B, C, orthogonally or diametrally.

In this case, in general, the twenty-four pairs of non-conjugate circles have

only nine radical axes, and the fifty -six triplets of circles have only thirteen radical
ABCcentres; the sides and vertices of the triangle
                                                    are the most important,

each side being the radical axis of four pairs, and each vertex the radical centre of

eight triplets.

                           By Charles H. Lees, M.Sc.

This method has been designed to determine the conductivities of liquids when

only small quantities are available. It follows closely the definition of conduc-

Ativity.  cyhnder of thin copper, about 3 cm. diameter and 4 cm. high, has a

copper base 3 mm. thick, and is filled with water in which is placed a coil of wire
--648 REPOET 1892,

tbrougb whicli a current of electricity can be sent. Below this cylinder is placed

another provided with a copper disc at the top, this cylinder being kept cool by

the passage of a stream of cold water through it. Between the two copper discs-

comes the layer, about 1 mm. thick, of the liquid the conductivity of which is to be

determined. The temperatures of the copper discs are determined by means of

Athermo-j unctions.  current is sent through the heating coil till the temperature

of the heating cylinder, as indicated by a thermometer in it, is about 5° above that

of the cooler. By adjusting the current through the coil this temperature excess
can be maintained for any required time. The temperatures of the copper discs

are during this time determined, and from their difl'erence and the amount of

energy supplied by the current to the heater, it would be possible, if there were

no loss of heat due to radiation, to determine the thermal conductivity of the

liquid between the discs. By another experiment this loss can, however, be deter-

mined and subtracted from the total loss, and thus the conductivity found. In

another form of the apparatus this correction is got rid of by surrounding the

heater with an annular vessel, separated from it by a layer of non-conductor.

This outer vessel is also provided with a heating coil, and by means of rheostats

in circuit the temperature of both heaters, as indicated by thermometers in them,

is kept the same. The energy supplied to the inner heater is then merely that

necessary to compensate the loss of energy due to conduction through the layer of

liquid at the base of the cylinder, so that the conductivity of the liquid is readily

found from the observations.

7. On Graphic Solution of Dynamical Problems.

The method of drawing meridional curves of capillary surfaces of revolution,,

described in ' Popular Lectures and Addresses,' vol. i., 2nd edition, pp. 31-42, and

^^''* '              illustrated by woodcuts made from large scale curves, worked
                     out according to it with great care by Professor Perry when

                     a student in the Natural Philosophy Class of Glasgow

                     University, suggests a corresponding method for the solution

                     of dynamical problems.

                     In dynamical problems regarding the motion of a single

                     particle in a plane, it gives the following plan for drawing

                     any possible path under the influence of a force of which

                     the potential is given for every point of the plane. Suppose,

                     for example, it is required to find the path of a particle pro-

                     jected in either direction, with any given velocity, in any

                     given direction through any given point P^, (fig. 1). Calcu-

                     late the normal component force at this point ; and divide

                     the square of the velocity by this value, to find the radius

                     of curvature of the path at that point. Taking this radius

                     on the compasses, find the centre of curvature, C,,, in the

                     line, PqK, perpendicular to the given direction through Pq,

                     and describe a small arc, Pj,P,Qj, making PjQi equal to
                     about half the length intended for the second arc. Calculate

the altered velocity for the position Qj, according to the potential law; and, as
before for P^,, calculate a fresh radius of curvature for Q, by finding the nonnal
component force for the altered direction of normal and for the velocity corre-

    The initial point Pq was taken on one of the lines cutting the axes of x and y at
A45°, and at first at a random distance from the origin.                    trial curve was worked

according to the method described above, and was found to cut the axis of y at an
oblique angle. Other trial curves, with unchanged energy-constant, were worked
from initial points at greater or less distances from the origin, until a curve was

found to cut the axis of y perpendicularly. This curve is one-eighth part of the
orbit ; and is shown in fig. 2 repeated eight times, in order to complete the orbit

which is symmetrical on the two sides of the axes of x and y.
    As an interesting case of motion related to the Lunar Theory, suppose the mass
of the moon be infinitely small in comparison with the mass of the earth, and the

earth and sun to have uniform motions in circles round their centre of gravity.

    From equations (12) and (13), G. W. Hill has, with four different values of E,

found 0.' and y explicitly in terms t, for the particular solution in each case which
gives the simplest 07-bit (relatively to the revolving plane XOY), of which the one
which presents the greatest deviation from the well-known ' variational ' oval of
the elementary lunar theory, is a symmetrical curve with two outwardly pro-

jecting cusps corresponding to the moon in quadratures. He supposed this to be

the most extreme deviation from the variational oval possible for an orbit
surrounding the earth. Poincar6, in his ' M(5thodes Nouvelles de la M6canique
Celeste,' 1892, p. 109, admiring justly the manner in which Hill has thus ' si
magistralement ' studied the subject of finite closed lunar orbits, points out that there
are solutions corresponding to looped orbits, transcending Hill's, wrongly supposed

extreme, cusped orbit. Mr. Hill tells me that he accepts this criticism. The

labour of working out a fairly accurate analytical solution for any of Poincar6's
looped orbits, by Hill's method, would probably be very great. I have therefore

thought it might interest others besides ourselves to apply my graphic method to

the drawing of at least one of Poincar^'s looped orbits, in our Physical (and

Arithmetical) Laboratory in the University of Glasgow. Fig. 3 represents a

looped orbit, which has been worked out accordingly by Mr. Magnus Maclean,
Chief Official Assistant of the Professor of Natural Philosophy from the equations

B8. eduction of every prohlem of Two Freedoms in Conservative Dynamics, to

     the drawing of Geodetic Lines on a Surface of given Specific Curvature.

    By Lord Kelvin, Pres.B.S.

     1. Any conservative case of two-freedom motion is proved to be reducible to a

corresponding case of the motion of a material point in a plane.

     2. In plane conservative dynamics, with any given value for the energy constant,

E, the resultant velocity, q, at any point (.r, y) is a known function of Qi; y), being

given by the equation                                         (1)

         ....y^ = 2(E-V)

Vwhere denotes the potential at (.r, y) ; and every problem depends on drawing

lines for which qds (the Maupertuis 'action') is a minimum.

     3. Considering any part, S, of the infinite plane, find a surface, S', such that

Cany infinitesimal triangle A' B' drawn on it has its sides equal to 2 of those of

A Ba corresponding triangle  C in the field, S, of our plane  problem                               g^ denotmg
                                                                                                 ;

Bythe value of y at any particular point (.i\,, «/,,) in the plane.  the principle of

least action we see instantly that the lines on S', corresponding to paths on S, are

geodetic. Thus the adynatmc case of motion of a particle on S' is found as a

perfect and complete representative of the motion on the plane surface S, under

force with any arbitrarily given function, V, for its potential, and any particular

given value, E, for the total energy of the moving particle.

     4. It is proved easily that the surface, S', to be found according to §3, exists

and that its specific curvature (Gauss's name for the product of its two principal

curvatures) at any point is equal to

                                      goV log q

practical usefulness of this method in dynamics, the problem of the parabolic

A3. Magnetic Curve Tracer. By Professor J. A. EwiNG, F.B.S.

The instrument traces complete curves for cyclic or other processes of magnetisa-

tion. The material whose magnetisation curve is to be determined is arranged to form

a magnetic circuit with a narrow gap in it, and in this gap a conducting wire is
Atightly stretched.
                     constant current passing along this wire causes it to sag up or

dovTU across the lines of force in the gap. Its movements, which are proportional

to the magnetism of the magnetic circuit, are communicated to a mirror which is

pivoted on a single needle-point, and is capable of being deflected in azimuth

as well as in altitude. The sag of the wire gives the mirror movement in

altitude. At the same time the mirror receives azimuthal deflection from another

stretched wire, which is stretched in a narrow gap between the poles of another

magnet. This second wire carries the variable current which is used to produce

the magnetisation of the first magnetic circuit, and the magnetic field in which it

is stretched is kept constant. Its movements are therefore proportional to the

magnetising current of the main circuit. In this way the mirror receives deflec-

tions in azimuth which are proportional to the magnetising force as well as deflec-

tions in altitude which are proportional to the magnetisation. Complete curves for

such operations as double reversal of magnetism are readily traced out, and may

be photographed by allowing the spot of light to fall on a sensitive plate, or may

be marked by following its movements on a sheet of paper with a pencil. The

instrument allows all the phenomena of magnetic hysteresis to be examined with

great readiness. The magnetic circuit which is under test is arranged in such a way

that the specimens of metal composing it may be quickly removed and replaced by

others. The instrument thus forms a practical magnetic tester capable of workshop

use in determining the magnetic qualities of any samples of iron or steel. When

the magnetic circuit is laminated the instrument allows magnetic reversals to be

performed with sufiicient speed to make the mirror trace out a continuous line of

light upon the screen. For very high speeds a pair of independent mirrors may

be preferred, arranged to give the beam of light its two components of motion by

successive reflexion. The arrangement is equivalent to the combination of an

extremely dead-beat galvanometer with an equally dead-beat magnetometer. The

galvanometer portion may be used alone in cases demanding the use of a current-

measuring instrument with a very high frequency of free oscillation ; and by

making the magnetic fields in both gaps constant, and sending variable currents

through both the stretched wires, the relations of the currents as to period and

phase may be studied.

The instrument exhibited is sufficiently dead-beat to allow cycles of magnet-
 654 REPOET--1892.

 isation to be gone through at any frequency up to twenty cycles per second without
causing any serious disturbance of the diagram to arise from the inertia of the
working parts, a continuous-current commutator being used to effect the reversals.
The general character of the diagram is the same at this speed as at any lower

speed. The presence of an air-gap in the magnetic circuit may be allowed for by

 giving the diagram which shows the relation of magnetism to magnetising force a
shear backwards through such an angle as will compensate for the shearing effect
of the air-gap. This can be automatically done in the magnetic curve tracer by
placing the fixed point about which the mirror turns in such a position that the two
components of motion are inclined not at right angles at an angle which exceeds a
right angle by the amount of the shear that is required to rectify the diagram.

                 4. On a Magnetic Balance and its Practical Use.
                               By Dr. H. E. J. G. du Bois.

      This instrument is intended to afford an easy and reliable means of determining
magnetic curves or hysteresis loops of materials used in machine construction. One
test-piece is cut to 15 cm. length, and by means of a template is best turned down
so as to have 1 cm.^ cross-section ; this obviates all further calculation. Its circuit
is completed by two end-pieces and a massive yoke, excentrically supported ; the
resulting moment is compensated by weights sliding on a divided horizontal scale,
on which the values of the magnetisation are directly read in absolute units. The
value of the magnetising field is given by multiplying the current in the coil into
ten. In plotting the results abscissae are measured from an ' instrumental direc-
trix,' inclined towards the left from the axis of ordinates. The apparatus was
exhibited to the Section, as well as half a dozen test-pieces, and the curves obtained
for them.

       9. On the Dielectric of Condensers.^ By W. H, Preece, F.B.S.

      Artificial cables are very useful adjuncts to the laboratory of the telegraph

engineer. They not only enable him to experiment at his leisure, but they form
very useful means to test and compare high-speed and delicate telegraph apparatus,
and especially telephones. I have one, made some years ago, which has been in
incessant use, composed of fifty-four inductionless coils of insulated copper wire,
each giving 33 ohms' resistance, and having a condenser of one microfarad capacity

     ' Lord Kelvin proposes to call this useful instrument a 'Leyden,' because the
term 'condenser' is applied to other more appropriate mechanical and physical
apparatus.

at the juncture of each pair of coils and one at the termination of the series. This
represented a circuit of a total capacity (k) of 54 microfarads, and of a total resist-
ance (r) of 1782 ohms, the ke being 96228. This was equivalent to an ordinary
submarine cable of 162 nauts length. It was not sufficient for our growing wants,
and another similar set was recently made, of the same dimensions and materials,
and in the same way. But it did not give the same results. The resistances were

exactly the same, but the individual capacities differed. This difference, of nearly

5 per cent., was, of itself, of no practical consequence for the particular purpose
for which the cable was constructed, but, on carefully comparing the two ' cables '

with telephones, it was found that with the same nominal kr the one gave 30 per

cent, better results than the other. This was a surprising and unexpected result.

I thought it might be due to inductance, but none, neither self nor mutual, could

be detected.

     The insulation, taken after one minute's electrification, of each was :

                       Old cable 172'8 megohms per naut,

                       New ,, 82-8 ,,  ,,,,

80 that the difference was in favour of the old one. But the electrification of the
new one was much superior to that of the old one. The difference in resistance
reading between the first and second minute of the former was 5\,th of that of the

Ifittsr

     Each cable was then rapidly charged and discharged 1,200 times, at varying
rates, with an E.M.F. of 40 volts, and the cumulative remaining charge in each
case read by deflection on a Thomson galvanometer. This was done by passing
a 10-foot length of perforated slip through a Wheatstone's automatic transmitter.

myphone circuits, and it accounts partially for tbe great difference in     ke law

between the observed effects of aerial and those of subterranean, or submarine,

conductors. The former are always much superior to the latter. This would be

due to the absence of polarisation in air as well as to other electromagnetic and

electrostatic causes. No work would be done on the molecules of air, no energy

would therefore be absorbed, and no retardation of currents from this cause would

                10. Earth-currents. By W. H. Preece, F.B.S.

     The year 1892 has been remarkable in tbe number and severity of those electric
storms which interfere so seriously with telegraphic communication. Unfortu-
nately, observations made upon them on working circuits are rarely reliable. Their
arrival and departure are sudden ; they come when they are least expected, and
they occur in busy hours, when the wires are fully occupied with more remunera-
tive currents, and when the staff is fully engaged. Their presence, duration, and

relative intensity are so exactly coincident with magnetic disturbances that the

recorded observations in magnetic observatories of needle variations may be taken

to indicate tbe same elements of earth-currents also, but they do not give their

direction or their absolute intensity. Their general direction is determined by

the simultaneous observation of many circuits running in many directions, and
noting the lines of maximum and those of no disturbance. This gives the position

of the equipotential planes on the surface of the earth, and the intensity of the
currents gives the difference of potential between these planes.

      I have not succeeded in obtaining definite facts to prove that these planes are
perpendicular to the line joining the centre of the earth and the centre of the sun,
but there is little doubt that it is so, for telegraph circuits running in this direction

experience the maximum disturbances, while those running at right angles on the
equipotential planes suffer no disturbance. Those that experience the maximum

disturbance in the forenoon are not affected in the evening, and vice versd.
     The storms commenced on January 4, and they have been observed at frequent

intervals since.

    The great storms occurred on February 13, March 12, April 24-27, May 18,

July 16.

    The intensity of the maximum currents observed in England frequently ex-
ceeded '045 ampere (or 45 milliamperes), which much exceeds in strength the
working currents. Hence ordinary telegraph working was paralysed, and we had

to resort to metallic circuits and to the use of condensers to maintain telegraphic
communication.

     The effect of such currents on our railways might be positively dangerous, for
they ring bells and reverse the block signals.

     ·045 ampere means '54 volt per mile, so that the equipotential planes differing
by 1 volt would have been placed about two miles apart.

     These earth-currents, though variable, are always continuous, and give no in-

dication of alternations.

     The simultaneous appearance of aurorse shows that disturbances on the sun's
photosphere, as indicated by sun-spots, produce electrostatic and electromagnetic
effects on the earth's surface of enormous magnitude.

     The appearance of earth-currents is invariably simultaneous over the whole

globe.

    Observers abroad would benefit science if they would record the maximum

strength, in milliamperes, of the currents received, the geographical direction of

the terminal earths of the circuits affected and unaffected, the resistance in ohms
of the circuits on which the currents are measured, and if they were to give the
times of observation in Greenwich and not in local time.

    Permeability of Magnetite. Bij Edwin H. Barton, B.Sc, and W.

      Williams, B.Sc.

     1. After being' eng'aged for some time upon the ' Magnetic Survey of the
United Kingdom,' Professor Riicker put forward his ' Theory of Terresti'ial Mag-
netism ' C Proc. Royal Soc.,' vol. xlviii. June 19, ISiJO, ' Relation between
Magnetic Permeability of Rocks and Regional Disturbances ').

     In connection with this theory it was desirable to ascertain the permeabilities of
various rocks both at ordinary and high temperatures.

     The investigation referred to in the present preliminary note is an instalment in

this direction.

     2. Professor Riicker proposed this imdertaking, and indicated the plan to be
pursued. It was then carried out under his supervision at the Royal College of
Science, London, as follows:

    W. Williams worked out the theory of the method, calculated what coils would

be suitable, and wound them accordiugl)^

     E. H. Barton arranged the apparatus, eliminated disturbances, took the
observations, and plotted the results.

     3. For measuring the susceptibility of the magnetite the ballistic method was

adopted.

     Since the specimen was to be exposed to high temperatures, the coil to receive
it was insulated with asbestos paper, and wound upon a porcelain tube. The
secondary coil was further insulated from the primary by two sheets of mica to
obviate the probability of leakage between the two.

     The temperature of the magnetite, when heated, was estimated from the con-
sequent E.M.F. of a thermo-electric couple of platinum and osmium-iridium.

                                                                    Fig. 1.

being meanwhile at ordinary temperatures.

     The arrangement adopted for obtaining the sulphur vapour and the tempera-
ture assigned to it were those published by Messrs. Callander and Griffiths.'

     4. The electrical connections used for measurmg. the induction effects are
diagrammatically represented below (fig. 2).

     5. Eight distinct disturbances were dealt with. Some of them were eliminated,
others measured, and the necessary correction applied when deducing the true

effect due to induction.

    6. The result obtained may be exhibited by a curve whose abscissfe are the

temperatures of the magnetite, and whose ordinates are proportional to the induc-
tion effects due to its presence, the impressed magnetic field being constant.

     Commencing at ordinary temperatures, it is seen, from the curve, that the
susceptibility for the specimen used rose gradually at first with increase of tem-

perature, reached a maximum at 325° C, then fell away, being zero at 557° C

                      with temperature. Impressed magnetic field constant.

O'C  SOO'

    The sharp peak in the curve at 325° C, though apparently anomalous, was
confirmed by a careful repetition of the measurements in that region. It cannot
therefore be regarded as due to experimental errors.

     7. The impressed magnetic field (treating the primary solenoid as infinitely
long) was 4-8 c.g.s. units. The actual field within the specimen of magnetite
(when cold) was of the order 3'4 c.g.s. units.

     8. The determination of the absolute values of the permeability for the various

temperatures is not yet completed. When this has been done we hope to publish

a fuller account of the methods and result of the investigation.

                            By the Rev. T. J. Smith, M.A.

    By the ' magBetic curve ' is here meant a stream-line in plane space due to a

source and an equal sink, or to two equal sources. The author gives a short
description of a method for drawing it by the use of linkages. Suppose that the
source and sink are in a horizontal line at distance a apart. Attach two strings of

--equal length one to the point at which the source is fixed, another to the point at

which the sink is placed. Attach the other ends of these strings to the ends of a

--rod, whose length is equal to a, which can move in a horizontal line the one

string being attached to those ends of the two equal lines of length a which are
nearest together, while the other is attached to the extreme ends. If the middle

points of the cords be now weighted, and the movable line of length a be slid along

liorizontally, the point of intersection of the lines proceeding from the source and
sink traces the required curve. If the middle point of the cord attached to the
near ends of the lines of length a be attached to a string which passes round a
pulley placed vertically over the middle point of the cord (so that the cord is
stretched upwards instead of downwards) the intersection of the cord, which is
attached to one of the fixed points, with the prolongation of the other cord, which
is attached to the other fixed point, traces a stream-line due to two equal sources
placed at these points.

                          3. Certain Volume Effects of Magnetisation.

              By Professor Cargill G. Knott, B.Sc, F.B.S.E.

     Five tubes of Swedish iron and five tubes of Bessemer steel were made of the
same length (45'7 cm.) and of the same external diameter (1'92 cm.). The tubes
were distinguished in each case by number, No. 1 having the widest bore, and No.
5 the narrowest bore. The diameters of the bores were in order, 3-19, 2'.56, 1-93,
1-40, and 0'7 cm. Each tube was clo?ed below, and into the upper end a nut
screwed tightly, through a perforation in which issued a fine capillary glass tube.
The nut was adjusted under water, so that the whole interior space of the metal

tube was filled with liquid, and also part of the glass tube. When the tube was

set vertically in the heart of the magnetising coil, the changes of volume were
measured by the motions of the liquid meniscus in the capillary tube. These
motions were observed by a powerful microscope.

     The changes of volume were observed as each field was applied and removed,
first in one direction and then in the other. If this alternation of direction of field
were not adopted the metal tube got into a magnetically biassed condition. This
magnetic bias was particularly noticeable when the field applied was smaller than
the field that had just been previously applied. After exposure to a high field the
tube could be neutralised by reversals in the well-known fashion.

     In the following brief abstract of the broad effects, the iron tubes are named by

Roman numerals, and the steel ones by Arabic, and the dilatation is regarded as
positive when the core space enlarges, and negative when it contracts. jN'os. I, 1,

and 2, show negative dilatations in fields lower than from 100 to 200 c.g.s. units,
and positive dilatations in higher fields. Nos. II., III., and IV. (all iron) give
negative dilatations throughout, up to the highest fields used. No. V. begins with
positive dilatation in very low fields, but in moderate and high fields behaves like
II., III., and IV. In IV. and V. the negative dilatation increases rapidly in high
fields and shows no sign of reaching a limit up to a field of 1,400 luiits. No. 3
(steel) begins with positive dilatation in low fields, and continues so throughout,
approaching a limit as the ],40U field is reached. Nos. 4 and .5 begin with positive
dilatation^, attain a sharp maximum, and aljove fields of 300 and 200 respectively
show negative dilatations, which grow rapidly in higher fields as in the case of the
iron tubes IV. and V. In the following scheme are given the measured values
(multiplied by 10') of the dilatations for all the tubes in fields 100, 1,000, and in

fields in which a maximum or minimum is obtained, if such a maximum or mini-

mum exist. The values of these last-named fields differ for the different tubes, and

                                                                                                                     un 2

        9. Proof that Density of Illumination does not affect Absorption.

                                 By W. Peddie, D.Sc.

    When parallel rays of light pass through a medium which exercises no

absorptive influence, the intensity of the light is not diminished as it proceeds.

When the medium is absorptive, it is assumed as a basis for the theory of radiation

that if the intensity of the light be reduced in a given ratio on passage through a
given thickness of the medium, it will be further reduced in the same ratio on
passage throagh an additional equal thickness. There is strong indirect evidence

that this assumption is correct. Professor Stokes suggested long ago a direct
method of testing the point. In his method the light is reflected at nearly
perpendicular incidence from the surface of glass, and two equal portions of the

--absorbing medium are used one being placed in the course of one half of the

incident light, the other in the course of the other half after reflection. Assuming
that reflection is not aflected by intensity, we thus get a direct test of the question.
The author has used diverging light passing through two double-image prisms, a
plate of quartz being interposed between them, and a lens being used for the

purpose of proper definition. By rotation of one diprism, and by varying the
thickness of the quartz, we can match closely any colour of the absorbing medium,
and also get the complementary colour. One portion of the absorbing medium is

inserted in the course of one ray, the other in the course of the similarly coloured
ray, but at a diflerent distance from the point of divergence. Surface-coloured glass

was used in the experiments described. No difl'erence of absorption was evident,

although the intensity varied from one to 1,000, and a change of intensity alone
(unaided by colour comparison) of one part in 100 could be detected.

           10. Physical Conditions of the Waters of the English Channel.

                              By H. N. Dickson, F.B.S.E.

    DCareful determinations of the value of Dittmar's ' ' for numerous samples

obtained at different seasons of the year show that the waters of the English
Channel are uniform and constant in composition, at least as far east as the Isle of

DWight. The mean value of was 1'4550, a result in exact agreement with that

found by Dr. Gibson for water collected in the Moray Firth, which he believed
had come from the Atlantic.

     The normal distribution of temperatua'e seems to be that in summer the coldest

--water, and in winter the warmest, is found in mid-channel the difl'erence

decreasing in summer and increasing in winter as we go eastward. Excluding a

thin surface layer, the temperature is nearly uniform at all depths.

     The principal exception to this rule occurs in the west of Start Bay, where a
mass of water, cut ott' from the general tidal circulation, is subject to peculiar
temperature conditions through the want of mechanical mixing.

   12. On the General Laws of Energetics. By Professor W. Ostwald.

     The mechanical law of the virtual velocities, or, more properly, of the virtual
work, is only a special case of a much more general law, holding good for all
forms of energy except radiant energy. The condition of equilibrium of every
energetic system can be found by summing up the virtual or correlative variations
of the various forms of energy and putting the sum equal to zero. In order to

--express these virtual variations each energy must be written as a product of two

factors its capacity and its intensity.

    As this calculus leads to the same results as those obtained up to the present

by the application of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible to prove
that this second law is another case of the same general law of energetics, which
662 EEPOET-- 1892.

the author proposes to call the second \a.w of energetics, the law of conservation of

energy being the first law. This second law may be expressed in words in the
Afollowing way :
                  perpetuum mobile of the second order is impossible. By a

perpetuuui mobile of the second order is meant an engine by means of wliich

energy in equilibrium {e.g., heat of constant temperature, or electric energy of

constant potential) could be converted into work or some other form of energy.

        13. On a Delicate Calorimeter, By J. A. Harker, D.Sc, and

                                           P. J. Hartog, B.8c.

     The authors have devised a calorimeter similar in principle to the Bunsen
ice-calorimeter, but in which the ice is replaced by pure solid acetic acid. Thi&
substance melts at about the normal temperature of rooms, and, moreover, yields a
considerably larger volume change per calorie than ice. The instrument will, it is-
hoped, prove specially useful for thermo-chemical measures with small quantities of
material, and for physiological work.

14. Some Notes connected with the Electromotive Force of a Secondary

       Battery. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone, F.B.S., and W. Hibbert.

     It has been recently shown by the autliors that the changes in E.M.F. in a
secondary battery depend mainly on the strength of the sulphuric acid that ia
against the working surfaces of the plates. If both plates be immersed in the
strongest acid the E.M.F. is 2'60 volts. On continuing the investigation the
authors have just found that, while lead against lead peroxide in pure water

gives 1-36 volt, lead in water against lead peroxide in the strongest sulphuric acid
gives 0-32 volt, and lead peroxide in water against lead in the strongest sulphuric

acid gives 0-89 volt. The sum of these is 2-57 volts, nearly the same as the figure
given above. By Lord Kelvin's thermo-electrical law it may be calculated that
when both plates are immersed in the strongest sulphuric acid the E.M.F. will be
2()2 volts, and when immersed in water 1-35 volt. This is in close agreement
with experiment. For intermediate strengths, however, theory and experiment
do not equally coincide. The authors are at present examining this point,'and
have found that the E.M.F. increases when the temperature rises, and they have
made a determination of the temperature coefficient, using a 14-7-per-cent. acid,
and find it 0-0136 volt per degree of temperature.

The President delivered the following' Address :

In endeavouring to prepare myself to properly fulfil the duties of President of

this section, to vphich I have been elected, and for which honour I am much
indebted to the council and members of the Association (although I am only too

well aware that the position might have been more eificiently filled by many

others), I naturally looked at the reports of the previous meetings held in Edin-

burgh in 1834, 1850, and 1871, and it appears that on the first two occasions an

address was not given by the President, a custom the discontinuance of which I
have, at the present moment, much reason to regret.

At the meeting in 1834 a committee was appointed, consisting of Dr. Dalton,

Dr. Hope, Dr. T. Thomson, Mr.Whewell, Dr. Turner, Professor Miller, Dr. Gregory,

Dr. Ohristison, Mr. K. Phillips, Mr. Graham, Professor Johnston, Dr. Faraday,

Professor DanieU, Dr. Clark, Professor Gumming, and Dr. Prout, to report at tlie

next meeting their opinion on the adoption of a uniform set of chemical symbols,

Dr. Turner to be secretary.

In the following year the report contains : ' Report of the Committee on

Chemical Notation. Dr. Turner, the chairman of the committee appointed to take

into consideration the adoption of a uniform system of chemical notation, made a

report to the following eflPect :

' 1. That the majority of the Committee concur in approving of the employment

of that system of notation which is already in general use on the Continent, though

there exists among them some difference of opinion on points of detail.

' 2. That they think it desirable not to deviate in the manner of notation from

algebraic usage except so far as convenience requires.

    *3. That they are of opinion that it would save much confusion if every

chemist would always state explicitly the exact quantities which he intends to

represent by his symbols.

' Dr. Dalton stated to the Chemical Section his reasons for preferring the

symbols which he had himself used from the commencement of the atomic theory

in 1803 to the Berzelian system of notation subsequently introduced. In his

opinion regard must be had to the arrangement and equilibrium of the atoms

(especially elastic atoms) in every compound atom, as well as to their number and

Aweights.  system either of arravgements without weights, or of weights without

arrangements, he considered only half of what it should be.'

664 EEPOBT-- 1892.

     ^Ve can all sympathise with the members of the Section of 1834 in their desire

to obtain a imifoini system of chemical notation, for at that time several very
different systems seem to have been in use. Although the report is a short one, it
i)robably directed the attention of chemists to the desirability of avoiding confusion

 3y the use of various systems, and since that period many advances have been

made.

     There is now little necessity for every chemist to ' state explicitly the exact

quantities which he intends to represent by his symbols ' for the accurate determi-

--nations of atomic weights by many chemists and we must not omit to mention the

work of Stas (whose death we have had to deplore since the last meeting of the

--British Association) have given us a series of numbers which are in the hands of

all chemists, so that, except in the cases where great refinement is requisite (or

when the atomic weight has not been universally accepted) there is no need to

state the values of the symbols.

     That great advances have been made in chemical notation is well known to all
even in my own short experience I have had to learn several different methods.

When I began to work at chemistry I was told that sulphate of lead was to be
expressed by the formula PbO,S03. Ilofmann taught me that it should be PbSO,

then Gerhardt doubled the atomic weights of oxygen and sulphur, and the formula
became PbjSO^ ; Oannizzaro showed that the atomic weight of lead should also be
doubled, and the formula again became PbSOj, but representing twice as much as

formerly; then Frankland taught me to write SOjPbo" as the expression of the

graphic formula

                                           oo

                                      //^\

which not only states that the compound contains 207 of lead, 32 of sulphur, and

64 of oxygen, but that the sulphur is hexad, and is combined with two atoms of

dyad oxygen, and witli a dyad compound radical containmg one atom of lead and

two  of  oxygen                                 and  of  all  the  formulae  just  given  this  is  the  only one which
                                             ;

satisfies the requirements which Dalton thought necessary in 1835, namely, to

indicate not only the weights of the elements present, but also their arrangeujent.

It may be objected that we do not know that this formula really represents the

arrangements of the atoms in plumbic sulphate, but there can be very little doubt

that the four atoms of oxygen in the compound are not all in the same condition,

for if we examine the properties of sulphuric acid (from which the sulphate of lead

is derived by the replacement of the hydrogen by lead), we find that two of the

atoms of oxygen are more closely associated with the hydrogen than are the other

sulphur may be capable of combining with six monad atoms, although no such

compound is yet known, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that sulphuric

acid is really

     What the nature of the attraction that holds the atoms together may be is not

known, but it is more probably of a character similar to that of gravity wliicli
holds together sun and planets "than of the nature of cohesion which would hold
the atoms rigidly together ; the atoms in each molecule are therefore most probably
in a state of rotation around, or of vibration to and from, the central atom which
holds them together. The pictorial representation in a plane does not therefore
truly express the position of the atoms, but merely the relations existing between
them. In organic chemistry the use of formulae expressing such a relation has
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                       665

ibecotue inditipensable, and in inorganic chemistry I believe such a sj'stem is very

\ useful.

       Recently this system has been found insufficient for the requirements of organic

chemistry, and recourse has been had to the figure of a tetrahedron to represent

the atom of carbon, other atoms being attached to the solid angles ; in this way

the position of the atoms in space is more or less expressed.

    There are many cases, however, in which the atomicity theory fails us. At first

it seemed probable that the atomicity of an element varied in pairs of attractions,
that is, an element might be monad, triad, or pentad, but not dyad or tetrad ; or it
might be dyad, tetrad, or hexad, but not triad or pentad ; but some great difficulties
have been encountered. Thus nitrogen, which is pentad in ammonic chloride and
triad in ammonia, forms the compound nitric oxide, NO, in which it would appear

to be dyad; it has been suggested, however, that in this body the nitrogen is really

Nowtriad, and that it possesses a ' free bond.'  the idea of a ' free bond ' seems

contrary to the principles of atomicity, since it is on the belief that such a free

bond is impossible that the explanation of the existence of elementary molecules is

founded, for it is said that when hydrogen is liberated two atoms unite to form a

molecule, so that their mutual attractions may be satisfied. Nevertheless nitric

oxide is a very active body, uniting readily with other substances, so the free bond

seems to be on the look-out for other kinds of matter, but to have no attraction for

the free bond of another molecule of nitric oxide. As the molecule of nitric
peroxide is variable by alterations of temperature, being N.^O^ at low and NO^ at

liigh temperatures, it seemed not impossible that at the ordinary atmospheric

temperature nitric oxide was a simplified or dissociated molecule, and that if the
temperature were sufficiently reduced it would be found that its molecule would be
NjOo, and thus it would contain triad nitrogen without a free bond. The density
of the gas has, however, been determined at a temperature as low as --73°. and

the molecule is still NO. Another important exception to the variation of the
atomicity of an element in pairs was furnished by the investigations of Sir Henry

Roscoe on the chlorides of vanadium : this element, which, from analogy, should
be a triad or a pentad, appears to form a chloride of the composition VCl^. Again,
the molecule of peroxide of chlorine is CIO.,, which would make chlorine a tetrad

 or the compound must have a free bond.
' Another set of phenomena which the atomicity theory will not explain is the

 existence of well-detined crystalline salts containing what is called water of crystal-
 lisation. This water is in many cases held with considerable pertinacity, the body
 appearing to be a veritable chemical compound. But water appears to be a
 saturated body, the attractions of the oxygen being satisfied by those of the
 hydrogen. It is true that water acts vigorously on other compounds, as on metallic
 oxides to form hydrates, and on some anhydrides to form acids; but these appear
 to be phenomena of double decomposition ; thus the combination of water with
 sodic oxide and nitric anhydride respectively may be expressed by the equations

OH2 + ONa,, = OHNa + ONaH and

OH2 + 0(NO,)j = OHCNO^) + 0(NO,)H.

In the combination of water with an anhydrous salt, a phenomenon often accom-
panied by great rise of temperature, there doe^ not appear to be a double decompo-
sition. That tliere is a chemical combination of some sort is shown by the changes
of properties produced, crystalline form and colour being both sometimes altered.
Compounds so produced have been called ' molecular compounds ' to imply that

saturated molecules are in some way or another combined, the combination being

different from 'atomic combination,' in which the atoms are directly united accord-
ing to their valencies. Another explanation has been sugge-sted by assuming that
there is some ' residual affinity ' not saturated by the constituents of the body, and
that this residual affinity enables bodies to unite in a less stable manner than in

--most compounds. But are not these terms 'molecular combination ' and 'residual
-- --affinity' analogous to the term 'catalysis,' merely words to express not to explain

--what we do not imderstand ? If ' residual affinity ' really exists, it must reside

in the oxygen of the water, or in the hj^drogen, or in both ; if so, what will happen
to some of the complex constitutional formulae of the organic chemist in which
the carbon is tetrad, the oxygen dyad, and the hydrogen monad ? If any of these
elements have a residual affinity should we not expect to find additional unions
between some of the atoms of the same molecule over and above those repre-

sented by the formula ?

    Oxygen may be tetrad, for which there is evidence in OAg^. Under these cir-
cumstances water is by no means a saturated compound, and there would be no

difficulty in explaining the combination of water with oxygen salts. Thus crys-

tallised magnesic sulphate, MgSO^, TOH, or SOHo.jMgo", eOH^ would be

     There is certainly a symmetry about the formula, and it will be found that sixteeru

of the molecules of water are in a different position from the remaining eight ; this

probably has no significance, although Graham found that crystallised alum at a

temperature of 61° lost eighteen molecules of water ; if be had used a temperature

a few degrees lower he might have found that only sixteen passed off

    By a little stretching of the imagination and altering the atomicities of the
elements to suit each particular case, no doubt graphic formuL-e might be made for
all crystalline salts, but they would be perfectly artificial, and not much good is

likely to come from the attempt.                                                                                                                                                                                *^'"^' '^*

    I fear we are driven to the conclusion that, notwithstanding all the progress
that has been made in chemical science during the last fifty-eight years, we have

mnot yet reached a method of notation that would have satisfied Dr. Dalton 1834.

But since that time we have learnt that our formulse ought to show even more-
than the number and position of the atoms of a compound ; we should like them to

indicate the amount of potential energy residing in a body, and our equations ought

to indicate the amount of heat generated by a chemical change. Let us hope that

before the next meeting of the British Association in Edinburgh these desirable

developments will have been accomplished.

   A short time ago I mentioned the word ' catalysis ' as being employed to express-

certain chemical actions which cannot be explained. It is apphed to those pheno-

mena wbich take place in the presence of a body which appears to be entirely un-
changed by the action. Happily these catalytic actions are being explained one

after another, so that soon the name itself may become obsolete. An example of
this action of presence may be given. When a mixture of sulphuric acid and
Nowalcohol is heated to a temperature of about 140° to 150° ether passes over.
                       ----

668 REPORT-- 1892.

alcohol contair.8 C^II^-O, and if from two molecules of alcohol one molecule of water

is subtracted a molecule of ether results : '2G^JI,.0 - OH, + C^Hj^O. As sulphuric
acid is known to have a great attraction for water, it is easy to imagine that the

acid combines with the water and ether passes oif. But it is found that a small
quantity of sulphuric acid at the temperature of 140°-150° will transform a very-
large amount of alcohol into ether and water, much more than can be explained by
assuming that the acid has combined with the water. If a mixture of sulphuric
acid and alcohol is heated to a temperature of 140°-150°, and alcohol allowed to
flow into the liquid, a mixture of ether and water vapours passes over, and after a
large quantity of alcohol has been transformed the amount of sulphuric acid is
found to be unaltered. At first glance this seems very difficult to explain, but on
further investigation it is found that alcohol and sulphuric acid act one on another
to form ethyl-sulphuric or sulphovinic acid

                             SO,Ho, + EtHo = SO.IIoEto + OH,.

But when ethyl-sulphuric acid is heated with alcoliol ether is formed with the

reproduction of sulphuric acid

                              SOalloEto + EtHo = OEt, + SO.Hoo.

The sulphuric acid is then able to produce ethyl-sulphuric acid by acting on more
alcohol, so a continuous production of ether and water takes place without loss of
sulphuric acid. Another well-known action is the combination of oxygen and
hydrogen under the influence of spongy platinum. In this case the platinum
remains apparently unaltered, and is capable of causing the combination of any
quantity of mixed gases. As spongy platinum possesses the power of absorbing
large quantities of gases it is usually said that the molecules of oxygen and hydro-
gen are so much condensed in the platinum that they are brought within the
sphere of each other's attractions, and consequently combine.

     Another instance of an action of this kind is atibrded by the oxidation of

ammonia in the presence of chromic oxide. When ammonic dichromate is heated

an evolution of gas occurs, and a residue of chromic oxide is left which bears a
striking resemblance to a mixture of black and green tea ; when some of this sub-
stance is placed on a piece of wii'e gauze, heated and then supported over a vessel
containing a strong solution of ammonia, the oxide glows, in a manner similar to
the glo^wing of spongy platinum under the influence of a mixture of hydrogen and
air. Under the.'^e conditions the chromic oxide facilitates the oxidation of the
ammonia, but it becomes changed during the process ; instead of having the appear-

ance above described it acquires a bright-green colour. Now, we loiow that
chromium is capable of forming several combinations with oxygen. Is it therefore
too much to suppose that the chromium is alternately oxidised by the oxygen of

the air, and reduced by the hydrogen of the ammonia, so that, although in the end
it has the same composition as at the beginning, nevertheless it has been con-

tinuously decomposed and reproduced? Now, may not a similar change take place
during the action of spongy platinum on a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen ? The

alteration of the platinum is very slight, but I believe I have observed a slight
modification of the appearance of a fragment of spongy platinum that was kept
glowing by a small jet of purified hydrogen for some hours ; the gas not being
allowed to burn so as to heat the platinum to a very high temperature, the metal
appears to be compacted and to be covered by minute spherules of glistening metal.

Now, may not the platinum have entered into combination with one or other of
the gases and been subsequently reduced ? If this is the true explanation then we

have in this case a continuous series of chemical changes and the ' catalysis ' is

explained.

   We all know the ease with which oxygen is obtained from potassic chlorate

when heated with a small quantity of oxide of manganese: the quantity of peroxide
is the same at the end of the process as at the beginning, and it may be used over
and over again to assist in the decomposition of fresh potassic chlorate. The oxide
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                       669

of manganese undergoes a molecular alteration ; if a crystalline variety is employed,
it is found, at the end of the proces;*, to have teen transformed into line powder.

    I hope I have proved to the satisfaction of my brother chemists that potassic

permanganate is first formed and subsequently decomposed with the reproduction

of manganese peroxide.
     Oxide of cobalt possesses the remarkable property of decomposing solutions of

hypochlorites at moderate temperatures with evolution of oxygen. For some time

Ihave been endeavouring to tind the explanation of the change, but hitherto with-
out complete success. At iirst it seemed probable that an unstable cobaltate,

aualogous to a ferrate, was formed and decomposed at the temperature of the ex-
periment. In fact, oxygen is evolved when chlorine is passed through a boiling
solution of sodic hydrate containing ferric hydrate in suspension. But no evidence

I if the existence of a cobaltate could be found. When a cobaltous salt is added to

un alkaline solution of a hypochlorite a black precipitate is formed which is usually
stated to be cobaltic hydrate, COoHOg, but Vortmann has shown that, when a

cobaltous salt is mixed with a solution of iodine in potassic iodide, and the liquid

Tendered alkaline by sodic hydrate, the precipitate formed at a temperature between

50° and 60° approaches in composition the dioxide of cobalt, CoO.,. He also found

that the precipitate lost oxygen at the temperature of boiling water. I have

repeated some of his experiments, and can quite confirm them, although I have not
obtained an oxide containing quite as much oxygen as his richest oxide. The

oxides I prepared rapidly effected the decomposition of a solution of sodic hypo-

chlorite, and that without undergoing any loss of oxygen themselves ; in fact, iu the
two experiments made the cobalt compound contained a little more oxygen after

boiling with the hypochlorite.

    AN'e have now many instances of the influence which small quantities of sub-
stances have upon chemical reactions. These influences may be more common than

is generally supposed. The presence of a third body is frequently helpful in the

combination of elements with one another : thus dry chlorine will not attack melted

sodium or finely divided copper; an electric spark will not cause a dry mixture of

carbonic oxide and oxygen to explode ; carbon, phosphorus, and sulphur will not

unite with dry oxygen ; and as chemical science progresses we may find that many

well-known actions are conditioned by the presence of minute traces of other

Wematter which have hitherto escaped detection.  all know the profound altera-

tions of the properties of substances by minute traces of impurities ; less than one-
tenth per cent, of phosphorus will render steel unfit for certain purposes. The

sapphire and ruby only differ from colourless alumina by the presence of traces of

impurities hardly recognisable by chemical analysis. During this meeting we

hope to have a contribution to the Section on the influence of minute traces of

what may be called impurities on the properties of diilerent substances and their

influence on chemical changes.
     In this city, where the first public chemical laboratory was started in 182.3 by

Dr. Anderson, the assistant of Professor Hope, it is hardly necessary to insist on

the extreme importance of teaching chemistry by practical work, but unfortunately,
even at the present time, endeavours are made to teach the subject by means of

lectures (sometimes without experiments) or by reading. Those who are ac-

quainted with chemistry well know the impossibility (this is hardly too strong a

word) of learning the science, especially in the first stages, without actual experi-
ment, by which a practical acquaintance wi'^h chemical phenomena is obtained.

The attempt to learn chemistry without practical experience reminds one of the
well-known story (for the truth of which I will not vouch) of a mathematician

who lectured on natural philosophy. He was visiting a foreign laboratory, and

stopped before a piece of apparatus and asked what it was : on being told it was an

air-pump he exclaimed : ' Dear me ! I have lectured on the air-pump for twenty--

five years, and this is the first time I have seen one.' It is problematical if his

students can have derived much advantage from his lectures. Teaching of the

kind to which reference has just been made is generally given to candidates for
examinations who do not intend to take up chemistry as their chief subject. At
the present time chemistry is required for entrance and preliminary examinations

from many classes of students. There is no doubt that it is an excellent means oi
education, teaching a boy to observe and draw conclusions from his observations;

but if he makes no observations  it  is  little  more  than  useless cram                                                   the  memory

might as well be exercised by learning a novel by heart.

This imperfect mode of teaching cliemistry arises principally from the difficulty

of obtaining properly appointed laboratories in schools, in addition to which the

very strong fumes are sometimes disagreeable, making it inconvenient to have
them in or near a house, to say nothing of the possible dangers to the clothes and

their contents ; but there is no help for it ; the teaching must be accompanied by
experimental demonstration, as was indicated in the reports on the teaching of
·chemistry which have been presented to this Association in former years. It

must be admitted that examinations do not always discover the best student

many are capable of preparing for examinations with a small knowledge of their

subject ; others, with a good knowledge, fail from nervousness or other causes ; but
at the present time examination, although far from perfect, is almost the only

means we have of j udging the fitness of the candidate. By properly selecting

<3uestions the examiner may, to a considerable extent, discourage cram ; he should
endeavour to find out what the pupils have actually seen, and to make them draw

conclusions from facts which they have either themselves observed, or which have
been described to them ; it is only in this manner that chemistry can be used as
a means of mental training.

     These remarks do not apply to the education of students intending to make
·chemistry their profession, who have many opportunities, in the large laboratories

of Great Britain and the Continent, of obtaining all the necessary instruction.

The Institute of Chemistry, which was founded to improve the status and also

the education of professional chemists, requires that its members should have a

thoroughly scientific training. Before a candidate for the associateship is admitted

to examination he must bring evidence that he has passed satisfactorily through

a systematic course of at least three years' study in the subjects of theoretical and

practical chemistry, physics, and elementary mathematics in some recognised

college or school ; and before admission to the fellowship he must have passed
through three additional years of work in cliemistry. It is to be hoped that an

·example of this kind will ultimately have a good effect in improving the modes of

teaching the science in its elementary stages.

     There is another cla.ss of workers in cliemistry who must not be forgotten at
the present time, as they have much influence on the life of the world, and have

been working for ages, but have only recently been recognised. I mean those

organisms which are included under the name of microbes. These organisms are

capable of producing chemical changes which entirely surpass all the results

hitherto obtained by the chemist in his laboratory. That the transformation of

sugar into alcohol and carbonic anhydride in the ordinary process of fermentation

is due to a living organism has been known for some years ; the important trans-
formation of ammonia into nitrous and nitric acids in the soil has been shown to

be due to organisms whicli have recently been investigated by many chemists ; it
is possible to transform ammonia into these acids in the laboratorj- by oxidation

under certain conditions and at a high temperature, whereas the organism does the

work quite as efiicaciously at the common temperature. Other organisms have

the power of producing complex organic poisons by the alteration of some of the

constituents of the animal body, and the relation of these products to the study

of diseases is of the highest possible importance. As we hope to liave a discussion
on this interesting subject by many eminent authorities, both from the chemical

and biological points of view, it will be unnecessary to pursue the subject further,

unless it be to urge some of the younger chemists to work at the chemical aspect

of bacteriology. They must be prepared for hard work and many disappointments,

for the subject is undoubtedly a difficult one.

      I cannot conclude this address without reference to the great loss whicli

chemistry has sustained by the death of Professor A. W. von Hofmann. I had

the good fortune to be under him as student and assistant from 1856 until he left

this country in 1865; all who worked with him must have been deeply impressed

by his capacity for -work and his power of inducing work in others. Although

perhaps some of us did not appreciate this at the time, yet we feel we owe him a

·debt of gratitude for his having started us in the right way. The list of papers
under his name in the Royal Society Catalogue up to the year 1883 is ^99, written

by himself alone, besides twenty-two joint papers. One of his characteristics

which impressed me was his inTestigation for the purpose of furthering chemical

Imowledge without any view to practical applications, and I well remember his

lecture at the Royal Institution, in 1862, on mauve and magenta (which owed

so much of their success to his work), in which he produced the original specimen

of benzene which had been obtained by Faraday from oil-gas in 1825. He pointed

out that Faraday had prepared this substance and investigated its properties

without ever supposing that it could have any practical application. The fol-

lowing is the concludmg paragraph of the lecture :

' Need I say any more ? The moral of mauve and magenta is transparent

Weenough ; I read it in your eyes.  understand each other. Whenever in future

one of your chemical friends, full of enthusiasm, exhibits and explains to you his

newly discovered compounds, you will not cool his noble ardour by asking him

that most terrible of all questions, " What is its use ? Will your compound
bleach or dye? Will it shave .P May it be used as a substitute for leather?"

Let him quietly go on with his work. The dye, the lather, the leather, will make

their appearance in due time. Let him, 1 repeat it, perform his task. Let him

-- --indulge in the pursuit of truth of truth pure and simple of truth not for the

sake of mauve, not for the sake of magenta ; let him pursue truth for the sake

of truth.'

This seems to me the true spirit of the scientific investigator, and in many

cases the reward consists solely in the consciousness that the investigator has done

his duty ; in some cases the reward may take a more substantial form, and since

the above paragraphs were written I have been informed that Professor von
Hofmann has left a large fortune, the result of the applications of his discoveries

in technical chemistry.

          These alloys possessed the unexpected feature of being readily attracted by the
      magnet, and it is principally on this account that they have been thought
     sufficiently interesting to bring before the members of this section, especially as
     the alloys of aluminium have for some time attracted much attention.
         It is now well known that the addition of manganese to iron or steel produces

an alloy which is not attracted by the magnet, alloys containing 8 to 12 per cent,

being only feebly magnetic, and over this proportion they may be said to have

practically no influence on the magnet at all.
     Aluminium also possesses a similar property, but in a less marked degree.

Ferro-aluminium containing 13 per cent, aluminium is still readily attracted, and
it is not until this element reaches 20 per cent, that the effect here alluded to takes

place.

     It is therefore an interesting fact that the addition of aluminium to a man-
ganese alloy, which of itself would be quite inert, results in an alloy which is

readily attracted.

In one of the alloys exhibited the aluminium is present to the extent of 3'05

per cent, only, and although the iron barely reaches 15 per cent, it responds to

the influence of the magnet almost as readily as a piece of iron.

In another alloy which was disintegrated the effect is still more remarkable, as

it contains not only manganese but aluminium in sufficient quantity to destroy the

influence of the   magnet  if they                                                             were   present        separately                                          yet  together     they do
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

exactly the reverse, and here, again, although the iron is even less than the above,

the magnet attracts it quite easily.

The alloys which I have drawn attention to were the result of an experiment

made to ascertain the possibility of forming a reliable homogeneous alloy of alu-

minium with ferro-manganese, and for this purpose 50 lb. of the latter (contain-

ing 82 per cent, manganese) and 5-56 lb. of aluminium (containing 99'0 per cent,

aluminium) were separately melted in large crucibles, the intention being to make

a 10-per-cent. alloy. After they were perfectly fused the ferro-manganese was

poured into the    aluminium                                                                   after  stirring  for  about  half                                         a  minute the mixture
                                                                                            ;

showed such decided signs of becoming pasty that it was at once poured into an

ingot mould. After about two-thirds had been poured the remainder suddenly

solidified, and was roughly knocked out of the crucible.

The alloys presented no apparent dissimilarity, and it was not thought worth

while to examine them until after keeping for about three months the portion

--which had solidified first commenced to fall into pieces in the same way that
--high-percentage ferro-manganese of 85 per cent, is known to do and this action

has gone on until it has almost completely disintegrated, and is now in the condition

of the specimen shown.

The analyses of the two portions showed a remarkable difference in composi-

tion. The disintegrated portion contains

This analysis was repeated with practically identical results. The deficiency is
no doubt due to slight oxidation having taken place owing to the finely divided con-
dition of the alloy: it has a specific gravity of 3'61. The examination of the

This alloy has not shown any signs of disinteofration since it was made.
     ^^^lether the difierence iu composition hetween the two portions is the result

of the great difficulty in mixing aluminium with the heavier metals, or has been

produced hy separation, is not quite clear ; if the carbon may be taken as a guide,

it seems to show not only separation but also actual loss of this element.

                           FRIDAY, AUGUST 5.

The following Papers were read :

1. The Explosion of Ethylene tvith less than its own Volume of Oxygen. By

     B. Lean, B.A., B.Sc. (Dalton Ghemical Scholar of Owens College), and

   AW. Bone, B.Sc. (Felloiv of Victoria Zfiiiversity).

Our investigations arose out of experiments to determine the rate of explosion

of hydrocarbons witli deficiency of oxygen, and were made at the suggestion of
Professor H. B. Dixon. On exploding ethylene with less than its own volume of

oxygen there is invariably a considerable increase in pressure. In the case of a

mixture of 100 volumes ethylene with 96 5 volumes oxygen, the pressure increased

I'rom 756 mm. to 1,503 mm. of mercury, indicating that the oxygen had mainly

gone to the carbon and not to the hydrogen. This result is in accordance with

Dalton's experiments (1810), with those of J. Daw, Kersten (1861), and E. von

Meyer (1874).
    On carefully analysing the products of explosion we found that, in addition to

hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and small percentages of carbonic acid and unsaturated

hydrocarbons, there was always present a small amount of marsh gns.

We made and tired five ditl'erent mixtures of ethylene and oxygen, containing
We100 volumes ethylene with 70 to 96'5 volumes oxygen.
                                                        invariably found

marsh gas present in the products of the explosion, and the percentage of this

increased as the percentage of oxygen in the original mixture decreased.

The quantity of marsh gas present in the products of explosion of 100 volumes

of ethylene with 70 volumes of oxygen was 5'53 per cent., and, in the case of the
mixture containing 100 volumes ethylene with 96'5 volumes of oxygen, we found

1-01 per cent, of marsh gas in the products.

AYith regard to the unsaturated hydrocarbons present in the products, a

qualitative examination revealed the presence of acetylene. Whether ihis con-
stitutes the whole of the unsaturated hydrocarbons present we are not prepared to

say ; it is certainly present in not inconsiderable quantities.

     The main reaction which doubtless occurs is a combination between the oxygen

and part of the ethylene with the formation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen,

according to the equation

                           aH, + 0., = 2CO + 2H,                                   (1)

     The heat liberated by this reaction produces a decomposition of some of the
unburnt ethylene analogous to the decomposition which ethylene undergoes when

passed through a red-hot tube into marsh gas and carbon, according to the

equation

                           C,H, = CH, + C                                          (2)

     Marsh gas might also be produced in another way, by partial oxidation, accord-

ing to the equation

                           2C3H, + 0., = 2CHj + 2C0                                (3)

With regard to the formation of acetylene, Professor Dixon suggested that it

is possibly due to a secondary reaction between the nascent hydrogen formed

according to equation (1), and the carbon liberated according to equation (2)

                           2C + ir, = C,,H,                                        (4)

   2. On the Luminosity of Hydrocarbon Flames. J5i/ Vivian B. Lewes,
                               Hoyal Naval College, Greenwich.

     In the year 1816, while engaged upon those historical researches which cul-

minated in the discovery of the miner's safety-lamp, Sir Humphry Davy noticed
certain facts which led him to work out and propound his theory of the causes

--which lead to luminosity in flame a theory which is generally stated as being

that the presence of solid particles in the flame is essential to its luminosity. This

theory remained unquestioned until 1868, when Professor E. Frankland, in his
celebrated communication to the Royal Society, showed that, although incan-
descent solid matter in a flame renders it luminous, luminosity is also in many
cases produced when the flame contains very dense vapours at a sufficiently high
temperature, and also that a non-luminous flame may be rendered luminous by

increasing the pressure.

     More recent researches, however, seem to point conclusively to the luminosity
of all flames containing hydrocarbons, being due to the presence of incandescent
particles of carbon, and the author has made an exhaustive series of experiments
as to the causes which lead to their production in an ordinary coal-gas flame.

     Coal gas is a mi.xture of hydrocarbons with hydrogen and small quantities of
carbon monoxide ; and it also contains traces of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and
oxygen.

     The unsaturated hydrocarbons consist of ethylene, benzene, butylene, and
acetylene, and probably also traces of crotonj'lene and others ; while the saturated
hydrocarbons consist chiefly of methane, with traces of ethane, propane, and butane.

     As the gas leaves the jet the hydrogen rapidly diffuses to the outer edge of
the flame and burns, the methane doing the same but rather more slowly. The

combustion of these gases raises the temperature 500° C. in the first half-inch ;
while before another half-inch has been traversed 1,000° C. is reached, and chemical
changes in the hydrocarbons are progressing rapidly, the unsaturated hydro-
carbons and higher members of the saturated hydrocarbons being rapidly converted
into acetylene. If the temperature of the flame were not allowed to rise above
1,000° C. this acetylene would be nearly all polymerised into benzene, naphthalene,
diphenyl, and other more complex bodies, which would be slowly burnt up with-

out liberation of carbon, and a non-luminous flame would result. This may be
shown by holding a platinum dish against a luminous flat flame, when luminosity
disappears; but it may be reproduced by heating the interior of the dish. In the
case of a gas flame, however, instead of remaining at 1,000° C, the temperature
rapidly rises to 1,200° C, with the result that, instead of polymerising into more

complex bodies, the acetylene formed at once splits up into carbon and hydrogen,
and the former, lieated to incandescence by combustion, gives the luminosity. It
is the attainment of this temperature that marks the limit of the non-luminous
zone. If this were the only action, however, the luminous zone would be very
short. But the bodies formed from the acetylene before 1,200° C. was reached,
and the methane, of which some still remains unburnt, are converted into acety-
lene at a still higher temperature, i.e., 1,300° C. ; and this being reached near the
top of the luminous zone yields a fresh supply of carbon, and so increases the
height of the light-yielding portion of the flame.

    3. Experiments on Flame. By Professor Aethue Smithells, B.Sc.

     The author described four distinct regions of an ordinary luminous flame, the
existence of which he thought could not be doubted by any impartial observer.
His experimeijts had arisen from a desire to understand more fully the chemical
changes which determined this peculiar structure, and especially the twofold

character of the outer sheath.

    He described the construction and demonstrated the use of his apparatus for

separating the two cones of combustion in non-luminous flames, and gave a sum-

mary of the results he had obtained with it. He considered these results to

furnish fresh protff that when a hydrocarbon is starved of oxygen, the carbon will
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                               675

burn more readily than the hydrogen, and that accordingly the luminosity of
ordinary flames must not be explained as is olten done by assuming the very re-

verse of this. The luminosity of ordinary flames is now generally admitted to be

due to the separation of solid carbon in the flame, and this must be ascribed to a

decomposition or dissociation of the hydrocarbons by heat. This heat is supplied

by the sheath of non-luminous combustion surrounding the flame. The author

considers this sheath, -which consists of tvpo parts (a barely visible outer part, and

a bright blue inner one) to correspond to the two cones of combustion in a non-
luminous flame. The author, whilst admitting from the result of experiments

made by Professor Lewes and by himself that acetylene was present in the interior

of luminous flames, thought that Professor Lewes had not established his view

that luminosity was mainly and essentially due to the formation and subsequent

dissociation of acetylene, and that he was altogether relying too much upon that

Asubstance.  study of the precise cause of carbon separation was being under-

taken by the author with the aid of his flame-cone separator, a single hydro-

carbon (ethylene) being employed.

Other experiments with the flame-cone separator relating to the spectra of

Anmetallic salts were exhibited.   account of these will be found in the report

of the proceedings of Section A, p. 646. The chief conclusion was that the spectra
obtained when metallic salts were introduced into non-luminous flames were the

direct outcome of and were entirely dependent upon chemical changes.

6. Preliminary Note on the Action of Dry Ammonia Gas on Sulphates.
    By Professor W. R. Hodgkinson, Ph.D., F.B.S.E., and C. C. Trench,

     Col. B.A.

     Very little appears in chemical literature as to the action of really diy
ammonia gas on salts at an elevated temperature. Some chlorides are stated to
be reduced, others to yield nitrogen compounds when heated with ammonia, but
little or nothing seems to be known respecting the action with sulphates.

     The experiments were also undertaken to ascertain (1) to what e.xtent, if anj',
sulphates were reduced by ammonia at temperatures below that at which the
sulphate itself decomposes, and (2) whether nitrogen compounds (nitrides) could

be formed.

     All the work has been quantitative as far as possible.
     After a number of preliminary experiments, the reactions were carried on in
a wide glass tube, so arranged that it could be heated in an air-bath to a detinite
temperature when required, or by the naked flame. The substance was contained
in a boat of platinum or porcelain as the case demanded, which with its contents
was weighed before and after the action, '"^he ammonia was dried by passing first
over potassium hydrate and then over a considerable quantity of freshly ignited

lime.

     As water is, however, certainly one product of the mutual action of ammonia
and sulphates, this drying is perhaps not an essential precaution. To catch vola-
tile products the tube was drawn out to about 50 cm., and either dipped into

--water or ended in a dry flask externally cooled.
     General Results. The preliminary experiments showed that some metallic
sulphates were entirely reduced by heating with ammonia. Silver mercury and
bismuth behaved in this manner. Water and what at first appeared to be

                                                                                                                          XX2

ammonium sulphite were the only products of a volatile nature. The actions

 were completed at the melting' point of zinc.

      Lead sulphate required a high temperature before any action was visible, and

Athe salt was not completely decomposed by heating for an hour to a red heat.

little lead sulphide was produced. Thallium sulphate acted in a similar manner,
 bat more sulphide was formed.

      Ferrous sulphate (dry) precipitated by addition of strong acid to the concen-
 trated water solution of FeSO^j and then dried in vacuo, ordinary crystallised
ferrous sulphate, and the ammonium ferrous sulphate were all reduced to metallic
 iron, which, however, contained 1 to 2 per cent, of sulphur.

      The sulphates of zinc, manganese, cobalt, nickel, magnesium, and chromium
 were remarkably alilce in their behaviour.

      In all these cases the quantity of material left in the boat after heating corre-

sponded very closely with that required if a sulphide of the form M| had been
formed. As a matter of fact, the residue consisted of a mixture of the sulphide

 and oxide in nearly molecular proportions.

     No nitride has as yet been obtained.
     As far as the volatile portion is concerned, the main bulk in all cases appeared
to be ammonium sulphite. No trace of sulphate was found. In the hot tube in

which the reaction was carried on, the substance which condensed was for the
most part ammonium thionamate NH3OHSONH.,. Where this came in contact
with water in tlie condensing ilask, or with moisture in the cooler parts of the tube,
ammonium sulphite was of course formed.

      Undoubtedly the most interesting salt examined is cupric sulphate. Either

dry or with cry,8tal water, the salt absorbed much NII3, and then melted below

200° turned black, and as the temperature rose appeared to boil, and finally at
somewhere about 400° began to decompose with incandescence, leaving almost
pure metallic copper.

     The comparatively low temperature at which an action was observable in the
case of copper sulphate suggested the possible formation of a hydrazin compound.

     The white sublimate was therefore examined for its reducing power on Fehling's
solution and silver nitrate. As thionamate reduces both silver and copper solu-
tions when alkaline, some of the white sublimate was distilled from potassium
hydrate solution and the distillate collected in dilute sulphuric acid. This solution
also reduced Fehling's solution. There is little doubt but that hydrazin is present
along^ with the thionamate sublimate, but the quantity is small, and in several
experiments could not be detected at all, probably on account of the temperature
being too high when the ammonia comes in contact with the sulphate.

   We are continuing this work in the hope of getting an easy method for the

production of hydrazin compounds.

           7. Note on the Action of Dn/ Sulphur Di-oxide on Oxij-salts.

Bij Professor W. R. Hodgkinson, Ph.I)., F.B.S.E., and J. Toung, A.B.S.M.

The behaviour of sulphur di-oxide on solutions of certain oxy-salts, such as

nitrates and chlorates, is suiliciently well known, and, in fact, a matter of every-

day occurence. The reactions of the dry gas on these salts does not, however,

appear to have been very carefully studied.

Some quantitative experiments have therefore been made with several typical

salts. The mode of experiment has been to expose a weighed quantity of the salt

to a current of carefully dried SO^ in a tube so arranged that it could, "if necessary,

be heated to some definite temperature in an air-bath, or with the naked flame "if

desired.
--ANitrates.
              considerable number of nitrates have been examined. As a rule,

the action commences at the ordinary temperature coloured oxides of nitrogen are

given olf, and when the salt is employed in fine powder the temperature rapidly

rises, and the metal in every case completely converted into sulphate. As long as

the materials were quite dry no SO3 was formed beyond that necessary to form

sulphate with the metal.

potassium. The first result of impact of the SOo was the liberation of chlorine
peroxide, which escaped along with the excess of S0,, as long as the temperature
did not rise above about 60° ; at a little higher temperature there was a slight
flash in the tube and formation of white fumes of SO.,. The escaping gases then
contained chlorine, SO3 and S0,,. The yellow but clear mixture of sulphur di-oxide

and chlorine peroxide became cloudy from formation of SO3 on introduction of a

little moisture.

     Moist S0,, appeared to act more rapidly than dry, and in most cases without

visible liberation of chlorine peroxide.

Phosphates are apparently not acted upon at all by SO2.

With chromates, dichromates, and permanganates considerable differences ot

behaviour were noticed, depending evidently on the nature of the metal. "With

silver chromate the figures point to the formation of silver sulphate and chromic

oxide.

With alkaline chromates, or dichromate, or barium chromate there is an

evident tendency to form chromium sulphate as well as other sulphate. In no
case, however, has the formation of chromium sulphate proceeded its full extent
even when the heating has been continued for many hours in a steady current of

S0,,.

     Permanganates behave in a similar manner.

    With both classes of salts the action is at first rapid during the formation of
the more positive metallic sulphate, and ceases at a higher temperature owing to

the decomposition of the chromium and manganese sulphates by heat.

     The ease with which potassium nitrate was converted into sulphate by the

action of dry SO^ suggested a method for the determination of potassium in gun-

powder and similar substances. It was, however, found verj' unsuitable.

    A number of experiments carried out by Lieutenant L. E. Traherne, R.N.,

show that when gunpowder is acted upon by SOo at about 150°, either dry or
moist, the temperature rises quickly, and in most cases causes explosion. With
fine-gTained powders, and especially when unglazed, the action is more rapid

and the explosion violent, as it appears to take place over a considerable area at

once.

Chlorates, as might be expected, when simultaneously in contact with SO.,
Aand any kind of organic matter set up a violent action.

fall on a little powdered potassium chlorate ; white fumes are given off which are
nearly always followed by a sharp explosion.

     The following Papers were read :

1. On the Application of a Hydrogen Flame in an Ordinary Safety-lamp to
     the Detection and Measurement of Inflammahle Gas or Vafour. By
     Professor Frank Clowes, D.Sc, University College, Nottingham.

     The appearance of a ' cap ' over the flame in the safety-lamp has long been
used by the coal-miner for detecting ' firedamp' in the air, and for roughly measur-
ing its amount. The ordinary oil-flame does not with certainty detect the presence
of less than 3 per cent, of firedamp. The alcohol flame adopted by Pieler detects
0'25 per cent, readily ; but since this flame gives no light the Pieler lamp can be
used for gas-testing only, and is useless for lighting purposes. At the last meeting
of the British Association the results of an examination of the Ashworth lamp
were given by the author ; this lamp burns benzoline, and was found to give good
illumination when the wick was raised, and to detect at least 0'5 per cent of fire-
damp when the wick was pulled down until it gave a pale-blue flame only.

      In the present paper the author describes a miner's safety-lamp, in which the
ordinary fiame can at once be replaced by a hydrogen flame when desired. The
use of the hydrogen flame enables the miner to detect readily and with certainty
percentages of firedamp, varying between 0'25 and 3-0, and to measure their
amount. As soon as the delicate testing is finished the ordinary flame of the lamp
is kindled, and can be employed either for illumination, or, if lowered, it can be
applied to the detection of percentages of gas larger in amount than those found
by the hydrogen flame. The hydrogen gas is carried in a small steel reservoir,
slung over the shoulder by a strap, and is introduced through a fine metal tute
which passes into the interior of the safety-lamp and terminates near the wick.
This composite lamp is at once a good illuminator and an extremely delicate gas-

 tester.

     Comparative experiments were made with a hydrogen flame, an alcohol flame
of the same height, and a small blue benzoline flame, all of which were exposed in
air containing 1 per cent, of coal gas. The * cap ' seen over the hydrogen flame
was nearly four times as high as that seen over the benzoline flame, and half as

 high again as that seen over the alcohol flame.

     Many serious accidents have arisen from bringing a ' naked flame ' into spaces
in which light petroleum oil had been stored. The vapour of this oil, when mingled

 with the air in proper proportions, is violently explosive ; and it becomes import-
 ant therefore to have means of detecting its presence and measuring its amount.
The author described tests carried out with the above hydrogen safety-lamp in his
 test-chamber. They prove that the hydrogen flame can detect one-twentieth of
 the amount of petroleum vapour which can be kindled in air, and one thirty-sixth

 of the amount which explodes when mingled with air.

4. Notes on the Molec^dar Refraction and Dispersion of (a.) Metallic

    Carbonyls, (b) Indinri and Gallium, (c) Sulphur. By Dr. J. H.

      Gladstone, F.R.S.

    The author had examined a specimen of iron pentacartonyl prepared hy
Ludwig Mond, which gave the molecular refraction of 67'33 for the line A, and
70-85 for the hne e. It is therefore, like the nickel tetracarbonyl, a very

refractive and extremely dispersive substance. He gave reasons for thinking that

the metals in these two substances had not any abnormal valency, that the car-

bonyls have a ring formula, and that each CO in the iron compound has the high

refraction of 11 '2.

     The refraction equivalents of indium and gallium had been previously deter-
mined from the observations of Soret upon alums of these metals. Soret, however,
has since published additional observations, especially upon gallium alums. From
these the atomic refraction of gallium was calculated at 11-6, and of indium at

1 3-7, which the author wished to substitute for his previous figures.

The refraction of sulphur had been determined by various observers in a solid,

liquid, and gaseous condition, dissolved in carbon bisulphide, and in chemical

combination with carbon and chlorine. Tliese all gave nearly the same atomic

lefraction for  the  line D, viz., about  16-3                         the sulphur  dissolved  in  carbon bisul-
                                                                    ;

phide was the lowest, viz., 16-0, as determined both by Nasini and the author.

The atomic dispersion of sulphur between a and G of the spectrum, whether

dissolved in carbon bisulphide or in actual combination with the carbon, was the

same, viz., 1-8. In more complicated organic compounds the atomic refraction and

dispersion are generally smaller.

1. The Impurities of Town Air. By G. H. Bailey, D.Sc, Ph.D.

During the past twelve months the Air Analysis Committee of Manche:tter, in

conjunction with the Royal Horticultural Society, have been engaged on the

Aanalysis of the air of large towns.      large amount of ioformation having been

already collected by previous observers as to the carbonic acid iu the air, it was

thought desirable to devote more special attention to such impurities as sulphurous
acid and organic matter. Furthermore, since the object in view was not merely to

collect data but to lay the foundations of what may be termed chemical meteoro-

logy, the atmospheric conditions prevailing at the" time of the observation have

been noted. From the results of several hundreds of analyses carefully conducted
in London, Manchester, and Liverpool the following conclusions are drawn:--

     (1) That in clear breezy weather the amount of sulphurous acid is less than

1 mdhgramme per 100 cubic feet of air.

     (2) That in anticyclonic periods it rises very considerably, and in times of fo"-
maxima of 34 and 50 miUigrammes have been recorded for the worst districts of
Manchester and London respectively.
_ (3) That wherever an open space or a less densely populated area occurs there
js a very marked diminution in the amount of impurities in the air.

     (4) That an increase in the amount of sulphurous acid is accompanied by at
least^as large an increase in the amount of organic impurities in the air.

     (5) That smoke, promoting as it does the formation of fog, and preventino- free
diffusion into the upper stratum of the air, must be regarded as the principal cause
ol the impure state of the atmosphere in large towns.

           7. The Halogen Addition Products of Salts of Organic Bases.

        By Leonakd Dobbin, Ph.D., and James Walker, D.Sc, Ph.D.

    In 1885 and 1886 one of us in conjunction with Dr. Orme Masson ' showed

that the haloid salts of trimethylsulphine and of tetramethylammonium were acted
upon by the halogens and by iodine monochloride with formation of compoimds,

Rthe composition of which is represented by the general formula RX3, where
Xstands for the group SMe3 or NMe^, and for one atom of a halogen.

     The products obtained in both cases differed very greatly in the readiness with
which they underwent decomposition by themselves and on treatment with water
or alcohol. The compounds containing three atoms of the same halogen were by
far the most easily decomposed, and, indeed, the formation of definite compounds
of this kind was never clearly proved, but only somewhat vaguely indicated. The
only compounds which remained unchanged on exposure to the air, and whicli
were further almost unattacked by boiling alcohol, were the dibromiodides pre-
pared by the action of bromine upon the monoiodides. The corresponding
dichloriodides, obtained from the monoiodides and chlorine, or from the mono-
chlorides and iodine monochloride, decomposed slowly on exposure to the air,
giving off chlorine and iodine. They were decomposed with moderate rapidity by
boiling alcohol, with formation of the monochlorides of the organic bases, alcoholic
solution of iodine, and products of the action of chlorine upon alcohol. Water
attacked all the compounds, but while trimethylsidphine trichloride was instantly
decomposed with liberation of torrents of chlorine, the dibrom- and dichloriodides
of both bases were only decomposed after prolonged contact. The dichloriodides
and dibromiodides were found to be very stable when heated, melting at tempera-
tures ranging from 94° to 216°, some almost and others entirely without decom-

position.

     More recently the dibrom- and dichloriodides of methyl-pyridium have been
prepared by us by the action of bromine and chlorine respectively on methyl-
pyridium iodide. The dichloriodide has also been obtained by Ostermayer - from
niethylpyridium chloride and iodine monochloride. These substances both crystal-
lise from alcohol, and were found to possess properties resembling in general those
of the corresponding trimethylsulphine and tetramethylammonium compounds,
being, however, more stable than these. The melting-point of the chloriue com-
pound is 88°, that of the bromine compound being 63°.

     In view of the serial character exhibited by these various substances with
respect to their stability in alcoholic solution, it seemed to us that the determina-
tion of the molecular weights of the most stable of tlie compounds by observing
with Beckmann's apparatus ^ the elevation of the boiling-point of alcohol in which
they were dissolved might yield results of interest in regard to the so-called

molecular compounds.
     The results of the determinations showed that methylpyridium and tetra-

methylammonium dibromiodides are not decomposed to any appreciable extent by

several minutes' boiling in alcoholic solution, while the trimethylsulphine analogue
is undoubtedly attacked, and that the dichloriodides are all decomposed, some to

a considerable degree, by the same treatment. The following table exhibits the
molecular weights calculated from the formula IIX3 and from the elevation of the
boiling-point respectively. Where there is no decomposition the values should be
identical, and the more widely they diverge, the greater is the amount of decom-

position.

     The products of resolution of cane sugar under these conditions are therefore
approximately per two molecules of the compound (C,,JI.,oOi J : acetic acid,
4 molecules ; oxalic acid, 1 molecule ; carbonic acid, 13 molecules ; gaseous carton
compound, 1 molecule ; hydrogen, lOH.^. The other carbohydrates will be simi-

larly investigated.

     While reserving a complete account of the research until further advanced, it
is sufficiently estabhshed that all the carbohydrates investigated break down
similarly, that acetic acid is the main product of the resolution, and that the
CO-CH,, grouping is an important factor of the stability of the molecules of these

compounds, and survives this very drastic process of resolution.

9. On the Molecular Volumes of Organic Substances in Dilute Solution.
                          Bij W. W. J. NicoL, B.Sc.

    In 1883 the author found that when dilute solutions of the sodium salts or
formic, acetic, and butyric acids were compared the differences between their
molecular volumes were approximately constant per CH.,. Thus :

Sodium butyrate   ^'*^\ 27-4        CH.,
                                    13-7
      ,, acetate  40-05/ \^;.*      14'J
     ,, formiate
                  2519 J

The sodium butyrate was not quite pure, containing acetate, so that the probable

volume of CH,, in aqueous solution was 15.

     During the past year the author has returned to tbis point, and it is his inten-
tion to fully examine a series of organic bodies in various solvents with the
object of ascertaining the apparent volumes of 0, H, 0, &c., in organic bodies. The
work is at present only in the preliminary stage, but the results are such as to

encourage him to proceed with it.
     Solutions of the commoner compound ethers in benzol, xylol, and rectified

spirits have been prepared and their densities determined. The solutions were
made by dissolving weighed quantities of the ethers in known amounts of the

solvents, and the densities were determined at 20° 0.
--684 REPORT 1892,

     "With regard to these results it is to he noted that the ethers were obtained
from commercial samples by fractionation, and the composition has not yet been
checked by analysis or by determining the vapour density ; further, that, while in

the first series the value of OHo depends on two substances for each of the mem-

bers of the pair, that of 3(CH,) depends on one substance for one of the pair and
two for the other, and it is most probable that the ethyl formate is slightly acid,

Weand thus the molecular volume is too low, and the value of CH^ is too hio-h.

     They attached to a leaden coil of two litres capacity a strong glass tube of
10 to 25 cubic centimetres capacity, closed at one end, and separated at its other
end from the coil by a gas-tight steel tap, the bore of which had the same diameter
as the glass tube. The glass gauge had previously been calibrated and graduated.
The coU was then filled with the explosive mixture, while the glass gauge i to-
gether with the bore of the tap was filled with air or hydrogen. The instant before
the mixture was fired the tap separating the coil from the gauge was opened, and
the flash due to the exploding gases darted into the gauge. The experiment con-
sisted in taking a photograph upon a sensitive plate of the flash in the gauge. It
was found possible to obtain photographs which showed the flash to come to a
well-defined and abrupt termination, marking the volume into which the air in

the gauo-e had been compressed. By this means the authors hold that the air in

the gauge is compressed adiabatically, and with the data aflbrded by the photograph
they'had originally intended to calculate the pressure produced in the explosion by

Ilankine's well-known formula

                                P' = P (;)

The assumption was therefore made that there is no loss of heat up to the time

that the flash attains its furthest limit. To obtain some data to justify this

assumption the authors took a photograph of the flash upon a swinging plate

attached to a pendulum chronograph. The plate moved past the flash at the rate

of 2i- metres per second. The photographs so obtained could scarcely be dis-

tinguished  from those taken upon a stationary  plate                            they were  perfectly symme-
                                                                              ;

trical ; only the slightest possible increase in breadth could be detected. These
photographs showed that the compression is approximately instantaneous, and that

the flash ceases to have any sensible photo-chemical action in an interval of time

less than one five-thousandth of a second. In so short an interval of time the
compressed gas cannot lose a sensible quantity of heat. It would appear, therefore,

rio-ht to assume that the compression is adiabatic. The authors believe also that

no appreciable diffusion of the compressed gas into the compressing gas can occur

during the very brief time of compression.

Further, since thermo-dynamic theory proves the ratio of the two specific heats

of any perfect gas to be approximately constant for all temperatures and pressures,

Eankine's formula may be employed' to calculate the pressure produced by the

explosion when the gauge is filled with air or hydrogen.

Essentially, therefore, the method gives a record of the adiabatic compression

of a gas by the explosion, a piston of indefinitely small thickness and mass being

interposed between the compressed and compressing gases.

Experiments have been made with gauges of different volume, varying from

11-55 cubic centimetres to 23-20 cubic centimetres, and the ratio y,^ is found to be

independent within these limits of the volume of the gauge. Further, the ratio

VX is found to be the same, within the error of experiment, whether air or hydro-
o-en is the gas compressed. The photographs obtained, however, in the case of
hydrogen show the flash to be in general iU-defined and pointed, owing probably
to the°high thermal conductivity of hydrogen, combined with a much greater inter-

diffusion with the compressing gases in consequence of the greater molecular

velocity of hydrogen in comparison with that of air.
     The mean value from six diflerent sets of experiments with air and hydrogen,

--electrolytic gas being the explosive mixture, gave                             = 8-6. Calculating P' by

means of Rankine's formula, and taking k = 1-408, it is found that P' = 20-7
atmospheres. This pressure is about twice that measured by former experimenters.

Some experiments were also made with carbonic acid gas ; in these the explosion
compressed the gas into a much smaller volume, owing to the great variation of
the two specific heats of carbonic acid gas -s^itb increase of temperature and

pressure.

   A careful consideration, however, of these experiments makes it very doubtful

whether the pressure can he calculated in this way. It would appear that the
problem cannot be treated as other than a hydrodynamical one, the solution of
which must be left to the mathematician. There can be little doubt that the inertia
of the gases cannot be neglected, and that the pressure produced by the explosion
is less than that calculated above, namely, 20*7 atmospheres.

     The authors desire to state tliat the idea upon which their method is based was
suggested to them by Professor II. B. Dixon.

    Analysis of the Ash. By John J. J. Kyle, Sc.D., Professor of Chemistry

     in the University of Buenos Ayres, Assayer to the Argentine Mint.

    By order of the Minister of the Interior of the Argentine Republic the Director

of the National Board of AVorks forwarded to the author a small sample of coal,
taken from a seam recently discovered near the town of San Raphael, in tlie
province of Mendoza, with instructions to analyse the mineral and to report on its

value as a combustible. The coal is lustrous, black even when finely pulverised,
without fibrous structure, and remarkably brittle. On being heated it softens,
emits much gas, which bums with a smoky flame, yielding a light spongy coke,
which after combustion leaves a singularly small amount of a greenish coloured
ash. The condensed products of its distillation have an acid reaction.

     The specific gravity of the mineral is I*173.

    From the foregoing it is evident that the San Raphael coal is one of great

interest, heing not only of fair quality as a combustible, but being also available as

a source of vanadic acid for industrial purposes, seing that each ton of the mineral,
supposing it to be equal to the sample, v?ill produce over 14 lbs. of jnire ash con-

taining 4| lbs. of the vanadic pentoxide, of which 3| lbs. may be extracted by

simple treatment of the ash with an alkaline liquor, whilst the remainder is of

course susceptible of extraction from the insoluble part, as in the case of basic
slags of Creusot ('Comptes Rend.,' xcv. 42-44), which contain but 1-5 per cent.

In short, the ash of the San Raphael lignite is, so far as my knowledge goes, the

richest known material utilisable as a source of vanadium compounds. I have

mytaken steps to obtain information regarding: the carboniferous strata whence

sample of mineral was derived ; the details cannot fail to be of great interest.
Meanwhile I have been assured that the seam where explored is about a metre in
thickness. The Argentine provinces of Cordoba and San Luis are abeady well
known as sources of vanadium minerals, such as vanadinite, dixloizite, and

psitlacinite. The province of Mendoza must now be added to the list of localities

in the Argentine Republic where vanadium is to be found.

We have made a re-determination of the atomic weight of boron by the follow-

ing methods :

   A1 preliminary re-determlnation of the water of crystallisation in borax.

     2. Conversion of anhydrous sodium borate into sodium chloride, by distillation

of the borax with hydrochloric acid and methyl alcohol, and weighing the result-

ing sodium chloride.

Pure borax was prepared from pure boracic acid and pure soda. It was found

to be an efflorescent substance, so the estimation of the water of crystallisation is
Wehardly a method suited for an atomic weight determination.

j)eriments upon it during damp weather, so that the loss of water that it under-

went was not great.

                      Method I.

    Determination of the water of crystallisation in borax, NaoB,0 J0II,O.

   A weighed quantity of borax, generally about 6 grams, was placed in a plati-

num dish, and heated 'in an air-bath at a temperature of about^90-I10° C. for

some time ; the temperature was gradually raised to about 350° C. ; the borax
swelled up very much, and in some cases there was loss by spurting ; the dish was
then taken out of the air-bath, and the borax fused over the blowpipe ; it was

then allowed to cool in a desiccator, and the fused borax weighed. The loss in

weight gave the percentage of water, from which the atomic weight was calcu-

lated.

    The results are given in Table I. The mean atomic weight obtained is 10-921

for boron.                                                         = 16;

     The atomic weights used in the calculations are: 11 = 1-008;

Na = 2305; 01 = 35-45; Ag = 107 92.

silver chloride was collected on a Gooch's filter, and dried in an air-bath at a tem-

                                6. On the Iodides of Sulphur.
                        By Professor Herbert McLeod, F.B.S.

    An iodide of sulphur, Slg, isomorphous with iodine was prepared by Landolt and

measured crystallographically by vom Rath (Pogg. ' Aunalen,' ex. 116). It was
made by allowing a solution of iodine and sulphur in carbonic disulphide to evapo-
rate spontaneously. As the existence of this compound has been adduced as a

proof of the hexad character of sulphur, it seemed advisable to investigate its

properties.

     Some of the substance was prepared by the process mentioned, and in order to
separate it from any admixture of iodine it was placed in a tube which was after-
wards exhausted by the Sprengel pump and sealed. One end of tlie tube was then
surrounded by muslin, kept wet with water by means of a piece of cotton-wick;
iodine volatilised, at first rapidly, but afterwards more slowly. After the lapse of
three months a residue was left at the end of the tube, which, on analysis, was

found to contain 98'5 per cent, of sulphur.
      Another quantity was dissolved in carbonic disulphide and the solution allowed

to evaporate ; as crystals were formed the liquid was poured off and the crystals
washed with carbonic disulphide. In this manner five crops of crystals were
obtained, none of which contained more than -5 per cent, of sidphur ; the residue
left on allowing the mother liquor to evaporate contained 56 per cent, of sulphur.

      The iodine is entirely removed from the substance by digesting it in a solution

 of potassic iodide.

      AVhen some of the powdered substance is exposed to the air in a shallow layer

the iodine all volatUises, leaving a residue of sulphur.

      "When acted on by a solution of sodic hydrate a residue of sulphur is left, and
the solution gives very little precipitate with baric chloride after acidifying with

hydrochloric acid.

     The properties of the substance seem to indicate that it is a mechanical mixture
of iodine and sulphur, and not a chemical compound.

     Some experiments were then made with the iodide of sulphur, SoL, described
by Guthrie. This was prepared by mixing chloride of sulphur, So01o,*with ethylic

iodide and allowing the mixture to remain in a sealed tube for four" days. Black

crystals were then found in the tube. On opening the latter a large quantity of
the vapour of ethylic iodide escaped. The crystals were removed from the tube
and powdered. On heating a portion in a test tube it fused at a temperature a little

 above the boiling point of water.

     Some of the substance in vacuo gave oflF iodine, leaving a light-coloured residue.
     Some of the substance dissolved in sulphide of carbon was crystallised fraction-
ally : the first crop contained -38 per cent, of sulphur ; the second, SI ; the third,
1-07; and the fourth, 34-78. On allowing the mother liquor to evaporate the residue

contained 76'32 per cent, of sulphur.

    When acted on by sodic hydrate the iodine is removed and all the sulphur

remains behind, the solution giving no precipitate with baric chloride after adding
hydrochloric acid. It is usually stated in text-books that the compound undergoes
a decomposition similar to that of chloride of sulphur, forming an iodide and a
sulphite or thiosulphate with separation of sulphur.

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  691

    The fusing point being lower than those of iodine and sulphur would indicate
tliat some chemical action takes place when the elements are mixed together, but
its properties more resemble those of a non-metaUic alloy than of a definite chemical

compound.

             7. On Solutions of Iodine. By W. W. J. NicOL, D.8c.

     The question as to the composition of the iodine molecule in solution is one
which has from time to time attracted the attention of chemists. It is well known
that the colour of dilute solutions of iodine is dependent largely on the nature of
the solvent, and this difference of colour has been generally attributed to a greater
or less complexity of the iodine molecule. The well-known violet of iodine vapour
is characteristic of the solution of iodine in carbon disulphide, and from this it is
argued the molecule must be the same in both states, i.e., T,,.

     The methods employed for the determination of the molecular weight of iodine
in solution have been two : that dependent on the lowering of the freezing point

--of the solvent a method necessarily applicable to but few solutions --the other

relies on the alteration of the vapour pressure of the solvent, a method of general
applicability. The first of these has been employed by Gautier and Charpy, the
second by Loeb and Beckmaun.

     But these results are far from satisfactory, and the author has endeavoured lo
throw further light on this subject by a study of the molecular volume of iodine
in solution. His experiments are far from complete, but he wished to lay some of the
first results before the Section with the object of reserving his special method of

investigating the point.

     The method of experimenting is extremely simple: solutions of iodine in various
solvents are prepared of definite strength by direct weighing of both substances, the
specific gravity of the solutions is then determined at a definite temperature (20° C),
and thus the apparent volume of the iodine in solution can be calculated.

     The following are the results obtained :

       13. Note on Valency or Atomicity. By Wm. Durham, F.R.S.E.

     The author referred to several communications which he had made to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh many years ago, and to a paper in the ' Revue des
Sciences Gen^rales ' for June last, by Professor Schutzenberger, of the Royal College
of France, who puts forth views identical with the author's.

     Although it is quite true that the constitution of matter is atomic, there is no
evidence to show that the chemical affinity associated with these atoms acts in
units or in an atomic manner, but that on the contrary it acts within certain limits

in all proportious, and may be all exhausted in combination, or part of it may be
left as a residue too weak to produce a further undoubted chemical compound, but

yet of sufficient energy to produce the phenomena of solution.
    Take, for instance, NH3. From this compound it is inferred that nitrogen is a

triad, but it is found that this substance can combine with other two monad
elements, viz., IICl. To explain this it is said that nitrogen acts sometimes as a
pentad, and the resultant compound is represented thus :

                                                                               II

        N--I

     II-- CI

      i{\

This must mean that the nitrogen, although already combined with three

hydrogen atoms, and presumably possessing less chemical affinity than when free,
Hhas yet sufficient energy left, not only to combine with one additional atom of
Hand one of CI, but also to dissociate the atoms of
                                                     and CI combined as IICl.

From the known affinities of the substances concerned this appears to the author

to be incredible, and Professor Schutzenberger is of the same opinion. Analogous

difficulties are found iu double salts, such as the chlorides of platinum and potas-

sium, &c. The solution of all these difficulties and many others of a like nature is

very simple if it be admitted that chemical affinity is exercised, not in units, but as

it were all round in any proportion, according to circumstances. Thus NII4CI may

be repi'esented graphically thus, without supposing any residual affinity whatever,

although the author believes there is such :
                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.  693

     Analogous arrangements would represent the double chlorides. These examples
were given in the author's original paper eleven years ago, and are the same aa
those which were given by Professor Schutzenberger in June last.

     In 1878, in another paper, the author stated that from the behaviour of clay in
water and other experiments he had come to the conclusion that in chemical com-
pounds the affinity is not all exhausted in all cases, but that sometimes enough
remained to give rise to solution and suspension phenomena, and that there is a
regular gradation between chemical combination, solution, and suspension. The

idea of residual affinity has now been adopted by many chemists, and lately Messrs.
Picton and Linders, from experiments on solution of sulphites, have also come to

the conclusion that there is no hard-and-fast line between solution and suspension.
This confirms the conclusion which the author drew from his experiments of

fourteen years ago.

14. On a Method for Determining the Vapour-j)ressures of Solutions. By

     Thomas Ewan, B.Sc, Ph.D., 1851 Exhibition Scholar at the Owens

    College, and W. R. Obmandy, Bishop Berkeley Fellow at the Owens

       College.

     M. G. Charpy has pointed out in the ' Comptes Rendus ' for 1890, p. Ill, the
possibility of using a condensation hygrometer of Regnault's form for the determi-
nation of the vapour-pressures of solutions. The paper contains a description of
some experiments which we have made with this method.

     The solution to be examined was placed in a cylindrical vessel, 4'5 cm. in
diameter and 13'5 cm. long, with a narrower neck 20 cm. long. The solution was
stirred by means of a ring of platinum wire attached to a light glass rod. The

hygrometer, consisting of a single silver cup attached to a glass tube 22 cm. long,

slipped loosely into the vessel containing the solution, was suspended about half

an inch above its surface.
     The whole apparatus was placed in a water-bath, which could be kept at a

constant temperature.

     The readings of the dew-point were made by observing the temperature at
which the first traces of dew appeared on the hygrometer. The vapour-pressure of
water corresponding to the temperature of the dew-point was taken from Regnault's
tables. The number so obtained is the vapour-pressure of the solution at the tem-

perature of the water-bath.

     The accm-acy of the method was tested by a number of readings with
      (a.) Water.
     (b.) Solutions of NaCl and CuCl,,.
     Table I. contains the readings made with water ; the dew-point should coincide

with the temperature of the water.

The President delivered the following Address on Monday, August 8 :

It has, I believe, been the rule for the man who has been honoured by election to

the Chair of President of tie Geological Section of the British Association to

address its members upon the recent advances made in that branch of geology in

which he has himself been most immediately interested. It is not my intention

upon the present  occasion to depart  from  this  time-honoured  custom                                     for it has
                                                                                                         ;

both the merit of simplicity and the advantage of utility to recommend it. In

this way each branch of our science, as it becomes in turn represented, not only
submits to the workers in other departments a report of its own progress, but

presents by implication a broad sketch of the entire geological landscape, seen

through the coloured glasses, it may be, of divisional prejudice, but at any rate

instructive and corrective to the workers in other departments, as being taken

from what is to them a novel and an unfamiliar point of view.

Now every tyro in geology is well aware of the fact that the very backbone of

geological science is constituted by what is known as stratigraphical geology, or

the study of the geological formations. These formations, stratified and un-

stratified, build up all that part of the visible earth-crust which is accessible to the

investigator. Their outcropping edges constitute the visible exterior of our globe,

the ten-aqueous surface of which forms the physical geography of the lands of the

present day ; and their internal characters and inter-relationships afford us our

only clues to the physical geographies of bygone ages. Within them lies enshrmed

aU. that we may ever hope to discover of the history and the development of the

habitable world of the past.
     These formations are to the stratigraphical geologist what species are to the

biologist, or what the heavenly bodies are to the astronomer. It was the discovery

of these formations which first elevated geology to the rank of a science. In the

working out of their characters, their relationships, their development, and their
origin, geology finds its means, its aims, and its justification. Whatever fresh

maWalour science may yield to man's fuU conception of nature, organic and

inorganic, must of necessity be grouped around these special and peculiar objects

of its contemplation.

    When the great Werner first taught that our earth-crust was made up of

.superimposed rock-sheets, or formations, arranged in determinable order, the value

of his conclusions from an economic point of view soon led to their enthusiastic
and careful study ; and his crude theory of their successive precipitation from a

universal chaotic ocean disarmed the suspicions of the many until the facts
 themselves had gained such a wide acceptance that denial was no longer

possible. But when the greater Hutton asserted that each of these rock-
 formations was in reality nothing more or less than the recemented ruins of an

 earlier world, the prejudices of mankind at large were loosed at a single stroke.
Like Galileo's assertion of the movement of the globe, this demanded such
696 KEPOET-- 1892.

a simple and apparently undignified mode of creation that there is no wonder

that, even down to the present day, there still exist some to whom this is a hard

saying, to be taken, if taken at all, in homoeopathic doses and with undisguised

reluctance.

    Hutton as regards his philosophy was, as we know, far in advance of his
time. With all the boldness of conviction he unflinchingly followed out his ideas
to their legitimate results. He claimed that as the stratified formations were com-

-- --posed of similar materials sands, clays, limestones, and muds to those now

being laid down in the seas around our present coasts, they must, like them, have

--been the products of the ordinary natural agencies of rain, rivers, and sea waters,
--internal heat and external cold acting precisely as they act now. And, further,

that as these formations lie one below the other, in apparently endless downward
succession, and are all formed more or less of these fragmentary materials, so the
present order of natural phenomena must have existed for untold ages. Indeed, to

the continixance of this order, he frankly admits ' I see no trace of a beginning
or sign of an end.'

     The history of the slow acceptance of Hutton's doctrines, even among geologists,
is, of course, perfectly familiar to us all. William Smith reduced the disputed forma-
tions to order, and showed that not only was each composed of the ruins of a
vanished land, but that each contained in its fossils the proof that it was deposited
in a vanished sea inhabited by a special life creation. Cuvier followed, and proved
that the fossilised relics of these departed beings were such as made it absolutely
unquestionable that these creatures might well have inhabited the earth at the
present day. Lyell completed the cycle by demonstrating stage by stage the
efficiency of present natural agencies to do all the work required for the degrada-
tion and rebuilding of the formations. Since his day the students of strati-
graphical geology have universally acknowledged that in the study of present
geographical causes lies the key to the geological formations and to the inorganic
world of the past.

     In this way the road was paved for Darwin and the doctrine of descent. The

aid which had been so ungrudgingly afforded by biology to geology was repaid by
one of the noblest gifts ever made by one science to another. For the purposes
of geology, the science of biology had practically completed a double demonstra-
tion : first, that the extinct life discernible in the geological formations was linked
inseparably with the organic life of the present ; and, second, that every fossil
recognised by the geologist was the relic of a creature that might well have existed
upon the surface of the earth at the present time. Geology repaid its obligation
to biology by the still greater twofold demonstration : first, that in the economy
of nature the most insignificant causes are competent to the grandest effects, if only
a sufficiency of time be granted them ; and, second, that in the geological forma-
tions we have the evidences of the actual existence of those mighty eons in which
such work might be done.

      The doctrine of organic evolution would always have remained a metaphysical
dream had geology not given the time in which the evolution could be accom-
plished. The ability of present causes to bring about slow and cumulative changes
in the species is, to all intents and purposes, a biological application of Hutton's
ideas with respect to the origin of the geological formations. Darwin was a bio-
logical evolutionist, because he was first a uniformitarian geologist. Biology is
pre-eminent to-day among the natural sciences, because its younger sister, Geology,
gave it the means.

     But the inevitable consequence of the work of Darwin and his colleagues was
that the centre of gravity, so to speak, of popular regard and public controversy,,
was suddenly shifted from stratigraphical geology to biology. Since that day
stratigraphical geology, to its great comfort and advantage, has gone quietly on its
way unchallenged, and all its more recent results have, at least by the majority of

the wonder-loving public, been practically ignored.
      Indeed, to the outside observer it would seem as if stratigraphical geology for

the first half of the present, forced the geology of their day into the very front rank
of the natural sciences, and made it perhaps the most conspicuous of tliem all in
the eyes of the world at large. Since that time, however, their successors have been
mainly occupied in completing the work of the great pioneers. The stratigraphical

geologists themselves have been almost wholly occupied in laying down upon our
maps the superficial outlines of the great formations, and workhig out their inter-
relationships and subdivisions. At the present day the young stratigraphical student
soon learns that all the limits of our great formations have been laid down iu
our maps and textbooks, and finds but little to add to the accepted nomenclature

of the time.

Our palaeontologists, also, have equally busied themselves in working out the

rich store of  the  organic  remains of  the geological formations                                                                                                                       and  the  youthful

investigator soon discovers that almost every fossil he is able to detect in the field

has already been named, figured, and described, and its place in the geological

record more or less accurately fixed.

In France, in Germany, in Norway, Sweden, and elsewhere, in Canada and in

the United States, work as thorough and as satisfactory has been accomplished,

and the local development of the great stratified formations and their fossils has

been laid down with detail and clearness.

Many an unfledged but aspiring geologist, alive to these facts, and contrast-

ing the well-mapped ground of the present time with the virgin lands of the days

of the great pioneers, finds it hard to stifle a feeling of keen regret that there

are, nowadays, no new geological worlds to conquer, no new systems to discover and

name, and no strange and unexpected faunas to unearth and bring forth to the

astonished light of day. The youth of stratigraphical geology, with all its wonder

and freshness, seems to have departed, and all that remains is to accept, to

commemorate, and to round oflf the glorious victories of the dead heroes of our

science.

    But to the patient stratigraphical veteran, who has kept his eyes open to dis-
coveries new and old, this lull in the war of geological controversy presents itself

rather as a grateful breathing time ; the more grateful as he sees looming rapidly
up in front the vague outlines of those oncoming problems which it will be the
duty and the joy of the rising race of young geologists to grapple with, and to

conquer, as their fathers met and vanquished the problems of the past. He knows

perfectly well that geology is yet in her merest youth, and that to justify even
her very existence there can he no rest until the whole earth-crust and all its
phenomena, past, present, and to come, have been subjected to the domain of

human thought and comprehension. There can be no more finality in geology

than in any other science ; the discovery of to-day is merely the stepping-stone to

the discovery of to-morrow ; the living theory of to-morrow must be nourished

by the relics of its parent theory of to-day.

    Now if we ask what are these formations which constitute the objects of study

of the stratigraphical geologist, I am afraid that, as in Ihe case of the species of the

biologist, no two authorities would agree in framing precisely the same definition.

The original use of the term formation was of necessity lithological, and even now
the name is most naturally applied to any great sheet of rock which forms a com-
ponent member of the earth-crust ; whether the term be used specifically for a

thin homogeneous sheet of rock like the Stonesfield slate, ranging over a few

square miles ; or generically, for a compound sheet of rock, like the Old Red
Sandstone many thousands of feet in thickness, but whose collective lithological

characteristics give it an individuality recognisable over the breadth of an entire

continent.

    When Werner discovered that the 'formations' of Saxony followed each

other in a certain recognisable order, a second characteristic of a formation

--became superposed upon the original lithological conception namely, that of de-

terminate ' relative position.' And when William Smith proved that each of the

formations of the Enghsh Midlands was distinguished by an assemblage of organic

--remains peculiar to itself, there became added yet a third criterion that of the

possession of 'characteristic fossils.'
                                                                                               ;

But these later superposed conceptions of time-succession, and life-type, are

far better expressed by dividing the geological formations, on the one hand, into

zoological zones, and grouping them together, on the other hand, into chronological

si/stems. For in the experience of every geologist he finds his mind instinctively

harking back to the bare lithological application of the word ' formation,' and I do

not see that any real advantage is gained by departing from the primitive use of

Ihe term.

    A zotie, which may be regarded as the unit of palcBontological succession, is

marked by the presence of a special fossil, and may include one or many sub-

Aordinate formations, or only a part of a formation.                  system, which is, broadly

speaking, the unit of geological successioyi, includes many ' zones,' and often, but
Anot always, many ' formations.'
                                                        formation, which is the unit of geological

stratigraphy, is a rock sheet composed of many strata possessing common litho-

logical characters. The formation may be simple, like the Ghalk, or compound,

like the New Red Sandstone, but, simple or compound, local or regional, it must be

always recognisable, geographically and geologically, as a lithological individual.

    As regards the natural grouping of these lithological individuals as such, fair

Weprogress has been made of late years, and our information is growing apace.

know that there are at any rate three main groups : First, the stratified formations

due to the action of moving water above the earth-crust ; second, the igneous forma-

tions which are derived from below the earth-crust ; third, the metamorphic forma-

Wetions which have undergone change within the earth-crust itself.                             know also

that of these three the only group which has hitherto proved itself available for the

purpose of reading the past history of the globe is that of the stratified formations.

Studying these stratified formations therefore in greater detail, we find that they

fall naturally in their turn into two sets, viz., a mechanical set of pebble beds,

sandstones and clays, formed of rock fragments, washed oft' the land into the waters,

and an organic set of limestones, chalk, &c., formed of the shells and exuviae of

marine organisms.

But when we attempt a further division of these two sets, our classification

Wesoon begins to lose its definiteness.                 infer that some formations, such as the

Old Red and the Triassic, were the comparatively rapid deposits of lakes and inland

seas                       that others, like the  Coal  Measures, London Clay, &c., were  the  less rapid
                        ;

deposits of lagoons, river valleys, deltas, and the like ; that others, like our finely

laminated shales and clays of the Silurian and Jurassic, were the slower deposits of

the broader seas ; and finally, that others, like our Chalk and Greensand, were

possibly the extremely slow deposits of the more oceanic deeps.

Nevertheless, after looking at the formations collectively, there remains no

·doubt whatever in the mind of the geologist that their mechanical members are

the results of the aqueous degradation of vanished lands, and that their organic

members are the accumulated relics of the stony secretions of what once were

living beings. Neither is there any possibility of escape from the conclusion that

--they have all been deposited by water in the superficial hollows the lakes, the
--sea-bottoms, and the ocean tioors of the earth-crust of their time.

In the life of every individual stratified formation of the mechanical type we

·can always distinguish three stages : first, a stage of erosion and transportation,

in which the rock fragments were worn oft' the rocks of the higher ground and
washed down by rain and rivers to the sea ; second, a stage of deposition and

consolidation below the surface of the quiet waters ; and third, a final stage in
which the completed rock-formation was bent and upheaved, in part at least, into

solid land. In the formations of the organic type three corresponding stages are

equally discernible : first, the period of mineral secretion by organised beings

second, the period of deposition and consolidation; and third, the final period of

local elevation in mass. But one and all, mechanical and organic alike, the forma-

tions bear in their composition, in their arrangement, and in their fossils, abun-

dant and irresistible evidences that they were the products, and that they are

the memorials of the physical geography of their time.

Guided by the principles of Hutton and Lyell, geologists have worked out with

great care and completeness the effects of those agencies which rule in the first
                        TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                          699

of tliese three life-stages in tbe history of a mechanical formation. No present
geological processes ai'e better known to the young geologist than those of

denudation, erosion, and transportation, so familiar to us in the eloquent works of
our President. They form together the subject-matter of that most wonderful and
fascinating chapter in geology which, from its modest opening among the quiet

Norfolk sandhills, sweeps upwards and onwards without a break to its magnificent
close on the brink of the gorge of the Colorado. But our knowledge of the de-
tailed processes of deposition and consolidation which rule in the second stage
is still exceedingly imperfect, although a flood of light has been thrown upon

the subject by the brilliant results of the Challenger Expedition. And we are

compelled to admit that our knowledge of the operations of those agencies which
rule in the processes of upheaval and depression is as yet almost nil ; and what

little we have already learnt of the effects of those agencies is the prey of hosts of

conflicting theories that merely serve to annoy and bewilder the working student

of the science.

     But not one of the formative triad of detrition, deposition, and elevation can

exist without the others. No detrition is possible without the previous upheaval

of the rock-sheet from which material can be removed ; no deposition is possible
without the previous depression of tbe rock-sheet which forms the basin in which

the fragmentary material can be laid down.
     Our knowledge, therefore, of the origin and meaning of any geological

formation whatever can at most be only fragmentary until this third chapter in

the life-history of the geological formation has been attacked in earnest.

    Now, all the rich store of knowledge that we possess respecting the first stage

in the life of a geological formation has been derived from a comparison of the

phenomena which the stratigraphical geologist finds in the rock formations of the
past, with correspondent phenomena which the physical geographer discovers on

the surface of the earth of the present. And all that we know of the second stage
has been obtained in precisely the same way. Surely analogy and common sense

both teach us that all which is likely to be of permanent value to us as regards
the final stage of elevation and depression must first be sought for in the same

direction.

Within the last twenty years or so many interesting and vital discoveries have

been made in the stratigraphy of the rock formations that bear largely upon this

obscure chapter of elevation and depression. And I propose on this occasion that

we try to summarise a few of these new facts ; and, reading them in conjunc-

tion with what we actually know of the physical geography of the present da,y, try

to ascertain how such mutual agreement as we can discover may serve to aid the

stratigraphical geologist in his interpretation of the true meaning of the geological

Weformations themselves.  may not hope for many years to come to read the

whole of this geological chapter, but we may perhaps modestly essay an interpre-

tation of one or two of the opening paragraphs.

In the physical geography of the present day, we find the exterior of our
Weterraqueous globe divided between the two elements of land and water.
                                                                            know

that the solid geological formations exist everywhere beneath the visible surface of

the lands, but of their existence under the present ocean floor we have as yet no

Weabsolute certainty.   know both the form of the surface and the composition

of the outer layers of the continental parts of the lithosphere ; we only know as

yet even in outline the form of the surface of its oceanic portions.

     The surface of each of our great continental masses of land resembles that of

a long and broad arch-like form, of which we see the simplest type in the New

World. The surface of the North American arch is sagged downwards in the

middle  into a central  depression which  lies between two  long  marginal  plateaux
                                                                                                                       ;

and these plateaux are finally crowned by the wrinkled crests which form its two

modern mountain systems. The surface of each of our ocean floors exactly resembles

that of a continent turned upside down. Taking the Atlantic as our simplest type,

we may say that the surface of an ocean basin resembles that of a mighty trough

or synchne, buckled up more or less centrally into a medial ridge, which is bounded

by two long and deep marginal hollows, in the cores of which still deeper grooves

sink to the profoundest depths. This complementary relationship descends even to

the minor features of the two. Where the great continental sag sinks below
the ocean level, we have our gulfs and our Mediterraneans, seen in our type
continent as the Mexican Gulf and Hudson Bay. Where the central oceanic
huckle attains the water-line we have our oceanic islands, seen in our type ocean

as St. Helena and the Azores. Although the apparent crust-waves are neither
equal in size nor symmetrical in form, this complementary relationship between
them is always discernible. The broad Pacific depression seems to answer to the

--broad elevation of the Old World the narrow trough of the Atlantic to the

narrow continent of America.
     Every primary wave of the earth's surface, again, is broken up into minor weaves,

in each of which the ridge and its complementary trough are always recognisable.
The compound ridge of the Alps answers to the compound Mediterranean trough

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the continuous western mountain chains of the Americas to the continuous hollow
of the Eastern Pacific which bounds them ; the sweep of the crest of the Himalaya
to the curve of the Indo-Gangetic depression. Even where the surface vraves of
the lithosphere lie more or less buried beneath the waters of the ocean and the
seas, the same rule always obtains. The island chains of the Antilles answer to
the several Caribbean abysses, those of the ^Egeau Archipelago answer to the
Levantine deeps.

    Draw a section of the surface of the lithosphere along a great circle in any

direction, the rule remains always the same : crest and trough, height and hollow,
succeed each other in endless sequence, of every gradation of size, of every degree of
complexity. Sometimes the ridges are continental, like those of the Americas ; some-
times orographic, like those of the Himalaya; sometimes they are local, like those

of the English Weald. But so long as we do not descend to minor details we find
that every line drawn across the earth's surface at the present day rises and falls
like the imaginary line drawn across the surface of the waves of the ocean. No
rise of that line occurs without its complementary depression ; the two always go

together, and must of necessity be considered together. Each pair constitutes one
of those geographical units of form of which every continuous direct line carried
over the surface of the lithosphere of our globe is made up. This unit is always
made up of an arch-like rise and a trough-like depression, which shade into each
other along a middle line of contrary curvature. It resembles the letter S or
Hogarth's line of beauty, and is clearly similar in form to the typical wave of
the physicist. Here, then, we reach a very simple and natural conclusion : viz.,
the surface of the earth-crust of the present day resembles that of a series of crust-
waves of different lengths and different amplitudes, more or less irregular and
complex, it is true, but everywhere alternately rising and falling in symmetrical
halves like the waves of the sea.

    Now this rolling wave-like earth-surface is formed of the outcropping edges of

the rock formations which are the special objects of study of the stratigraphical
geologist. If, therefore, the physiognomy of the face of our globe is any real index

of the character of the personality of the earth-crust beneath, these collective

geographical features should be precisely those which answer to the collective

structural characters of the geological formations.

      In the earlier days of geology one of the first points recogni,«ed by our strati-
graphists was the fact that the formations were successive lithological sheets, who.se
truncated outcropping edges formed the present surface of the land, and that these
sheets lay inclined at an ano-le one over the other, or, as William Smith quaintly
expressed it, like a tilted ' pile of slices of bread-and-butter.' But as discovery
progressed, the explanation of this arrangement soon became evident. The forma-
tions revealed themselves as a series of what had originally been deposited as hori-
zontal sheets, lying in regular order one over the other, but which had been
subsequently bent up into alternating arches and troughs (the anticlines and syn-

clines of the geologist). Their visible parts, which now constitute the surface of

our habitable lands, are simply those parts of the formations which are cut by the
irregular plane of the present earth surface. All those parts of the great arches
 and troughs, formerly occurring above that plane, have been removed by denu-
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  701

dation; all those parts below that plane lie buried still, out of sight within the solid

earth-crust.

     Although in every geological section of sufficient extent it was seen that the

--anticline or arch never occurred without the syncline or trough in other words,
--that there was never a rise without a corresjionding fall of the stratum yet it is only

of late years that the stratigrapbical geologist has come clearly to recognise the
fact that the auticline and syncline must be considered together, and must be united
as a single crust-wave. For the arch is never present without its complementary
trough, and the two together constitute the tectonic, structural, or orographic unit,

namely. The Fold, the study of which, so brilliantly inaugurated by Heim in his

' Mechanismus der Gebirgsbildung,' is destined, I believe, in time, to give us the
clue to the laws which rule in the local elevation and depression of the earth-crust,
and to furnish us with the means of discovery of the occult causes that lie at
the source of those superficial irregularities which give to the face of our globe its

variety, its beauty, and its habitability.

     Like the form" of the surface wave of the geographer, the form of this wave or

fold of the geologist resembles that of the wave of the physicist. Now we may

regard such a wave as formed of two parts, the arch-like part above, and the
trough-like part below. The length of the wave is naturally the length of the
axial line joining the outer extremities of the arch and trough, and passing through
the centre, node, or point of origin, of the wave itself, which bisects the line of
contrary curvature. The amplitude of the wave is the height of the arch added to
the depth of the trough. The arch part of such a wave, if perfectly symmetrical,
may clearly be regarded as belonging either to a wave travelling to the right,
in which case the complementary trough is the one in that direction ; or it maybe
 regarded as belonging to a wave travelling to the left, in which case its trough must
be the one in that direction. But as in the case of the shore wave, the advancing
 slope of the wave is always the steeper, and the real centre of the wave must lie

 half-way down this steeper slope, so also, in the case of the geological^ fold,

 there is no difficulty in recognising the centre or in tixing the real direction of

 movement.
      The fold of the geologist differs from the ordinary wave of the physicist,

 essentially in the fact that, even in its most elementary conception, as that of a

 plate bent by pressure applied from opposite sides, it necessarily includes the

 element of thickness. And this being the case, the rock sheet which is being folded

 and curved has different layers of its thickness affected differently. In the arch of
 the fold the upper layers of the rock sheet are extended, while its lower layers are

 compressed. On the contrary, in the trough of the fold the upper layers are com-
 pressed, and the lower layers are extended. But in arch and trough alike there
 exists a central layer, which, beyond taking up the common wave-like form,

 remains practically unaffected.
      But the geological fold has, in addition to length and thickness, the further

 element of breadth, and this fact greatly complicates the phenomena.

      Many of the movements which take place in a rock sheet which is being
 folded, or in other words those produced by the bending of a compound sheet com-
 posed of many leaves, can be fairly well studied in a very simple experiment. Take

 an ordinary large note-book, say an inch in thickness, with flexible covers. Kule

  carefully a series of parallel lines across the edges of the leaves at the top of the

 book, about ^ of an incli apart, and exactly at right angles to the plane of the
 cover. Then, holding the front edges loosely, press the book slowly fi-om back and

 front into an S-like form until it can be pressed no further. As the wave grows,
 it will be noticed that the cross lines which have been drawn on the upper edge of

  the book remain fairly parallel throughout the whole of the folding process, except

  in the central third of the book, where they arrange themselves into a beautiful

 sheaf-iike form, showing how much the leaves of tlie book have sheared or slidden
 over each other in this central portion. It will also be seen when the S is

  complete that the book has been forced into a third of its former breadth. It is

 clear that the wave which the book now forms must be regarded as made up of

  three sections : viz., a section forming the outside of the trough on the one side, a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                -

section forming the outside of the arch on the other, and a central or common

section, which may be regarded either as uniting or dividing the other two.

     As this experiment gives us a fair representation of what takes place in a

geological fold, we see at a glance that the geologist is forced to divide his fold into

-- --three parts an arch limb, a trough limb, and a middle limb which latter we may

call the copula or the septum, according as we regard it as connecting or dividing

the other two. Our note-book experiment, again, shows us also that in the

trough limb and the arch limb the leaves or layers undergo scarcely any change of

relative position beyond taking on the growing curvature of the wave. But the

layers in the central part, or septum, undergo sliding and shearing. It will be

found also, by gripping the unbound parts of the book firmly, and practising the

folding in different ways, that this septum is also a region of warping and twisting.

This simple experiment should be practised again and again until these points are

clear, and the various stages of the folding process become apparent, the surface of

the book being forced first into a gentle arch-like rise with a corresponding trough

like fall ; then stage by stage the arch should be pushed over on to the trough until

the surfaces of the two are in contact, and the book can be folded no further.

In the structure of our modern mountain ranges we discover the most beautiful

illustrations of the bending and folding of the rocky formations of the earth-crust.

The early results of Rogers among the Alleghanies, of Lory and Favre in the

Western Alps, have been greatly extended of late years by the discoveries of Heim

and Ealtzer in the Central Alps, of Bertrand in Provence, of Margerie in Languedoc.

of Button and his colleagues in the western ranges of America, and of Peach and

Home and others in the older rocks of Britain. The light these researches throw

upon the phenomena of mountain structure will be found admirably summarised

and discussed in the works of Leconte, of Dana, of Daubree, of Reade, of Heim,

and finally in the magnificent work of Suess, the ' Antlitz der Erde,' of which

only the first two volumes have yet appeared.

     Looking first at the mountain fold in its simplest form as that of a bent rock-

plate, composed of many layers which have been forced into two similar arc-like

forms, the convexities of which are turned the one upwards and the other down-

wards, we find in the present mountain ranges of the globe every kind represented.

We commence with one in which the arch is represented merely by a gentle swell

of the rock sheet, and the trough by an answerin? shallow depres.sion, the two

shading into each other in an area of contrary flexure. From this type we pass
insensibly to others in which we see that the sides of the common limb or septum
are practically perpendicular. From these we pass to folds in which the twisted

common limb or septum overhangs the vertical, and so on to that final extreme

where the arch limb has been pushed completely over on to the trough limb, and

all three members, as in our note-book experiment, are practically welded into one-

conformable solid mass.

In many cases, due partly to the action of transverse pressures, the septum

becomes reduced to  a plane of contrary motion or thrust-plane                                                                                                                                                                                                  Rnd the arch limb

longer a fold, but a fault.

Although the movements of these mountain folds are slow and insensible, and

only effected in the course of ages, so that little or no evidence of the actual move-

ment of any single one of them has been detected since they were first studied, yet

it is perfectly plain that when we regard them collectively, we have here crust folds

in every stage of their existence. Each example in itself represents some one

single stage in the lifetime of a single fold. They are simply crust folds of

different ages. Some are, as it were, just born ; others are in their earliest youth.
Some have just attained their majority, some are in the prime of life, and some are

--in the decrepit stages of old age. Finally, those in which all three members arch
--limb, trough limb, and septum are crushed together into a single mass are dead.

Their life of individual movement is over. If the earth pressure increases the
material which thej' have packed together may of course form a passive part of a

later fold, but they themselves can move no more.

    We see that every mountain fold commences first as a gentle alternate eleva-
                                                                                 ;

tioD and depression of one or more of the component sheets of the geological for-
mations which make up the earth-crust. This movement is due apparently to the

tangential thrusts set up by the creeping together, as it were, of those neighbouring

and more resistant parts of the earth-crust which lie in front of and behind the

moving wave. Yielding slowly to these lateral thrusts the crest of the fold rises
higher and higher, the trough sinks lower and lower, the central common limb

·TOWS more and more vertical, and becomes more and more strained, sheared, and

twisted. As this middle limb yields, the rising arch part of the fold is forced gra-

dually over on to the sinking trough, until at last all three members come into

conformable contact, and further folding as such is impossible. Movement ceases
Wethe fold is dead.
                     see also from our note-book experiment that the final result

of the completion of the fold is clearly to strengthen up and consolidate that part

of the crust plate to the local weakness of which it actually owed its origin and

position. The fold has by its life-action theoretically trebled the thickness of that
part of the earth-plate in which its dead remains now lie. If the lateral pressure

"·oes on increasing, and the layers of the earth-crust again begin to fold in the same
reo-ion, the inert remains of the first fold can only move as a passive part of a

newer fold, either as a part of the new arch-limb, the new trough-limb, or the new

septum. As each younger and younger fold formed in this way necessarily

includes a more resistant, and therefore a thicker, broader, and deeper sheet of the

earth-crust, we have here the phylogenetic evolution of a whole family of crust

folds, each successive member of which is of a higher grade than its immediate

predecessor.

     But it very rarely happens that the continuous plate in which any fold is
imbedded is able to resist the crust-creep until the death of the first fold. Usually,
long before the first simple fold is completed, a new and a parallel one rises in
front of it normally on the side of the trough limb ; and the two grow, as it
were, henceforward, side by side. But the younger fold, being due to a greater

pressure than the older, must of necessity be of a higher specific grade, and the
two together form a generic fold in common.

Our present mountain systems are all constituted of several families of folds,

formed in this way, of different gradations of size, of different dates of origin, and of
different stages of life evolution ; and in each family group the members are related

to each other by this natural genetic affinity.
    Sometimes the new folds are formed in successive order onty on one side of the first

fold, and then we have our unilateral (or so-called unsymmetrical) mountain groups,
like those of the Jiu-a and the Bavarian Alps. Sometimes they are formed on both
sides of the original fold, and then we have our bilateral (or so-called symmetrical)'

ranges, like the Central Alps. In both cases the septa of the aged or dead folds
are of necessity all directed inwards towards the primary fold. If, therefore, they
originate only'on one side of the fold, our mountain group looks unsymmetrical,
with a very .steep side opposed to a gently sloping side, If they grow on both

sides of the original fold, we have the well-known ' fan structure ' of mountain

rano'es. In this case the whole complex range is seen at a glance to be a vast
compound arch of the upper layers of the earth-crust, keyed up by the material of
the dead or dying folds, which, by the necessities of the case, constitute mighty
wedges, whose apices are directed inwards towards the centres of the system. But
a complete arch of this kind is in reality not a single fold, but a double one, with a
septum on both sides of it, and it requires two troughs, one on each side of it, as
its natural complement. The so-called unsymmetrical ranges, therefore, which are
constituted merely of arch limb, trough hmb, and septum, are locally the more

natural and the more common.
     It is clear that in the lifetime of any single fold, its period of greatest effective

energy and most rapid movement must be that of middle life. In early youth the
lateral pressure is applied at a very small angle, and the tangential forces act there-
lore tinder the most disadvantageous circumstances. In the middle life of the fold
the arch limb and the trough limb stand at right angles to the septum, and the
work of deformation is then accomplished tmder the most favourable mechanical
conditions, and with the greatest rapidity. That is to say, the activity of the fold
704 KEPOET-- 1892.

and the rate of movement of the septum, like the speed of the storm wind, vary

directly as the p-radient.

     In our note-book experiment we observed that little or no change took place

in the arch limb and trough limb, while the septum became remarkably sheared

and twisted. The same is the case in nature ; but here we have to recollect that

these moving mountain folds are of enormous size, indeed actual mountains in

themselves. These great arches, scores of miles in length, thousands of feet in

height and thickness, must of necessity be of enormous weight, capable of crushing

to powder the hardest rocks over which they move, while the thrust which drives

them forward is practically irresistible. It is plain, therefore, that, while the great

arch limb and the trough limb of one of these mighty folds move over and under

each other from opposite directions, they form in conjunctiou an enormous machine,

composed of two mighty rollers or millstones, which mangle, roll, tear, squeeze,

and twist the rocky material of the middle limb or septum that lies jammed in

between them into a laminated mass. This deformed material, which is the

characteristic product of the mountain-making forces, is, of course, made up of the

stufi' of the original middle limb of the fold ; and whether we call it breccia,
mylonite, phyllite, or schist, although it may be composed of sedimentarj' stuff,

it is certainly no longer a stratified rock ; and though it may have been originally

purely igneous material, it is certainlj- no longer volcanic. It is now a manu-

factured article made in the great earth mill.

These mountain folds, however, are merely the types of folds and wrinkles of

all dimensions which afl'ect the rock formations of the earth-crust. Within the

mountain chains themselves we can follow them fold within fold, first down to

formations, then to strata, then to laminae, till they disappear at last in micro-

scopic minuteness beyond the limits of ordinaiy vision. Leaving these, however,

for the moment, let us travel rather in the opposite direction, for these mountain

folds are by no means the largest known to the stratigraphical geologist. Look at

any geological section crossing our t^-pe continent of North America, and it will be

found that the whole of the liocky Mountain range on its western side and the

Alleghany ranges on the eastern are really two mighty compound geological anti-

clines, while the central sag of the Mississippi Basin is a compound geological

synchne made up of the whole pile of the geological formations. That is to say,

the continent of North America is composed of a pair of geological folds, the two

arches of which are represented by the Rockies on the one side and the Alleghanies

on the other ; while the intermediate Mississippi syncline is the common property of
both. Here, then, we reach a much higher grade of fold than the orographic or

mountain-making fold, viz., the plateau-making fold or the semi-continental fold,

which, because of its enormous breadth, must include a very much thicker portion

of the earth-crust than the ordinary orographic fold itself.

But which must be the actual middle limbs of these two American folds, the

septal areas where most work is being done and the motion is greatest ?

Taught by what we have already learnt of the mountain wave, the answer is

immediate and certain. They must be the steeper sides of each of the two arches,

Hownamely, those which face the ocean.  perfectly this agrees with the geological

facts goes without saying. It is on the steep Pacific side of the western fold that

the crushing and crumpling of its rocks is the greatest. It is on the Atlantic side

of the eastern fold that the contortion and metamorphisra of its rocks are at their

maximum ; while in the common and gently sloping trough of both folds, namely,

in the intermediate Mississip])i Valley, the entire geological sequence remains prac-

tically unmodified throughout.

Again, which of these two American folds should be the more active at the

present day ? Taught by our study of the mountain wave, the answer again is

immediate and conclusive. It must be that fold whose septum has the steeper

gradient. Geology and geography flash at once into combination. The steeper

Pacific septum of the western fold, from Cape Horn almost to Alaska, is ablaze with

volcanoes, or creeping with earthquakes ; while the gently inclined Atlantic septiuu

of the eastern fold, from Greenland to Magellan Straits, shows none, except on the

outer edge of the Antilles, in the very region where the slope of the septal surface
                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                              705

Weis the steepest.      see at a glance that the vigour of these two great continental

folds, like those of our mountain waves, varies directly as the surface gradient of

the septum.

    But the geographical surface of North America, considered as a whole, is in

Wereality that of a double arch with a sag or common trough in the middle.

have seen already that this double arch must be regarded as the natural comple-

ment of the equally double Atlantic trough. Here, then, if the path of analogy
we have hitherto so triumphantly followed up to this point is still to guide us,

the basin of the Atlantic must be, not only in appearance but in actuality, formed

of two long minor folds of the same grade as the two that form the framework of

America, but with their members arranged in reverse order. If so, their sub-

marine septa ought also to he lines of movement and of volcanic action. And

this is again the case. The volcanic islands of the Azores and St. Helena lie not

exactly on the longitudinal crests of the mid-oceanic Challenger ridge, but upon

its bounding flanks.

    We have not yet, however, finished with our simple folds. If we draw a

line completely round the globe, crossing the Atlantic basin at its shallowest,

between Cape Verde and Cape St. Roque, and continued in the direction of Japan,

where the Pacific is at its deepest, as the trace of a great circle, we find that we

Wehave before us a crust fold of the very highest and grandest order.       have one

mighty continental arch stretching from Japan to Chili, broken medially by the

sag of the Atlantic trough; and we see that this great terrestrial arch stands

directly opposed to its natural complement, the great trough of the Pacific, which

is bent up in the middle by the mightiest of all the submarine buckles of the

earth-crust, on which stand the oceanic islands of the central Pacific.

But if this be true, then the septum of all septa on our present earth-crust

must cross our grandest earth fold where the very steepest gradient occurs along

this line, and it must constitute the centre-point of the moving earth fold, and of

greatest present volcanic activity. And where is this most sudden of all de-

pressions ? Taught once more by our geological fold, the answer is instantaneous

and incontrovertible. It is on the shores of Japan, the mightiest and most active

of all the living and moving volcanic localities on the face of our globe.

But the course of the line which we indicated as forming our grandest terres-

trial fold returns upon itself. It is an endless fold, an endless band, the common

possession of two sciences. It is geological in origin, geographical in effect. It

is the wedding ring of geology and geography, imiting them at once and for ever

in indissoluble union.

Such an endless fold, again, must have an endless septiun, which in the nature

of things must cross it twice. Need I point out to the merest tyro in these wedded

sciences that if we unite the Old and New Worlds, and Australia, with their inter-

mediate sags of the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, as one imperial earth-arch, and

regard the unbroken watery expanse of the Pacific as its complementary depression,

the circular coastal band of contrary surface-flexure which lies between them

should constitute the moving master septum of the present earth-crust ? This

is the ' Volcanic Girdle of the Pacific,' our ' Terrestrial Ring of Fire.'

    Or, finally, if we rather regard the compact arch of the Old World itself as the

natural complement of the broken Indo-Pacific depression, then the most active

and continuous septal band of the present day should divide them. Again, our

law asserts itself triumphantly. It is the great volcanic and earthquake band on

--which are strung the Festoon Islands of Western Asia the band of Mt. St. Elias,
--the Aleutians, Kamtehatka, and the Kuriles the hand of Fusijama, Krakatoa,

and Sangir. The rate of movement of the earth's surface doubtless everywhere

varies directly as the gradient.

   We find, therefore, that even if we restrict our observations to the most simple

and elementary conception of the rock fold, as being made up of arch-limb, trough-
limh, and twisting but still continuous septum, we are able to connect in one un-

broken chain the minutest wrinkle of the finest lamina of a geological formation

with the grandest geographical phenomena on the face of our globe.

   We find, precisely as we had anticipated, that the wave-like surface of the earth of

the present day reflects, in its entirety, the wave-like arrangement of the geological

formations below. On the lands we find that the surface arches and troughs

answer precisely to the grander regional anticlines and synclines of the subterra-

nean sedimentary sequence ; and it may, I believe, be regarded as certain that the
Wesubmarine undulations have a similar or complementary relationship.
                                                                       find in

the New Geology, as Hutton found in the Old, that geography and geology are one.

We discover, aa we had suspected, that the physiognomy of the face of our globe

is an uneiTing index of the solid personality beneath. It bears in its lineaments

the peculiar family features and the common traits of its long line of geological

ancestors.

      Such, it seems to me, is an imperfect account of the introductory paragraphs of

that great chapter in the New Geology which is now in course of interpretation
by geologists of the present day, and we have translated them exactly in the old

way by the aid of the only living geological language, namely, the language of
present natural phenomena ; and I doubt not that sooner or later the rest of the

great chapter will be read by the same simple means.

      I have strictly confined myself to-day to the discussion of the characteristics of
tlie simple geological fold as reduced to its most elementary terms of arch, trough,

and unbroken septum ; for this being clearly understood, tlierest naturally follows.

But this twisted plate is really the key wh ich opens the entire treasure-house ot

the New Geology, in which lie spread around, in bewildering confusion, facts, pro-

blems, and conclusions, enough to keep going the young stratigraphists and other

scientists busily at work for many a long year to come.

Into this treasure-house I often wander myself, in the few leisure hours that

I can steal from a very busy professional life ; and out of it I bring now and
again heresies that sometimes amuse and sometimes horrify my geological friends.

As you have so patiently listened to what I have already said, perhaps you will

permit me in a few final sentences to indicate in brief some of those novelties

wliich I see already more or less clearly, and a few of those less novel points on
My --which it appears to me that more light is wanted.
                                                         excuse is twofold first,

to furnish material for work and controversy to the young geologists ; and, second,

to obtain aid for myself from workers in other walks of science.

The account of the simple rock-fold which I have already given you is of the

most elemeutai-y kind. It presupposes merely the yielding to tangential pressure
from front and back, combined with eflectual resistance to sliding. But in the

layers of the earth-crust there is always, in addition, a set of tangential pressures

theoretically at right angles to this. The simple fold becomes a folded fold, and
the compound septum twists not only vertically but laterally. On the surface of
the globe this double set of longitudinal and transverse waves is everywhere
ap])arent. They account for the detailed disposition of our lands and our waters,
for our present coastal forms, for the direction, length, and disposition of our
mountain-ranges, our seas, our plains, and lakes. The compound arch becomes a
dome, its complementary trough becomes a basin. The elevations and depressions,

major and minor, are usually twinned, like the twins of the mineralogist, the
complementary parts being often inverted, and turned through 180° (compare
Italy with the Po-Adriatic depression). Every upward swirl and eddy has its
answering downward swirl. The whole surface of our globe is thus broken up
into fairly continuous and paired masses, divided from each other by moving
areas and lines of mountain maldng and crust movement, so that the surface of

the earth of the present day seems to stand midway in its structure and appear-

ance between that of the sun and that of the moon, its eddies wanting the
mobility of those of the one and the symmetry of those of the other. In the
geology of the earth-crust, also, the inter-crossing of the two sets of folds,

theoretically at right angles to each other, gives rise to effects equally startling.

It lies at the origin of the thrust-plane or overfault, where the septal region of
contrary motion in the fold becomes reduced to, or is represented by, a, plane of
contrary motion. It allows us to connect together under one set of homologies
folds and faults. The downthrow side of the fault answers to the trough, the

upthrow side to the arch, of our longitudinal fold ; while the faidt-plane itself
                    --;

                    TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                               707

represents the septal area reduced to zero. The node of the fault and the
alternation and alteration of throw are due to the eilects of the transverse

folding-.

These transverse folds of different grades, which affect the various layers of

the earth-crust differentially, account also for the formation of laccolites, of

granitic cores, and of petrological provinces ; and they enable us also to understand

many of the more striking phenomena of metamorphism.

Of the folds of the third order I shall here say nothing ; but I must frankly

admit that the primal cause of all this tangential movement and folding stress is

still as mysterious to me as ever. I incline to think that it is due to many

--causes to tidal action, sedimentation, and many others. I cannot deny, however,

that it may be mainly the result of the contraction in diameter of our earth, due
to the loss of its original heat into outer space. For everywhere we find evidences

of symmetrical crushing of the earth-crust by tangential stresses. Everywhere we

find proofs that the various layers of that crust have been affected differentially,

Weand the outer layers have been bent the most.  seem to be dealing not so

much with a solid globe as with a globular shell composed of many layers.

Is it not just possible, after all, that, as others have suggested, our earth is

such a hollow shell, or series of concentric shells, on the surface of which gravity

is at a maximum, and in whose interior it is practically non-existent ? IMay this
not be so, also, in the case of the sun, through whose spot-eddies we possibly look
into a hollow interior ? If so, perhaps our present nebulpe may also be hollow
shells formed of meteorites, on the surfaces of which shells the fiery spirals we see

would be the swirls which answer to the many twisting crustal septa of the earth.

Our comets, too, in this case might be elongated ellipsoids, whose visible parts

would be merely interference phenomena, or sheets of differential movement.

In this case we have represented before us to-day the past of our earth as well

as its present. Uniformity and Evolution are one.

    Thus from the microscopic septa of the laminre of the geological formations we

pass outwards in fact to these moving septa of our globe, marked on the land by
our new mountain-chains, and on the shores by our active volcanoes. Thence we

sweep, in imagination, to the tiery eddies of the sun, and thence to the glowing

swirls of the nebulte ; and so outwards and upwards to that most glorious septum

of all the visible creation, the radiant ring of the Milky Way.

Professor George Darwin, in his Address to the Section of Mathematical and

Physical Science at the meeting of the British Association at Birmingham in 1886,

with all the courage of genius, and the authority of one of the sons of the prophets,

acknowledged that it seems as likely that ' meteorology and geology will pass the

word of command to cosmical physics as the converse.' Behind this generous

admission I shelter myself. But I feel absolutely confident that, long after the

physicists may have swept away these astronomical suggestions as ' the baseless

fabric of a vision,' there will still remain in the treasure-house of the geological

fold a wealth of abundant material for the use of the mathematician, the physicist,

the chemist, the mineralogist, and the astronomer of the deepest interest and of

the highest value.

recorded it from the Vale of Clwyd.
     It is always accompanied by South Scottish granites, and where these pre-

dominate, as in the Isle of Man, it is common. About Liverpool the Scotch rocks
are about in the same proportion as those of Lake District origin, and further east

the Scotch cease altogether.
      Floating ice could not have transported the Ailsa Craig and other northern

rocks, as there is not a free intermingling of types. There is also a vertical uplift
of over 200 feet from Ailsa Craig (1,140 feet) to Moel-y-Tryfaen (1,350 feet). The
ridge of which Moel-y-Tryfaen forms a part acted as a barrier, and destroyed the
force of the Snowdonian ice northwards, and thus tlie northern ice got the mastery
and pushed the northern erratics up to the summit of Moel-y-Tryfaen.

          By J. W. Gray, F.O.S., and Percy F. Kendall, F.G.S.

    Two hypotheses at present engage the attention of glacialists, viz., a, that

propounded by CroU, which ascribes the glacial cold to the combined effects of a
liigh degree of eccentricity of the earth's orbit and the precession of the equino.xes,
with, as secondary causes, changes in the winds and marine currents ; and b, the
explanation presented in detail by Mr. Warren Upham, which is based upon great
earth-movements which might lift wide areas above the snow-line.

    Neither of these appears to satisfy the known geological conditions, which may

be defined as follows : (1) The Glacial period was a unique episode, no evidence
being adducible of any previous Glacial period, but only of glacial conditions in
the neighbourhood of mountains. (2) The cold conditions came on witli extreme
·slowness, the refrigeration being progressive from the Eocene period to the climax.
(3) The Glacial period was of long duration, judging by the great dimensions of
the glaciers and the amount of work done by them. (4) The return to temperate
conditions was very rapid. (5) The final disappearance of the ice was a very
recent event; the condition of the drift accumulations and direct measurements

.such as those of the recession of waterfalls point to a maximum of 10,000 years.

      OroU's hypothesis, in the opinion of the authors, is in opposition to Nos. I, 2,
4, and 5.

     Upham's explanation has much to commend it. Submerged valleys of com-
paratively recent date exist upon many coasts, e.y., one which deeply indents the
1,000-fathom line at the mouth of the Congo; but the rate of filling up of these
gulfs is not known, and they are not necessarily even approximately contem-

poraneous.

    Arguments against this explanation may also be drawn from Nos. 1, 2, 4,
and b. Any explanation must apply to Britain, but the indications of cold con-
ditions in Pliocene times, when the sea reached British shores in East Anglia,

Cornwall, and Aberdeen, are inexplicable on this hypothesis. Furthermore, the
sea-level was not appreciably lower in Caithness, Aberdeen, the Firth of Clyde,
and the Irish Sea at a time when glacial conditions of great .severity had set in

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and in Yorkshire, when the Scandinavian glacier approached the coast, the land
stood at the same level as at present.

     The authors formulate no hypothesis, but they consider that the causes are to be
sought outside the earth ; and, having regard to the uniqueness of the Glacial period,

its recency and its very gradual oncoming, they think it may be connected with a
secular cooling of the sun. The great development of sun-spots must affect the

radiating power of the sun, and the sudden blazing out of novce shows that causes
are in operation which are adequate to produce a temporary rejuvenescence of suns.

     The authors ask the aid of astronomers and physicists in the solution of one
of the unsolved problems of geology.

         5. The Devon and Cornish Granites. By W. A. E. Ussher.

    From the relations of the stratified rocks to the granites of Devon and Cornwall

there is no obtainable evidence as to the upheaval of the latter.

     From evidences of great mechanical disturbance (such as deflections of strike

and constrictions of outcrop), and of metamorphism in areas bordering the granites,
and from the shapes, relative positions, and internal structure of the granite
masses ; from the distribution of the Elvans, and from evidences of the production
of cleavage in the area prior to the contact metamorphism of the cleaved rocks,
it appears that the sites of the Devon and Cornish granite masses were occupied
by the granites or pre-existent and subterraneouslj^ connected rocks of pre-Devonian
age, which had, in a rigid state, exercised an obstructive influence on the north
and south movements, and had thereby produced great mechanical effects on the
surrounding strata prior to the alteration of the latter.

     The contact alteration of the stratified rocks seems to be coeval with the
metamorphism of these ancient masses, and the consequent genesis of the granites
in their present form during the later stages, or at the close of the Carboniferous
epoch. The intrusion of granitoid rocks perhaps accompanied, certainly succeeded,
the solidification of the granites, and continued at intervals down to the Permian
quartz porphyries. These rocks, called Elvau d^'kes, approximate, with some few
exceptions (notably the north and south Elvan of Watergate Bay), to the general
strike produced by the north and south movements, and in some cases, as near
Camelford, to the main strike deflections produced by the resistance of granite
masses to these movements, but in proceeding from granite to killas they ignore
the slight uptilt of the latter on the margin of the granites.

     The evidences in favour of the subterranean connection of the Devon and
Cornish granites are too strong to be ignored, and this connection annihilates the
application of the laccolitic hypothesis advanced by me to account for the relations
of the Dartmoor granite, and at the same time contradicts the suggestion of the

upheaval of the granites in or through their surroundings.

             6. Malvern Crystallines. By A. Irving, B.Sc, F.G.8.^

     The author, after ten weeks' field-work upon the Malvern crystallines, has

been led, as the result of his observations, to attach a high value to the theoretical

S]ieculations of Professor John Phillips, made many years ago, as to the genesis of

the rocks for the most part by mineral differentiation from ' one unerupted

magma ; but he goes further than Phillips did, and agrees with Dr. Callaway
                                                     '

that the whole series (with one doubtful exception) is of ' igneous ' origin, though
unable to follow that author in recognisiiig a sequence between the diorites and
the granites. Reasons for this difference of view are given in the paper.

     The really intrusive rocks are either (1) felsitic dykes (in places a quartz-
porphyry), (2) : dykes of basic rock, in many cases some variety of dolerite, though
in some perhaps a tine-grained diorite, evidence of their intrusive relation to the

granite-diorite series being given in the paper.

     The structural phenomena presented by the rocks of this crystalline chain the
author classes as (i) Diorite-gneiss, the primary structure being in some cases
rendered somewhat schistose by shearing prior to final consolidation ; (ii) Gneissose

 (Jiaseriff) structure ; (iii) Phyllolithic structures, upproachbuj in various degrees to
 true schists, including hornblende-schists (due to local excessive deformation of the
 diorite by accentuation of pressure against the more rigid felspathic masses),
Jissile felspathic rocks (on the cleavage-planes of which secondary mica appears to
 have "been developed at the expense of the felspar), and sericite-schisfs which be-
long probably to a later stage of development, and resemble rather the younger
 (Casanna) schists of the Alps ; (iv) Shear-planes, in which dynamic action appears
 to have resulted solely in the degradation of the original minerals after pulverisa-
 tion unaccompanied by any resultant reconstruction of higher silicates (v) Crush-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

planes, in wliicli either {(i) breccias, or (6) mere fine chloritic debris, rendered
crudely fissile in the presence of water by pressure, have resulted from large and
small dislocations, to which the mouutaLn-mass has been subjected at various

periods of its history.

     The author's general conclusions are :
      1. That the prevalent petrological morphology of the Malvern crystallines is
diagenetic, rather than due to subsequent metamorphism.
      2. That the geotectiuiic features, due to the action of purely mechanical forces,
are mainly of a metataxic nature, and that such forces have been very limited in
their action in altering the atomic relationships of the chemical constituents of

the rocks.

      3. That the most important problem the Malvern crystallines still present to
the investigator is the determination of the limits of action of dynamic forces, and
of original segregative action by atomic movement (supplemented by the differen-
tial action of gravity upon minerals of different density in the primordial magma,

aided perhaps by forces of a tidal nature upon the magma as a whole) in bringing

about the structural phenomena presented by the Malvern crystallines.
     4. These phenomena seem to lend no suppoi't to the doctrine of ' regional meta-

morphism,' as usually understood, for they seem to admit of easier explanation as
the results of deformation of originally crystalline masses, rather than of recon-
struction out of elastic materials.

    An account of the geology of the Builth district was given by Murchison in the

' Silurian System ' (1839), since which date scarcely anything has been written on it.

A series of igneous rocks associated with beds of Ordovician age stretches from

near the town of Builth to beyond Llandrindod. Tn this paper the author con-

fined himself to the southern half of this area, giving a preliminarv description of

the distribution and characters of the rocks met with, namely, diabase, rhyolite,
porphyrite, andesite, and ashes.

the hammer this sand gives a brown streak, the brown grains, which are compara-

tity of green sandstone of a bright colour, and sometimes of a glassy texture, which
has been recognised as like some that occurs in the Lower Greensand ot Ightham,
Kent. It is a serviceable-looking stone, and the brightness of its colour adds
beauty to the brown sandstone, of which the edifice is mainly built. The stone
seems to be a counterpart of the green sand in the Aspley Section, and similarly

colour-hearted. Professor Bouney, on receiving specimens of the Husborn'e
Crawley rock, but speaking from sight only, doubts, however, whether it is the

same as the green sand at Aspley. It may be mentioned that pieces of the same

rock have been dug up in the roadway half a mile from the church, and a larger

boulder-like piece lies by the roadside, on the outskirts of the village green. Ad-

joining the churchyard is a very old-looking excavation that suggests the spot at

which this stone may have been got. Seeing the difficulty of transporting stones

in olden times, it is extremely unlikely that the stone came from a distance.

Possibly, therefore, there may be some local equivalent of the Lower Greensand of
Kent in the Bedfordshire Greensand, which, if not entirely dug away in supplying
the stone for Crawley Church, may yet again be brought to light.

            9. The Fullers' Earth Mining Company at Wohurn Sands.
      By A. C. G. Cauekon, Geological Survey of England and JVales.

      Since reporting to the British Association in 1884 and 1891 on the progress
made in working this mineral, the demand for it has gone on steadily increasing,
and mining on systematic principles has been established in Bedfordshire for the

first time. The mines now show an extensive industry, with underground galleries
that extend many hundreds of feet. The layers of earth as they come to be
worked are not found disposed quite even, but raised into slight inequalities, ridge-

and-furrow-like. Although all one sort of earth, the layers alternate in colour
downwards, from yellow, through blue, to yellow again ; a difference in colour

which Mr. Player, who has analysed the Woburn earth, does not consider is ex-

plained by difference in composition.
     It has long since been suggested that the name 'Woburn Sands' should beapplied

to the lower portion of the Lower Greensand of the ^Midlands, and the name may
well be retained for Bedfordshire and Bucks. It is at Woburn Sands, in these

counties, that the greatest expanse and greatest thickness of Midland Counties
Oreensand occui's, and where it contains also those valuable deposits of fullers' earth.

1. On a Widespread Eadiolarian Chert of Arenig Age from the Southern
     Uplands of Scotland. By B. N. Peach, A.'R.S.M., F.B.S., F.G.S.,

      of the Geological Survey of Scotland.

                      [Communicated by permission of the Director-General.]
     The Silurian rocks of the South of Scotland are chiefly made up of greywackes
and shales. The Moffat shale group, which lies at their base, consists of -liner
sediments. Beneath these latter there is a widespread deposit of chert, which is
chiefly made up of the remains of radiolarians. This chert zone, where typically
developed, is about 100 feet thick, and is divisible into
     ·An upper sub-zone of dark Lydian-stones and massive grey chert.
712 KEPOKT-- 1892.

A middle sub-zone of green chert.
A lower sub-zone of red and chocolate-coloured chert and jasper.

The chert beds or nodules are separated from each other by the finest sediment,

and towards the bottom of the zone by tuft' and agglomerate, the latter con-

taining angular fragments of radiolariau chert. The zone reposes on a platform of

basic lavas and agglomerates. It is seen on the crests of anticlines over an area of

from 2,000 to 3,000 square miles of the northern half of the ujjlands, and, in all

probability, has a much greater extension though hidden under newer sediments.

From the chert Dr. Hinde has described in the ' Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.' for July,

1890, twenty-three species of radiolaria.

WhenThis deposit is regarded by the author as a true radiolariau ooze.  traced

from south to north the upper zones become in turn replaced by sediment, thus

beha\'ing in the same manner as the Moffat black shales, and indicating that the

land whence these sediments proceeded lay to the north of what are now the

Southern Uplands.

2. On the Contact Metamorpliism of the Hadiolarian Chert in the Lower
     Sihirian Rochs along the Margin of the Loch Domi, Granite. By 3.
     HoRNE, F.G.S., of H.il. Geological Survey of Scotland.

                      [Communicated by permission of the Director-General.]

   mWhile tracing the representatives of the Moffat series the neighbourhood of

Loch Doon, during the present summer, certain remarkable features were noted
by me in the radiolariau chert when followed along the outcrop to the pomt of
junction with the granite. About two miles from the igneous mass the chert pre-
sents features similar to those in the unaltered areas between Abington and Lead-
burn, About a mile from the junction the chert becomes slightly granulitic, and

the radiolaria are not so discernible with the pocket lens ; while tbe graptolites in

the adjoining black shales are quite fresh and determinable. About half a mile
from the margin of tbe granite the chert has been completely granulitised, and yet
the radiolaria are still traceable in the matrix. At this stage there is a slight
development of mica. Close to the granite the chert has undergone a complete

transformation ; the rock has been recrystallised, consisting of large quartz grains

with irregular edges, remarkable for the number of inclusions. Biotite is largely
developed as rounded inclusions in the quartz granules.

3. On the ' Grampian Series ' (Pre-Camhrian Bocks) of the Central
Highlands. By Henry Hicks, M.D., F.li.S., Sec. of the Geol. Soc.

In his address to the Geologists' Association in the year 1883 (' Proceedings

of the Geologists' Association,' vol. viii. p. 270) the author gave the name of
'Grampian series' to a group of rocks which occupy an extensive area in the

Central Highlands. He described them briefly as ' tender gneisses, bright siliceous

schists, chiastolite schists, quartzites and limestones,' also some 'chloritic schists.'

He classed them as of pre-Cambrian age, and all the evidence since obtained

tends to confirm this view. It is quite possible, of course, that newer rocks may

be in places entangled amongst them, but the majority of those which he claimed

as being of pre-Cambrian age are now generally admitted to be older than any of

the Palpeozoic rocks of that area. The further descriptions of these rocks now

given have been prepared with the kind assistance of Professor T. G. Bonney, D.Sc,

F.R.S., to whom the author some time since submitted specimens, collected at

various points in the year 1880.

AFrom Near Ballachulish, S)-c.    finely banded, fine-grained micaceous schist,

containing apparently a considerable amount of felspathic matter.

From Glen Sjoean, S,c. Fine-grained gneisses, not rich in quartz, but with a

considerable amount of black mica, not markedly foliated except as the result of

subsequent pressure. All are characterised by a peculiar speckled aspect, the

spots being about the size of pins' heads'. The felspar varies from a warm to a

reddish grey.
                                                                  --

AFrom Tyndrum, ^-c.          somewhat varying series of schists, but with a

common facies. Some have but little mica, consisting mainly of quartz and

felspar, and pale grey or reddish in colour ; others ai'e very micaceous schists of a

lead coloui', with sheen surfaces and indications of mineral banding. There are

also very quartzose gneisses of a white or pinkish white colour.

Crianlarich and Killin, ^-c. Calc mica-schists, with sheen surfaces due to sub-

sequent pressure, but showing mineral banding ; also fine-grained gneisses like

some of those near Tyndrum. But as they have a very marked cleavage foliation
Athey may originally have been somewhat coarser grained.
                                                                  garnetiferous mica-

schist from several places.

Blair Athol, ^-c. Dark mica schists, with rather a carbonaceous aspect and a

very marked cleavage foliation. Some show on close examination along the edges

a speckled aspect, recalling some of the gneisses mentioned above. There is also

a fairly coarsely crystalline limestone, with specks and streaks of green serpentinous

material and some scattered pyrite ; also a calc mica-schist modified by pressure

and some quartzose schists.

To the south of this line, as mentioned by the author in another paper (' Pro-

ceedings of the Geologists' Association,' vol. vii. p. 8-4), 'schistose and slaty chlor-

itic rocks become more abundant in association with micaceous rocks,' and

' everywhere strongly recall to mind the pre-Cambrian rocks of Wales, especially

those in Anglesea and in the Lleyn Promontory.'

       4. On the Still-possible Caiiibrian Age of the Torridon Sandstone.
                              By J. F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.

     The Torridon Sandstone had been last year removed from the Cambrian on
account of the discovery of a species of Olenellus in the unconformably overlying-
series. There is, however, an a priori improbability in the rock being pre-

--Cambrian amongst which in this country no red grits and conglomerates are
--known while this is everywhere the character of the Lower Cambrian, except in

particular isolated spots whose peculiarities are due to special conditions, and not
to the epoch of the deposits. The main points, however, are that the fauna of the
Durness Limestone had been examined by C. D. Walcott, of the United States
Geological Survey, and recognised by him as Ordovician, and not Cambrian, by
comparison with the American series, and that the species of Olenellus discovered
in these fucoid beds in Durness was not of the same section of the genus as those
which had been definitely found in position below the Olenus and Paradoxides
beds, and might even be separated as a distinct genus. The supposed pre-
Cambrian age of the Torridon Sandstone depended therefore only on the supposed
limited range of a genus of several sections, which limited range had never been

proved.

5. On the Alleged Proofs of Submergence in Scotland during the Glacial
                           Epoch. By DuGALD Bell, F.G.S.

                                              I. Chapelhall, near Airdrie.

    The maximum degree of submergence in Britain during Glacial times has been
the subject of much discu.ssion among geologists. The view held till recently
that it may have been 1,500 feet or more-- is now generally abandoned. Minor

--yet considerable degrees of submergence are still usually admitted up to 500 or
--GOO feet one of the supposed proofs of which is the shelly clay that was found at

Chapelhall.

     riegarding this deposit little is really known. It was first recorded by Mr.
Smith, of Jordanhill, in 1850, from information supplied to him by Mr. Russell,
an operative miner, who came upon it at 510 feet above the sea in digging a
well. Some sheila, curiously enough all of one species, Tellina calcarea (proximo),
had been taken from it, and the clay has not been seen since. Sir A. Geikie, Dr.
                                       --

714 EEPOET-- 1892.

Crosskey, and others have made further inquiries, but have obtained very little
additional information. The well was built up, and in other wells sunk in the
immediate neighbourhood the clay had not been found. At most, it seems to have

been a limited strip or patch.
      Its very limited extent, the absence of marine organisms in the overlying

boulder-clay, and the highly arctic character of the only species of shell known

with any certainty to have been found in it appear strong objections to its being

considered a true marine bed. On the other hand, there are probabilities, from its
position, &c., of its having been transported by land ice. It is submitted that
further attempts to find the clay again, and re-examine it, are very desirable.

                                II. Clava and other Northern Localities.

     The shelly clay found at Clava, near Inverness, 500 feet above the sea, and
described by Mi-. James Fraser, C.E. (' Trans. Edin. Geol, Society,' vol. iv.), is
thought by some to be a clearer proof of submergence than that which was found
at Chapelball. The shelly sands and gravels, which occur at lower levels in
Aberbeenshire, &c., are usually referred to along with it. It occurs imder some

45 feet of boulder-clay and 20 feet of stratified sand. Was it laid down by the

sea where now found ? It seems to be of very limited extent, and the overlying

Isand and boulder-clay furuisli no proof of marine origin, as they contain no organic

remains. Thus the difiiculties presented by Ohapelhall occur here also. On the

other hand, it seems equally probable, as in the case of Chapelball, that the
deposit owes its present position to transport by land ice.

     The district is one of intense glaciation, and all around it there is evidence of
this particular effect, viz., the transport inland of materials from tlie sea by laud
ice, e.g., Caithness, along the eastern coast of Aberdeenshire, and near Elgin. In
the neighbourhood of Clava there is every proof that the ice issuing from the
Great Glen curved gradually round to the eastward, assuming at length, near
Forres, an almost due west to east direction. The cause of this was doubtless the
ice-blocked condition of the Moray Firth from the numerous great ice-streams
pressing into it from the west. There is every likelihood, or rather certainty, that
the ice would pass over part of the sea-bed before reaching Clava, and in that case
it may have transported shells or shelly clay along with it, as in many other

 instances. Here, also, to settle the point further examination is desirable.

                        6. On some Calcareous Tujas in Norway.
                      By Professor Axel Blytt, of Christiania.

     In the valley of the Gudbrandsdal, in the central part of Norway (lat. 61' oO'
to 62°), there are found some calcareous tufas which will now be described.

      In the upper part of this valley, not far from the Dovrefjeld, at the farm of
 Leine, in the district Nordre Froen, 500 metres above the sea-level, the following
series of strata was found in descending order :

           7. Vegetable earth, 0-10-015 m.
           6. Greyish-white hard tufa with Pinus silvestris, 0'58-0'68 m.
            5. Greenish-grey clay without fossils, 0'04 m.
            4. Yellowish-grey, partly sandy tufa with Pinii^ silcestris, Dri/as octopetala,

                &c., 003 m.

           3. Yellowish- grey, hard, and slaty tufa with Betula odorata, Sec. (but
                   neither Pinus nor Drt/as), 0*45 m.

            2. Ferruginous clay without fossils, 0'03 m.
            1. Boulder clay (glacial).

      At the present time the springs which deposited the tufa have almost disap-
 peared, and the tufa deposition has ceased. At the time when the tufas were
 formed the rainfall must have been much more considerable than it is now, and
 the springs much more numerous, for at the uppermost spring, which now is
                      TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.               715

scarcely more than a third of a metre broad, the tufa was fouud to extend for a

breadth of not less than thirty metres.

     As shown by the section given above, we find below the vegetable mould a
thick stratum of hard tufa, which we will name the fir tufa, and which is all

through its thickness quite full of leaves, cones, bark, &c., of the Scotch fir {Pinus

silvestris). In this bed we also find (but more sparsely) the leaves oi Betula

verrucosa and B. odorata, Populus tremula, Salix caprea, Vaccinium yitis id<ea,

Mniuin punctatum, Hypnum falcatmn, &c. The common spruce (Picea Abies)

grows now plentifully through all the valley, but is quite wanting in the tufas,
from which we may conclude that the formation of tufa had ceased before the

immigration of the spruce into the Gudbrandsdal.

Below the fir tufa there comes first a clay (5) and then the stratum (4). Both

these strata are of inconsiderable thickness. The stratum (4) is a crumbling,

calcareous sandy clay, in which are found small lumps of hard tufa. In these we

find still some pine leaves, but besides them, in great numbers, the beautiful leaves

of Dryas octupetala, and (more sparsely) some other arctic plants, as Sali.v reticulata

and S. arbuscula. I found also in this stratum leaves of what appears to be

Cotoneaster vulgaris, besides some other plants. In the lower beds (3-1) neither
WePinus, Dryas, Sali.v reticulata, nor S. arbuscula is found.
                                                               learn from this

that Dryas and the other arctic plants named flourished at the place when Pinm

silvestris first immigrated.

     The bed (3) is hard and of considerable thickness. Its flora is quite diff'erent
from that of the strata already described. I name this bed the birch tufa. It has
no trace of Piiius, but is quite full of the leaves of different foliferous trees and
shrubs, as birch (only the mountain birch, Betula odorata), Populus tremula, Saiix
caprea, S. glauca, Mbes rubrum, &c. Betula and Populus occur to the bottom,

where also Hypnum falcatmn and Equisetum vanegatum are found. There is no

arctic flora at the bottom. The clay (2), which rests on the bottom moraine of

the old glacier, has no fossils.

     In this manner we find at Leine mainly two different beds of tufa. The oldest

of the two is the birch tufa, the youngest the fir tufa. Between them there is
intercalated a clay and a thin layer of tufa with Pinus, Cotoneaster, Dryas, and

other arctic plants.

At the other and southern end of the long valley of Gudbrandsdal, not far

from where the river falls into the lake Mjosen, there is another deposit of tufa.

This deposit occurs at the farm Nedre Dal, in the district of Faaberg, 225 metres

Weabove the sea-level.  find here the same two stages as at Leine, viz., birch

tufa and fir tufa, but the intermediate Dryas tufa is wanting. In the two beds,

which here also occur as separate blocks, we find mainly the same fossils as at

Leine. In the birch tufa at Nedre Dal occur Betula (only B. odorata), Popvlus

tremula, Prunus Padus, Salix caprea, S. nigricans, Myrtillus uliginosa, Equisetum

hiemale, &c., and in the fir tufa Pinus silvestris, Betula odorata, Vaccinium vitis

id^a, Linnrea borealis, &c. At the locality where the tufa occurs, no tufa is

formed at the present time. The spruce {Picea Abies) and Acer platanoides grow

abundantly at the place, but both are wanting in the tufas.                the

   mNot far from Nedre Dal, at the northern end of the great lake Mjosen,

district of Birid, I found this summer a third deposit of tufa with the two same

separate stages, viz., birch and fir tufa.

    From all this we learn that the flora of the Gudbrandsdal (as, indeed, the whole
Norwegian flora) immigrated during alternating rainy and dry periods. At first

we have a time when glaciers flowed down the valley. After the ice had retired
there was first a dry period, when the clay (2) was deposited. Then the ramfall

increased again, and the springs formed a bed of tufa with such plants only as still

grow in the sub-alpine birch region of our mountain valleys. Then the climate
became drier. Dryas and other arctic plants descended from the higher mountains

and flourished, together with Cotoneaster, at the upper limit of the immigrating
pine forests, and soon afterwards the formation of tufa ceased totally, and the
clay (5) was deposited. Once again the rainfall increased, and a new bed of tufa

was formed. Durmg this moist period all the valley was clothed in sombre woods

of the Scotch fir, in which also, besides a number of sub-alpine plants, more

southern plants, as Betula verrucosa, occurred. At last the climate again became

dry, and the formation of tufa ceased anew. After that time Picea Abies, Acer

platanoides, and other plants of a more southern type immigrated into the valley.*

In the case of these tufas there is no doubt that the alternation of tufa beds

and clays is due to a climatic period of long duration (probably caused by the

precession of the equinoxes). In a paper, On Variations of Climate in the Course

of Time (' Nature,' 1886), I have given many reasons for the occurrence of such
a period. And in a later paper, On the Probable Cause of the Displacement of

Shore-lines (London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, ' Phil. Mag.,' 1889, pp. 405, 487,

reprinted in the 'Smithsonian Eeport,' Washington, 1890, p. 326), I have tried to

show how, with the aid of alternating strata, we may possibly get to a computation

of geological time. It is no objection to this theory that alternating strata may

Webe formed also by other and more local causes.   should try to learn to dis-

tinguish between such local alternations and those which are caused by more

generally operating and probably cosmical causes.

Lastly, I would remark that in Denmark and Southern Norway the alternating

layers of forest and peat in peat bogs show more alternations than the tufas and

peat of our mountain valleys, the reason being probably that glaciers Ungered in

the mountain valleys a long time after the lowlands had been free of ice and snow.

                           By Clement Reid, F.L.8., F.G.S.

     Recent discoveries by Mr. Bennie, of the Geological Survey, have brought to
light a series of silted-up tarns or small lochs in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.
These tarns seem to have lain in irregular hollows left on the retreat of the ice,
for the lowest deposits usually yield remains of arctic plants. The principal
localities for these plants are Corstorphine and Hailes. Trees, except perhaps the
alder, are entirely missing in the lower deposits, and the vegetation consists mainly
of dwarf willow and birch, with a few herbaceous plants, of species still living

within the Arctic Circle. The list now includes the following plants, those

marlced with an asterisk being arctic species no longer living in the lowlands of
Scotland :

           8. The Cuttings on the Crieff and Comrie Bailwmj.

                           By Henry Coates, F.B.S.E.

As the Crieff and Comrie Railway is now being rapidly completed, the euttmgs

Awill in a very short time be covered or obscured.  record of what they presented

when fresh may therefore be useful.

The line is a fraction under six miles in length, and runs almost due east and

west. Half-way between Crieff and Comrie it passes over the line of the great

fault, which approximately divides the Old Red Sandstone of the Midland valley

of Scotland from the Crystalline Rocks of the Highlands. The eastern or Crieff

section passes over the Old Red Sandstone area, and the western or Comrie section

passes over the Highland area. All the cuttings, of which there are seven, occur

in the former section.

The first cutting, which is also the most complicated in its geological features,
Aoccurs in the village of Crieff.
                                   few yards to the west of King Street the follow-
--ing series was exposed : At the base, 8 feet of fine yellow sand or silt ; next, a
Hbed of boulder clay, feel; thick, in which the boulders are very large and nume-

rous ; then 8i feet of peat, in which are some thin layers of sand and grit ; and, on

the top of all, a foot of surface soil. This bed of peat is quite local, occupying a

shallow basin in the boulder clay. About a hundred yards westwards, in the same
cutting, the Old Red Conglomerate rises up in a buttress-like mass, and forms the

base of the series at that point. It dips south-east at an angle of 30°. Its upper

surface is very much disintegrated, apparently by ice action. Resting on this disin-

tegrated surface is a bed of boulder clay, which to the west of Burrel Street rises
until it reaches a thickness of 24 feet. On the western face of this bank of boulder

clay there is a bed of river material.

  -- --On either side of the valley of the Turret which the line crosses there are

cuttings through the highest river terraces. In these cuttings boulder clay is

exposed at the base for a depth of 3 or 4 feet, on the top of which rests a series of

river deposits. These latter consist of fine and coarse gravels, grits, sands, and

silts, all more or less distinctly bedded, the finer material frequently exhibiting false

bedding. In the boulder clay some of the boulders are very large and finely

striated.

    Two miles west from Crieff the line passes through a cutting where the Old
Red Sandstone is exposed tilted up in a perfectly vertical position, and, indeed,

bending over to a reverse angle of 78°. On the truncated edges of these beds rests

a deposit of boulder clay, 30 feet thick, and on the top of that 4 or 5 feet of fine

sand, apparently of river origin,

The last cutting occurs three miles from Crieff, where the line is carried in a

tunnel through the hill on which the Baird Monument stands. The rock through

which the tunnel is bored is a very hard and coarse (Old Red) conglomerate.

I am indebted to Mr. John Young, C.E., Perth, the chief engineer, and to Mr.

Moncur, the resident engineer, who gave me facilities for inspecting the cuttings,
and also placed at my disposal the plans and sections of the line.

718 REPORT-- 1892.

                             SATVB DAY, AUGUST 6.

     The following Papers and Reports were read :

          1. On the Physical Oeology of Arabia Petrcea and Palestine.
                Btj Professor Edwaed Hull, LL.T)., F.P.S., F.G.8.

     The author in this paper stated the results of the ohservations made during the
expedition sent out hy the Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund in

1883-84, including the observations of previous travellers.
      After describing the physical features of the region traversed, the author

described the Archtean rocks of the Sinaitic and Edomite Mountains, succeeded

by the Lower Carboniferous sandstone and limestone of Wady Nasb ; succeeded by

the Nubian sandstone (Neocomian or Cenomanian), the Cretaceous and Nummulite
limestones, which form the table-land of Palestine and of Arabia Deserta.

     The relations of the Pliocene terraces along the coast, and those of the Jordan-
Arabah Valley, to the older formations were also discussed.

     The author concluded by describing the line of the great fault or system of
faults along the line of the Jordan-Arabah Vallev, and showed how this great
depression had (probably during the Pluvial period) been the basin of a lake, about
200 miles in length, during the period of highest level, and had extended from the
Wady-el-Arabah to the Lake of Merom. Conclusions regarding the climatic
conditions of the Pluvial period and the extent of aqueous erosion were stated.

       2. On Two Tunnel Sections in the Cambrian of Carnarvonshire.
                            By J. P. Blake, M.A., F.G.8.

   A section in the Penrhpi Slate Quarries, lately made, shows felsite, like that

of Llyn Padarn, in the midst of purple and other slates ; a position consistent with
intrusion or contemporaneity, but not with a pre-Cambrian age of the felsite,
except by the aid of hypothetical faults.

     The already described adit in Moel Tryfaen had been examined, and a conglo-
merate, similar to that of the summit, but only thirtv inches thick, had been found
between the purple and banded slates. This is considered to be probably different
from the more massive and wider spread mass on the summit, though no proof of this
is as yet offered. The conglomerate, however, is not at the base of the series in
any case, but is followed below by a long series of banded slates, Bangor breccia,
coarse grits, and a lower smaller breccia conglomerate. Amongst the grits are two
bands of felsite, possibly intrusive, but certainly not earlier than the grits, so
that the hill has, on the whole, very little felsite in it at all.

TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  719

                             MONDAY, AUGUST 8.

     The President's Address (see p. 695) was delivered, and the following Papers
were read :

1. On the Relation of the Bunter Pebbles of the English Midlands to those
    in the Old Red Sandstone Conglomerates of Scotland. By Professor

     T. G. Bonnet, D.Sc, F.R.S.

     The author had recently examined the conglomerates near Brodick (Arran),

at Rothesay, and in the neighbourhood of Callander. He had already expressed

the opinion that the quartzites in the Midland Bunter Pebble Beds were identical
with those abundant in Arran, and was convinced this was the case. The felstone

pebbles found in the Midlands were, he was now satisfied, similar to the Scotch
felstones, which occur both in situ and as pebbles in the Old Red Sandstone con-

glomerates, and in more than one locality in the latter he had found a peculiar
quartz-felspar grit (like Torridon Sandstone), which occurs also in the Midland
Pebble Beds.

            2. On the Relations of the Rocks of the Lizard District.
                                   By Alex. Somervail.

      These rocks include the hornblende-schist, serpentine, gabbro, granite, &c.,
which the author regards as all belonging to the same period of geological time,
and to have segregated or separated out from each other during the cooling of a
homogeneous magma.

     There seems absolute evidence in the field to show that the serpentine is a non-

intrusive rock, that it was the first portion of the magma to cool, and is broken

through by all the other rocks, but that it is intrusive into none.
     The relations between the serpentine and the diorite and portions of the granu-

litic rocks are those of segregation, and not of intrusion, as many sections show

these rocks associated together in great alternating bands with a concentric-like
structure with complete transition varieties, but with no signs of intrusion on the

--part of either. These concentric-like structures, which are certainly original-- due

to cooling have been subsequently displaced and broken up, so that the now

 isolated portions are mistaken for intrusive tongues of serpentine or included frag-

ments of hornblende. When followed out they resolve themselves into what were

 once connected masses.
      While the main masses of these rocks have separated out from each other, and

cooled in the order of increasing acidity, there also seems absolute proof in the field
that the intrusive dykes in the serpentine, consisting of diorite, granite, complexes

of these and also of gabbro, are but portions of the uncooled magma of the main

masses which were able to penetrate the serpentine.
      That the main masses and the dykes are of one and the same age is evident,

 not only from their mineral composition and lithological aspect, but also from the

--fact that all these rocks are inter-related for example, the gabbro and diorite

 dykes coalesce, and dykes of the former have margins of the latter. The diorite
 contains inclusions of gabbro, and in some instances inclusions of the latter contain
 others of the former. The granulitic rocks, diorite, and gabbro occur as a regular
 interbanded series, and there are also schists of these complexes.

      The facts seem to warrant the following conclusions :
      1. That all these rocks belong to one geological epoch ; that their relations are
 principally those of segregation or separation, and in a lesser degree of contempo-
 raneous intrusion on the part of the less basic and more acid portions of the
 magma.

     2. That the olivine portion of the magma now forming the serpentine was the

 first to cool, followed by the others in the order of their increasing acidity.
      '.J. That the serpentine is a non-intrusive rock, and one into which all the other

 types of rock have been intruded, the granite intrusions being the latest.

3. The Ice- Shed in the North-West Highlands during the Maximum
    Glaciation. By B. N. Peach, F.U.S., F.G.S., and J. Horne, F.G.S.

   [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survej'.]

      In the course of the geological survey of the North-west Highlands certain data

 have been observed which seem to point to the conclusion that during the maximum

 glaciation the ice-shed did not coincide with the existing water-shed of the region.

 From an examination of the striae and the distribution of the boulders, it would

 appear that the ice-parting then lay to the east of the present water-shed. In the
 group of mountains forming the eastern chain of Assynt, Sutherlandshire, extend-

ing from Glasven and Ben Uidh by Coniveall to Braebag, the phenomena relatuig
to this remarkable dispersion of the ice may be seen to advantage. On Ben Fuaran,
which is composed of displaced members of the Cambrian formation (quartzites,
fucoid beds, and serpulite grit), boulders of Lewisian gneiss are met with, which

Lave been borne westwards from the deep corries on the north-east slope of the
Ben More range. In like manner on the long ridge of Braebag, running south-
wards from the Beallach of Coniveall, the average height of which is over 2,000
feet, splendid striated surfaces are observable, the ice-marldngs pointing in a
westerly direction. Numerous blocks of thrust Lewisian gneiss and granulitic
quartz-schist (Moine schist) occur on the crest and slopes of this ridge, derived
from areas lying to the east of Braebag. The average level of the plateau
formed by the eastern schists to the east of Kiuloch Ailsh is lower than that of the
water-shed south of the Beallach of Coniveall.

     Passing southwards to the mmmtainous region in Ross-shire, in the neigh-
bourhood of Kinlochewe, Loch Maree, there is abundant evidence of the granulitic
Moine schists having been carried to higher levels by the westerly movement of

the ice. On the elevated peaks and slopes of Sgurr Ban, Oorrie Mac Fearchar,
Ben Slioch, and Ben Eighe, composed of Torridon sandstone and Cambrian

strata, numerous blocks of various types of the eastern schists have been observed.
     It would appear that during the great extension of the ice, even these lofty

mountains had been overstopped by the ice-sheet, while at a later period the various
mountain groups formed independent centres for the dispersion of local glaciers.

4. On a, Bone Cave in the Cambrian Limestone in Assijnt, Sutherlandshire.
             By B. N. Peach, F.B.S., F.G.S., and J. Horne, F.G.S.

  [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geologieal Survey.]

     The authors called attention to a group of caves occurring en the south side of

the valley of Allt an Uamh (Burn of the Caves) traversing the limestone plateau

of Inchnadamff, Sutherlandshire. Owing to the limestones being piled together
by reversed faidts, the streams flowing on to the plateau from the surrounding
less pervious rocks plunge underground on reaching the limestone and emerge
at lower levels. All the tributaries of the Allt an Uamh, save during heavy floods,
disappear at a considerable distance above the caves, and issue as two powerful
springs about a mile below the bone cave. The authors are of opinion that a stream
may have issued from the floor of the bone cave at a time when the valley was
filled with glacial deposits up to the level of the caves. These materials having
been largely removed by denudation, the water circulates at lower levels in the

limestone plateau.

     In (he autumn of 1889 the authors, together -with the Rev. Mr. Short and Mr.
Clarence Fry, explored the most easterly cave with the following results, the
materials being carefully examined as they were removed :

     (a) Peaty matter from a few inches to a foot thick.
     (6) Lenticular layer of calcareous marl about one foot thick, composed of the
remains of various land shells.

    (c) Red clay or cave earth from one to three feet. Indications of human occu-

pation occur at various levels in the form of layers of charcoal, split and calcined
bones, comprising reindeer, red deer, badger, fox, bones of birds--chiefly of grouse

--with nests of frog bones.

--The following Papers and Reports were read:

       1. Landslips in the St. Cassian Strata of S. Tyrol.

                          Bij Miss M. M. Ogilvie.

This paper deals with the nature of the landslips in the Wengen and Ca.ssian

strata, in the neighbourhood of St. flassian in S. Tyrol, and the effect wliich they

have pi'oduced in mingling the fossils derived from rocks of different horizons.

The peculiar liability of these strata to landslips is attributable (1) to their

litliological character and stratigraphical relations ; they are soft, easily weathered,

occurrence at the high altitude of 5,000 to 7,000 feet, and in a region where the

ordinary atmospheric agencies may, and often do, indirectly produce most violent

effects, due to the sudden swelling of mountain streams and their increased powers

of eroding and transporting loose or insecure material.

If, from any cause whatever, a breach takes origin in a high-lying meadow,

either suddenly or gradually, it must inevitably become wider and deeper in the

course of years. The essential features in the development of the landslips in

Wengen and Cassian strata are admirably illustrated by tlie actual exposures on

the Alp of Prelongei above St. Cassian, The turfed ground along the top terrace

or ridge is cracked, fissured, and rent into huge irregular ' clods,' which sink in

larger or smaller fragments   steadily downward and outward                                                                                                                                the streams  at  the

base of this ridge eat backward and undermine fresh portions, at the same time

actively carrying oft" the debris and layering it afresh at lower levels.

The ' Muren,' on the S. side of Prelongei, are great scars, 300 feet high, which

were opened up by a series of landslips three centuries ago. As the dip of the

beds isto the N.E., these ' Muren' have remained steep, whereas in the case of

slips on the N. side, the slipped rock rests as it were on a sliding plane, and must
travel slowly downward. The loosened material from each new slip tills up the

gap made by the previous slip ; the surface thus becomes raised, and a plane of

repose is gradually reached.

Several highly fossiliferous limestones and marls occur in the Cassian beds

some in the upper horizons capping the series exposed in the ' Muren ' have yielded

most of the fossils gathered over the whole Prelongei and Stuores Alps. For

fragments of these fossiliferous beds occur in secondary position in the lower

ground where the remains of successive landslips form in some parts an almost

continuous mantle over the beds actually in position.

   A lower fossiliferous zone is recognisable at the base of the beds of the ' Muren,'

but its precise palteontological value will take some years to determine. To this

end the fossils lying loose cannot be used ; only those which luive been so far

weathered out in the bedded rock itself can be regarded as secure evidence. This

whole series, in which the landslips here and elsewhere have mainly taken place,

                     Bij J. G. GOODCHILD, H.M. Geological Survey.

    [Communicated by permission of the Director-General of the Geological Survey.]

    A quarter of a century back Professor Hughes expressed the opinion that

 granites and some other intrusive rocks did not thrust aside the rocks they invaded,
but rather that they occupied exactly the same position, and that they replaced,
rather than displaced, an equivalent bulk of the rocks into which they had eaten
their way. At a later date Mr. Clough came to the same conclusion in regard to

Whin Sill of Teesdale. The idea did not find acceptance except amongst field

 geologists, the chief objection urged against it being the remarkable uniformity of
composition of the invader where the rocks assimilated happene'd to present a wide
range of chemical composition. Mr. Clough sup-gested as an explanation of this
 difficulty that the molten rock might have undergone circulation throughout the
mass as fast as it was melted up.

      The aatlior's examination of the peripheral parts of the Ross of Mull granite
 (as well as of others in Cornwall and elsewhere) seemed to him to lend further

support to the views advanced by Professor Hughes and Mr. Clough. He considers

that the evidence is in favour of replacement by melting in the case of the majority
 of intrusive masses, the molten rock being diS'used as an alloy throughout the
mass, but that where the superincumbent pressure was comparatively low he admits
tliat a true laccolite might really be formed, and the molten mass thrust into a
.space formed by local upheaval of the overlying rock without any such replacement.

therefore slightly unconformable to the beds below. These are admitted on all
hands to be Permian; therefore the break between the Trias and the Permian is at
the base of (3). The author considers that the whole of these rochs form the
natural basement beds of the Neozoic rocks, and that the dividing line between the
PalfEOZoic rocks and those of Neozoic age should be taken somewhere between the
Red rocks of the Salopian type (to which he would restrict the term Permian)

and the true New Ked, as the term is here employed. lie considers that the New

Red proper bears the same relation to the Jurassic and Rha^tic rocks that the
upper Old Red Sandstone does to the Carboniferous, and that the Salopian Permian
may possibly occupy the same relatiou in regard to the Carboniferous rocks as the
Glenijarilf Grits do to the Silurians. Some at least of tlie Salopian rocks may be

simply Carboniferous rocks stained by infiltration from the New Red.

     The author regards the St. Bees Sandstone as mainlj- equivalent to the Bunter,
and proposes that the term Bunter Marls should be applied to the marls which

here (and in Devonshire, Sec.) occur at the base of that subdivision.

                    Sandstone. -By E. T. Newtox, F.Q.S., F.Z.S.

    At the Aberdeen meeting of the British Association in 1885 Dr. Traquair

called attention to the skull of a dicynodont which had been discovered in the

Elgin Sandstone of Cutties' Hillock ( = New Spynie). Since that time several

other specimens have been obtained from the same place, some of which are the
property of the Elgin Museum,'while others belong to the Geological Survey of the

United Ivingdom. These specimens are now being worked out bj' the author, and

this communication is a preliminary note on the interesting results which have
been obtained.

     All the reptile remains obtained from Cutties' Hillock are in the condition of

hollow casts, the bones themselves having been dissolved away ; this, it will be
remembered, was the case with some of the examples of Stctgonolepis from the
Elgin Sandstone, described by I'rof. Huxley, and the method of taking casts from
the hollow cavities, which was adopted in that case, has been found of great
advantage in the present instance. The blocks when brought from the quarry
were more or less split open, exposing portions of the specimens. In some cases

these cavities were traced out and developed with the chisel, while in others they

were farther split open, thus allowing casts to be taken. lu many ca.ses these
casts had to be made in several parts and afterwards fitted together. The time

and labour involved in this task have been repaid by the restoration of the skulls
and parts of skeletons of several Dieynodunts and one or two other equally
remarkable forms of reptiles.

      In most of these specimens, including that noticed by Dr. Traquair, the skulls
are similar in form, although diflering in minor details, and have a general resem-
blance to the South African Bicynodon and Oudetiodon , some of them having small
tusks in the maxillary bones. Vv'ith most of these skulls parts of the skeleton have

                                                                                                                     3A2

been found. Two or tLree show the position of the vertebral column and rib«, but

up to the present no definite centra have been traced ; besides this there is evidence
of scapula, clavicle, humerus, radius, and ulna, the humerus having the charac-
teristic anomodont expansion of the two extremities. In two specimens the ilia
are preserved. These forms appear to be distinct from Dicynodon, and probably
represent at least two or three species.

     Another skull presents most of the characters of Ttycliorjnathus, but has a short
muzzle and no teeth. The last and by far the most remarkable skull of this
series is about six inches in length, and has the outer surface completely covered
in by bony plates, the nostrils, orbits, and pineal fossa being the only apertures. The
chief feature of this skull is the extreme development of horns upon the face and
cheeks, there being about thirty of these formidable defences, varying from a fourth
of an inch to nearly three inches in length, besides some smaller bosses. The
dentition is pleurodont, and resembles very closely that of the living Iguana ; the
palate is lacertilian, but with the pterygoids united iu front of the pterygoid
vacuity. This skull reminds one very strongly of the living Moloch and Phrynosoma,
but it probably finds its nearest ally in the Pareiasaurus from the South African
Karoo Bed. The detailed description of these specimens is nearly completed, and
will, it is hoped, be shortly published.

    1. Additions to the Eurypterid Fauna of the Upper Silurian,
               By Malcolm Laurie, B.A., B.Sc, F.L.S.^

    The uppermost Silurian rocks are almost universally characterised by a well-

developed Eurypterid fauna. It has been described iu Eussia, Bohemia, and

America, as well as in two or three places in Great Britain. The range of the

species, however, is, as a rule, very limited, almost every new locality yielding

new forms.

    The Silurian rocks of the Pentland Hills, passing as they do conformably into

the Lovrer Old Ked saiidstone, might be expected to yield some trace of this fauna,

and a small bed containing somewhat abundant I'emains was described by Mr.

Henderson iu the 'Transactions of the Edinbuigh Geological Society,' vol. iii.

The collection which he made is now in the Museum of Science and Art, where

I had an opportunity of examining it last year.

     The specimens belong to three genera, one of which is new. Eurypterus is

--represented by three species, one of which-- represented only by fragments may

be  identical with U. scorpioides of  Woodward                                                           the  other  two  appear  to  be new.

eyes, which are nearer the marfrin than is usual in Eurypterus, In the other
species (J^. cydophthalnms), wliioh is only represented by a single specimen, two

inches in length, the eyes are circular and comparative!}- large, the carapace being

semicircular and with a distinct border.
     Stylonurus is represented by two species, also new. S. ornatus is a com-

paratively large form, about 18 inches in length, and is characterised by the form
of the carapace, whicli is horse-shoe-shaped, the possession of epimera on the
posterior segments and the abundance and variety of the ornamentation. The

--second species Stylonurus marrophthalmus is much smaller, and the most

marked feature is the size of the eyes, which are half as long as the carapace.
     The third genus represented is a new one, to which I have given the name

Drepanopterus. The carapace in this form is somewhat of the same shape as in
Stylonurus, but broader in propotion to its length, measuring 3 inches by If.
The body is short and conical, beirg widest at the third segment. The first seg-
ment seems ver)^ much reduced. The ornamentation on the body is reticulate
rather than scale-like. Only one limb is preserved, which is 4 inches long and
shows the four last joints, of which the first three are subcylindrical find somewhat
hour-glass-shaped, decreasing in length from the first to the tliird. The terminal
joint is an inch long, expanded and falcate in shape, the posterior margin being
slightly concave and the anterior margin strongly convex. The whole limb is
covered with punctate markings. ThciC are traces of a second limb, which probably
equalled this one in size. The form of the limb seems to be somewhat intermediate

between Stjionurus and Eurypterus.

                           By Alfred Haeker, M.A., F.G.S}

     Basalts enclosing quartz-grains are known from the Tertiary volcanic areas of

the United States and from other parts of the world, and similar grains of quartz
occur widely, though sparingly, in the lamprophyre dykes (' mica-traps,' &c.) of
the North of England and other districts. Having regard chiefly to the latter
group of rocks, the author maintains that the quartz has not the characters of
mechanically derived fragments ; while it is dirticult, on the other hand, to conceive

of free silica crystallising from a basic magma. He supposes, as the source of the

rocks in question, a large magma-basin separated by <rravity into layers of different
density. The quartz crystallised out in the upper acid magma, and sank, owing to
its superior density, into the lower basic portion, which was afterwards separately
injected or ejected as a basic rock.

               By H. J. Johnstok-Lavis, M.B., Bac-cs-Sci., F.G.S.

      During the Saturday's excursion of the British Association to the Pentland
Hills, under the able guidance of Mr. Peach, we were shown some tuffs that cap the

ridge we were crossing from Logan Burn to Penicuik, or more correctly in the
third quarry down from the crest of the ridge between Carnethy and Scald Law.
These tuffs overlie scoriaceous andesites, which in their turn are superposed on

basalts.

     The tuffs are well stratified, at times finely banded, and altogether composed
of minute fragments, which in considerable part can be seen to be pumice.

     The interesting points about these tuffs, from a vulcanological point of view, is

the presence of pisolites, showing all the characters of those structures so common

--in dusty tufts of recent formation that is to say, with a coarse-grained nucleus

surrounded by a fine-grained shell.
      I originally believed these pisolites to be due to a sort of accretion, such as

forms in glazing pottery. They have, however, been shown to be produced by

drops of rain falling through a dusty atmosphere. Now such an origin will

--explahi their structure the rain drop will at first catch both coarse and fine

particles on its surface, but ]ireferably the larger ones, for they are more easily
wetted. As the drops of water get graduUy filled with solid particles the amount
of available moisture on the surface gets less and less, so that finally only the finest
powder can adhere. Pisolites frequently enclose a cavity in their centre, probably
due to the larger ])articles jamming together and forming a spherical vault around
the central drop of water.

    The deductions to be drawn from the existence of these pisolites ia that they
 indicate that practically sub-aerial volcanoes, or at any rate vents in very shallow

 water, are necessary for their production.

      I have recognised pisolites in tufts of Triassic age in Germany, but these of the
Old Red Sandstone period are the oldest recorded occurrence of such accretions,
and form another link of evidence in favour of the similarity between ancient and

 actual volcanic action.

                         THURSDAY, AUGUST 4.

--The President delivered the following Address:

At the meeting of this Association held at Birmingham in 188G I had the

honour oF delivering a lecture on the sense of hearing, in which I criticised the

current theory of tone-sensation, and I propose on this occasion to discuss the

current theories regarding our sense of colour.

I may premise that our conceptions of the outer world are entirely founded on

the experience gathered from our sensory impressions. Through our organs of

sensation, mechanical, chemical, and radiant energies impress our consciousness.

The manner in which the physical agents stimulate the peripheral sense-organs,

the nature of the movement transmitted through our nerves to the centres for

sensation in the hraiu, the manner in which different qualities of sensation are

--there produced all these are problems of endless interest to the physiologist and

psychologist.

     Every physiologist has acknowledged the profound significance of Johannes

--Miiller's law of the specific energies or, as we should rather say, the specific

activities of the sense-organs. To those unfamiliar with it I may explain it by

saying that if a motor nerve be stimulated, the obvious result is muscular move-
--ment
                         ;                                            it may be
it matters     not  by what form  of  energy the nerve is stimulated
--by electricity or heat, by a mechanical pinch or a chemical stimulus the specific

--result is muscular contraction. In like manner, when the nerve of sight is stimu-

lated it may be by light falling on the retina, or by electricity, or mechanical

--pressure, or by cutting the nerve the invariable result is a lumiuous sensation,

because the impression is transmitted to cells in the centre for vision in the brain^

whose specific function is to produce a sense of light.
    The same principle applies to the other sensory centres; when thrown into

activity, they each produce a special kind of sensation. The sun's rays falling on

the skin induce a sense of heat, but falling on the eye, they induce a sense of light.

In both cases, the physical agent is the same ; the difi'erence of result arises from

specific differences of function in the brain centres concerned in thermal and visual

sense. "We have no conception how it is that different kinds of sensation arise from

molecular movements in the different groujis of sensory cells ; we are as ignorant
of that as we are of the nature of consciousness itself.

     The subject I propose to discuss on this occasion is not the cause of the different

hinds of sensation proper to the different sense-organs, but the causes of some

qualities of sensation producible through one and the same sense-organ.
     The theory of tone-sensation proposed by Helmholtz is, that the ear contains an

elaborate series of nerve terminals capable of responding to tones varying in pitch
from .sixteen vibrations to upwards of 40,000 vibrations per second, and that at least
one different fibre in the auditory nerve, and at least one different cell in the centre
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                                  729

for hearing, is aflfected by each tone of perceptibly different pitch. Although the

physical diiFerence between high and low tones is simply a difference in frequency

of the sound waves, that is not supposed by Helmholtz to be the cause of the

different sensations of pitch. According to his theory, the function of frequency of

vibration is simply to excite by sympathy different nerve terminals in the ear. The

molecular movement in all the nerve fibres is supposed to be identical, and the

different sensations of pitch are ascribed to a highly specialised condition of cells-

in the hearing centre, whereby each cell, so to speak, produces the sensation of a
tone of definite pitch, which in no way depends on the frequency of incoming

nerve impulses, but simply on the specific activity of the cell concerned.

In my lecture on the sense of hearing I pointed out in detail the great

anatomical ditficulties attending the theory in question. I endeavoured to show

the ph)'sical defect of a theory which does not suppose that our sensations of

harmony and discord must immediately depend upon the numerical ratios of nerve
vibrations transmitted from the ear to the central organ, and I offered a new theory

of hearing based upon the analogy of the telephone. According to that theory,

there is probably no analysis of sound in the ear ; the hair-cells at the peripheral

ends of the auditory nerve are probably affected by every audible sound of what-

ever pitch. When stimulated by sound they probably produce nerve vibrations,

simple or compound, whose frequency, amplitude, and wave-form correspond to

those of the sound received. The nerve vibrations arriving in the cells of the

auditory centre probably induce simple sensations of tones of different pitch, or

compound sensations of harmonies or discords strictly dependent on the relative

frequencies of the nerve vibrations coming in through the nerve.

I cannot now recapitulate the evidence derived from anatomical, experimental,

and pathological observations that give support to ray theory of hearing, but I ma.y

briefly say that it is opposed to the theory of specific activities, in so far as it has

been applied to explain the different qualities of sound sensation. It is, however,

in strict accord with the fundamental proposition stated by Fechner ' in his great

work on psj'chophysics in these words : 'The first, the fundamental hypothesis is,

that the activities in our nervous system on which the sensations of light and

sound functionally depend are, not less than the light and sound themselves, to be

regarded as dependent on vibratory movements.' It is evident that, if we could

only comprehend the nature of the molecular movement in the nerve that links the
vibration of the physical agent to that in the sensory cell, we could advance

towards a true theory of the physiological basis of different qualities of sensation in

the different sense-organs. As j'et no definite answer can be given to the question,

what sort of molecular movement constitutes a nerve impulse, but in recent years

our knowledge of the subject has been extended in a direction that opens up a

new vista of possibilities.

  A --nerve impulse travels at a rate not much more than 100 feet per second an

extremely slow speed compared with that of electricity in a wire. It has been

thought to be of the nature of a chemical change sweeping along the nerve, but

that hypothesis is opposed by the fact that the most delicate thermo-pile shows no

production of heat, even when an impulse is caused to sweep repeatedly along the
Asame nerve. Again, it is far easier to fatigue a muscle than a nerve.
                                                                            living

frog's nerve removed from the animal, and therefore deprived of all nutrition, can

retain its excitability for nearly an hour, although subjected all the while to thirty

or forty stimulations per second. An excised muscle, when similarly stimulated,

is exhausted far sooner, because the mechanical energy entirely springs from

chemical change in the muscular substance, and therefore the muscle is more easily

fatigued than the nerve. The molecular commotion in the excited nerve produces
a momentary electrical current ; but that result is not peculiar to nerve. The
same occurs in muscle when stimulated. Possibly the molecular movement is of

tho nature of a mechanical vibration ; at all events, we now know that a nerve

can transmit hundreds, even thousands, of impulses, or let us simply say vibrations,

per second. That fact is so important and significant in relation to the physiology

of the sense organs that I show you an experiment to render it more intelligible.

A frog's muscle has been hooked to a light lever to record its movement on a

smoked cylinder. The nerve of the muscle has been laid on two electrodes con-

nected with the secondary coil of an induction machine. In the primary circuit a

vibrating reed has been introduced to serve as a key for making and breaking the

circuit, and so stimulating the nerve with periodic "induction shocks. If we make

the reed long enough to vibrate ten times per second, ten impulses are sent through

the nerve to the muscle and ten distinct contractions produced, as shown by the
wavy line upon the cylinder. If we shorten the reed so that it will vibrate, say,

fifty times per second, the muscle is thrown into a continuous contraction aiid

traces a smooth line on the cylinder ; but if we listen to the muscle we can hear a

tone having a pitch of fifty vibrations per second, from which we know that fifty

nerve impulses are entering the muscle and inducing fifty shocks of chemical dis-

charge in the muscular substance. If we take a reed that vibrates, say, COO times
per second, we hear, on listening to the muscle, a tone having the pitch of 500

vibrations. Observe that we are not dealing with the transnaission of electrical

shocks along the nerve, but with the transmission of nerve impulses. By stimu-

lating the nerve with wires of a telephone it has been shown by D'Arsonval that a

nerve can transmit upwards of 5,000 vibrations per second, and that the wave-

forms may be so perfect that the complex electrical waves produced in the

telephone by the vowel sounds can be reproduced in the sound of a muscle after

having been translated into nerve vibrations and transmitted along a nerve. Such

·experiments go far in helping us towards a comprehension of the capabilities of

nerves in transmitting nerve vibrations of great frequency and complicated wave

form                           but although they enable us reasonably to suppose that all the fibres of    the
                            ;

auditory nerve can transmit nerve vibrations, simple or complex, and with a

frequency similar to that of all audible tones, we encounter superlative difficulty

in applying such a theory to the sense of sight. In objective sound we have to

deal with a comparatively simple wave motion, whose frequency of vibration is not

difficult to grasp even at the highest limit of audible sound--about 40,000 vibra-

--tions per second. But in objective light the frequency of vibrat ion is so enormous

amountmg to hundreds of billions per second that ever^'one feels the difficulty of

forming any conception of the manner in which different frequencies of ether waves

induce diftereuces in colour sensation.

But before passing to colour sense I wish to allude for a moment to the sense

of smell. The terminals of the olfactory nerve in the nose are epithelial cells. It

has been recently shown by Yon Brunn' that in man and other mammals the cells

have at their free ends verj- delicate short hairs, resembling those long known in

lower vertebrates. These hairs must be the terminal structures affected by sub-

stances that induce smell, and are therefore analogous to the hairs on the terminal

cells in our organ of hearing. No one ever suggested that the hairs of the

auditory cells can analyse sounds by responding to particular vibrations, and I

think it quite as improbable that the hairs on any particular olfactory cell respond

to the molecular vibrations of any particular substance. If we follow those who

have had recourse to the doctrine of specific activities to explain the production

of different smells, we must suppose that at least one special epithelial cell and

nerve fibre are aff"ected by each different smelling substance. Considering how

great is the variety of smells, and that their number increases with the production
of new substances, it would be a somewhat serious stretch of imagination to sup-

pose that for each new smell of a substance yet to emerge from the retort of the

cheniist there is in waiting a special nerve terminal in the nose. It seems to me

far simpler to suppose that all the hairs of the olfactory cells are affected by every

smelling substance, and that the different qualities of smell residt from differences

in the frequency and form of the vibrations initiated by the action of the chemical

molecules on the olfactory cells and transmitted to the brain. · That hypothesis
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     i

seems to me the only intelligible theory of smell yet offered. But it must be
admitted that a theory of smell such as that advanced by Ramsay involves a more

subtle conception of the molecular vibrations in nerve fibrils than is required in

the case of hearing. It involves the conception that musk, camphor, and similar

substances produce their characteristic qualities of smell by setting up nerve

Wevibrations probably of dififerent frequencies and different complexities,  shall

see what bearing this may have on the theory of colour sense, to which I now pass.
    No impressions derived from external Nature yield so much joy to the

mind as our sensations of colour. Pure tones and perfect harmonies produce

delightful sensations, but they are outrivalled by the colour effects of a glorious

sunset. Without our sense of colour all Nature would appear dressed in bold

Weblack and white, or indifferent grey.   would recognise, as now, the beauty of

shapely forms, but they would be as the cold engraving contrasted with the

brilliant canvas of Titian. >The beautiful tints we so readily associate with natural

objects are all of them sensations produced in our brain. Paradox though it

appear, all Nature is really in darkness. The radiant energy that streams from a

sun is but a subtle wave-motion, which produces the common effects of heat on all

bodies, dead or living. It does not dispel the darkness of Nature until it falls on

a living eye, and produces the sense of light. Objective light is only a wave

motion in an etherial medium subjective light is a sensation produced by mole-
                                                                                                                                                                     ;

cular vibration in our nerve apparatus.

The sensorj' mechanism concerned in sight consists of the retina, the optic

nerve, and the centre for visual sensation in the occipital lobe of the brain. In the

vertebrate eye the fibres of the optic nerve spread out in the inner part of the

retina, and are connected with several layers of ganglionic cells placed external to

them. The light has to stream through tlie fibres and ganglionic layers to reach

--the visual cells that is, the nerve terminals placed in the outer part of the retina.

They may be regarded as epithelial cells, whose peripheral ends are developed into

peculiar rod and cone-shaped bodies, while their central ends are in physiological

continuit}' with nerve fibrils. Each rod and cone consists of an inner and an outer

segment. Tlie outer segment is a pile of exceedingly thin, transparent, doubly

refractive discs, colourless in the cone, but coloured pink or purple in the rod. In

man, the inner segment of both rod and cone is colourless and transparent. Its

outer part appears to be a compact mass of fine fibrils that pass imperceptibly into

the homogeneous-looking protoplasm in the shaft of the cell. Owing to the

position of the rods and cones, the light first traverses their inner, then their outer

segments, and its unabsorbed portion passes on to the adjacent layer of dark-

brown pigment cells by which it is absorbed. It is not necessary for me to discuss

the possible difi'erence of function between the rods and cones. I may simply say

that in the central part of the yellow spot of the retina, where vision is most

acute, and from which we derive most of our impressions of form and colour, the

Aonly sensory terminals are the cones. ·  single cone can enable us to obtain a

distinct visual impression. If two small pencils of light fall oh the same cone the

resulting sensory impression is single. To produce a double impression the
luminous pencils must fall on at least two cones. That shows how distinct must

be the path pursued by the nerve impulse from a visual cell in the yellow spot to a

sensory cell in the brain. The impulses must pursue discrete paths through the

apparent labyrinth of nerve fibrils and ganglion cells in the retina to the fibres of

the optic nerve. I now pass to tlie physical agent that- stimulates the retina.
    When a beam of white light is dispersed by a prism or diffraction grating, the

ether-waves are spread out in the order of their frequency of undulation. The

undulations of radiant energy extend through a range of many octaves, as Hertz

has recently shown, but those able to stimidate the retina ard comprised within a

range of rather less than one octave, extending from a frequency of about 395

billions per second at the extreme red to about 757 billions at the extreme violet

end of the visible spectrum. The ultra-violet waves in the spectrum of sunlight

extend through rather more than half an octave. Although mainly revealed by

their chemical effects, they are not altogether invisible: their colour is bluish-grey.

·waves in the visible and invisible spectruai is frequency of undulation, or, otherwise

--expressed, a diflerence in wave-length. The chromatic that is, the colour-produc-
--ing effects of the ether-waves depend on tlieir power of exciting sensations of

colour, which vary with their frequency of undulation.
     Although the retina is extremely sensitive to differences in the frequency of

ether-waves, it is not equally so for all parts of the spectrum. In the red and blue
portions, the frequency varies considerably without producing marked difference
of colour effect, but in the region of yellow and green, comparatively slight varia-
tions in frequency produce appreciable differences of colour sensation. One striking
difference between the effect of ether-waves on the eye and sound-waves on the ear
is the absence of anything corresponding to the octave of tone sensation. The
ether-waves in the ultra-violet, which have twice the frequency of those of the red
end of the spectrum, give rise to no sense of redness, but merely that of a bluish-
grey. Even within the octave there are no harmonies or discords of colour sense

corresponding to those of tone sensation.

   --Colours are commonly defined by three qualities or constants hue, purity, and

brightness. Their hue depends upon the chromatic eff"ect of frequency of undulation
or wave length. Their purity or saturation depends on freedom from admixture
with sensations produced by other colours or by white light. Their brightness or
luminosity depends on the degree to which the sensory mechanism is stimulated.
The loudness of sound depends on the amount of excitement produced in the
auditory mechanism by the amplitude of sound waves ; but a sound with small

amplitude of undulation may seem loud when the nerve apparatus is unduly
sensitive. The brightest colour of the spectrum is orange-yellow, but it does not

follow that the amplitude or energy of the ether-waves is greater than in the
region of dull red. There is no physical evidence of greater amplitude in the
orange-yellow, and its greater luminosity is no doubt purely subjective, and arises
from the greater commotion induced in the sensory mechanism.

     The theory of colour sense long ago proposed by Sir Isaac Newton ' is now
commonly treated with what seems to me very undeserved neglect. Newton

supposed that the rays of light induce vibrations in the retina which are trans-
mitted by its nerve to the sensorium, and there induce different colour sensations

--according to the length of the incoming vibrations the longest producing sensa-

tions of red and yellow, the shortest blue and violet, those of medium length a
sense of green, and a mixture of them all giving a sense of whiteness. At the
beginning of this century Thomas Young proposed a theory which seems to have
been intended as a modification of that suggested by Newton rather than as a
substitute for it. Young supposed that the ether-waves induce vibrations in the
 retina ' whose frequency must depend on the constitution of its substance ; but as

 it is almost impossible to conceive that each sensitive point of the retina contains

an infinite number of particles, each capable of vibrating in unison with every
possible undulation, it becomes necessary to suppose the number limited to three
 primary colours, red, yellow, and blue, and that each sensitive filament of the

nerve may consist of three portions, one for each principal colour.' ^ Soon after-

 wards he substituted green for yellow, and violet for blue, so that he came to
 regard red, green, and violet as the three fundamental colour sensations, by mixtui-e
 of which in varying proportions all other colours, including white, are produced.

 Young believed that his suggestion ' simplified the theory of colours, and might

 therefore be adopted with advantage until found inconsistent with any of the
 phenomena.'

      Young's trichromic theory of colour sense was adopted by Clerk-Maxwell, and

 Von Helmholtz amplified the ' three portions' supposed by Young to exist in 'each

 sensitive filament of the nerve ' into three distinct terminals, each having its

own nerve fibre. He supposed that each terminal contains a diflferent visual
substance capable of being decomposed by light ; that when the substance in

 the red nerve terminal undergoes chemical change its nerve fibre is stimulated,

and the excitement travels to a cell in the brain by whose specific activity the
sensation of red arises. In like manner, when the visual substances in the green

and violet terminals are decomposed, nerve impulses travel through different
fibres to different cells in the vision centre, by whose specific activities the
sensations of green and violet arise. "With Ilelmholtz there was no question

as to difference in quality of sensation depending on difference in frequency of
nerve vibration arriving in the sensorium ; no such hypothesis was entertained by
him either for tone or for colour sensation. "With sight, as with hearing, he

supposed that the function of frequency of undulation virtually stops at the nerve
terminals in the eye and ear, and that the frequency of undulation of the physical

agent lias no correlative in the quality of motion passing from the receiving ter-

minal to the sensory cell. He believes that the different Irequencies of ether-waves
simply excite chemical changes in ditf'erent nerve terminals. He expressly states '

that the molecular commotion in the nerve fibres for red, green, and violet is
identical in kind, and that its different effects depend on the specific activities of
the different cells to which it passes in the sensorium. It is evident that Helmholtz
entirely dismissed the Newtonian theory of the production of different qualities of
colour sense, and substituted for i t the doctrine of his own great teacher, Johannes

Miiller.

    The theory of Young and Helmholtz offers an explanation of so many facts,
and has at the same time provoked so much criticism, that I must enter more
fully into some of its details. On this theory, the sense of white or grey is sup-

posed to result from a simultaneous and duly balanced stimulation of the red, green,

and violet terminals. The red terminals are supposed to be excited chiefly by the
longer waves in the region of the red, orange, and yellow, but also by the shorter
undulations extending as far as Fraunbofer's line F at the beginning of the blue.
In like manner, the green terminals are excited cliiefly by the waves of medium
length, and to a less extent by the waves extending to about in the red, and by

Gthe shorter waves extending to in the violet. The violet terminals are stimulated
most powerfully by the shorter undulations between F and G, but also by the
Dlonger ones reaching as fiir as in the yellow ; therefore, optically homogeneous

light from any part of the spectrum, e.xcept its extreme ends, does not usually

give rise to a pure  colour  sensation                                      all  three  primary sensations are present, and
                                                                         ;
--consequently the colour inclines towards white the more, the stronger the light.

The experimental facts in support of Young's theory are familiar to all who

have studied physics. Compound colour sensations may be produced by causing

light of different wave lengths to fall simultaneously or in rapid succession on the

same part of the retina. The commonest experimental device is to rapidly whirl

discs with sectors of difl'erent colours, and observe the results of the mixed sen-

sations or to cause the images of coloured wafers or papers to fall simultaneously
                                        ;

on the retina by Lambert's method ; or to transmit light through glass of different
colours, and cause the different rays to fall on the same surface ; or to mix pure

homogeneous light from different parts of the spectrum. For obvious reasons, the

Welast method yields the mo.«t trustworthy results.                                     cannot, by any mixture of

homogeneous light from different parts of the spectrum, obtain a pure red or green

sensation, and, according to Ilelmholtz, the same holds true of violet. On the

other hand, a mixture of homogeneous rays from the red and green parts produces

Aorange or yellow, according to the proportions employed.                               mixture of rays

from the green and violet gives rise to intermediate tints of blue, and a mixture

of red and violet light produces purple. Therefore, Young regarded red, green,

--.'ind violet as primary sensations, and orange, yellow, and blue ^just as much as
--·jiurple he regarded as secondary or compound sensations. Grassmann discovered

that to obtain r. sense of white or grey it is not necessary to mingle rays from the

red, green, and violet portions of the spectrum. He found that he could obtain a

white sensation bj' mixing onlj^ t^^·o optically homogeneous rays from several parts

<)f the right and left sides of the spectrum. The pairs of spectral colours which

he found complementary to each other are red and greenish-blue, orange and

--ment for pure green being found not in any liortiogeneous ligbt, but in purple

mixture of red and violet. The complementary colours may be arranged in a

circle, with the complementaries in each pair placed opposite one another. Of

course, the  circle  cannot  be  completed  by the  colours  of  the  spectrum                                               purple

must be added to fill in the gap between the red and violet. Helmholtz found no

constant ratios between the wave lengths of homogeneous complementaries ; and it

is a striking fact that, while a mixture of the green and red, or of the green and

violet, undulations gives rise to a sensation such as could be produced by rays of

intermediate wave length, no such etiect follows the mingling of rays from oppo-

site sides of the spectrum. Pure green, with a wave length of 527 millionths of

a millimetre, marks the division between the right and left sides. The mixture

of blue from the one and yellow from the other side does not produce the inter-
Amediate green, but a sensation of white.
                                            mixture of blue or violet and red

--produces not gieen, but its complementary purple. On the trichromic theory,
the sense of wliite produced by the mingling of any of these two colours is simply

regarded as the result of a balanced stimulation of the red, green, and violet terminals.

But the anatomical form given by Helmholtz to Young's theory of primary

colour sensations is beset with serious difficulties. It implies the existence of
three sets of terminals in the retina, and these must all be found in the central
part of the yellow spot where cones alone are present. Three sets of cones there

would be necessary to respond to tlie ]'ed, green, and violet light, and a colourless

pencil of light could not be seen uncoloured, unless it fall on three cones, which

we know is not the case. Therefoi'e, if there are three diflerent terminals, they
must, in the human retina at all events, be found in every single cone in the

yellow spot. In a single cone there might be three sets of fibrils capable of simul-

taneous stimulation in ditt'erent degrees, but it seems impossible to suppose that the

different vibrations started in the same terminal could be kejjt discrete, and be

transmitted to the brain through tliree d liferent fibres in the optic nerve, even if

the nerve contained a suihcient number of fibres for the purpose, which we know is

not the case.

The phenomena of colour-blindnpss also offer great diihculty. In several cases

of apoplectic seizure it has happened that the ceuti'e for vision on botli sides of

the brain has been completely or partially paralysed by the extravasated blood.

In such cases the sense of colour may be entirely lost either ibr a time or per-

manently, while the sense of light and form remain, altliough impaired. The

loss of colour sense in some cases lias been found complete in both eyes ; in most
of the recorded cases the loss of colour sense was limited to the right or left halves

of both eyes ; that is, if the lesion aflijcted the vision centre on the right side of the
brain, the right halves of both eyes were blind to all colours. That illustrates the

well-known fact that a sense of light does not necessarily imply a sense of colour.

The colour sense probably involves a more highly refined action of the sensory cell

than the mere sense of light and form, and is on that account more liable to be

lost when the nutrition of the sensory cell is interfered with. In the normal

eye the peripheral zone of the retina is totally blind to colour. If you turn the
right eye outwards, close the left, and then move a strip of coloured paper from

the left to the right in front of the nose, the image of the paper will first fall on

the peripheral zone of the retina, and its form will be seen, though indistinctly,

but not its colour. It is difficult to say iu that case whether the colour-blindness

is due to the state of the retina or to that portion of the vision centre in the brain
associated with it. The absence of cones from the peripheral part of the retina

has been assigned as the cause, but it is much more probable that the portion of

the vision centre associated with the periphery of the retina, being comparatively

little used, is less highly developed for form sensation, and not at all for colour
sense. It is evident that the production of a sense of white or grey in the absence

of all colour sense is not to be explained on the theory that it results from a

balanced stimulation of red, green, and violet nerve terminals.

I need scarcely say that colour-blindness has attracted a large share of atten-

tion, not only because of its scientific interest, but still more on account of its
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  735

practical importance in relation to the correct otservation of coloured signals. In
1855 the late Professor George Wilson/ of this city, called attention to the grow-

ing importance of the subject. Some years ago Professor Holmgren made an
elaborate statistical inquiry regarding it at the instance of the Swedish Govern-
ment, and lately it has been investigated by a committee of the Koyal Society

of London, who have quite recently published their report.'-

     Although colour-blindness occasionally results from disease of the brain, retina,
or optic nerve, it is usually congenital. Total colour-blindness is extremely rare,
but partial colour-blindness is not uncommon. It occurs in about 4 per cent, of

males, but in less than 1 per 1,000 of females. Its most common form is termed
red-o-reen blindness, in which red and green sensations appear to be absent. So

far as I can find, the first fidl and reliable account of the state of vision in red-
green blindness is that given in 1859 by Mr. Pole,^ of London, from an examination

of his own case, which appears to be a typical one. The state of his vision is
dichromic ; his two-colour sensations are yellow and blue. The red, orange,
and yellowish-green parts of the spectrum appear to him yellow of different

shade's. . Greenish-blue and violet appear blue, and between the yellow and

blue portions of the spectrum, as it appears to him, there is a colourless grey

band in the position of the full green of the ordinary spectrum. This neutral band

is seen in the spectrum in all cases of dichromic vision. It may appear white or

 orey according to the intensity of the light, and it apparently results from an
equilibrium of the two sensations : no such band is seen in the spectrum by a

normal eye. Mr. Pole, in the account of his case given now three and thirty years
 ago, considered it impossible to explain his dichromic vision on the commonly

 received theory that his sense of red is alone defective, and that his sense of yellow

is a compound of blue and green. He believed his green quite as defective as his-

red sensation, and that yellow and blue are quite as much entitled to be considered

fundamental sensations as red and green. He suggested that in normal colour

--vision there are at least four primary sensations red and green, yellow and blue.

 Professor Hering is commonly accredited with the four-colour theory, but it was

 previously suggested by Pole.^

    A year after Pole's paper appeared, Clerk-Maxwell ° published his celebratod

 paper on the theory of compound colours, to which he appended an account of his
 observations on a case of what he believed to be red-blindness, but which we now

 Imow must have been red-green blindness. The spectrum appeared dichromic,

 its only colours being yellow and blue. His description of the case does not

 materially ditter from that given by Pole ; but Clerk-Maxwell believed in the tri-

 chromic theory of normal vision, and that red-green and blue are the three

 primary sensations ; consequently he supposed that the yellow sensation of a red

 blind person is not yellow, but green.

      It is evident that much depends on the question. Is the yellow sensation of a
 red-green blind person the same as that of normal vision ? For many years it was-
 impossible to give a definite answer to that question, but the answer can now be
 given, as we shall immediately see. Colour-blindness is frequently hereditary, and
 two or three cases are known in which the defective colour sense was limited to-
 one eye, while in the other eye colour vision was normal. In such a case observed
 by Professor Hippel, of Giessen, there was red-green bhndness in one eye. Holm-
 gren, who examined Ilippel's case, has published an account of it.'^ With one eye
 all the colours of the spectrum were seen, but to the other eye the spectrum had
 only two colours with a narrow grey band between them at the junction of the-
 blue and yellow. The yellow seen "by the eye with the red-green defect had a

gTeenisli tinge like that of a lemon, but in other respects the observations con-

firnjed Pole's account of bis own case.
    Hippel's case seems to me important for another reason. By some it is believed

tbat congenital colour defect is due to the brain. If there had been defective

colour sense on one side of the brain, it would not have implicated the whole of

one eye, but the half of each eye. Its limitation to one eye, therefore, seems to

me to suggest that the fault was in the eye rather than in the brain.

   Another interesting fact in this relation is that in every normal eye, just be-

hind the peripheral zone of total colour-blindness, to which I have already referred,

there is a narrow zone in which red and green sensations are entirely wanting,

while blue and yellow sensations are normal. Possibly the red-green defect is

due to an imperfectly developed colour sense in the portion of the vision centre

«onnected with that zone of the retina, but Hippel's case seems to me to show

that such defect might be in the retina.

   It has probably already struck you that red-green blindness is really blindness

to red, green, and violet, that Young's three primary sensations appear to be

absent, and the two remaining colours are those which he regarded as secondary

compounds of his primaries.

That, however, is not all that is revealed by colour-blindness. There is at least

another well-known though rare form in which a sense of yellow, blue, and violet

is absent, and the only colour sensations present are red and green. The defect is

sometimes termed violet blindness, but the term is somewhat misleading. It is

much more in accordance with the fact to term it yellow-blue blindness ; indeed,
we would define it precisely by terming it yellow-blne-violet blindness. Holmgren '

has recorded a unilateral case of that defect analogous to Hippel's case of uni-

lateral red-green defect ; we therefore know definitely how the spectrum appears to

such a person. In the case referred to all the colours of the spectrum were seen

with the normal eye, but to the other eye the spectrum had only two colours, red

and green. The red colour extended over the whole left side of the spectrum to a

neutral band in the yellow-green, a little to the right of Fraunhofer's line D. All

the right side of the spectrum was green as far as the beginning of the violet,

where it ' ended with a sharp limit (about the line g).'

If you turn to the Report of the Royal Society's Committee^ on colour

vision, you will find the spectrum as it appears to yellow-blue-violet blind per-

sons. The plate agrees with the description of Holmgren's case already given

but you will not find a representation of the spectrum as it appears to those

who are red-green blind, and as described by Pole and others. In place of

it you will find two dichromic spectra, one with a red and blue half, said to be

seen by a green blind, the other with a green and a blue half, said to be seen
Webv a red blind person.
                                have copied the spectra for your inspection, and you

will observe that yellow does not appear in either of them. I do not for a

moment pretend to criticise these spectra from any observations of my own ; I am

aware Holmgren maintains that red-and-green blindness may occur separately

but, on the other hand, Hering and Stilling have maintained that they are always

associated, and Dr. George Berry, an eminent ophthalmologist, has assured me, from

his own observations, that such is the case.

Of the various methods of testing colour vision, that suggested by Seebeck is

most commonly employed. The individual is mainly tested with regard to his

sense of creen and red. He is shown skeins of wool, one pale green, another pink

or purple, and a third bright red, and he is asked to select from a heap of coloured

wools, laid on a white cloth, the colours that appear to him to match those of the

Weseveral tests.  have arranged such test skeins for your inspection, and have

placed beneath each of them the colours which a red-green blind person usually

selects as having hues similar to those of the test. It is startling enough to find

brown, orange, green, and grey confused with bright red; pale red, orange, yellow,

and grey confused with green ; blue, violet, and green confused with pink ; but

these confusions have all their explanation in the fact that the red-green blind

-- --liave only two colour sensations yellow and blue with a grey band in what

should have been the green part of his spectrum.

   We have now to show you another and far more beautiful method of ascer-

taining what fundamental colour sensations are absent in the colour-blind. It is

the method of testing them by what Cbevreul long ago termed simultaneous contrast.

If in a semi-darkened room we throw a beam of coloured light on a white

screen and interpose an opaque object in its path, the shadow shows the comple-

mentary colour. If the light be red, the shadow appears green-blue; if it be green,

the shadow appears purple or red according to the nature of the green light em-

ployed.  If  the  light  is jellow, the shadow is  blue                         if  it  is  blue, the  shadow is
                                                                             ;

Weyellow.    must remember that the part of the screen on which the shadow falls

is not entirely dark; a little diffuse light falls on the retina from the shadowed

part, so that the retina and vision centre are slightly stimulated, where the

Weimage of the shadow falls.  use an oxyhydrogen lantern and transmit the light

through plates of coloured glass carefully selected.

The experiment is rendered still more striking, though at the same time a

little more complicated, by using two oxyhydrogen lamps and throwing their light

-- --on the same portion of the screen. If a plate of coloured say ruby glass is held
before one of the lamps, and au opaque object such as the head of a T-square is

placed in the path of both lights, the shadow cast by the white light falls on a

surface illuminated by a red light, and shows a deep red far more saturated than

the surrounding surface of the screen where the red and wliite lights fall. The

shadow cast by the red light shows the complementary bluish green ; and the con-

trast of the two is exceedingly striking. When we use a plate of pure green glass,

the shadow showing the inducing colour is a saturated green, the other shows the

complementary purple. With yellow glass one shadow is deep yellow, the other

pale blue. With blue glass one shadow is saturated blue, the other pale yellow.

AViih pink glass the complementary green is deeper than the shadow showing the

inducing pink, and is on that account very striking.

These experiments which we have shown you point to some subtle physiological

Arelations between complementary colours.          colour sensation produced in one

part of the vision apparatus forces, so to speak, the neighbouring part, which is

relatively quiescent, to produce the complementary colour subjectively. I

say vision-centre rather than retina, because, if one eye is illuminated with

coloured light while the other eye is feebly illuminated with white light, the com-

plementary colour appears in the centre Ijelonging to that eye. The sense of white

appears to be a mysterious unit}' ; if you ohjectively call up one part of the sensa-
tion, you call up its counterpart subjectively. If a colour and its complementary

counterpart be both displayed objectively at the same time, the action and reaction

of effect afford a sensation far more agreeable than is producible by the objective

display of only one of them. The agreeableness of the contrast of complementary
colours, no doubt, springs from the harmony of effect. There is no harmony of

colour effect analogous to that of music, but there is harmony of a different kind,

and that harmony is formed by the contrast of complementary colours.

   Now I imagine many of you have already anticipated the question. What infor-

mation can simultaneous contrast give regarding the fundamental sensations of

the colour-blind ? From an extended series of observations Dr. Stilling,^ of

Cassel, has ascertained that if a person cannot distinguish between red and green,

no complementary colour appears in the shadow when the inducing light is red or

green, but if the inducing light is yellow or blue the proper complementary appears
in the shadow. If a person was blind to red, he never found the complementary
green appear; if he was blind to green, he never found the complementary red

appear. When the inducing light appeared colourless, the shadow was also

colourless. Stilling therefore concluded that either the sensations of red and green
or of blue and yellow were wanting at the same time or all colour sense was absent.

It is difficult to see how these results are to be harmonised with the conclusions

arrived at by the Committee of the Iioyal Society.

     Facts such as these are regarded by some as lendinp- support to the theory of

colour sense proposed by Professor Herinpr, of Prague.* He supposes that the

diversity of our visual perceptions arises from six fundamental sensations consti-

--tuting three pairs white and black, red and green, yellow and blue. The three

pairs of sensations are supposed to arise from chemical changes in three visual

substances not confined to the retina, but contained also in the optic nerve and in

the vision centre.- He imagines that a sense of white results from decomposition

induced in a special Tisual substance by all visible rays, and that the restitution of

the same substance produces a sense of black. The sensations of the red and

green pair are supposed to arise, the one from decomposition, the other from

restitution of a second substance ; while yellow and blue are supposed to result

from decomposition and restitution of a thii'd substance. From our knowledge of

photo-chemical processes we can readily suppose that light induces chemical change

in the visual apparatus ; but that the wave-lengths in the red and yellow parts of

the spectrum induce decomposition, while the wave-lengths in the green and blue

Howinduce restitution of substances, it is difficult to believe.     such a visual

mechanism could work it would be difficult to comprehend ; for example, if we

look at a bright red light for a few moments and then close our eyes, the sensatiou

remains for a time, but changes from red to green and then slowly fades away.

According to Hering's theory, the green after-sensation results from the restitution

of a substance decomposed by the red light. But if we reverse the experiment by

looking at a bright green light and then closing our eyes, the after-sensation

changes to red. The theory in question would require us to suppose that the green

light builds up a visual substance which spontaneousl}^ decomposes when the eyes

are closed, and so produces the red after-image. I'coufess that such an hypothesis

seems to me incredible. Another remarkable feature of Hering's theory is that

colours termed complementary ought to be termed nntagonistic,^ because they are

capable of producing a colourless sensation when mingled in due proportions. If

the complementary colours yellow and blue could, when mixed, produce black,

they might well be named 'antagonistic ' ; but since their combined effect is a sense
of whiteness, and since the addition of them to white light increases its luminosity,

it seems very difficult to comprehend on what ground the term antar/onistic should

be substituted for complementary. I confess I am quite imable to follow Heriug
when he supposes that three pairs of mutually antagonistic chemical processes are

produced in the retina when white light falls on it, that these processes are all

continued on through the optic nerve into the vision centre, and there give rise to

our different light and colour sensations.

In 1881 Professor Preyer contributed an important paper on colour sense,'' in

which he supported Young's theory of primary colour sensations, but assuming

their number to be four instead of three. Believing with Schultze that the cones

are the only terminals in the retina concerned in colour sense, Preyer supposes

there are four sets of cones containing different photo-chemical substances which

are severally affected by undulations in the red, yellow, green, and blue parts of

the spectrum. But since it has been calculated that the cones are thrice as

numerous as the fibres of the optic nerve, Preyer has endeavoured to bring the

Helmholtz amplification of Young's theory within the range of anatomical possi-

bility by supposing that the four sets of cones are arranged in pairs, each pair

being connected with one nerve fibre. This hypothesis, however, could not meet

the case, oven if cones were the only visual terminals. The rods are far more

numerous than  the cones                                             therefore, although it is probable that in the yellow spot

and more towards the periphery of the retina, where the power of perceiving a

double impression is far less than at the yellow spot. Preyer supposes that the

reception of red and green stimulation, the other for yellow and blue. The part

of Preyer's theory that appears to me attractive is that the photo-chemical chan"-es

induced iu the several terminals cause vibrations to be transmitted throun-h the

nerve whose frequency must be far less than that of the undulations of the ether

and their wave-length consequently^ far greater, but ' the ratios of the wave-lengths

of the ether and nerve vibrations probably remaining almost unchanged.' ' If

Preyer had only gone a step farther and supposed that different colour sensations

are producible in the same cells by difi'erent frequencies of vibrations entering the

sensorium through the same nerve fibres, I would gladly have assented to a theory

which would have been essentially a return to that of Newton : but my learned

friend still strives to account for different colour sensations on the doctrine of

specific activities, and to support the idea that different visual substances are

located in different optic terminals. He supposes that when the cones of the red-

green pair are simultaneously stimulated, vibrations of diiTerent frequencies are

transmitted to a ganglion cell in the retina, and thence to a fibre of the optic

nerve, but not simultaneously, lie does not entertain the idea that the two sets of

vibrations are compounded, and so transmitted by the fibre ; on the contrary, he

helieves that * one and the Same nerve fibre cannot be stimulated in a double

manner at the same moment,' and therefore, to explain the transmission of vibra-

tions of two frequencies by the same fibre, he supposes that there must be a rapidlv

alternating transmission of the two sets of vibrations. I feel unable to assent to

that idea, for it appears to me that if an undulatory theory is applicable to nerve
action, we must believe that simple pendular vibrations of different frequencies can

be compounded. Nor do I feel able to assent to Professor Preyer's theory of the

-- --production of two qualities of sensation say red and green by vibrations trans-

mitted through the same fibre. IJeduced to the simplest expression, his theory is,

that the fibre eventually ends in two sensory cells of specifically diflPerent activities,

one producing a red. the other a green sensation                                                                                                                                                                                                                             that  these  two cells are affected

--sympathetically by vibrations of different frequencies the red cell by vibrations of

the frequency transmitted from the red cone, the green by those of the frequency

transmitted from the green cone. It seems to me far simpler to suppose that the

vibrations produced by chemical change in visual substances in the retina may be

transmitted either as simple or compound vibrations simultaneously by the same

nerve fibres, and produce different sensations in the same cells, according to

frequency and complexity of the incoming vibrations.

It seems to me that the difficulty of this question is much increased by attempt-

ing to show that different cones are concerned in the reception of different colour

impressions. In support of such a view, the fact is adduced that, in birds and

some reptiles, each cone contains an oil globule of a red or orange colour iu some

cones, and of a yellow or 'greenish-yellow in others. The coloured spheroid is

placed in the outer part of the inner segment immediately internal to the outer

segment, and must exercise a selective absorption on the liglit passing to the outer

vsegment. The presence of these coloured spheroids is remarkable, but we know as

little regarding tlieir physiological significance as we do regarding that of the

yellow pigment in the internal layers of the retina at the yellow spot in

our own eyes, through which all the light must pass ere it can reach the

inner segments of the cones in that portion of the retina. All the cones

in the human eye, as in that of all mammals, are colourless, and it involves serious

difficulty if we suppose that different cones are affected by red, green, yellow, and

blue light. The image of a coloured star, small enough to fall on only one cone,

can Ije seen of a fixed and definite colour, that does not alter when the position of

the eye is changed, and the image shifted from one cone to another in the yellow

spot. That fact alone seems to me sufficient to show the necessity for supposing

that each cone is capable of stimulation by all visible undulations of light, and of

transmitting sucli nerve vibrations as are capable of inducing all the colour

sensations.

     It further appears to me that the difticulty of the case is increased hy attempt-
ing to show that cones are the only optic terminals concerned in colour impressions,

while the rods minister only to a sense of light. It is true that cones are relatively

few in number, or may indeed be absent from the retina of nocturnal animals, such

as night-ilying owls and bats, but that cannot be regarded as proof that the rods

are not concerned in colour sense. Rods are much more numerous than cones
everywhere in the human retina, save at the yellow spot. Throughout the greater
part of the retina the cones occur singly, surrounded by numerous rods. Yet when
the image of a coloured .star, .small enough for the area of a single cone, is made to

fall on parts of the retina peripheral to the yellow spot, its colour does not dis-

appear, and reappear when the eye is moved, as would inevitably happen if the

rods were not terminals concerned, as well as the cones, in colour sense.
     It must be admitted that the production of nerve impulses within the terminals

in the retina is almost as obscure as ever. It is still the old question, Does light

stimulate the optic terminals by inducing vibration, or by setting up chemical

change ? Whichever view we adopt, it seems to me necessary to suppose that all

the processes for the production of nerve impulses can take place in one and the

same visual cell, and are transmitted to the brain through the same nerve fibre.

    I referred to the sense of smell because it seems to me that we cannot in that

case escape from the conclusion that the different sensations arise from different
molecular stimulations of the same olfactory terminals.

    From Lippmann's recent researches on the photography of colour ' it appears
that f 11 parts of the spectrum can now be photographed on films of albumino-
bromide of silver to which two aniline substances, azaline and cyanine, have been
added. It seems, therefore, reasonable to suppose that a relatively small number

of substances could enable all the rays of the visible spectrum to aft'ect the retina.
Helmholtz believes that three visual substances would sufiice ; but if the primary

-- --sensations are to be regarded as four red, green, yellow, and blue at least four

visual substances appear to be necessary ; and I think we must assume that all of
them are to be found in the same visual cell in the retina, and that the nerve

impulses which their decompositions give lise to are all transmitted through the

same optic fibres to the brain cells, there to produce a sense of uncoloured or

coloured light. Evidently such an hypothesis is not altogether novel ; it is essen-
tially a return to that long ago suggested by Newton. The only ditt'erence is that

light is supposed to induce photo-chemical changes in the retina, as Von Helmholtz
suggested, instead of mere mechanical vibration, as Newton supposed. But if in
the sense of smell nerve undulations are induced by mechanical vibrations of mole-

cules acting on delicate hairs at the ends of cells, is it, after all, so very unreasonable

to suppose that within each visual cell there may be different kinds of molecules that
vibrate in different modes when excited by ether waves ? Four or five sets of

such molecules in each terminal element in the retina would probably be sufficient to

project successively or simultaneously special forms of undulations through the optic

nerve, to induce colour sensations differing according to the wave form of the incoming

nerve undulation.

WeThe photo-chemical hypothesis has much in its favour.  know how

rapidly light can induce chemical change in photographic films, and Ave know

that light induces chemical change in the vision-purple in the outer segments of
the rod cells in the retina. The fact that the cones contain no vision-purple

is no argument against the theory, for the inner segment of both rod and cone

is by many regarded as the true nerve terminal, and there is no vision-purple
in either of them. The visual substances in the cones, at all events, are colour-
less, and the existence of them as substances capable of producing nerve impulses
hy chemical decomposition is as yet only a speculation awaiting proof. The

fatigue of the retina produced by bright light is best explained on a chemical

theory, tut it could also be explained on a mechanical theory, for we must remem-

ber tiiat, even if the nerve impulses produced in the visual cells were merely a

translation of the energy of light into vibration of nerve molecules, the nerve

impulse has to pass through layers of ganglionic cells before reaching the fibres of
the optic nerve, and in these cells it probably always induces chemical change.
The phenomena of partial colour-blindness could be explained on a photo-chemical
theory by supposing that it arises from the absence of the substances required to
produce the wave forms necessary for the colour sensation which is defective, but
the total colour-blindness at the anterior part of the retina is evidently a difficulty.

How could we have a sense of light irom that portion of the retina if all the visual

substances are absent ? That is one of the reasons why Ilering supposed that a

special visual substance is present everywhere in the retina, which by decomposition
gives rise to a sense of light as distinguished from colour. But even on the hypo-

thesis we are pursuing, it is not necessary to suppose that all visual substance is

absent, for the colour-blindness in the front of the retina could be explained by

i^upposing that colour perception has not been developed in the corresponding
portion of the vision centre, and consequently all nerve impulses coming from that
part of the retina produce scarcely anything more than a sense of light.

      If the photo-chemical theory is entertained, it seems necessary to suppose that
there is some singular relation between the pairs of substances which respectively
give rise to red and green, and yellow and blue, seeing that both members of a

pair frequenth', if not always, fail together.

     It seems to me that the great difficulty arises when we consider the puzzling

phenomena of contrast. If light of a particular wave length decomposes a special

substance, and gives rise to, say, a sense of red, why does the complementary

bluish-green sensation appear in the remainder of the vision centre ? If the induced
colour were a pure green, one might attempt to explain it by supposing that a

sympathetic change had been induced in a substance closely related to that suffer-

ing decomposition by the objective light, but no such simple explanation is
admissible ; the complementary contrast of red is not green, but a mixture of
green and blue. The inadmissibility of such an explanation becomes still more

apparent if we take pure green as the inducing colour-- the complementarj^ con-

trast that appears is purple, which involves a blue or violet, as well as a red

sensation. It matters not what inducing colour sensation we employ, the induced

contrast is always the complementary required to produce a sense of white.

George Wilson ' long ago suggested that simultaneous contrast probably arises
from a * polar manifestation of force ' ; indeed, he regarded it as a ' true, though
unrecognised, manifestation of polarity.' It is enough to mention that interesting

suggestion, but I must not pursue it, for we are dealing with a problem that has as

yet baffled the wit of man.
     I have placed before you a subject that involves physical and physiological

considerations of extreme difficulty. I have endeavoured to show the nature of
these diflSculties, and although I have not attempted to solve them all, I have at

all events sought to show reasons why we should refer our different colour sensa-

tions to differences in the nerve vibrations transmitted from the optic terminals
rather than to specifically different activities of cells in the vision centre. Although
I have no hesitation in adopting a tetrachromic in place of a trichromic theory of

--normal vision, I am unable to relinquish the essential part of Young's tlieorj- that

tl'.ere is a relatively small number of primary colour sensations. To abandon that
idea entirely, as Krenckel and Berry - have done, is to return to the Newtonian
theory, the difficulties of which none knew better than Thomas Young. I have not
found it an agreeable task to point out the shortcomhigs of some theories advanced

by those for whom I have the deepest regard ; but in the progress of scientific

thought it is especially necessary to keep our minds free from the thraldom of

      The nucleus of a cell about to divide undergoes the following changes :
      The hyaloplasniic structures become ultimately resolved into threads of ap-

proximately_ the same size. The chromatin or nuclein granules become nearly
uniform in size, and are grouped in single file along the threads or segments which
 thus constitute the nuclear segments or chromosomes of Boveri, the ' idants ' of

Weismauii. The file of granules next becomes double, probably owing' (o their

bipartition, and the nuclear segments widen out, as a preparation for splitting

between the two lines of granules.   The nuclear wall now disappears the nuclear
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

segments become grouped about the centre of the cell, constituting the 'equatorial

plate ' of Strasburger, the ' monastroid ' of Flemming, and the cytoplasm shows a

bipolar arrangement. Each segment splits into two secondary segments, one of

which goes to either pole of the cell, and the assemblage of these daughter seg-

ments receiving a wall constitutes the nucleus of the daughter cell. On their way

to the pole the daughter segments are usually /\-shaped wilh the apex in front,
and they frequently retain this shape for some time in the young nucleus, giving

it a polar or monaxlal structure. Kabl, who found traces of this an-angement

persist in the ' resting nucleus ' of the larval salamander, formed the generalisation

that the threads formed in an old nucleus on its 7»v/j>a>-«fi'ows for division are the
same as those which constituted it on its original formation ; and that where, this

arrangement is seeminf/ly lost in the 'resting nucleus^ definite paths exist along

which the errant granules return to their original stations to re-form identical

segments. This we may term Rabl's ' doctrine of the personality of the nuclear
segments.' On the assumption of the truth of this doctrine Weismann has based
a complex theory of heredity, fully and finally developed in his essay on Amphi-
mixis but despite its ingenuity it must fall if Rabls doctrine is not proved. But

                                ;

Rabl's doctrine has never commanded the universal assent of histologists, and Ihe

author's researches have yielded additional evidence against it. He adduces the

following arguments :

     1. The resting nucleus, in the vast majority of cases, shows no trace of polar
structure, but a network of protoplasm which is either impregnated witb

chromatin, or bears on its  threads  chromatin  granules of irregular size                                                                                                                     and this
                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

network, granules and all, is probably in constant motion. Such a nucleus,

characteristic of tissue cells and most brood-mother cells, such as ovarian ova, &c.,

is sometimes found even between successive brcod divisions. Hence we infer that

Rabl's polar type of nucleus is characteristic not of the resting state but of the

absence of it, the preparations for a new division supervening before the nucleus
has as it were settled down from its constitution.

2. In the pollen mother cells of Tradescantia spp., on their first division, the

segments undergo changes (now first described by the author) during the recon-

stitution of the nucleus, which give no support to Rabl's doctrine.

o. In the resting nucleus of the ordinary type there is no indication of a path

by which the granules could return to their primitive position.

4. The chromatin granules themselves should have a personality if Rabl's

doctrine be correct ; but in the ordinary resting nucleus they are subject to increase

--and decrease of size, probably appearance and disappearance phenomena which

make their personality doubtful.

     5. In certain cases of brood-cell formation, not all the segments of the equa-
torial plate are divided between two equivalent daughter nuclei. In Hemerocallis
fulva some segments pass laterally to form one or more lateral nuclei (Stras-

burger). In Tradescantia some segments may be retarded, and stay in the cyto-
plasm (as now shown by the author). On Rabl's doctrine the personality of the

pollen grains should be defective, with a corresponding result in the offspring; on
Weismann's theory these groups should evince increased variability, but neither

anomaly has been observed.
     6. The nucleus of the brood-mother cell of most gametes on its first division

presents a number of segments which is half of the number that constituted the
nucleus on its formation. As the mitosis is often in all other respects normal,
this process of ' reduction ' is irreconcilable with Rabl's doctrine, and Weismann's
explanations based on purely hypothetical differences from ordinary mitosis are

inadmissible.

     7. In some cases a cell on its mitosis presents a greater number of segments
than those which constituted its nucleus on formation. Thus in the embryo-sac
oi Lilium the first mitosis shows twelve nuclear segments; but the second mitosis
shows sixteen in the lower cell, while the upper repeats twelve segments. Such
                              --

nuclear ' augmentation ' is as inexplicable on Rabl's doctrine as the ' reduction '
described in (6).

     The author concludes that Eabl's doctrine of the personality of the nuclear
segments is not itself firmly enough established to serve as the foundation of any

wide-reaching theory.

     The following Papers were read :

                                     Defartment of Botany.

     A1. Proposed World's Congress of Botanists at Chicago in 1593.

                                  By Dr. J. C. Aethub.

                2. Ohservations on Secondary Tissues in Monocotyledons.

         By D. H. Scott, M.A., Ph.D., F.L.8., and George Brebner.

      1. Origin of secondary tracheides in Draccena and Yucca.

    Two contradictory views have been held on this question. On the one hand

Krabbe, Roseler, and Strasburger maiutain that these elements are true tracheides,

each arising from the elongation of a single cambial cell. On the other hand Kny,

Mdlle. Loven, and Wieler regard them as short vessels arising by the fusion of a
series of cambial cells. To this view one of tlie authors of the paper (Dr. Scott)

formerly inclined.

    A more complete investigation has, however, shown that the appearances

of cell-fusion are illusory, and that each tracheide develops simply by the enor-
mous growth in length of one cell. The nucleus usually remains undivided. The
tracheides have been observed, both in sections and in macerated preparations, at
all stages of their growth. The definite decision of this point is of interest, as
establishing some of the most striking instances of ' sliding growth.' These
tracheides often grow to forty times their original length, and that in a region
which, as a whole, undergoes no elongation. Thus the whole room required for
the growth of these elements has to be provided by mutual displacement of cells.

     2. Growth in thickness of the roots of Drnccena.

    When a cambium arises outside the vascular bundles it is usually formed in the
pericycle. In these roots we have a conspicuous exception to the rule, for here it

is quite common for the cambium to appear in the cortex, outside the endodermis.
In Dracana Draco, D./ragrans, and Z>. ensifolia the authors found that the cam-
bium is often formed in the cortex at once, without any previous pericyclic develop-
ment. The two modes of growth, however, often occur side by side, or combined

in the most irregular manner. Connecting vascular bundles, passing through the
endodermis, were often observed.

    A new point of importance is that in most cases observed, the secondary growth

starts from the insertion of a rootlet, advancing upwards and downwards, as well

as peripherally, from this place. At and near the insertion of the rootlet the cam-
bium is always pericyclic; at a distance from it cortical cambium begins to appear,
while at a still greater distance the pericyclic cambium disappears, and the forma-

tion of secondary tissues is limited to the cortex.
      3. Secondary thickening in Iridacece.

     The authors are not aware that any example of this has been described before.
Their attention was called by Professor Bower to the occurrence of secondary
thickening in Aristea corymbosa, Ait., an iridaceous shrub. The process has now
been fully investigated, and agrees generally with the Ih-acana type. The young
stem of Aristea is flattened in the plane of the distichous and equitant leaves.
The primary vascular cylinder is thus narrowly elliptical in transverse section.
                     TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                     745

The primary development ceases for a considerable time before the cambium appears.
The formation of secondary tissue is at first most active at the sides of the cylinder.
At its narrow edges the process begins later, and for a long time is less active.
Hence the vascular cylinder gradually acquires a circular transverse section. The
secondary vascular bundles are concentric ; their xylem consists chiefly of long
tracheides, -which have a tortuous course, and arise, like those of Dracana and

 Yucca, by the elongation of single cells.
     Here, as in other Monocotyledons, the cambium does not form a single initial

layer of cells, but rather constitutes a secondary meristematic zone in which

several layers may successively take up the cambial divisions.

     The first -formed periderm is external at the sides, internal at the prominent
edo-es of the flattened stem. This helps to give the older stem a cylindrical form.

     At a later stage successive interniil periderms arise, and soon the whole of the
primary corte.x is thrown oil". This is meanwhile replaced by the formation of
abundant secondary cortex on the outer side of the cambial zone. The outer

layers of the secondary cortex also are successively cut off as bark.
      It is evident that a process of secondary growth of the same general type has

appeared independently in several distinct groups of Monocotyledons.

3. On, tlie Simplest Form of Mosses. By Professor Dr. Goebel, For.F.L.S.

Since Hofmeister's researches proved that the moss sporogonium is the homo-

logue of the leafy spore-forming fern-plant, and the sexual moss-plant is the

Lomologue of the fern prothallus, it has been the endeavour of many morphologists to

discover how the transition from the moss sporogonium to the fern-plant took place.

These eflorts have, however, led to no result. They started from the assumption

Mythat vascular cryptogams sprang from moss-like ancestors.        investigations

early led me to regard such a view as erroneous, and to the conclusion that mosses

and ferns do not stand in direct genetic connection, but have been derived from a

common stock. The character of this alga-like ancestor we must seek for in the

sexual generation, whilst the asexual generation in the moss series and in the fern

series has developed differently.

Now we see the sexual generation of the moss beginning as a simple structure
-- -- Athe protouema often mistaken for a filamentous alga.
                                                             similar structure is

found in the prothallus of Hyuienophyllere, and in the beginning of the development

in the prothallus of most other ferns. The moss-plants arise out of the protonema

as lateral shoots. They were originally only the supports of the sexual organs, for

the protection of which envelopes were formed. If, now, the sexual organs were

developed, not coincidently with the formation of the moss-stem, but only at a

later period, then the envelopes of the sexual organs might serve for assimilation

as leaves, and thus might arise the moss-plant as we have it now.

The simplest moss-plant was, then, one in which the sexual organs were seated

on the protonema, surrounded by one or several leaf-like envelopes. Such a form

has hitherto been hypothetical, but I have had the good fortune to discover its

existence in Buxbaumia.
     The male plants of this moss are of a wonderfully simple character, and corre-

spond exactly with the hypothetical form just referred to. From primary delicate

protonema-threads a thicker branch takes origin, at the end of which is a single
antheridium, long-stalked like that of a liverwort, and corresponding otherwise in

form with that of liverworts.
     Around this antheridium is a curved shell-like envelope, which has no chloro-

phyll, and difters also from other known moss-leaves in the arrangement of its
cells, there being no two-sided apical cell. No stem is formed, the only indication
of it being the formation of one or two oblique segment walls in the cell beneath

the leaf-insertion.

The female plant is more highly developed, as one would expect from a bio-

logical point of view. The formation of the embryo demands a considerable food
Aeupply, and therefore a cell mass of some bulk must be developed.
                                                                    similar

arrangement to the one I describe is seen in the filamentous prothalli of the
            --

746 EEPOKT-- 1892,

Hymenophyllere, in wliicli the antheridia are directly sessile on tlie filaments,
wiiilst the archegonia stand upon a ciisbion of cell-tissue, the archegoniophore, pro-
duced by the division in a longitudinal direction of a prothallus-filament. This

female plant in Buxhaumia is an archegoniophore, with envelopes composed of a
number of leaf-like structures without chlorophyll, which correspond with the
single envelope leaf of the male plant. Only one archegonium is developed.

     The sexual generation of Buxbaumia possesses, then, an extremely simple con-

struction, and in my opinion exhibits the nearest approach known to the ancestral

form of the mosses. One might, of course, conjecture that this simplicity of con-
struction is a reduction from a more complex ; hut against this view may be urged
that Buxbaumia possesses characters which separate it from the other mosses, and
which remind us of the liverworts, chiefly of a low stage in development. These

characters are :

     1. Form of antheridium ; which is very different from that of Bryineoe, and
corj-esponds with that of many liverworts.

     2. The arrangement of the cells in the leaf.
     3. The fact that the marginal cells of the leaf normally grow out into proto-
nema-threads, which shows that the leaves are merelj^ expanded protonemata, an
assumption which is supported by other facts.
     The author believes, then, that Buxbaumia has preserved in its sexual genera-
tion the primitive characters, and is a very old type.

              4. On the Cause of Phi/siological Action at a Distance.
                         By Professor L. Errera (Brussels).

     Most vegetable organs .are sensitive to the influences of their environment, and
respond to these stimuli, as long as they are capable of growth by bending in
a definite direction. In fact, they generally i'eel asymmetrical distribution of
matter or energy around them. Thus the geotropic, heliotropic, hydrotropic,
haptotropic curvatures arise which are familiar to vegetable physiologists.

     But the very interesting phenomena described two years ago by Elfving did
not appear to belong to any of the known categories, and led this distinguished
botanist to the assumption of a new force revealing itself by ' physiological action

at a distance,' as he terms it.

     He found that pieces of iron, and to a less degree of zinc or aluminium, as well

-- --as different organic substances sealing-wax, rosin, roots of living plants attract

the growing, sporangium-bearing filaments of P/n/comi/ces nitens, a well-known
fungus belonging to the Mucorini. All other metals tried by Elfving were in-
active, whereas the filaments of Phycomyces itself showed a mutual repulsion.

      The latter fact, which I had often observed, I always ascribed to negative
hydrotropism. So the question arose whether the attractions discovered by
Elfving are not due to a similar cause. For, just as we know that a surface
which emits moisture repels the Phtjcomyces filaments, it seemed probable that
moisture-absorbing substances should produce the reverse efiect and attract them.
IVow iron certainly absorbs aqueous vapour whilst rusting, and its peculiar action
on Phycomyces might thus be simply a case of hydrotropism.

      I have tested this view by a great number of experiments, and I submit for
the inspection of tlie members of this section photographs showing the behaviour
of Phycomyces towards different substances. This theory enables one not only to
explain the known facts, but it also permits one to predict unknown ones.

      It is easy to demonstrate that any modification of iron which lessens its capa-
city of rusting at the same time diminishes its attraction on Phycomyces : polished
steel scarcely attracts, and nickelled steel does not do so at all.

      China clay, which is very hygroscopic, attracts energetically, but china exhibits
no attraction. One of the most striking instances is that of agate and rock-crystal.
 Although both are essentially formed of silica, the Japanese physicist Ihmori ' has
shown that the former is very hygroscopic, whereas the latter is not so. And, .18
·was to be foreseen, agate strongly attracts the I'hyconiyces, though rock-c)'ystal

is perfectly iuactive. I might quote many similar facts, if iicccssaiy. Thus, sul-

phuric acid, sulphate of copper, &c., are strongly attractive. Certain bodies

which are onlv moderately hygroscopic, as white soap, lose or gam moisture

according to the degree of 'dampness uf the surrounding atmosphere; and in the

lirst case they repel Phycomyces, in the second they attract.

     The sensibility of Pliycoviyces is, in fact, so great that it may_ actually be used
as a reagent to test the existence of hygroscopic power. Having noticed that
camphoi-'very distinctly attracts the fiiameuts, and thymol does not (although
both of these substances have a deleterious action on them), 1 could anticipate
that camphor is hygroscopic--a fact which, though unknown to chemists, was

confirmed bv careful weighing.

     Lastly, the theory may be tested in another way. Differing from lilaments ot

Thycomyces, roots of higher plants are positively hygroscopic. Then, as might be

expected, they bend away from iron instead of being attracted by it.
     All these experiments succeed also in a saturated atmosphere, which shows

that hydrotropism is not due, as generally admitted, to differences in the hygro-
metric" state of the air. But the discussion of this point, as well as certain deduc-
tions relative to the physical phenomenon of hygroseopicity, must be reserved for a

detailed paper on this subject.

     To sum up the general results : the apparently mysterious action ol iron on

riiyavmyces is nothing but a matter of hydrotropism ; and hydrotropism itself
(negativ'e or positive) is the bending of a vegetable organ towards the points, not

where it will find a minimum or maximum of moisture, but where it will, within

certain limits, transpire most or least.

specimens, the development of which was watched and figured by the writer, from

that of a single frond until it had increased to a connected colony ot six.
     The=e observations seemed to point to the fact that this duckweed, as a general

rule, produces two buds only, the first being usually from the right side, and the
second from the left ; thougli exceptions occur in both cases, and there are other

     From this it would appear that the p^roup usually breaks up when the fourth

frond has been produced, thus explaining the comparatively few groups of five
which are to be found. It would also account for the large number of pairs found
during this month, and perhaps for the fact that there are more than twice as

many pairs consisting of fronds with a right-hand bud as of pairs where the bud
k on the left ; for although the detaching of the right pair would temporarily

leave a left-handed pair, this would soon be altered by the left young frond
budding and pushing off the parent weed.

     After other remarks upon the tethering filament which appears at the base of
certain fronds in order to attach them loosely to the parent frond, and disappears
shortly after they are separated, with an account of experiments with duckweeds
grown in the dark, and others which continued to throw out buds, after being
tlivided in half, the paper concluded with the following questions presented for the
consideration of the botanical members of tlie Section :

     1. As to the number of buds produced by a single frond of Lemna minor .''
     2. The order and position of the buds ?
     3. The use of the connecting filament ?
     4. The absorption or destruction of the connecting thread after separation ?
     5. The explanation of the comparative number of fronds found connected, as

eliown in the table above ?

            I, Vital Absorption. By Professor E. "\Yayjiouth Reid.

     As a result of the researches of Dutrochet, the causation of the movement of
fluids through membranes in the animal body was considered to be entirely due to
osmotic action up till about the middle of the present century. The researches of
Briicke, Liebig, Ludwig, Graham, Fick, Eckhard, and others, bear witness of the

painstaking labour that has been spent upon the determination of osmotic equiva-
lents and diffusion rapidities. It was found, however, that with variation in the
kind of membrane used, and its state at the time of experiment, great variations
in the results made themselves manifest. In 1845 was publislied by Matteucci and

Cima a series of e.xperiments with skins of frog, eel and torpedo, and various mam-

malian mucous membranes, in which it was shown that, provided the membrane
was fresh, the direction of easier osmotic transfers varied with the facing of the
membrane towards the solutions employed for experiment, and it was found that
this peculiarity only existed so Ions* as the membrane was perfectly fresh.

     Later experiments with the bladder by Susini, using potassium ferrocyanide, and

Cazeneuve and Livon, using urea, have shown how greatly the phenomena of difl'u-

eion through the wall are etiected by the state of the lining epithelium. Tappeiner's
experiments upon the absorption of bile salts from the dog's intestine, and those of
Lannois and L(5pine upon the absorption of glucose and peptone, have pointed
clearly to the fact that the phenomena of intestinal absorption receive no clear
explanation upon the old osmotic hypothesis.

     Still more recently in Heideuhain's laboratory the work of Rohmann, and also
that of Gumilewsky, has done more to show the necessity of discarding the physical
explanation that so long seemed to meet the conditions of the case.

      The consideration, too, of the changes that are wrought upon substances in
process of absorption, such as the regeneration of albumen from peptone, pointed
out by Salvioli, Hoft'meister, and Neumeister, and the synthesis of fat when fatty
acid is supplied, demonstrated by Immanuel Munk, forces us to view the phe-
nomena of absorption in the organism from the vital and chemical rather than from
the purely physical standpoint.

     Three years ago, in experiments directed to determine how far the physiological
·condition of a membrane can affect the magnitude of an ordinary osmotic stream
caused to pass through it, I found, when using the skin of the frog freshly removed,
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                           749

and taking precautions that the fluids in contact -with it should have as little
deleterious action as was possible under the conditions of the experiment, that the-
direction of easier osmotic transfer was from the outer towards the inner surface,
the reverse of the direction of easier filtration in dead skin as demonstrated by

Cima.

Contrasting, too, the action of fluids tending to preserve tissue life with that

of those tending to destroy it, I found that while the skin was more permeable from

·without inwards so long as the fluids employed did not kill its tissues, yet so soon

as a fluid was used that tended to destroy life, as, for instance, pure water, thats

then the direction of easier osmotic transfer was that of easier filtration in dead

skin, i.e., from within outwards. I concluded that a vital absorptive action existed

in the living skin, by virtue of which it was able to aid the osmotic stream if sucb

stream were passing in the direction from witliout inwards, for in such case the

vital and physical stream would be in the same direction. If, however, the osmotic

stream were passing in the direction from within outwards, being then contrary to

the direction of the vital cui-rent, it would undergo a retardation. This hypothesis

was much strengthened by the action of stimulant and depressant drugs upon the
Amagnitude of the osmotic current through the living skin.
                                                            stimulant, such as

weak alcohol, was found to increase the magnitude of a stream passing from with-

out inwards, i.e., in the normal direction of absorption ; while, on the other hand,

it diminished that of a stream caused to pass from within outwards, for here the

opposing vital action was against the physical stream, while in the former case it

had been with it.
     Using chloroform as a depressant I obtained exactly reverse effects ; with this

substance a stream set up from witliout inwards was diminished, wliile one passing
iu the reverse direction was increased.

     The crucial test of tlie hypothesis of vital absorptive force is to place exactlp
the same fluid upon either .«ide of a living membrane, and to obtain evidence of
transference of fluid across it in the normal direction of absorption in the body.
This I have succeeded in doing with the skin of the frog by means of a special
apparatus. I have suspended the skin between two layers of baudruche soaked in
normal saline solution, and have seen a stream of normal saline pass across from
the outer to the inner surface. With dead skin no such effect occurs, but only

imbibition at both surfaces. This action does not appear to be of electro-osmotia

origin.

     With the intestine of the rabbit it has also been found possible to demonstrate
vital absorptive action. Here the same apparatus and method have been employed

as in the experiments with the skin of the frog. It is necessary for success that
the loop of intestine selected for experiment shall be in full digestive activity as
judged by the state of its lacteals, blood vessels, and contents. Here, again, with
normal saline on either side of a piece of exsected gut, it is possible to get evidence
of a stream passing from within outwards so long as the tissues are alive. Scraping

oti" the epithelium diminishes the transfer or puts a stop to it.

     Furthermore, by adding pilocarpine to the fluids used it is possible to reverse^
the direction of the stream, so that instead of a current passing from within out-
wards one may artificially produce one passing from without inwards ; in fact, a

piece of absorbing mucous membrane may have its action swamped by the

induction of an excess of secretory action.
      It is claimed for these experiments that they are positive as regards the occur-

rence of vital absorption instead of inereh/ negative as regards osmotic absorption^
as has been the case with tlie results of previous observers.

                2. On Animal Heat and Physiological Calorimetry.
                        By Professor Rosenthal, of Erlangen.

    To measure the amount of heat given out by a living animal is very difficult,
because the common water calorimeter is not suitable for this purpose. Professor
Rosenthal therefore chose the air calorimeter, first invented by Scharhng and
                      -- --a

recently adopted by D'Arsonval. He described sliortly the apparatus coustructed

by himself, and gave a brief account of some of the results he obtained by his
experiments. These extend to the heat-production in different conditions of the

normal state and of fever. As to the latter, he found that heat-production is not
augmented in fever produced by injection of putrid matters. But in a few
experiments he made on men he found a small aiigmentation ; and so he thinks
that there are two types of fever with different causes of rising temperature.

    Among the other objects of his investigations he principally mentioned the

connection between nutrition and heat-production. According to his i-esearches
there is no strict proportion between the two, because the mixture of materials
burnt in the body changes from hour to hour. After a rich meal the heat-produc-

tion rises to a maximum point, falls then very rapidly, and is nearly constant

tetween the thirteenth and twenty-fourth hour. It is nearly the same with the
expiration, of carbonic acid. But the changes of both functions are not quite
proportional to each other. The expiration of carbonic acid rises more quickly,

and reaches its maximum point earlier. So the ratio between both functions
varies. And this is also the case in animals differently nourished, and in cases

where heat-production changes in consequence of variations of the outer tempera-
ture or of muscular action. The combined investigation of heat-production and
of the expired carbonic acid enables us to understand better the chemical processes
going on in the system. The changing ratio between both shows that the mixture
of materials oxidised in the body varies from hour to hour. Therefore it was
impossible to find a strict accordance between heat-production and excretion until
the new method enabled one to measure the heat produced during long periods
of time, and to show exactly that animal heat also is produced only by oxidation,
and that the law of the conservation of energy is true for the living body as in all

other cases of combustion.

               Bij A. LocKHAiiT GiLLESPii;, M.B., CM., F.R.C.P.E.

     In applying this name to the r/ebundene Salzsiiure of the German writers, the
author seeks to accentuate the part proteids play in the combination. His views
with regard to them are as follows :

     All proteid substances have an affinity for hydrochloric acid. The lower
proteids in the series combine with a greater percentage of IICl than the higher.
The percentage varies from per cent, in the case of acid albumen to 18 or 20 per
cent, in peptone. The greater affinity which the lower proteids have for hydro-
chloric acid compared with the higher may indicate the mode of their formation.

     the Prqfcssur of Plydulogij in the Uitiversittj of Edinhnrgh.

This organ is a lobulated. bilateral, brownish-yellow structure, situated chiefly

in the axillary, thoracic, cervical, and dorsal regions. It derives its nervous supply

from the cutaneous branches of the cervical and upper intercostal nerves, in

connection with which a ganglion is developed in the axillary region. Its vascular

supply is obtained from the corresponding branches of the cervical and intercostal

arteries, and from the inferior thyroid artery.

The organ is quite distinct from the thymus gland, though its cervical lobes

come into intimnte relation with the latter.

The size of the organ varies with the period of the year; it attains its maximum

dimension in October, i.e., just at the commencement of hibernation, and its
minimum shortly after the animal has awakened from winter sleep.

Each lobe is surrounded by a fibrous capsule, from which septa pass inwards,

dividing it into lobules: in these septa the blood-vessels and nerves ramify. In

the fully formed organ the lobules consist of rounded or polyhedral cells of vary-

ing size from 23 yi to 34 ^ in diameter; each cell consists of a granular mass of

protoplasm exhibiting a fine wide meshed protoplasmic network, interrupted here;

and there by droplets of fat that varj' considerably in size in different cases; in

the centre of the cell is a spherical nucleus measuring 5 /x to 7 w in diameter, so

rich in chromatin that the contained nucleolus is almost invisible in stained

Apreparations. The cell is surrounded by a definite though thin cell wall.  few-

cells contain two nuclei. The cells appear to arise at the margins of the develop-

ing lobules from small granular, unnucleated connective tissue corpuscles, which

divide again and asraiu, similar in appearance to those that give rise to adipose

tissue generally. These cells gradually enlarge, their protoplasmic network be-

coming more and more distinct presently tiny droplets of fat make their appear-
                                                                                                                                                                              ;

ance at difterent points in the cell, which go on increasing in size with the growth

of the cell, and which may or may not run together to form large fat droplets.

The fat, however, never increases to such an extent as to completely fill the cell, a

large part of the protoplasm, usually the peripheral portion, always remaining

altogether free from it; the nucleus, around which most of the droplets are

irregularly arranged, remains in the ceutre of the cell. Owing to the increase in

size, the cells which are at first rounded become polyhedral from mutual pressure.

The cells are always readily distinguishable from ordinary fat cells, of which many
may be developed in the fibrous capsule of the organ.

Parallel with the increase in number and size of the cells there is an increase

in the capillary blood-vessels, w'hich multiply to produce a rich plexus between the

cells, much in the same way as in adipose tissue generally. The veins accompany

the arteries in their distribution. The ganglion found in connection with the

axillary part of the organ consists of small closely packed unipolar nerve cella
       ----

       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                              753

similar to those of peripheral g-anglia generally, except in that they possess no
special envelope lined by endothelial cells. It is worthy of note that the large
arteries of the organ exhibit a fine nerve plexus between their middle and internal
coats, similar to and directly continuous with that ordinarily described between the
middle and outer coats of larger blood-vessels generally.

    If the organ be examined in March, r>., towards the close of hibernation, many

of the cells will be seen to exhibit remarkable changes.
     These changes appear to start in the nuclei, which begin to swell, assume a

more completely spherical shape, lose some of their chromatin, and so reveal certain

changes in the nucleolus which can now be seen to contain one or more colourless

endo-nucleoli ; from this nucleolus there are given off from time to time para-
nucleoli, which pass gradually towards the periphery of the nucleus, meanwhile in-

creasing in size, and presently find their way through the nuclear membrane into the
surrounding protoplasm, where they break down and disappear; as the nucleus
becomes more and more devoid of chromatin more of these bodies are produced,
only one or two at a time, however, which, after piercing the wall, break down in

the protoplasm ; finally, the nucleolus itself passes towards the periphery of the
nucleus, applies itself to the nuclear membrane, causing it to bulge somewhat at one
point, through which it eventually passes into the surrounding protoplasm, to break

down there just as the para-nucleoli have already done. After the passage through

it of the nucleolus, the nuclear bag, still containing a few strands of chromatin,
collapses and finally also disappears.

     Whilst these changes are going on in the nucleus, the fat stored in the cell
is gradually absorbed, and eventually entirely disappears ; the cell wall disappears,
and the protoplasm also exhibits changes ; its network becomes less distinct, the finer
strands seeming to give way, producing a finely granular appearance throughout

the cell, amongst which a peculiar coagulable colloid-looking material may some-
times be seen which finds its way into the capillaries, and thence into the veins,

where it appears in hardened preparations as a uniform hyaline mass with the red
blood corpuscles imbedded in it. This material is not of the nature of glycogen,
but possibly rather allied to lecithin. Eventually the whole cell disappears.

      This change does not occur in all the cells simultaneously, but in groups of
cells here and there, giving rise in those places in which it has been going on for
some time to an appearance of greater vascularity, owing to the capillaries
formerly separated by large cells gradually coming together as the intervening
cell mass is absorbed.

    By this process the very voluminous body present at the commencement of
hibernation gradually dwindles away to almost nothing soon after the animal

awakes from its winter sleep.

5. The Functions, Staining Beadions, and Structure of Nuclei.

                     By GusTAV Mann, M.B.G.M.

     The author holds the following views :
     1. The nuclear chromatin segments are organs for the transformation of simple-
into more complex compounds.
     2. The nucleolus is a storehouse for material which has been elaborated by the

nuclear segments.

     These views are supported by the position of nuclei and nucleoli relatively to
their cell walls and the supply of food, as seen in the vegetable kingdom in the
sporangia of Tmesipteris, Selaginella, the embryo-sac of Angiosperms, &c. ; and as
readily demonstrated in the animal kingdom in the ganglion cells of the retina,
during the development of the chick, in the alimentary canal of the salamander, &c.

First, the activities of animals have to be carefully observed as objective phenomena.

Secondly, our own mental processes have to be carefully observed, and cautious

inductions have to be drawn therefrom. Finally, the objective phenomena

reached by the first process of observation have to be interpreted in terms of the

conclusions reached through the application of the second process. Naturalists

are too apt to forget that the second process is as essential as the first, and that to

do good work in comparative psychology it is necessary to be a psychologist.

Neither process of observation can be omitted if results of scientific value are to be

reached, for both are of co-ordinate importance.

Psychological analysis is beginning to make clear the nature of the feeling and

perception of relations. It also discloses that there is a well-marked contrast

between (1) the mere feeling or practical awareness of relations, and (2) the definite
perception or cognition of relationships. The former is the foundation of practical

skill; the latter is the foundation of explanation and knowledge. The former is

manifested in the  simple  psychical  life of  external  perception                                            the latter involves

introspection and reflection.

In the higher animals there is abundant evidence of ability to feel and respond

to relations, and of wonderful practical skill based on direct experience. There is

little or no evidence of the perception or cognition of the relations, of introspection,

or of reflection. It is well to restrict the words ' reason ' and ' rational ' to the latter

process. Animals are certainly intelligent ; they may be rational.

      Mitosis in the Larval Salamander. Bij J. E. S. Mooke, A.B.C.S.

      Bond.

     The existence of the ' Nebenkern ' as a frequent cellular constituent has been
pointed out by a variety of authors whose descriptions relate to vertebrates and
invertebrates alike, but hitherto certain elements of confusion, arising from the
simultaneous description of other bodies, obviously heterogeneous and foreign, have

relegated this structure to a position of only secondary importance in cellular
anatomy.

     Our most accurate knowledge of the ' Nebenkern ' is derived from Platner's
admirable description of its origin and metamorphosis in the spermatocytes of
Heli.r, where it plays so marked a part in the indirect division of the cell.

     Hermann's more recent description of an archoplasmic body in the sperma-
tocytes of the salamander, and his institution of a probable homology between this,
the 'Nebenkern,' and the 'sphere attractive' of Van Beneden, renders the possible
extension of these observations to other kinds of cells a matter of primary interest
to those desirous of embracing under some more general formula the varied
phenomena of mitosis.

     The duplication of the spheres in Ascaris, as compared with the single archo-
plasmic body in the spermatocytes of Salamandra ; the invariable appearance and
relationship' of a central body or bodies, of the ' medullary corpuscle ' and outer
' archoplasm ' in the former ; and the frequent absence of ' medulhuy zones,'
central body, or both, from the archoplasm of the latter, are considerations
antagonistic to the desii-ed demonstration of the above homology.

    Much of this confusion is dispersed by discoveries in the embryonic genital
ridge of the salamander. In this tissue the archoplasmic body is much more
definite than in the spermatocytes, and may become duplicated, as in the ' spheres

attractives ' of Ascaris.
      It presents a serial metamorphosis identical with that of the spermatocytes of

Helix. During certain phases of this, the relationships of the central body, zone,
and archoplasm are identical with those existing in the spheres of Ascaris.

     The interest and significance of the above observations are greatly increased by

the discovery of an archoplasm (' Nebenkern,' ' sphere attractive ') in certain

phases of the life history of tlie leukocytes in the same amphibian larvaj. The
existence of the archoplasm (' Nebenkern ') in the cells constituting the uuditTereu-

 tiated genital ridge of the salamander shows that it is not specially related to the
 spermatocytes ; while its appearance in cells so obviously primitive as the

 leukocytes proves it to be in no way specially connected with the reproductive

 elements, and suggests that it should be regarded rather as a normal constituent
of the resting cell.

      The ' attraction sphere ' of Flemming cannot represent in ioto those described
 above, as it consists of a central body (or bodies) and its immediate radiation only,
apart from anything analogous to the detinite archoplasm which Hermann
describes. The complicated origin attributed to the spindle in the mutually
 irreconcilable descriptions of previous authors is, moreover, much simplified by the
study of the cells in the same genital ridge. The intim.ate connection between the
' Nebenkern ' and spindle described by Platner in the spermatocytes of Helix ia
most strikingly borne out during the metamorphosis of these cells. The central
 bodies become duplicated ; the two halves recede from one another through the
archoplasm, whose mass elongates in the direction of their motion.

      The delicate external radii of the cell mass follow the central bodies as specific

centres while en route to the polar extremities of the archoplasm; until, simul-
taneously with their arrival in this position, these radii assume the characters of
the well-known astral radiations.

     The whole spindle is formed from the intervening archoplasmic mass, and

apparently from nothing else.
      So soon as the constriction to form the daughter-cells becomes apparent, the

expanded spindle fibres collect around the intermediate bodies of Flemming, and
by their fusion regenerate an archoplasm on either side of the last division planes
of the cells. The central bodies enter into a secondary connection with these new
archoplasms, travelling up the fibres which remain between them and the concavi-
ties of the daughter nuclei. It thus appears that in these various cells of the
 vertebrate (Salamondra) Platner's generalisation with respect to the cells of the
invertebrate {Helix), that ' zwischen Kniiuelgeriist, Spindelfasern imd Nebenkern
ein genetischer Zusammenhang existirt,' is strikingly extended and borne out.

           G. The Origin of Sex. By Gcistav Mann, M.B., G.M.^

     AVhile studying the origin of sex, two distinct points must always be kept in

--view first, the origin of sexual cells ; and secondly, the physiological cause

determining the sex of potential sexual cells.

     With Ryder and Hartog the author believes that sexual cells are derived from
* Zoosporangia,' as a common origin of male and female cells seems to be proved by
the reduction in the number of chromatin segments which occurs in both male and

female cells previously to the act of fecundation.

     The author holds, further, that any condition unfavourable to a ready assimila-
1 ion of food will produce a male organism ; while, reversely, any condition favouring-

the assimilation of food will tend to produce a female organism.
      Conjugation of two cells is, then, equivalent to the new-formation of one cell

thus constituted, that a common trophic centre is formed which is capable of exert-

ing its influence over the various oi-gans, and that its organs are able to maintaia
the trophic centre by satisfying its chemical affinities i.e., its hunger.

     The author does not believe, therefore, the active male cell to effect the restoration
of the equilibrium, as manifested by the division of the passive female cell, by acting
either as a ferment (v. Sachs), or by simply doubling the amount of chromatin in
the female cell (Strasbm-ger, Weismann, Eyder), or by being the carrier of
katastates ((leddes and Thomson), or by restoring the susceptibility of the female
nucleus to stimuli from its own cytoplasm (Hartog) ; nor have we digestion of the

                               By J. Beard, M.Sc, Ph.D.

     Starting from the fact that two common types of development have hitherto

-- --heen recognised viz., larval, with metamorphosis, and festal, or direct the author

attempted to show that all Metazoa above Coelenterata developed through the
intermediation of a larva, and, in fact, upon the latter. This was indeed known to
be the case in a great many forms, and in others traces of a larva could always be
detected. The great influences which led to the disguising of the larva wei-e
shown to be either the lading of the larva with food-yolk, or its acquirement of a
parasitic life within the parent form. The former adaptation led to a loss of
motor and some other organs on the part of the larva, while the latter tended to
its degradation and degeneration, as in all fixed internal parasites.

     Even in mammals traces of a larva might be met with in the amnion and yolk-

sac placenta, and additional reasons were adduced for a belief that here also the
development took place upon a larva. This was rendered more probable by the
reflection that a fixed internal parasite never could and never did develop to a higher

organisation, such as that which the mammal attained, but that the parasitic larva

might become degenerated and yet give rise to the higher organism which
developed upon it.

     The researches of Kleinenberg {Lopadorhynchus) and Kennel (Peripatus) were
cited, and their views on the mode of development of some invertebrates were
stated to be in close agreement with those enunciated by the author.

     It was urged that the recapitulation theory was no explanation of the phe-

--nogiena of embryology at best, it held good to a limited extent for the ontogeny

of certain organs.

     The views of the author led him to regard Metazoan development as a sort of

alternation of generations.

o 0)1 the Origin of the Electric Nerves in the Torj^edo, Oymnotus, Mormyrus,

                and Malopterurus. By Professor Gustav Fritsch.

     The author directed attention to the organisation of the electric fishes, with the
purpose of throwing some more light on certain general questions relating to the
functions and structure of the elements in the nervous system.

     There are two kinds of electrical organs found hitherto, one originating from
modified muscles, as in Torpedo, Gymnotus, Mormyrus, and Raja; the other
                                                                                                                                            a

758 REPORT-- 1892.

belonging to the cutaneous system, most likely transformed gland-cells of tlie skin,
which are found in Malopterurus.

     In the nervous apparatus, to make these organs act according to the impulse
given by the will of the fish, there are found in every instance wonderfully developed
ganglion-cells, from which the impulse passes directly to the electrical organs. In
all the cases where the electrical organs are of a true muscuhxr character the

ganglion-cells send out well-defined, not branched, axis cylinders, one from each

cell, which may easily be traced into the anterior roots of the spinal cord or

medidla oblongata. These cells are more or less plentiful just as the nerve fibres
arising from them are.

     In the cutaneous organs of Malopterurus there are only two ganglion-cells for
innervation, one on each side, and only one nerve fibre belonging to each cell.
That fibre does not rise from the cell-protoplasm as a true axis cylinder, but is
formed by a combination of protoplas'mic processes at a certain distance from the
giant ganglion-cell. The electric current in the latter case has the opposite direc-
tion from that in the former.

     It should also be kept in mind that in many other cases, not concerned with

the electric fishes, peculiar ganglion-cells are found where peculiar functions of the
nervous system occur. For instance, large ganglion-cells are found in the motor

region of tlie brain, first seen by Betz, who looked for them on purpose to state

--anatomically the laws of localisation i'ound by I'rofessor Ilitzig and myself

branch of science which has been followed up iu a glorious way by Professor

Horsley, of London.
     Inflammation and decav' of motor ganglion-cells might cause spasms in the

muscles belonging to them, as was stated lately by Professor Ilitzig in a case of
tetanus of the head, where the motor cells of the fifth nerve were found to exhibit
marked vacuolation.

     All these facts prove evidently that the ganglion-cells must be essential for
.sending on the nerve impulse to peripheral organs, and that the view recently put
forward by Nansen, that the ganglion-celis are necessary only for the nutrition of
the nervous tissue, is not tlie true one.

     In Mormyrus there is another very important fact to be stated, which touches

also the nature of functions iu ganglion-cells. Besides the axis cylinders, the
electric cells in the spinal cord send out broad proces,ses, which communicate quite
regularly on such a large scale that there cannot be any doubt that these cells form

a complete system, being united for common work.
     The axis cylinder being a well-defined, not branched, process, the other uniting

processes must be considered protoplasmatic (in the sense of Deiters). Their
freqnent communications cannot have any other meaning than to warrant the

equality of action in the electric shock. Tliat statement being admitted, the proto-
plasmic processes of the cells must be conducting stnictures. If that is true in the

Mormyrus, there is no reason whatever why it should be otherwise in the rest of

vertebrate animals, although Golgi states that the protoplasmic processes are not
nervous.

     There is another proof in the organisation of Mormyrus regarding the same
object of combined action in the electric organs on both sides. The upper as well
as the lower electric nerves form a decussation outside the vertebral column,
like a chiasraa. As there is no other instance recorded that motor nerves cross
over from one side to the other through the median plane of the body, this shows
the immense power of adaptation to function (in the sense of Cha'ries Darwin)
"which nature is apt to work out.

                  4. The Blood-vessels and Lymphatics of the Retina.

By James Musgrove, M.D., Demonstrator of Anatomy, Edinburgh University.

    AVhen we remember that the retina is to the eye what the sensitive plate is to
the photographic camera, it need hardly be wondered at that nature has provided a
TBANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  759

special set of vessels to bring to it a stream of pure Wood, veins to remove the

impure blood, and a tbird set of vessels, tbe lymphatics, concerned in preserving

the retina in a state of healthy vitality.

     The retina forms tbe innermost layer of tbe eyeball, and in shape is a hollow

sphere with a bole in front to allow tbe rays of light to impinge against tbe
posterior part of the membrane. It is this shape of the retina that has hitherto
prevented its demonstration with tbe oxy-bydrogen lantern, owing to tbe difficulty
of bringing the parts into one plane. This ditficulty I have, however, overcome by
carefully stretching the peripheral parts of tbe retina of the ox and other animals,

and preparing as a lantern-slide.
     As the central artery appears at tbe optic disc, it gives to the lower part of tbe

retina from two to four branches. Of these branches two pass more or less hori-
zontally, one going towards the nasal and tbe other towards the temporal side.
I'rom these two vessels branches pass right and left until the stem is ex-
hausted. Those passing upwards from these two vessels pour tbeir blood into a
region whieb may be spoken of as the intermediate zone, where only capillaries are
found. In addition to the inferior braucbes mentioned, tbere are generally two

others passing downwards. These go to tbe lowest part of tbe retina. Occasion-
ally they pass for a short distance as one trunk, wbicb divides into two branches,
to be distributed, one to tbe nasal and the other to the temporal side at tbe most
inferior part of tbe retina. The veins accompanying these last two vessels are
much larger than the arteries, draining tbe blood from a much more extensive iield
than is supplied by tbe arteries. After giving off these four brandies, the main
artery courses in an almost straight line upwards and outwards. Sometimes,
however, it may be seen to be entwined around the corresponding vein once or
twice. The main stem gives off two or three branches to the temporal side, and
an equal number to the nasal portion of the retina, and sometimes terminates by
dicbotomous division. The first two branches given off (one on the temporal side,
the other on tbe nasal) send twigs downwards to the intermediate zone already

referred to. In nearly all cases the branches of tbe artery given to tbe inner or

nasal side are larger than those to the outer side, since tbe inner part of the retina

is larger in consequence of the point at wbicb tbe optic nerve pierces tbe sclerotic

in tbe ox.

    When tbe specimens are sbown on tbe screen witb tbe aid of the oxy-bydrogen

ligbt, tbere is brought out very prominently the fact that, as regards the distribu-

--tion of vessels, the retina may be dividad into three parts a lower portion con-

taining branches of the four arteries and veins already described, an upper part
containing also large vessels, and an intermediate zone entirely free from large
vessels except in so far as it is traversed by the main stems of the artery and vein
in tbeir course to the upper part of tbe retina. This intermediate zone appears on

tbe screen as a wide belt, not unlike a 'watershed' in appearance, but when
examined under the microscope, tbe part occupied by capillaries only is much nar-
rower than it appears on tbe screen. This zone would seem to be the bomologue
of tbe yellow spot found in the human retina.

      Under the microscope, there is seen, throughout the whole extent of the retina,
to tbe very margin of the membrane, a dense capillary plexus. The capillaries
immediately associated with tbe arteries differ from those directly connected with
the veins in that they form irregularly shaped meshes, with tbe appearance of a
confused network, whereas those pouring their blood directly into tbe veins have
more regularly rhomboidal meshes, and show a general convergence towards the

 vein in wbicb they terminate.
     In addition to the specimens described, I made preparations of tbe injected

 retina for vertical sections, and found that the vessels lay chiefly in tbe nerve-cell
 layer, tbe inner molecular layer, and tbe inner nuclear layer. Only rarely were
 capillaries found beyond the inner nuclear layer, and they never extended as far as
 the outer nuclear layer, so that the outer layers of the retina are entirely free from

 vessels.

     From the foregoing account it is apparent that tbe retina, far from being a
 membrane witb a few vessels only, as might be inferred from ophthalmoscopic

 examination, is permeated throughout its whole extent by a dense capillary plexus.

  6. Natural Eelatiovs lettveen Temperature and Protoijlasmic Movements.

                               By Jas. Clakk, M.A., Ph.D.

     For every vegetable cell showing streaming movement in the protoplasm there
is a minimum temperature below which all movement ceases, an optimum at
which the rapidity of the streaming is greatest, and a maximum beyond which
movement is impossible. Of these the minimum is of greatest practical

importance.

     Although we possess many isolated determinations of the minima for various
plants, no attempt has yet been made to cai'ry out a series of systematic observa-

tions on the subject.

     As might have been expected, the minimum varies greatly according to the

nature and the general surroundings of the plant. Thus, of eight species collected
on the "\'incent pyramid of Monte liosa at a height of over 10,000 feet all showed
streaming movement in the parenchyma of the stem at O'^ C. ; of six collected at a
similar heigbt on the Aletschhorn five gave identical results, the exception being
Linaria alpina. The plants, too, that flower on the lower Swiss Alps immediately
on the retreat of the snows in spring Soldanella alpina, S. j)usilla, Crocus

--verna, I'rimula iiitegvifolia, Alcheniilla iK'niaphyllea, &c. all exhibit decided

protoplasmic movements at 0° C. Similar results are obtained from winter
seedlings of SteUaria viedia, Cerastium triviale, and Seyiecio indgaris in England.

CThe stem parenchj-ma of most of our farm crops gives a minimum of about 5°
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

for sainfoin {Onobrychis sativa), Lupines, Indian corn, the minimum is from 8° C.

to 11° C. ; for tomatoes about 14° C. ; and for the majority of stove plants 18° C.

or over.

      Such minima are not constant for the same species, but vary according to the
conditions under which the individual has actually been growing. Cochlearia

Cofficinalis, growing on our sea coasts, usually gives a minimum of 5° to 7° C,

whereas the minimum for specimens collected on the Ilorneckalp in the Justisthal
was about 1° 0. Asphodelus nlbus, on the Riederhorn and at Rawyl in Switzer-
land, shows a minimum of 2° C, and in its Mediterranean habitats of 7° C. to

 11° C.

     The minimum for the stem parenchyma of Soldnnella alpina is usually 0° C. or
lower, but there is a variety found on the lower slopes of the liigi in which the
minimum lies between 5° C. and 7° C.

      Seeds of Androsace ylacialis, Anemone venialis, Cherlena sedoides, Draba

 WaMenberyii, Gentiana bavarica, var. ivibricata, G. nana, Sa.vifraga bryoides, &c.,
collected at a height of 8,000 feet or more, produced plants in the botanical
gardens at Tiibingen and in the vicinity of the Lake of Geneva, in which the
minima were from 4° G. to 12° C. higher than in the parent plants. Seeds from
these garden-grown plants, though capable of germinating freely on the plain,

rarely did so when sown in the habitats of their mountain ancestors. Specimens
of Potamogeton marinus from Lake Fully (7,000 feet) showed streaming movement

in the leaf at 0° G.,but, on being kept in the botanical gardens at Tiibingen for six

months, showed a minimum of 7° C.

      In the marshes of the Jura, where, in consequence of local conditions, the

average temperature is very much lower than that of the surrounding country,
the minima for protoplasmic movements in the stem, and particularly the root, are
very low. In the parenchyma of the roots of Gentiana pneumonanthe and Swertia
perennis, for instance, circulation of the protoplasm was well defined at 0° G., and
in the upper part of the stem was just visible at 2° C.

     The minimum for the cells of the root is, as a rule, lower than for those of the
stem and leaves, the diflerence in some bog plants examined being as much

as 8° C.

7. Experimental Observations on the Function of the Nucleus in the Vege~

                      table Cell. By Jas. Clark, M.A., Fh.D.

"When certain cells are immersed in a 10 to 20 per cent, solution of cane sugar

a plasmolytic shrinking takes place in the protoplasmic contents, and it often

becomes possible with careful manipulation to strip away the cell wall and leave

Whenthe rest of the cell intact.                                                           this has been done in the case of Spiroc/yra and

Nitella, and of cells from the leaf of Fimaria Jiygrometrica, Elodea cmiadensis, and

Tallisneria spiralis, a new cell wall as a rule appears. "When the nucleus is

eccentric the new cell wall makes its first appearance in the proximity of the

nucleus and gradually spreads over the whole of the protoplast. In Spirogyra,

for instance, if the nucleus be in the centre of the cell, the new cell wall first
appears as a girdle round the middle of the somewhat elongated protoplast ; if the

nucleus be at the side, then cell-wall formation begins as a rule at that point on

tlie outer surface of the protoplasm nearest the nucleus, and for a variable time

cell-wall formation is confined to that side of the protoplast where the nucleus

happens to be.

Slight mechanical irritation of the protoplast in Spirogyra at a point near the

nucleus hastened the formation of the cell wall ; or, if the cell-wall formation had

already begun, caused an increasing thickness in the same. Similar irritation at a

point remote from the nucleus caused protoplasmic contraction and reduction in

the complexity of the protoplasmic movements in the neighbourhood.

By purely mechanical means it is possible, by compressing the cell wall, to

divide the contents of a cell of Spirogyra and various other plants into two equal

parts completely separated from each other, the one half containing the nucleus,
the other not. The part containing the nucleus functionates exactly as an

ordinary cell, but is, if anything, more active. In the case of Spirogyra it can

form a new cell wall, and many, by repeated cell division, grow into" a new and

independent filament, provided the old cell wall be torn to allow its escape. When

submitted to slight mechanical irritation the nucleated portion usually passes into

a resting stage. In Spirogyra the part without the nucleus is capable of forming

starch, occasionally in abundance                                                                                                                                                                        and the protoplasmic movements usually
                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

undergo extensive simplification, well-marked circulation being at times converted

into rotation. When protoplasmic movements are arrested in the non-nucleated

portion by the withdrawal of oxygen, they are not restored by the introduction of a

normal oxygen supply.

    When the tip of a very young root-hair of Trianea hoyotensis is separated from

the basal nucleated portion the nucleus advances towards the place of separation,

where the formation of a new layer of cell wall occurs. The nucleus then returns

to its original position and the hair resumes ordinary growth. In a hair so

treated the characteristic fountain-like rotation never subsequently appears, though

in other respects the hair may be quite normal.

8. Co-ordination of Cellular Oroivth and Action by Physical Forces.

                          By Francis "Waenek, M.D.

Referring to former publications, the author points out the importance of

studying cellular action, and the attributes, time, and quantity of action, in each

elemental part of the object observed ; this is particularly needful in studying the

brain. Generalisations from observation of cellular growth are formulated, with

references to examples of control by physical forces. Co-ordination of growth and

of nerve-action is alike due to control of the attributes (time and quantity) of the

elemental parts of the organism, leading to proportion and form of growth, and

order of nerve-action                                                                      both supply of                                                                                                pabulum  and  stimulation  may bring about
                                                                                        ;

such co-ordination.

In children normal proportional growth and normal nerve-action have been

shown usually to coincide.

Evidence is advanced that ' similar living things under similar conditions of
----  --

762 EEPORT-- 1892.

--environment i.e., supply of pabulum and stimulation by physical forces tend to

subsequent similar action.' From the study of g:rowth, movement, and expression

of mental states, the author suggests that 'all vital phenomena occur in the parts of
a living body ; they necessitate not only supply of pabulum, but also stimulation
by force ; these conditions together are commonly called the environment, and are
capable in many cases of determining a control leading to subsequent co-ordinated
action.' It appears that when once a special combination, or group of ratios of
growth of parts, has been established by the environment, it tends to recur, and

may be easily reproduced or called into action.

     The facts accumulated in a report on 60,000 children observed by the author
appear to confirm these views, showing that defects in development of the body
are largely co-related with defects of the nerve-system in its power of co-ordination
and mental function.

   A table showing methods of observation and description of living objects, the

nerve-system in action, and conditions of children was appended to the paper.

A1. Slcetch of the Scottish Fisheries, chiefly in their Scientifl.c Aspects,

    during the past decade (1882-1892). By Professor W. C. McIntosh,

     F.E.iS. L. and E.

    At the period with which the present survey begins the pelagic condition of
the eggs of the food-fishes was little known to scientific men in Britain, though

Sars and others had described this condition in the eggs of cod, haddock, and
gurnard, while others had added the eggs of the pollack, bib, pilchard, mackerel,
&c. The complaints of the fishermen in regard to the scarcity of sea-fishes caused
the Government to appoint a Royal Commission about the commencement of this
period (viz., in 1883) to inquire into the matter, with Lord Dalhousie as chair-

man. No statistics were then available to show whether the iisheiies were really
dimuiishing. It was known that larger boats, longer lines, and a larger number
of men were engaged in the pursuit, so that, even though fishes were abundant in
the market, it might be that the fishermen of to-day gathered them from a much

wider area than in former times. Consequently the maintenance of an efficient
supply might be coincident with an actual diminution. Moreover, shortly before
this period beam-trawling by means of steam-vessels had been introduced into
Scottish waters, and furtlier complicated the question. The ( Uimmissiou sifted all
the matters complained of as fully as was possible, and, after the lapse of seven or
eight years, Professor Mcintosh did not think that any change of importance can

be made in their carefully drawn conclusions.
      Shortly afterwards the Fishery Board for Scotland, acting on the authority

obtained through the Commission, closed certain waters against beam-trawling

--viz., St. Andrews Bay, Aberdeen Bay, and the Forth and procured a small

steam-vessel (the Garland) for scientific experiments, and especially to inquire
whether beam-trawling is an injurious mode of fishing. Stations were arranged
for in the various areas, and in 1886 a commencement was made.

     In examining the elaborate statistics, carefully drawn up by the Fishery Board,
on the trawling experiments of the Garland, the author varied the mode of
drawing deductions from them ; in short, they were handled as in the report for

--the Royal Commission, the fishes captured being divided into two groups viz.,
--saleable and unsaleable and St. Andrews Bay, about which most is known,

alone considered. Without going into detail, these statistics show considerable
variation. In 1886 twenty-one hauls of the trawl gave 1,792 saleable and 1,186
unsaleable fishes, or a total of 2,978. In 1887 the same number of hauls produced
2,649 saleable and 5,525 unsaleable, or a total of 8,174, or more than twice the
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                     763

mimter obtained in 188G, and no notice was taken of tlie verj' large ininiber of
plaice captured by the liners. In 1888 twenty-five hauls gave 0,2111 saleable and
only r)94 unsaleable, and of the latter no less than 43G were dabs and 135 plaice.
In 1880 tbirty-tive bauls of the trawl gave 6,026 saleable and 1,00-4 unsaleable,
or a total of 7,030, a considerable diminution on the previous year. In 1890 thirty
hauls produced 0,421 saleable and 2,247 unsaleable, or a total of 8,608. Durino-
1891 ' thirtj'-three hauls gave 3,072 saleable and unsaleable 1,061, or a total of 5,333.

     These results were then contrasted with the condition of the bay in 1884, and
the dift'erences in regard to the fishes captured by the various kinds of trawl (large
and small) pointed out. The bay in 1884 contained a very considerable number

of iishes, notwithstanding that, so far as man could, it had been swept for many

years by fieets of sailing trawlers and by liners, and for several years by large steam-
trawlers. The closure of the bay has not been followed by tlie growth of teeming
multitudes of flat and round fishes ; but, as pointed out in the Trawling Ileport,
the large flat fishes occur mainly in the ofi'shore waters, the smaller forms
migrating outward as thej' grow older. Conversely the pelagic eggs, larvns, and
very .young are borne shorewards. In regard to the large captures of plaice by
the liners, it was explained that, having undisturbed possession of the bay, three
sets of lines are used, and special exertions made to procure bait. The local
benefits of the closure to the fishing community are undoubtedly great.

     The increase in our knowledge of the development and life-histories of the
British food-fishes was then dwelt on, and a list of these, for the first time hatched
and reared at the St. Andrews Marine Labor.itory, was given, together with others,
the eggs or young of which had been partially examined. Between fifty and sixty
species of fishes had been thus studied. Moreover, Last season the comparative
number of the various kinds of pelagic ova had been examined on the diiierent
areas in which the Garland worked.

     Another feature of the decade has been the agitation concerning mussels for
bait, an agitation arising from the increased price and diminished production. The
advantages of the bed-system of management were pointed out, and the failure of

the bouchot-system mentioned.

    The workers who have contributed to the increase of our knowledge of the

--development and life-histories of fishes at St. Andrews were next alluded to viz..

Professor Prince, Mr. Holt, Professor Burdon-Sanderson, Mr. Gotch, Dr. Scharil",
Dr. Marcus Gunn, Profess(n- Cleland, Messrs. Pentland Smith, Teviotdale, Corbyn,
Oolliuge, and others.

     The valuable work done by the Fishery Board was then noticed, both in
connection witJi the Garland and other departments. Amongst those who have
published contributions to the annual reports are Professors Ewart, Greenfield,
and Stirling ; Messrs. Duncan Matthews and Calderwood : Dr. Fulton (the
scientific secretary of the Board), Dr. Fullerton, Dr. Beard, Dr, B. H. Mill,
Dr. Gibson, Messrs. Iloyle and llamsay Smith, Mr. Anderson Smith, and Mr. Thos.

Scott.

    Finally various suggestions were made for the improvement of the Scottish
fisheries in regard to marine food-fishes, mussels, and fresh-water fishes.

              Paet I. Introductory Statement.                  ·

By W. L, Calderwood, Director M.B.A. Laboratory.

     The various conferences which have been held by tlie National Sea Fisheries
Protection Association, and by representatives of the fish trade alone, have all had
before them the question of the depletion of our sea fisheries. It has, in point of

fact, always formed one of the most important subjects under discussion.

' This year is available only by the courtesy of the Fishery Board for Scotland.
                                                              ----

764 EEPOET- -1892.

In considering remedial measures necessary to the proper preservation of extra-

territorial iisheries, the conference have considered the question from only one

point of view, viz., that of prohibiting the capture and sale of what are termed

' undersized ' Hat fish.

     It is an undeniable fact that within recent years a market has opened for the
sale of these small fish, and that, in addition to this, modes of fishing are allowed

which, carried on in certain localities, tend to the destruction of many fish CA'en

too small for the market.

The outcry against such procedure is very ancient, and has in past years led to

legislation in this country ; and at the present day in France and Denmark fish

are not allowed to he sold under certain sizes.

In England the Act 1 Geo. I. stat. 5, cap. 18, established the following sizes,

the measurements being from the eye to the end of the tail :
            ....No Bret or Turbot
                                                   under 1 6 inches

            No Brill or Pearl            .... . .  ,, li inches
            No Codlin, Bass, or ^Mullet
            No Sole, Dab, or Plaice                ,,13 inches
            No Flounder
                                                   ,,8 inches
                                                   ,.7 inches

            No Whiting                             ,, ^ inches

     Subsequently (by 22 Geo. II. cap. 49) a relaxation was made in favour of
undersized fish if caught by a hook. At a later date this exemption was repealed,

but ultimately (by 33 Geo. II. cap. 27) turbot and brill were altogether exempted

from the list of undersized fish.

Finally, the Sea Fisheries Act of 1868 (31 and 32 "N'ict. cap. 45) abolished all

restrictions on deep-sea fishing. The agitation almost immediately recommenced,

and has been mentioned continually in official reports up to the present day. The

question is therefore not a new one, but rather the repetition of an old-standing

grievance.

     Mr. Fryer, Inspector of Fisheries to the Board of Trade, in bis Fiftli Annual
lieport (1891), after discussing the difficulties in the way of restricting the size of

mesh in nets, particularly those used for shrimping, suggests that 'a simple
prohibition of any method of fishing could be much more easily enforced than a

regulation involvuig constant watching and measuring,' and further remarks :
' The application, of this principle to extra-territorial waters by means of an

international agreement, and the adoption of a regular system of closing and

opening certain areas in rotation, would probably secui'e fuller advantages than

could be derived from any other method of protection in this respect.'

I give this extract in passing, since it shows, although on an entirely diflerent

system, a proposition to deal with this difficult question which is regarded with

favour by man}'.

    I shall now give the conclusions arrived at by the conference held in February
of this year in the Fishmongers' Hall, since they may be considered the most

highly revised.

    I shall then give reasons why, in my opinion and in the opinion of my two

colleagues, Mr. Cumiingham and Mr. Holt, these sizes are quite unsatisfactory.

By resolution passed on February 25, after discussion and reference to a com-

            ........Sole
mittee on the previous day, the following sizes were determined on:

            ........Turbot                                    10 inches

            Brill                                             12 inches         ·
                                                              12 inches

            Lemon Sole . . . . . . . 10 inches

            Plaice                                            11 inches

    At the commencement I would point out that these limiting sizes were agreed
upon by the majority of the members present at the conference merely because
they were the sizes which appeared to them best for preventing the sale of very
small fish, and thus preserving them until they have reached a fair marketable size.

      In our estimation the framing of this resolution is of almost no value, since its
only point of recommendation is that fish at, or above, the sizes given fetch a
              TRAKSACTIONS OF SECTION D.            765

better price in the market than fish which are smaller. It takes no account of the
question as to whether or not these fishes have ever spawned, and so contributed

to the natural supply or up-keep of their species.

     Our contention, therefore, is that, in all resolutions in which the line between

marketable and undersized fish is drawn, that line should be the one separating,
at the same time, the sexually mature and the sexually immature fish ; and,
further, that no protective measure of the kind referred to can possibly be of any

ultimate value unless the fish are protected till after their first spawning season.

Further, Dr. Fulton's investigations have shown that, taking flat fishes as a

Awhole, females are much more numerous than males.  matter of equal, if not

greater, importance is the statement that, without exception, males were found

ripe at a smaller size than the females.

     Thus Fulton's figures show that in 23 males and 45 females (taking the turbot

as an instance) the average length in inches of males is 16-8-5, in females 20-83.
     It would appear clear from these observations, which have been verified over

and over again, that if any resolution dealing with the capture and sale of immature
fish be based upon the sizes at which the females alone spawn for the first time,

the smaller male fish, which are also less numerous, need not be taken into

consideration, since in proportion they will be protected to a greater extent than

the females.

     This opinion is held by Mr. Holt, Mr. Cunningham, and by myself, but Dr.

Fulton still inclines to include males.

The appended table is arranged so as to compare the results from the four

districts mentioned, and includes also the sizes agreed on at the last fishery

conference.

     It is necessary to mention each district separately, since the sizes at which tbo
various species become mature differ very considerably on the different coasts.

--766 REPORT 1892.

new crop of ova commences to mature as soon as, or even before, the old crop has
been ejected. Moreover some of the old ova are invariably retained in the ovary,
and their presence is perceptible even several months after spawning. In some
species, also, the ovary, on maturing, grows backwards, and thus assumes new
topographical relations which it never again entirely loses.

     It has been suggested that confusion may occur between immature females and

females in which the ovaries, having once fulfilled their function, have reverted to
a condition of rest. I can find no evidence that the latter condition is ever

--realised at all events amongst marine Teleosteans.

     In distinguishing immature females from such as are just commencing to
approach ripeness, I find the most easily recognised microscopical feature in the
relative translucency or opacity of the ovum.

     In immature fish the condition and size of the ova are not materially influenced
by the size of the individual in any species, but at the first approach of sexual
activity an opacity manifests itself, under the microscope, in certain of the ova, and
brings about changes in the appearance of the ovary, which, after some experience,
are easily recognisable by the naked eye.

     The changes in the ovum which bring about this opacity are familiar to students

of ovarian development.
      ]\Iale fish being of comparatively small importance in the present connection I

have not devoted much attention to the minute anatomy of the testis, but it

presents certain well-marked external characteristics which serve to distinguish

the different conditions.

     The table of comparative size-limits suggests a close relationship between the
absolute size of a species and the size at which maturity is attained by that species

in difterent districts.

     Rate of growth being doubtless related to absolute size, it must be presumed,
in view of Cunningham's researches, that there is a constancy in the age at which

maturity is reached in all districts.

     Most of the observations embodied in the tables were made during the spawning

season.

       Part III. The Protection of Immature Fish.

                 By J. T. CxrNNiNGHAM, M.A.

       I. The Limit op Size for each Species.

My researches have been directed more to the question of the rate of growth

and to the age at which maturity is reached than to the size of specimens taken at

sea.

     I have found, in the case of the flounder, that of a large number of specimens
reared in captivity none became ripe when one year old, although a few reached

the size of the smallest mature specimens, i.e., a length of 7 inches. In the second
spaMaaing season from that in which they were hatched a proportion, viz., 19 per
cent., became ripe and spawned. The rest did not become mature at two years

old.

     The results of this research, which I wish to emphasise, are two.
     (1) That an adult or sexually mature fish is at least two years old, and more
probabl}' three years, while an average sized adult is usually four years old or

more.

The importance of this fact is that it shows how easily the supply of a valuable

Afish may be diminished by over-fishing.  turbot, for instance, produces a very

large number of eggs, from which comparatively few larvae safely pass through

their metamorphosis, and even after this the young fish have to find food and

escape enemies for throe or four years more before they reach the average size of

fish brought to market.
     (2) That the size of the smallest ripe fish is not the only point to be considered

in fixing the limit below which the young fish require to be protected.
     Assuming that a fish ought not to be killed before it has been able to reproduce

itself and leave progeny to take its place, it must be remembered that while one

specimen of a female flounder which is 9 inches long may be two-and-a-half years
old, and have already spawned once, another which is 10 inches long may be only

one-and-a-half year old, and have never spawned at all.
     The limit fixed should therefore, in order to exclude all immature females, be

somewhat higher than the size of the smallest (ripe) females observed.

          II. The Benefit of the Proposed Restrictive Legislation.

     If the destruction of all fish which had not spawned at least once could he suc-
cessfully prevented the henefit would he indubitable, and the permanent produc-
tiveness of the sea fisheries would be assured.

     But it is bj' no means certain that the prohibition of the sale of fish below a

certain standard will prevent the destruction of such fish. All that can be said is,

that it may be hoped that when the sale of such fish is made illegal the trawlers
will avoid catching them as much as possible, and when they do catch them will

throw them overboard.
     (1) Can fishermen avoid catching them by ceasing to fish in certain areas ?

Are the small fish especially abundant in certain places ?

    There is evidence in Dr. Fulton's reports and my own that young plaice, sole,

turbot, and brill haunt shallow waters, and in summer occur close inshore. It is said
that the young of these kinds haunt shallow extra-territorial water on the east
side of the North Sea. I cannot speak of the North Sea, but I know something of
inshore trawling for small fish, especially soles and turbot, and this mode of fishing
would be practically stopped iDy the proposed legislation.

    On the other hand, it has been proved that the young of the lemon sole, megrim

(or sale-fluke), long rough dab, and witch are never found in shallow water or near
the shore, but prefer deeper water even than the adults.

     {;2) Can fishermen avoid catching the young fish by enlarging the mesh of the

trawl ?

     I think to a great extent they can. If the mesh at the cod end, at present 1^
inch square, were enlarged to 3 inches square, more small fish would escape ; the
net would not be so liable to be choked with debris, and so kill the fish.

     It is probable that if the proposed legislation were carried out the men would
enlarge the mesh of their own accord, if recommended to do so.

     (3) AVhen young fish are caught and thrown overboard, will they survive ?

    From Ur. Fulton's experiments and my own experience I think it is clear that

a proportion of the fish will survive, and equally clear that a good many will be

killed. This applies to deep-sea trawlers.

     The proposed legislation would cause shrimpers and ground-seiners to throw
back the young fish they had caught, and if this were done at once as soon as the
net was hauled the young fish would survive.

      III. Other Measures for the Maintenance op the Fish SuprLT.

     It has been abundantly proved that a dose time is absolutely no use, even if it
were practicable.

    But on the other hand close places may be of the greatest benefit.

     If fishing could be prevented in certain defined areas where young fish congre-
gate, those young fish would live in security to supply large fish in the future.

     It might also be possible to prevent fishing in certain areas where full-grown
fish are abundant, in order that these might form permanent reserves in which
there would always be abundance of mature fish spawning.

     It might further be possible to prohibit trawling for a given number of years
on exhausted grounds, to give them time to recover their productiveness.

     Such measures as these could only be considered by a permanent fisheries com-
mission composed of experts, such as exists in France, a central commission for the
whole kiDgdom, as distinguished from the district committees.

       Part IV. (i) On the Destruction of Immature Fish in the North Sea.
                                  By Ernest W. L. Holt.

     '^^'e have long been familiar with the fact that immature fish of valuable food-
species are destroyed in dangerously large quantities.

     From time to time efforts have been made to ascertain the condiLions that

givern such destruction and its approximate extent.

    The earliest of these was the Scotch Trawling Commission, the carrying out of
wliich was fortunately entrusted to I'rofessor Mcintosh, then, as now, our highest
authority on the scientific aspects of sea fisheries, and his report may be regarded

as the classic of the subject.

More recently Dr. Fulton has been able to give us much valuable information

as to the distribution of immature fish on tlie various grounds accessible to the

Garland, and my colleague, Mr. Cunningham, has dealt with the same subject

in the Plymouth district.

     The results attained by the Royal Dublin Society's survey of the west coast of

Ireland fishing grounds appeared early in the present year, my reports being

arranged as far as possible on the model of those put forth by Dr. Fulton.

    From their very nature, however, none of the observations gives us any idea of
tlie total amount of destruction that is actually caused by any one practical fishing

industry on any one coast.

Indeed, beyond a few vague statements, made at fishery conferences, &c., we

have only Dr. Fulton's estimate of the numbers of small fish captured (though not

destroyed) by the small fleet of shrimpers in Solway Firth.

I propose in the present paper to give such observations as I have been able to

raalie on the actual quantity of undersized fish that have been landed at the port

of Grimsby during the present year.

myI shall limit     remarlts to plaice, turbot, brill, and soles.
--Plaice. As may be seen from the comparative table, I consider that 17 inches

is the average size at which female plaice spawn for tlie first time, and, therefore,

the biological limit between mature and immature fish.

On every North Sea ground with which I am acquainted a proportion of the

plaice fail to reach that standard ; but at present I sliall confine myself to the dis-

cussion of fish landed //-owi those grounds wliere only small Jish are to be found.

Moreover I shall not make use of the biological limit, but shall use the term

' small ' in the sense in which it is understood by fishermen and fish merchants.

The appended figures refer, therefore, to fish which are undersized in every

sense of the word.

     The quantity is certainly not exaggerated ; indeed, it is probable that a number

of boxes have escaped my notice altogether, whilst I have omitted from considera-

tion numbers of boxes which, though containing chiefly small fish, have yet had a

few fair-sized ones arranged on the top.

There were landed at the port of Grimsby      l,8Ji6 boxes of small plaice

      During April                            830 ,,

        » May                                 3,470 ,,             ,,
                                              2,059 ,,             ,,
          ,, June
          ,, July

       Total for the four months .        .   8,195 boxes.

     In addition 155 large packing cases of small fish, caught by Danish boats, were
brought to Grimsby market by cargo steamers.

    The sizes of fish in the above boxes range from 6 or 8 inches up to a maximum

Mf 15 inches, but in the majority of cases do not exceed 13 or 14 inches, or very

frequently even 12 inches.

   A box of such fish containsabout 300 fish, more or less, weighing about nine stone.

     To be far on the safe side let us take 250 fish as the number in a box, giving us
a total for Grimsby smacks of 2,048,750 fish, or in round numbers 2,000,000. In
all probability the actual number is not less than 2,500,000.

     The packing cases contain about 200 fisli, which gives us a total of 31,000 fish,

sent over per cargo boat by foreign fishermen.

     Thus we have direct evidence that at the lowest possible computation the con-
signments oi exclusively small plaice landed at Grimsby from April to July reached

a total of 2,079,750 fish.

     I do not know whether the numbers I have given will appear surprisingly

large or surprisingly sma'l,

--770 REPORT 1892.

     In any case we have to consider that the fish landed at Grimsby represent only

a tithe of those brought ashore by the whole of the North Sea boats.

     As a matter of fact only a single small ' fleet,' of about twelve sail, has been
working the small fish grounds from Grimsby during the present year.

     Only one steam-trawler, so far as I know, has regularly worked these grounds,
though a good many others have made occasional trips to them. The balance of
boats bringing in small plaice has been made up by a certain number of sailing smacks,
* single-boatiug,' and working the small fish grounds with more or less regularity.

    Now from Hull alone two large fieets, each of about 250 sail, have been on

these grounds during the present fleeting season, as has also the large fleet from
Yarmouth, Lowestoft, and Barking.

     Certain of the Hull and Boston steam trawlers have also visited the grounds
from time to time.

     The grounds alluded to lie along the Dutch, Gerui.tn, and Danish coasts, off the
islands of Terschelling, Schiermonnikoog, Nordevey, Heligoland, and Sylt, ofl:" the
Horn Reef, and along the Danish coast as far north as Haustholm.

    It may be said at once that the greater part of all these grounds lies outside the
territorial area. Some of them are 14 or 1.5 miles from land, and in one case the
small fish extend even 40 miles from the coast. At the same time the productive

area of some grounds extends as close inshore as the vessel dare go.
     Besides the small plaice landed, great numbers are caught, especially on the

grounds last referred to, which are too small to meet even the modest require-

ments of the present market, and it may be assumed that as trawling is at present

conducted nearly the whole of such small fish are destroyed.

  --Destruction by Foreign Boats. Besides the large British trawlers, there fire a

certain number of small boats of Dutch, German, or Danish nationality which are
engaged in the small plaice trade.

    On the whole, I think the damage inflicted on the fishery in this manner is com-
paratively small, since the German and Danish boats are careful to return the fish

which are too small for market uninjured.

     Our own fishermen agree that the share taken by foreigners in the destruction

of immature fish is insignificant.

   --The German steam trawlers appear to avoid the small fish grounds altogether.

      Tiirbot. Besides the small plaice, the grounds which I have been referring to
yield large catches of turbot. The bulk of these are immature.

     Thus in June the aggregate of thirty-one catches was 4,623 fish. The propor-
tion of undersized fish amongst these was 82 per cent.

      During July eighteen catches comprised 2,4.'i5 fish, the proportion of small being
69 per cent. The diminution is probably explicable by the fact that the inshore
parts of the grounds, chiefly frequented by the very small fish, became less pro-
ductive in that month.

    A certain number of immature turbot occur on all grounds frequented by the

species, but I found that the aggregate of fish in the market during ten days before
the regular opening of the eastern grounds season comprised only 30 per cent, of

 small.

   --Brill. Contrary to the statements that have been made on this subject, I find

 that the proportion of immature brill landed from the eastern grounds is entirely

 insignificant. It is not sufficiently recognised that the brill is a smaller fish than
the turbot, and matures at a smaller size. Most of the immature brill which I

--have seen came from the Lincolnshire coast.
     Soles. I do not think that the proportion of immature soles now caught on the
eastern grounds is a high one, though there is evidence that in former years, when
the boats went closer to the shore, great numbers were destroyed.

     There is a fishery, ostensibly shrimp trawling, in the Humber, and though the
number of fish caught in this way is not large nearly all are immature.

     The use of a fish-trawl in the Humber is prohibited, but it is possible that the
law is frequently evaded.

      Undoubtedly there is considerable destruction of immature fish, chiefly plaice,
but also including other forms by the various methods of inshore fishing practised
in the Humber, but I do not propose to deal with that subject here.

              (ii) On Remedial Measures. By Ernest W. L. Holt.

     Various measures have been put forward for checking the destruction of small

fish and renewing the tish supply generally. They may be classified as follows :

(1) Prohibition of sale or possession of undersized lisb.

{2) Closing of grounds frequented by small iish.
(3) Regulations affecting size of mesh.

(4) Close seasons.

(.5) Artificial rearing.

Of these various methods I am inclined to consider that the first is likely to

yield the most important results, since its enforcement would practically carry with

it the closing of the grounds on the eastern part of the North Sea, where, as 1 have

shown, by far the greater part of the damage is done.

Indeed, I believe that the prohibition of sale or possession of undersized plaice

alone, or at most of undersized plaice, turbot, and sole, would render these eastern

grounds so unprofitable that they would be entirely deserted by trawlers.

It is absolutely necessary, however, that the size limits should be higher than

those proposed at the Fishery Conference. Indeed, in the case of turbot and brill

I cannot understand why a limit of 12 inches should ever have been proposed,

since, as the number of turbot and brill below that size which are landed at

Grimsby is quite insignificant, the matter is practically left in st.atti quo.

In the case of the plaice I do not consider that it is absolutely necessary that

the limit of 17 inches should be enforced, although, as I have shown, that is the

natural or biological limit.

   A limit of 15 inches would be high enough for the purpose, since all bvit a very

few of the fish on these eastern grounds fail to reach that size.

It is the certainty of being able to pay his expenses by the sale of these small

fish that induces the trawler to visit these grounds, since the amount of other fish

taken there is utterly insufiicient for the purpose.

     The grounds lying without the territorial limits could not be closed without

international arrangement, and even if that could be attained I believe that it

would be practically impossible for cruisers to watch the grounds, great part of

which lies altogether out of sight of laud. Indeed, I am not aware that they find

the enforcement even of such restrictions as already exist an easy task.

     I consider an indiscriminate closing of the territorial area altogether inadvis-
able, since the distribution of young fish in relation to this area is by no means the

same on all coasts, being largely affected by physical conditions, chiefly those of

declivity.

     I agree with Dr. Fulton in considering that no restriction of the mesh can be
alone elhcient in protecting undersized fish, though no doubt some good can be done

in that way.

mySuch restriction should, in  opinion, take the form of an alteration of the

pattern rather than any great enlargment of the mesh. Thus it is my experience

that by substituting a square mesh lor that at present in use, or by simply turning

the mesh across, so that the strain of the trawl meets with the greatest instead of

the least possible resistance offered by the knots of the mesh, much less small fish

are captured.

      Further, since the loophole of escape, if any, presents itself to the fish in the

cod-end of the net, the alteration need affect only that portion, and thus would
entail the minimum of trouble and expense to owners of nets.

    I have already suggested that when a spawning ground lies within the juris-

diction of fishery authorities, such part of it as best offers itself to the watchful-
ness of the autliorities might advantageously be reserved as a sanctuary for
spawning fish during the season, but I do not "see that any other form of close

season is practicable.

    I do not know of any North Sea spawning ground that fulfils the above re-
quirements, though some exist on the Irish coast, and probably on the west coasts

of England and Scotland.

     With regard to the culture of sea-fish it appears to me that we should concen-

                                                                                3D2

trate our efforts oa the more valuable kinds of flat fish, especially turhot, brill, and
soles, since the results, if successful, would be of infinitely greater value than an
increase in the supply of such forms as the cod. I do not, however, believe that

any success we may attain in this direction will justify us in neglectiuo°- the protec-

tion of undersized fish.

    4. The Food of Fish. By W. Ramsay Smith, B.Sc, M.B., CM,

This paper gives a summary of four annual reports made by Dr. Eamsay Smith

to the Fishery Board for Scotland. The reports were made from materials col-
lected by the naturalists of the Board. The paper deals only with the most im-

portant fish of the Firth of Forth and St. Andrews, and gives the results of the
observations made there during four years, irrespective of stations and seasons of

the year. The statistics are so extensive as to reduce the limit of the errors of

observation to such an extent as allow general conclusions of a trustworthy

character to be drawn now for the first time from those observations,

   --The species of fish and the numbers examined are as follow:

    1. Firth of Forth : Plaice, 1,205 ; lemon soles, 831 ; common dabs, 1,211 ; long

rough dabs, 1,512; witch soles, 217; flounders, 75; giu-nards, 726; cod, 72?";

haddocks, 874; whitings, 1,050. Total, 8,418.

     Various forms are dealt with in the paper, but the feature of chief interest was
the description, for the first time, of the ovum and early larva of the turbot
(Rhombus maximns). Tlie ovum has a diameter of about I'Ol mm., that of the
single oil-globule being about -21 mm. The larva, which is hatched in about
eight day.«, in summer, is characterised by the ventral position of the oil-globule,
and especially by the extremely brilliant rust-coloured pigment. Black piginent is

also present, but in less quautity.

     The ova, which are pelagic in their early stages, display a tendency to sink at
a variable period before hatching takes place ; a condition which may 'throw difii-
culties in the way of the artificial propagation of this species.

 7, On the Formation of Argenteous Matter in the Integument of Teleosteans.
                               By Professor E. E. Prince.

      During larval life the integument of Teleosteans is of a very simple character,
and consists of two layers, an ectodermal external layer (epidermis) in which an

outer corneous layer can be made out, and an inner mucous stratum, the latter
generally several cells deep and giving origin to enlarged mucous cells; while
internal to the epidermis is the mesodermic layer or true cutis, out of which the
scales are developed. Below the mesoderm layer the muscle masses occur. In
many young bony fishes this mesoderm layer is represented by a stratum of
granular plasma, which takes a deep tint in stained preparations ; and it is limited
internally by a thin layer of flattened cells in which large pigment corpuscles occur.

In such diverse forms as the Gadoids, Labrus, Anarrhichas, &c., this layer of
granular plasma is well marked, and in it the fibrillated substance is formed to

which the integument of many fishes owes its silvery lustre. In the mackerel
midge, now known to be the small post-larval stage of certain species of Motella,

this deposit of fibrillated matter is noteworthy. In a specimen {\ in. long its

thickness is greater than that of the other layers of the integument, and in an
example ^^ in. long the deposit of silvery matter is so great as to form a layer
along the sides of the trunk live times the depth of the epidermis external to it.
In the species named the silvery matter is very precociouslj' developed, and the

presence of long spindle cells amongst its fibrous strands suggests that it may arise

from the lengthened cells of the deeper layer of the dermis. If not, then it is

merely a fibrillated condition of the mesodermic plasma, in ^vliich stray cells of the
dermis occur. This peculiar matter arises below and independent of the scales
which are formed as protrusions of the outer dermal layers.

8. The Development of the Pharyngeal Teeth in the Labridce.

                     By Professor E". E. Prince.

The wrasses are all characterised by the presence of toothed grinding plates in

the pharynx. Below the pharyngeal epithelium, which is six or seven cells deep,

the mucous layer cells form roimded dental sacs in which four distinct portions

can be distinguished at an early stage, viz. : (1) an enclosing laj-er of flattened

cells; (2) a single layer of nucleated round cells; (3) a columnaV layer of enor-
mous gland-cells, each with an eccentric nucleus, and secreting at the lower or

proximal end a clear homogeneous substance, similar to the osteoid matter, which

largely clothes the skeletal cartilages of post-larval Teleosteans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (4) a papilliform
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

mass of rounded cells, representing the pulp-cavity of typical teetli. The last-named

layer secretes a granular substance which stains deeply, and constitutes an inner

cone of the developing tooth. This inner cone is soon covered with a clear coat

of osteoid matter, except at the acuminate tip, and the large gland-cells are active

in forming the clear non-staining matrix. The tooth lengthens, and by the time

that it pierces the pharyngeal epithelium it forms a lengthened conical structure

of clear matter, enclosing in its upper half an inner deep-staining cone which con-

tinues into the apex. AVheve the inner stained cone ceases a thickened stained

band occurs encircling the whole tooth. Compound teeth occur with two or more

pointed projections, and at their bases the teeth become attached below to the

nasi- and hypo-branchial cartilages and to the epibranchials above. The mucous

layer of the pharyngeal wall is crowded with dental sacs at various stages of

development.

into irregular elevations, over which a very thin epithelium is evenly arranged,
which also passes downwards to form the sheaths of the spines. Beneath the
fibrous tissue is a skin muscle of some thickness. There are neither sweat nor
sebaceous glands in connection with the spines, but often a great development of
adipose tissue beneath the muscle.

     The epithelium exhibits only two layers, a stratum corneum of little thickness,
and a rete Malpighi only two or three cells in vertical extent. The stratum
lucidum and stratum granulosum are both absent. The mucosa consists of thick
wavy bundles of connective tissue, with which are mingled near the epithelium
considerable numbers of pigment cells. There are few blood-vessels in this dense

tissue, but a free percolation of lymph.
     The panniculus carnosus consists of striped muscle of the usual type, and is

often of great thickness.

     The spine follicles are situated in the cutis vera, and are of large size. The

tliin neck of the spine soon widens out into a liemispberical root, the convex in-

ternal aspect of which is indented by a small vascular papilla. The sheath of

this root consists of epidermic and of dermic coverings ; of the latter nothing need

he said ; the former presents two layers, an outer and an inner root sheath, which is
Anot subdivided into several layers of cells.
                                                                                   large fan-shaped arrector pili

muscle is attached to the dermic coverings ; it consists of non-striped fibres firmly
attached, for the most part, to the deeper layers of the rete mucosum. In the

neighbourhood of the spine is a fine capillary plexus ; there appear to be no special

nerve end organs, though tactile impulses are conveyed in some way from the

spines to the brain.

     The ventral region gradually passes into the dorsal at the sides of the animal.

The skin is much thinner, less rugose, and less firml}' attached to subjacent
structures than that of the dorsum ; it is covered with hair, and contains both

sweat and sebaceous glands.

The epithelium is similar to that of the dorsum.

     The cutis vera is thinner and finer than that of back, very vascular, and
contains much adipose tissue.

     The panniculus carnosus of striped muscle is thin, and exhibits some fibres in

a more or less embryonic condition.
     The sweat glands, situated deeply in the cutis vera, are lined by a single layer

of cells surrounding a central lumen ; the non-striped muscle fibres between them
and the basement membrane are inconspicuous or wanting. The ducts are lined

by a single layer of cells.

The hair follicles are similar to those of other animals ; the arrector pili muscle

and sebaceous glands are large.

  --Hairs and Spines. The hairs are of the fibrous or fibro-cellular type, depend-

ing on their size; they exhibit a cuticle, a cortex, and a medulla. There is a gradual
transition between the soft hairs and ridged spines at the sides of the animal.

     The spines are gigantic, somewhat modified hairs, consisting of a cuticle, a

cortex, and a medulla.

     The cuticle is a single layer of large imbricated scales.
     The cortex is fibrous in appearance, contains pigment at intervals, and is
strengthened internally by twenty-two to twenty-iour longitudinal ridges that

project inwards for some distance into the medulla.
     The medulla is of large size, thickest in the middle of the shaft, tapering

towards  the  tip     and  neck  of  the  spine                            it  is  divided into  narrow  lenticular

chambers by transverse imperforate septa, each of which splits horizontally at

the margin into several leaflets, which in their turn again split horizontally into

still smaller leaflets ; all the leaflets are firmly attached to the sides of the inward
projecting cortical ridges, thereby firmly binding them together and helping them

to withstand a vertical strain, the septa themselves preventing undue distortion of

the spine from a transversely applied strain. Morphologically the spines are true

hairs.

4. Calamostachjs Binneyaua {Schimp.). By Thomas Hick, B.A., B.Sc.

     The object of this paper is to revife our knowledge of the structure and affi-
nities of Calamostachys Binneyana in the light of a series of preparations which
have not hitherto been described or published.

     The spike consisting of an axis surrounded by alternating whorls of bracts and
sporangiophores, the structure of each of these is examined in detail and compared
with the descriptions already published by Carruthers, Biuney, and Williamson.

     The central part of the axis, hitherto described as vascular, the author tinds to
be cellular, and to form a true pith which is circular or triangular in the transverse

section.

     Round the pith are, usually, three primary Avascular bundles, which are reduced
to the condition of those met with in ihe stems of Equisefjim and the youngest
branches of Catamites, i.e., to as many carinal canals, with annular or spiral
vessels adhering to the wall. AVhen secondary thickening occurs it commences
at these carinal canals, and usually three wedge-shaped masses of secondary
xylem are first formed; subsequently these may be united to form a- complete

zone.

     The cortical tissues of the axis, the 'nodal discs,' the bracts, and the sporangio-
phores are described with additional detail, and special attention is called to a
layer of large cells, often with black contents, which is found uear the margin of
the ' nodal discs,' and forms the lower or outer half of the bracts.

   A few additional details are also given of the structure of the sporangia, the

most important of which is the presence of a small mass of non-sporogenous tissue
at the proximal end, where the sporangia are contracted into the peduncles.

     As to the afHnities of the spike, the structure described is held to demonstrate

that it belongs to some carbonilerous plant whose affinities are more or less close

with the existing genus Equisetum. Such a plant we have in Calamites, to which

 the spike was referred by Carruthers in 1867. Against this determination AVil-
liamson set the vascular structure, as it was then interpreted, of the central part
 of the axis, and, relying on this, referred Calamontachys Binneyana to the Lyco-

podiaceaj. The proof now adduced that the centre of the axis is cellular removes
the objection raised by AVilliamson and brings us back to Calamites. The discovery

 of carinal canals at the periphery of the pith, as representatives of the primary
 vascular bundles, gives all that is needed to conlirra this view, and leaves little or
 no doubt tliat Calamostachys Binneyana is the fruit of some form of Calamites.

      Beyond this it is difficult to go. There are, however, two facts thfit suggest
 that the spilie is ]>robably tlie fruit of a Calamites of the Arthropitys type. These
 are (i.) that Arthropitys is the only form with structure found in Yorkshire and
 Lancashire where Calamostachys Binneyana is met with; and (ii.) that in the stems
 and leaves of Arthropitys we have a layer of large cells, with frequent black
contents, such as are found in the nodal discs and bracts of the spike.

5. Notes on Specimens of Myeloxylon (Brong.) from the Ilillstone Grit and

                  Coal-measures. By A. C. Seward, M.A., F.O.S.

    A number of specimens of IMyeloxylon examined by the author lend support

to the views of Schenk and others, that the anatomical structure of this fossil
plant agrees more closely with that of cycadean petioles leather than with the'
petioles of ferns. Whilst recognising a number of characters which suggest a
cycadean affinity, there are noted one or two points which render it probable that

Myeloxylon may eventually find its true position intermediate between ferns and
                                               --

     cycads. The specimen whicli supplies the most important evidence in the ques-
      tion as to relationship with living plants is one from the collection of the late
     Mr. Binney. In many of the vascular bundles of this Oldham example the phloem
      is well preserved, and a longitudinal section clearly demonstrates the position of
      the protoxylem. In examples previously described and figured the position of the
      protoxyleui has been inferred from the appearance, in transverse sections, of the
     xylem tracheids ; in the longitudinal section of the Oldham Myeloxylon the small
     xylem tracheids next to the phloem are seen to be spirally thickened, and are
      without doubt protoxylem.

           Another example of Myeloxylon described was found in a limestone band of
I Millstone Grit age : this furnishes facts of some interest in connection with the

      question of botanical affinity, and as regards fossilisation. Hitherto English
      specimens of Myeloxylon have only been found in the Coal-measures.

6. Observations on tJie Stmchire of Cystopns Candidas.

                 By Harold W. T. Wagek.

In this paper a short account is given of the structure of the vegetative and

reproductive organs of Ct/stopus candtdus, a fungus parasitic on cruciferous plants,

and especially abundant on the common shepherd's-purse Capsella bursa-pastoris

--on which it forms white shining patches, often of considerable extent on the

stem, leaves, and fruits.

The mycelium consists of non-septate hypha3 which ramify in all directions

between the cells of the host plant, and often produce extensive hypertrophy of

the organ attacked. Here and there small spherical haustoria are developed on

the hyphse, and these penetrate directly into the cell cavities.

Both hypliie and haustoria contain a granular protoplasm, in which numerous

nuclei can be seen. The structure of these nuclei can be made out by careful

staining and examination under a sufficiently high power, as was shown by Fisch,

with whose observations mine in the main agree. Each nucleus is vesicular, and

contains a large nucleolus which stains deeply and is surrounded by a less deeply

stained substance, in which some indications of a granular or thread-like structure

may at times be observed.

Tue reproductive organs are of two kinds, asexual and sexual. The asexual

organs are formed just beneath the epidermis of the host plant : they are club-

shaped branches of the mycelium, from which zoosporaugia are cut off by con-

striction and formation of a double cell wall at the apex. Tliese branches contain

Agranular protoplasm derived fi-om the mycelium, and numerous vacuoles.  few

nuclei are found scattered in the protoplasm, the number behig variable, from five

to twelve. The structure of the nucleus is similar to that in the mycelium, but is

more easily made evident.

In the formation of a sporangium a part of the protoplasm accumulates at the

apex, together with a few nuclei, four or five, or perhaps more ; this is then sepa-

Arated from the club-shaped branch by constriction of the cell membrane.

double cell wall is then formed which completely cuts oil' the sporangium from

the branch on which it is formed. The sporangium is thus, from the beginning,

a multinucleated cell. Each nucleus at a later stage becomes the nucleus of a

zoospore without undergoing further division.

The nuclei found in the club-shaped branches are probably derived directly

from the mycelium, no division stages having been observed in the sporangiophore

itself. It is possible, however, that owing to the smallness of the nuclei the

division stages are masked.

The sexual organs, antheridia and oogonia, also contain numerous nuclei.

According to Fisch the oogonium contains from ten to twenty nuclei, the anthe-

ridium thi-ee or four. I find more than this in many cases. In the formation of

the oosphere the protoplasm separates into periplasm and gonoplasm, a cell wall

appears round the gonoplasm ; a large number of nuclei remain in the periplasm,

but the gonoplasm does not appear to possess nuclei at this stage ; at a later stage.
778 REPORT-- 1892.

however, during t'ae formation of the exospore a number of nuclei make their ap-

pearance in the oospore around a central oil-globule. These observations do not
agree with those of Fisch. According to this observer all the nuclei of the
oogonium fuse together to form the nucleus of the oosphere. According to Dan-
geard the central nucleus of Fisch is nothing more than an oil-globule, and, so far

as my observations go, I agree with him. Soon after the separation of the oosphere

a quantity of oil begins to accumulate in or near the centre. This is stained
deeply by hrematoxylin or picro-nigrosin, and might be easily mistaken for a

nucleus. Its oily nature may be determined, according to Dangeard, by soaking
the sections for some time in chloroform, when it disappears and a vacuole is left.
The oil-globule gradually increases in size vmtil the exosporium is fully formed.

It then takes up about one-third of the diameter of the cavity of the oospore.
     The disappearance of the nuclei of the oosphere during the earlier stages of its

development is probably only apparent, some change taking place, of the nature of
which we are not yet cognisant. It is probable that these nuclei are included in
the oosphere at the time of its separation from the gonoplasm.

    The problem of fertilisation is an important one, but is difficult to settle. At

an early stage the antheridium contains numerous nuclei which pass over at a
later stage into the fertilising tube of the antheridium, but whether they pass into
the oospore is a question which I have not been able to settle.

        7. On the Affinity of Nuclein for Iron, and other Substances.
                      By Professor G. Gilson, of Louvain.

An iron-holding nuclein was discovered some years ago by Bunge ' in the

yolk of the hen's egg, and another by Zaleski- in the liver cells of various animals.

Grounded on these two observations, as well as on some personal researches,

Macallum, of Toronto, was led to the generalisation that the nuclein of every cell

contains iron as a necessary' constituent of itself. I know also that R. Schneider,

in 1888, presented to the Physiological Society of Berlin microscopical prepara-

tions showing the reaction of iron in the nucleus ; but I have not been able to
find out where he published an account of his work.

     Macallum, like Schneider,^ tried to detect iron in the nucleus itself by micro-

chemical means. He succeeded in that by keeping cells under the action of

--ammonium sulphide, in a warm oven, a rather long time two or three weeks.

Recently, however, he declared he has arrived at the same results by a much

easier  process *                                  but, as far as  I know, he  has  not, up to this  time,  published his
                                                ;

new method. The biological importance of Macallum's conclusion is too obvious

to need any further explanation. But on the other hand, as long as there remains

the slightest doubt about the fact itself, all kinds of theoretical considerations on

the svibject would be of no use to positive science. I took upon myself to verify

Macallum's observations, and I found very soon that the question is by far more

difficult than it might appear.

I also succeeded in detecting iron in the nucleinic elements or chromatosomes

of the nucleus, not only by the action of ammonium sulphide alone, but by various

other means.

Generally speaking, an intact nucleus gives no reaction with the usual re-

agents of iron compounds. But I remarked, on the contrary, that when nuclein

has been recently submitted to the action of various chemical agents, it very clearly

gives evidence of the presence of the metal. Amongst the numerous substances I

tried, sulpliuvic acid and sulpliurous anhydride gave tlie best results, thougli manj'

other agents, especially saline solutions, produce tlie same effect.

    When nuclei, previously steeped for a certain time in these liquids, are treated

with ammonium sulphide their chromatic elements take a greenish-hlack colour,

while the action of an acidulated solution of potassium ferricyanide gives them an

intense blue colour, caused by the formation of Turnbull's blue.

These reactions are strictly limited to the chromatic filaments or chromato-

somos of tlie nucleus, the protoplasm remaining absolutely colourless. In pre-

sence of such a perspicuous reaction, there cannot remain the slightest doubt about

the presence of iron in the nucleinic elements actually under observation.

    But a question now arises : Is Macallum right when he contends that ' the

--chromatin of every cell, animal or vegetable, is an iron compound'? that is to

say, a regular chemical combination "with fixed proportions.

I have no peremptory objection to oppose to Macallum's conclusion. But,

though his experiments seem to have been carefully carried out, I must confess 1

am not entirely satisfied with the accuracy of his generalisation, and cannot help

thinking that the union of nuclein with iron might be a rather accidental com-

bination taking place after death only, and similar to that which it efl'ects with

many other substances, especially colouring matters.

This suggestion is not a mere supposition; it proceeds from some observationa

I have made lately.

I was able to ascertain that dead nuclein has a very strong afUnity for iron

compounds. The nuclei of freshly extracted cells, when steeped in a solution of

sulphate of iron, FeSO^, even as weak as 1 for 2,000 parts of water, take with

ammonium sulphide or potassium ferricyanide a much more intense coloura-

Ation than they did before, when simply treated with sulphuric acid.        conse-

quence of that observation on dead nuclein is, that it is extremely ditlicult to

ascertain wliether living nuclein really contains iron, or whether it only absorbs it,

after it has been killed, out of the blood or other surrounding liquids, or even out

of the reagents themselves if they are not absolutely free from iron. Biologists

ought therefore to test their reagents very carefully before using them, and also

to take great care to avoid the contact of the slightest trace of organic or inorganic

iron with the cells. And that is not an easy task at all, for everyone knows that

this metal spoils everything, and is everywhere throughout nature.

For my part, though my reagents were as pure as possible, I am not certain at

myall, as far as the present, that the iron made visible in        preparations really

belonged to the living nuclein, and had not been absorbed after death only.

Macallum did not experimentally ascertain this affinity of nuclein for iron com-

pounds. I know, however, that he used to treat his objects with an acidulated

alcoholic mixture, called Bunge's fluid, a liquid which is supposed to take out, after

ten hours of action, all the organic and inorganic iron, excepting that combined

with nuclein. But I have observed that Bunge's liquid does not take away the

iron artificially combined with dead nuclein even after six days.

     I observed also that various iron compounds are attracted by nuclein, and
that its affinity is stronger for the ferrosum radical than for the ferricum. But

iron is not the only metal which nuclein can absorb and retain. I succeeded in

fixing in it manganese, nickel, and even copper, which all gave in the nucleus only

their usual reactions. Nickel is almost as strongly attracted as iron itself is.

Molybdenum also is retained by nuclein, and this last observation induces me to be

cautious about another method of micro-chemical technic recently published. Dr.

Lilienfeld, just a month ago, announced he had discovered a method of detecting

phosphorus in the nucleus, with the aid of ammonium molybdate and pyrogallol. I

suspect that the yellow-brown colouration he regards as characteristic of the

phosphorus is caused by the accumulation of ammonium molj'bdate in the nuclein

the brownish colouration that ammonium molybdate itself gives with pyrogallol is

darker in the nucleus, not because nuclein contains phosphorus, but because it

retains more of the ammonium molybdate than the protoplasm does.

1 may add also that other substances found in the cell have a similar attrac-

tion for iron. Macallum pointed out that amyloid substances contain iron, and I
                                                                                             --

780 REPORT-- 1892.

have observed that the silk of certain insects (chironomus, for instance) seems to
possess a stronger affinity for this metal than nuclein itself.

     To sum up briefly the present state of the question, it is now certain that

dead nuclein, as well as other substances found in the cell, have a very strong
affinity for various compounds of iron and of other metals, or even negative
chemical bodies. Thus the difficult question arises, whether the presence of iron
in the nucleinic element during life is constant and normal, and whether this
metal is necessary for the chemical activity of the nucleus.

     I hope these remarks will induce other biologists to undertake similar researches
on a question that seems to require more than a single man's activity ; and that

is the reason why I resolved to pubUsh my results in their present incompleta

form.

                                                            By Professor G. Gilson, oJ Louvain.

    The fact that metallic compounds are easily fixed in nuclein suggested to me a

pecidiar method of staining nuclei that, perhaps, might be of some use for special
histological and cytological researches. It consists either in keeping cells, pi'e-
viously hardened, in the metallic solution during a certain time, or in adding this

latter directly to the usual fixing liquids. Then, after the solution has been

thoroughly washed out, the objects are put into ammonium sulphide or potassium

ferricyanide, or into both, and washed again.

I succeeded by this method in staining the chromatic elements of many

animal and vegetable cells, after the action of picro-sulphuric acid, Perenyi's fluid,

mycorrosive sublimate, especiallj^ the acid solution used in                                 laboratory, and others.

But I did not succeed up to the present, after using Flemming's fluid or other

chromic liquids.

The colouration is always characteristic, provided the object has been suffi-

ciently washed before the reagent is applied.

    I am still studying the best method to get a good dark colouration. Satis-

factory results, however, have been obtained with the following solution, as well

for fixing and hardening the cell as for staining the nuclei :

After some hours' steeping in this fluid, objects are washed with weak alcohol,

then with water, and put into ammonium sulphide for a few minutes. Alter

another washing with alcohol and with water they are steeped for about half an

hour in a weak solution of potassic ferricyanide acidulated with hydrochloric acid

and washed again.

Each of the substances composing the solution, except alcohol, has the effect

of making nuclei colourable with ammonium sulphide or with potassium ferri-

cyanide                                         but  I  noticed  that  better  results  are  obtained when they are mixed
                                             ;

together in the above-mentioned proportions.

The action of potassium ferricyanide is much quicker and more intense when it

succeeds that of ammonium sulphide. This latter does not harm in the slightest
way the cells previously treated with the mixed solution or with the usual fixing

liquids, though it seems better, at all events, not to use it too concentrated.

     10 Conditions affecting Plant Life in a Toivn Atmosphere.

                      By G. H. BAir,EY, D.Sc, Ph.D.

     Altliougli it is well known that plants in towns exist under very unfavourable

conditions, there is very little precise information as to the nature of these

Aconditions.  series of observations extending over more than a year, and carried

out by tlie Town Gardening Committee of the Manchester Field Naturalists, in

conjunction witli the Royal Horticultural Society, have supplied many important

details, a summary of which is given below.

   A1. comparative measure of the amount of light received each day at stations

in different parts of Manchester and district and in other localities shows that,

whilst tl>e record for the suburbs of a large town falls below that of a country

district, there is a still greater falling off to the extent of 50 per cent., or even more,

within the town area. For the same period of the year the measure for bright
sunshine is ten to twenty times that for dull weather, and as much as 300 times

that during dense fog. As to the effect of the season, an hour's sunshine at

midday in June gives five times the record of that for December.

     Moreover, comparative measures for sunshine taken simultaneously in Switzer-

land, Torquay, and the suburbs of Manchester were in the proportion 20 ; 11 : 3.
     2. The amount of sulphurous acid in town air in heavy weather is ten to

twenty times that in bright clear weather, and in fog the proportion is still greater.

    3. Freshly fallen rain collected in Manchester showed as much as seventy

parts per million of sulphuric acid.

     Snow is usually more free from sulphuric acid than rain, whilst rime, which
has formed on the leaves during frost, is by far the most impure form of moisture

which comes in contact with plants, and samples have been collected containing

nearly 400 parts per million of sulphuric acid. Estimations have also been made

of the amount of organic matter and soot deposited on the leaves of plants, and

the nature of the deposit has been examined.

11. Some Alhucas and their Eyhrids. By John H. Wilson, B.Sc, F.R.S.E.

     The African liliaceous genus, Albuca, is easily recognised by the cucuUate and
connivent inner segments of the perianth, which commonly conceal the essential

organs as in a capsule. The writer confined his remarks to the following
species : A. con/mbosa, A. fastigiatn, A. caudata, A. juncifolia, A. trichophylla,

A. major (?), and an unidentified species.
     During the past six years a number of hybrids have been raised by the writer.

     Using the initial letter as an abbreviation of the specific name, and placing the

seed-bearing parent before the sign of hybridity, the following is the series involv-

    Two capsules were also borne by the unidentified species, resulting in the one

case from double poUination by tx{fxc), and m; and in the other by c, and

/ X (/x c). It will be instructive to see, by study of the hybrids furnished by

these experiments, which pollen of the three kinds applied has been eftective.

    A brief description of the prominent features of the hybrids of previous years

was given, reference being especially made to the bulbs which, no less than the
flowers and foliage, aftbid many points of interest. The characters of certain of

them have already been discussed ('Botanisch Jaarboek,' vol. iii. 1891, p. i>33).
      Hybrids between species having in the one parent erect, and in the other

cernuous flowers, are txc, tx{fxc), and {fxc)xj. The characters of both
parents are fairly equally blended iu the first two. The flowers during the day

12. The Hmhrijo-sac of Angiosperins is a 8poroci/te and not a Macrospore.

                          By GusTAV Mann, M.B., CM.

     The development of the ovule and its embryo-sac has been studied in Myosuru't
minimus, L. Three stages may be distinguished :

    1. An early stage, during which one physiological and several non-physiological

archespores and one physiological and two or three non-physiological embryo- sac-

cells are formed.

    An2. intermediary period, ending with the formation of eight sexual nuclei

within the sac.

   A3. final stage, during which the ovum matures and the primary endosperm-

--cell is formed by the conjugation of two sexual primordial cells.
     A. Early Stage. There are several archespores, but only one undergoes further
development, and this, the physiological one, divides into two cells, one of which

lies next the plerome elements of tiie ovule. This one attains a larger size, and

precedes in redivision its sister cell, which abuts on the dermatogen.
     Four cells are thus derived from the physiological archespore, and of these that

one lying next the plerome develops into tlie physiological embryo-sac ; the three

remaining cells must be regarded as non-physiological embryo-sacs. In all the

cells derived from the functional archespore, gelatiuisation of the cull-walls takes

--place a phenomenon quite analogous to that occurring in other sporocytes, e.(j.,

pollen-mother-cells, and in all probability analogous to what occurs in animal ova
generally, the zona pellucida being the wall of a sporocyte, the ovum proper

equalling physiologically a female cell, the polar bodies being non-physiological

female cells.

The author's view has been conflrmed by (1) Guignard, who discovered that in

the embryo-sac and pollen-mother cell, at the time of their formation, the number

of chromatin segments becomes reduced  by half                                      (2)  by  Dodel  and  Overton, who
                                                                                 ;

discovered, quite independently of each other, that the synergidffi are non-

physiological ova, as proved by the fact that they may become fertilised and

--develop into embryos.
     B. Intermediary Period. The functional embryo-sac cell shows no gelatinisa-
tion in that cell-wall which is in contact with the plerome elements to allow n
ready transit of nutritive material through it.

     The embryo-sac cell enlarges, one or more vacuoles are formed, and the nucleus
divides. The protoplasm does not divide immediately, but does so later on, in
about 50 per cent, of cases, by the formation of one or two membranes separating

the apical half of the sac from the basal half.
     The two nuclei in the sac divide and redivide, thus giving rise to eight nuclei

namely, the ovum, two synergidae, two primordial cells, and three antipodes. The
basal half of the sac, being supplied more abundantly with nourishment, precedes

the apical half in division ; its monasters are larger, &c.

   --C. Final iStaqe. As the sac enlarges the nucellar cells and the non-functional

embryo-sacs perish; albuminoid compounds, set free by their death, enter the

apical end of the physiological or functional embryo-sac, the basal end and the

ovum being supplied with food derived from the jilerome elements. This is the
reason why the nuclei of the syuergidse are placed next the dermatogen ; why the
nucleus of the ovum is placed next the cavity of the sac ; why the vacuoles occupy
respectively the reverse position. The synergidre are, normally, non-functional,

because want of food leads to their degeneration before the flower is ready for

conception.

     The two primordial cells giving rise to the primary endosperm-nucleus (Stras-
burger's secondary nucleus) are sexual cells ; and the resulting zygote is a true
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                       783

   embryo, whicb, however, is destined to be consumed by tbe stronger ombryo which
   is the oflspring of the ovum and the extr.aneous sexual cell derived from the pollen-

   grain.

       The three antij)odes usually do not act as sexual cells, but they may perhaps

   undergo a conjugation similar to that occurring between the two primordial cells

   (^Sr.illa nutans).

         Criticism of the current assumption that the embryo-sac is a macrosjiore.

       Summary of facts in favour of the view, first advanced by the author, that the

   embryo-sac is a sporocyte.

    Spinal Nerves in Mammals. By Arthur Robinson, M.I)., Senior

     Demonstrator of Anatomy at the Oivens College, Manchester.

1. In cat and rabbit embryos of eleven proto-vertebral somites, and in mouse

and rat embryos of a similar stage of development, a continuous cord of nerve-cells

extends backwards from just within the posterior part of the auditor}- depression

along the dorso-lateral angle of the medulla and spinal cord. At this period the

cord of cells is connected with the dorsal extremity of the neural tube by a series

of cellular strands, which are so numerous and so closely opposed that they almost:

form a continuous lamina, which is only one cell thick.

2. During the period of formation of the secondary optic cup this cellular cord

I (a) loses its connection with the dorsal extremity of the neural tube (b) becom.ee-

3. At a later period, in cat embryos of 9 mm., in mice of from 2i-5 mm., and

in rat embryos of a similar stage of development, the cord of cells in the region of
the first four somites is enlarged in three places. One enlargement is situated in

relation with the fourth somite, which is in the cervical region ; the other two are

in relation with the second and third somites, which belong to the occipital region.

The cellular cord is also enlarged in the region of the first somite, but this enlarge-

ment is continuous with the enlargement in the pre-^mitic region, and cannot be

distinctly separated from it.

     4. (a) The ganglionic enlargement in the pre-somitic region becomes converted
into the root ganglia of the glosso-pharyngeal and vagus nerves.

     (p) The ganglionic enlargement in relation with the fourth somite becomes

the tirst cervical ganglion.

     (c) In the rat and tlie mouse the ganglionic enlargements in relation with the
second and third somites become connected with the spinal accessory nerve, but
in the cat the enlargement in relation with the third somite becomes united with

the most posterior root of the hypo-glo.ssal nerve.
     5. After the separation of the cellular cord from the dorsum of the neural tube

a series of nerve roots are developed, and by means of these the cellular cord and
its ganglionic swellings become secondarily connected with the neural tube in the
region of the angle between the alar and basal laminse.

     6. The nerve roots are divisible into two series :

   A(a) dorsal series, which pass partly into the cellular portion of the neural

tube and partly into the white columns in the region of the ascending roots of the
vao-us and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. These roots are from twelve to fifteen in
number, and in the region of the spinal accessory nerve they appear to terminate
almost entirely in the cellular wall of the neural tube dorsal to the next series of

roots.

   A(6) lateral series, which leave the neural tube either together with, or a short

distance ventral to, the dorsal series. Many of these roots pass beneath the

ganglionic chain, but others appear to be connected either with the ganglia or the
cellular strand which unites them. Centrally these roots are connected with the
dorsal angle of a column of cells situated along the ventro-lateral aspect of the
neural tube, which ultimately becomes the anterior grey cornu and its cephalic
continuation. Peripherally they pass, in the region of the second and third
somites, into the spinal accessory nerve, and further forward into the stems of the
"losso-pharyngeal and vagus nerves. In the region situated between the fourth
and eighth "somites they pass directly into the spinal accessory nerve, and have no

connection with the ganglia of the cervical nerves.
     7. The cellular commissure, which in the early stages can be traced backwards

beyond the cervical region, terminates in the later stages as a continuous cord, at

the second cervical ganglion, but traces of it can be found much further back-

wards.

     8. The dorsal roots of the cervical ganglia enter the cord on the same level as
the dorsal roots of the accessory and vagus nerves, and terminate, like the dorsal
roots of the vagus, partly in the white columns and partly in the cells which are

afterwards situated at the region of the base of the posterior grey horns.

     0. The hypo-glossal roots spring from the ventro-lateral angle of the neural
tube, taking origin from the column of cells which in the cervical and post-cervical

regions becomes converted into the anterior grey cornu.
     The most anterior rootlets are collected into a small bundle which lies in front

of the first somite. The remaining rootlets are gathered into three bundles, one
of which lies in relation with the ventral portion of each of the three first somites,
and below the level of the somites all four bundles are collected into one trunk.

7. On the Cerebral Commissiires in the Marsupialia and Monotremata}
                       By Johnson Symington, M.I)., F.li.S.E.

     The author gave an account of the literature of the subject, discussing more
particularly the views of Owen and Flower. In 1837 Professor (now Sir Richard)

Owen published in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' a memoir, On the Structure

of the Brain in Marsupial Animals. In this communication it was asserted that

the brains of the Marsupialia differed from those of the placental mammals in

having no corpus callosum. In 1865 Professor W. H. Flower published a paper

in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' in which he controverted the conclusions of
Owen, and maintained that a corpus callosum was present in the Marsupialia and
Monotremata.

     The material used by the author in his study of the subject included the brains
of the Ornithorhyuchus, Echidna, and various Marsupialia. Serial sections were
mounted for microscopic examination and stained with carmine, or by the
Weigert-Pal method. Sections were also made for naked-eye examinations upon

Mbrains hardened in tiller's tluid.

     The conclusions arrived at agreed in general with those of Owen.
     In the Marsupialia and Monotremata the anterior commissure is as large as, and
generally much larger than, any other transverse commissure of the cerebrum, and
it unites the whole of the cortex of the two hemispheres, except the gyri dentati
and hippocampi_majores._ They have no true corpus callosum, and the superior
transverse commissure is simply a commissure for the gyri dentati and hippocampi
majores-- the hippocarapal commissure of Owen. The peculiar position of this
commissure is due to the fact that the convolutions it unites extend much farther
forwards than they do in the placental mammals.

     The Monotremata and Marsupialia agree in the general arrangement of their
cerebral commissure, and both differ very distinctly from that found in the lower
placental mammals so far as examined.

                  9. Note on the Geographical Distrihution of Ascidians.

                   By Professor W. A. Heedman, D.Sc, F.B.S.

    When the large collection of Ascidians, both simple and compound, brouo-ht

home by the Challenger expedition is arranged according to the latitudes where

the specimens were collected, it is seen that the great majority belong to the
southern hemisphere, and most of them to the far south, such 'localitie's as the
Straits of Magellan, Kerguelen Island, and Bass Strait being especially rich. Then
high northern latitudes follow the extreme south, while tropical and semi-tropical
regions are, on the whole, poorly represented. Moreover, the species from these
high latitudes were mostly obtained in abundance, and the individuals are mosth'
of large size, so that not only in number of species, but also in actual mass, the
bulk of the collection is from the far south or north. Hence it seems obvious that
the Ascidians flourish best in comparatively cold waters.

     However, it might seem improbable that the Challenger collection, extensive
though it is both in species and in localities, would represent the distribution of
tlie group quite adequately and correctly, so I have lately gone over the recorded
geographical distribution of all the known species of simple and compound
Ascidians, with the result that although, as might be expected, the long-continued
and minute investigations of the shores of north-west Europe and the Mediterranean
have helped to raise the numbers for temperate seas, still a very considerable

proportion of the species belong to the extreme north and south, while the tropical

Ascidian fauna is relatively scanty and the individuals of small size.

     The gigantic Molgulidce (the largest of simple Ascidians), such as Ascopera
gigantea, A.pedunculata, and Molgula ffigmitea, are only known from the far

south the large Boltenias are from the north and the south, while to take an
                                 ;

example from nearer home, the small Styelas of our seas are represented on the

northern coasts of Europe and Asia, and in the Greenland seas, by large specimens

of Styela rustica and S. rnonoceros.

    Then in regard to the abundance of individuals, I know of no records of great

hauls from tropical seas, while in the Straits of Magellan the Challenger obtained

ahout forty specimens of one large species {Molgula gigantea), and a dozen of

another (Ascidia Challenger i), at Kerguelen Island, and large numbers of Amarou-
ciuin variahile and other compound Ascidians were also obtained, and last summer,

while dredging from Mr. Alfred Holt's yacht Argo, ahout eleven miles north of

the North Cape, I brought up a dredge net about 3 feet by 1 foot, and about

y feet long, crammed to the mouth with splendid specimens of the two closely

allied species Styela rustica and S. rnonoceros ; there must have been many

-- Weliundreds perhaps thousands.  only picked out and preserved what seemed a

few of the better specimens, the remainder being shovelled overboard, and yet I

find that about 300 were kept. These large species must evidently be present ia

enormous profusion at the bottom in some places.

On the whole, then, I consider that this more extended survey of the group

points to the same general conclusion which I arrived at from an examination of

--the Challenger collection viz., that Ascidians attain their greatest development

both in numbers and size in the colder northern and southern seas.

Although certain genera seem, with our present knowledge, restricted to

particular regions, none of the more important families is confined to northern

or southern seas or to the tropics. I have lately received from the Austrahan

coast members of the Botryllidce, a family not previously recorded from southern

Esas.

     The examination lately of two collections of Ascidians from the north of
Norway and Finmark, made, the one by Canon Norman and the other by myself,
from the Argo, recalled vividly the apparent abundance of Ascidians in these
northern waters, and caused me to look into the records bearing on the matter.

          10. Note on Atrial, or Glrcumcloacal, Tentacles in the Tunicata,

                       By Professor W. A. Herdman, F.B.S.

     In the interesting paper (' Bulletin Scientifique,' .Tuly 1892) by Dr. C. Julin,
which forms the first part of his ' Les Ascidiens des Cotes du Boulonnais,' I notice
it is stated, on page 30, ' L'existence d'une couronne de tentacules circumcloacaux

n 'a iamais, a ma connaissance du moins, 6i6 signalee chez aucune espece d'ascidien

simple ou compost. ' If it has escaped Julin's attention that I described and
figured atrial tentacles in 1882 in a .simple ascidian, and in 1886 in a compound

one, then I fear it may have escaped notice altogether, perhaps because, along

with some other anatomical observations and some theoretical conclusions and
suo-o-esiion?, it is buried in the Challenger reports in a mass of detailed descrip-

tions of new species. At any rate, the existence of atrial tentacles is evidently
so little known that this brief note upon what I have seen of them may be of

interest.

     In the simple ascidian Bathyojwiis mirabilis from the Southern Ocean, at a
depth of l,(iOO fathoms, there are two circlets of minute tentacular processes which
project from the inner surface of the cloacal wall close to the atrial aperture.
These atrial tentacles are all of the same size, and are placed at about their own
length apart {see 'Rep. Tun. Ghall. Exp.,' part ], vol. vi. 1882, page 167, and

pi. xxiv. tig. 12, at. t.).

     The ascidiozooids of the compound (?) ascidian, Goodsiria placenta, from the
Cape of Good Hope, have also atrial tentacles, very much like those of Bathyoncus
                                                                                  --

mirabiUs, but forminnf a single series. In the original description (op. cit., part 2,

vol. xiv. 1886, page 331, and pi. xliii. fig. 10) I wrote as follows : ' At the base of
the atrial siphon, where the invaginated layer of test ends, there is a slight ridge

which bears a series of small tentacles projecting freely into the peribranchial

cavity. These atrial tentacles are much smaller than the ordinary or branchial

tentacles, and there are only twelve of them. The position of the atrial tentacles

in relation to the atrial siphon corresponds exactly' to the position of the branchial

tentacles at the base of tbe branchial sipliou, but their use at the entrance to the

peribranchial cavity is not obvious. It has been observed in some simple ascidians

that the current of water which usually flows in at the branchial aperture and out

at the atrial is occasionally reversed for a short period, the atrial aperture be-

coming inhalent. Possibly in the present species this habit may have become so

marked as to have favoured the development of a circle of atrial tentacles, which

would act as tactile organs waving in the current of water entering the animal.'

     During the last few years I have found similar atrial tentacles in at least three

new species of the compound (?) ascidian genus Chorizoconnus, viz., Ch. sydney-

ensis, Ch. leumphceus, and Ch. subfuscus, all from Australia. In each case they

form a single circlet, as in Goodsiria placenta, and there are about twenty tentacles.

myThey are briefly referred to in  ' Revised Classification of the Tunicata ' (1891),

at page 636, and will be figured in the forthcoming ' Catalogue of Tunicata in the

Australian Museum.' And, lastly, Julin has made the interesting discovery that

ntrial tentacles are also present in Styelopsis grossidaria.

I have queried above the genera Goodsiria and Chorizocormus as being com-

pound ascidians because they belong to the family Polystyelidte, in regard to

which it must be considered still doubtful whether the masses of ascidiozooids are

true colonies. But although they may be colonial forms now, there can be no

doubt that phylogenetically the Polystyelidre are closely related to the sub-family

Styelinfe of tbe Cynthidaj, the sub-family to which both Bathyoncus and Stye-

lopsis belong. So we arrive at the interesting conclusion that the four genera in
which up to now atrial tentacles have been noticed, although differing widely

from one another in appearance, structure, and habitat, are yet phylogenetically

rather closely related. 1 think it not unlikely that atrial tentacles will be found,

if looked for, in other members of the groups Styelinfe and Polystyelida3.

    Another point : it is an interesting fact, and may have some significance, that
putting aside Bathyoncus mirahilis, in regard to the conditions of life of which we

--know nothing all tbe five species in which atrial tentacles have as yet been

demonstrated form either colonies or aggregations, i.e., they have numbers of small

individuals or ascidiozooids massed together. It is quite conceivable that, under

these crowded conditions, it may be some advantage to tbe animals to have the
power (to return to the suggestion I made in the Challenyer Report) of frequently

reversing the current of water or of using the atrial for a time as the inhalent
aperture possibly, for example, because of being so placed amongst neighbours

-- --that the atrial siphon is able to draw upon a purer supply of water and in any

such case the advantage of having the entrance to the peribranchial cavity pro-

vided with a circlet of tentacles is obvious.

      Possibly Julin, in his recent investigations on Styelopsis yrossidaria, has already

solved the problem of the meaning <ind use of tbe atrial tentacles, and may be able
either to support or demolish the above suggestion. In any case I shall be much

interested to learn his views on the matter.

    Two small specimens of Myxine ylutinosa were described. The one measured

G'5 centimetres, the other 15 centimetres. It was stated that an Ammoccete stage
appeared to be unrepresented in Myxine, but that the individual underwent a
metamorphosis, as was proved by the 'diphyodont' dentition.

internal anatomy revealed among other things several rows of teeth in both roof

                    By Professor G. B, Howes and J. Harrison.

     The authors showed that the vertebral epiphyses are more fully developed than

--Albrecht has suspected, and that they appear late and rapidly ankylose with the

centra a feature of especial interest, in view of Lefevre's alleged discovery of fully

developed epiphyses in HaUtheriuni Schinzi and Metaxythermm. On comparison

with the Cetacea, they sought to associate the reduction of the epiphyses with
adaptation to an aquatic existence.

     In dealing with the limb-skeleton, they described a longitudinal cleavage of
the phalanges, akin to that recorded by Kiikenthal for the Cetacea. The only
structures observed which were at all comparable to supernumerary phalanges were
derivatives of the terminal (ungual) ones, arising proximally ; and the observa-
tions lend no support to Kukenthal's view that supernumerary phalanges are
epiphysial in origin.

     The first upper incisor and the four lower ones of either side were shown to
have milk predecessors, which are early absorbed. Five teeth were shown to be
present on either side of the sympliysial region of each mandibular ramus of
Manatus, the fifth one being claimed as a canine ; and, in this animal, the
authors described milk predecessors to the two anterior pairs of mandibular cheek
teeth. The authors finally discussed tlie bearings of the facts upon the inter-
relationships and affinities of the Sirenia, for whose presumed incisors a numerical
parallel alone exists in the Marsupialia and Soricidse.

                        By the Rev. Hilderic Friend, F.L.S.

     'We are indebted to the lamented Charles Darwin for any enthusiasm which has
been aroused among the pubHc in the subject of earthworms. The angler, how-
ever, was the pioneer student of terrestrial annelids, and to those who use the rod

we owe most of our popular names for earthworms. The first and only list yet
published in England appeared in 18G5, though many able monographs have

appeared on the Continent. In 1881 Darwin assumed the existence of eight or ten
.species of earthworms in England, and I have now to report the progress which
has been made in the subject since the publication of ' Vegetable Mould.' In
former times all our indigenous worms were ranged under the simple genus
Lximbricus, but in 1873 Eisen showed that they really belonged to four different

genera. He named them Lumbricus, Allolohophora, Allurus, and Dendrohfcna, but

the_ latter term has fallen into disuse, though I hope to show the wisdom of
reviving it for the true tree worms. The genus Lumbricus, tiH understood since
Eisen's time, first claims attention. It is distinguished by the ' mortise and tenon
arrangement of the head, the distribution of the setae in four couples, the indi-

somewhat complex nature. Four true and one abnormal species are now on

--record for these islands, as follows :

     1. The True Earthworm {L. terrestris, Linn.), which has only very recently been
properly defined, but may now be infallibly distinguished by its colour, the positiou

--of the setse, the shape of the tail which is flattened to enable it to grip its
--burrow and especiallj' the position of the girdle on segments 32 to 37.

   --2. The Ruddy Worm (i. rubescens, Friend). New, not only to England, but

to science, and recognised by the fact that its girdle commences on the thirty-

fourth and ends on the thirty-ninth segment. By this means, as well as by the

prominence of the male pores, it is easily distinguished from the next, which it

closely resembles in size and colour.

Worm3. The Red  (Z. rubellus, Iloffmeister) is the commonest representative

of the genus, and has the twenty-seventh to the thirty-second segments occupied

by the girdle.

    4. The Purple Worm (i. purpureus, Eisen) is usually much smaller than any

of the foregoing, though it exactly corresponds with them in colour, shape, and

general appearance. Its girdle extends from the twenty-eighth to the thirty-third

segment.

5. Eisen's AVorm (Z. Eiseni, Levinsen), though inserted here, cannot be

regarded as a true member of the genus, as it lacks several of the characters of the

type. It is a very small worm, which frequently lives in decaying timber, and has

its girdle on the twenty-fourth to the thirty-first or thirty-second segment, without

the usual band on the under surface. I refer it to group No. 4 below.

    As its name implies, the genus Allolobophora is distinguished by the shape of

its lobe-insertion. The colour also is more variable than in Lumbricus, while the
setfe are not always in pairs, and the girdle occupies an indefinite number of

segments, on which the pores or bands, if present, are variously disposed. The

genus is best studied in groups, of which we have five in our fauna. Group No. 1

is represented by the Long VVorm {A. longa, Ude), which has been the cause of

endless confusion, owing to its wide dispersion and general similarity to the earth-

worm. Its specific nature was only determined half a dozen years ago.

Group No. 2 contains a species or sub-species new to science, and found at

present only in Dublin {A. hibernica, Friend), so far as Great Britain is concerned.

It has, however, been simultaneously found on the Continent, but no printed

account has j'et appeared. The well-known Brandling {A. fcetida, Sav.) also

belongs to this group, and a search in the Highlands might yield one or two new

species.

Group No. 3 has always presented great difficulties, which are now, however,

cleared away. The Turgid Worm {A. turgida, Eisen) and the Trapeze Worm

{A. trapezoidea, Duges) are difficult to distinguish. Midway between the Mucous

Worm {A. mucosa, Eisen) and the Green Worm {A. ehlorotica, Savigny) we have

Wormto place the newly discovered Welsh   {A. cambrica, Friend), whose specific

diflerences are only to be recognised by dissection.

Group No. 4 contains several worms which are truly dendrobsenic or tree-

haunting. They are usually very small, and have their set,«E in eight almost equi-

distant rows. The Gilt-tail {A. subrubicunda, Eisen) is the best known, and closely

Wormrelated to this is the Compressed     {A. constricta, Rosa), which has hitherto

been taken by me only in the extreme South of England. The genuine Tree

Worm {A. nrborea, Eisen) lives in the very heart of damp, decaying timber, and is

Wormoften associated with the Celtic      {A. celtica, Rosa), which, however, keeps

near the bark, or lies in the soil underneath the wood. The type of Eisen's genus

Dendrobcena (I), boeckii, Eisen) may for the present be put here. It has only been

met with in Yorkshire and near Paisley, so far as my authenticated records go at

present. L. Eiseni, Lev., is very closely related to the members of this group.

Group No. 5 may be known by the large size of its members, whose setoe,

Wormunlike those of other large species, are wide apart. The Roving  {A. profuga,

Rosa) has this year been added to our English lists, and another species {A. com-

planata, Dugfes), whicli is the only one I have not personally studied, is recorded
on the strength of a recent memoir.

     There remains the genus Allurns, which is readily distinguished hy its square
tail and semi-aquatic habit. Its male pores also are on the thirteenth segment,
and there are only two or three species at present known to science. Of these, the
Square Tail {A. tetrcedrus, Savigny), the Quadrangular {A. tetraijonurus, Friend),
and the Golden Woi-m {A. Jiavus, Friend) are indigenous, and there are also some

interesting varieties.

     The generic differences are best understood by presenting the main features in
the form of a chart which was exhibited to the Section, and a complete list of all
the species at present known to occur in Great Britain is given in the paper.

    A wide field for research is opened up by the study of earthworms.

Their distribution, numbers, and utility ; the height to which they ascend, the
habitats they prefer, the parasites by which they are infested, the freaks and

abnormalities to which they are liable, are only a few of the many topics which may

be profitably studied, and concerning which I have for some years past been busily
accumulating a mass of interesting material.

18. On the Canalisation of Cells and the Continuity of Living Matter in
     Plants and Animals. By Dr. Louis Olivier, Editor of the ' Bevue

      generale des Sciences pures et appliquees.'

   We1. have long known that both in animals and plants certain cells, instead

of being completely closed, present in their walls pores which establish a communi-
cation between the cellular cavities. These cases have been especially observed in
organisms of a lower type (as, for instance, in the Siphonocladacese Algte), which
form, as it were, a connecting link between uni-cellular and multi-cellular forms.
In the latter, however, special groups of cells have been described, which com-
municate by their extremities. Such, for instance, are the sieve tubes of the liber
discovered by Hartig, the endosperm cells of certain monocotyledons observed by
Tangl, the cells of the pulvinus of the petiole of the sensitive plant and other
tissues specially described by Gardiner, &c.

      These instances of cellular canalisation were considered till recent years as
exceptional in the tissues of living organisms, where they seemed to be of strictly
local occurrence; so that the cell in the higher animals and plants was still looked
 on as a completely closed chamber; the cavity either containing or free from pro-
 toplasm could only have osmotic communication with its fellows.

      2. In 1885 I was led to suspect that this theory was erroneous, and to
 recognise even in highly differentiated tissues and in highly organised individuals
the canalisation of the cell-wall and the free passage of protoplasm through the
 narrow pores.

     On photographing under special conditions three sections of various tissues,
 artificially stained, I was surprised to see on the plates a very remarkable arrange-
 ment in the cell-walls, which direct observation had failed to reveal. I attributed

 this result to the fact that optical and chemical conditions in photography are in
 various respects different from those in direct vision, and I believed it possible to
 base on this observation a method of research supplementary to simple microscopical
 examination. The proofs I have obtained confirm this anticipation.

                                                                                       I

3. In order to see directly the canalisation of the cells under the microscope,

·we must use reagents capable of giving us a double stain.

   We cannot, however, make use of this method in all cases, for when the tissues

in which we wish to observe the protoplasm are living, reagents induce a contrac-

tion of the protoplasm into the cell-cavities and the rupture of the exceedingly fine

filaments which unite a cell to its fellows. To force, as it were, these filaments to

remain in position,! thought it desirable to produce a slow anoesthesis of the tissues

before fixing, hardening, cutting, and staining them. Osmic acid, which anatomists

often use, can be of no service to me, as it does not attack simultaneously the

various portions of the protoplasm surrounded by their cell-wall, and, moreover,

nearly always renders staining impossible at a later stage. I therefore had

recourse to true antesthetic agents, ether, chloroform, carbon disulphide, &c.

     The organism should be submitted in its entirety to the action of the vapours

of these reagents. When it has quite ' gone to sleep,' a fragment of the tissue
may be detached, plunged into alcohol containing picric acid, and then cut into

sections of ^J^ of a millimetre in thickness; if they are vegetable tissues, they
must be treated with dilute selenic acid, washed and double-stained.

The cellular membranes, already much thinned out and partly destroyed by the

selenic acid, are seen to be coloured red, for instance, while the protoplasmic

filaments which pass through them are coloured blue, like the protoplasm of the

cell-cavities, and are seen to be in continuity therewith.

    This method has allowed me to ascertain that in highly oi-ganised species, such

as Dicotyledons, the protoplasm is continuous from the extremity of the roots to

the extremities of the leaves. The protoplasm is differentiated in these various
regions, and exhibits many various properties, but remains everywhere in a state of

continuity.

4. It seemed to me that the method for photographing doubly coloured originals,

devised last year by MM. A. et L. Lumiere (of Lyon), would make this structure

myeasily visible. By photographing  preparations according to this method, I

have obtained examples on glass, showing the fine filaments of protoplasm coloured

blue clearly distinguished from the cell-wall membrane, which is coloured red.

THURSDAY, AUGUST 4.

The President delivered the following address :

Amongst the many questions upon which of late years light has been thrown by

deep-sea exploration and geological research, not the least interesting is that of

Howthe geographical development of coast-lines.  is the existing distribution of

land and water to be accounted for ? Are the revolutions in the relative position

of land and sea, to which the geological record bears witness, due to movements

Whyof the earth's crust or of the hydrosphere ?  are coast-lines in some regions

extremely regular, while elsewhere they are much indented ? About 150 years

ago the prevalent belief was that ancient sea-margins indicated a formerly higher

ocean-level. Such was the view held by Celsius, who, from an examination of the

coast-lands of Sweden, attributed the retreat of the sea to a gradual drying up of

the latter. But this desiccation hypothesis was not accepted by Playfair, who

thought it much more likely that the land had risen. It was not, however, until
after Von Buch had visited Sweden (1806-1808), and published the results of his

observations, that Playfair's suggestion received much consideration. Von Buch

concluded that the apparent retreat of the sea was not due to a general depression

--of the ocean-level, but to elevation of the land a conclusion which subsequently

obtained the strong support of Lyell. The authority of these celebrated men

gained for the elevation theory more or less complete assent, and for many years

it has been the orthodox belief of geologists that the ancient sea-margins of Sweden

and other lands have resulted from vertical movements of the crust. It has long

been admitted, however, that highly flexed and disturbed .strata require some other

explanation. Obviously such structures are the result of lateral compression and

crumpling. Hence geologists have maintained that the mysterious subterranean

forces have affected the crust in different ways. Mountain-ranges, they conceive,

are ridged up by tangential thrusts and compression, while vast continental areas

slowly rise and fall, with little or no disturbance of the strata. From this point

of view it is the lithosphere that is imstable, all changes in the relative level of

land and sea being due to crustal movements. Of late years, however, Traut-

schold and others have begun to doubt whether this theory is wholly true, and

to maintain that the sea-level may have changed without reference to move-

ments of the lithosphere. Thus Hilber has suggested that sinking of the sea-

level may be due, in part at least, to absorption, while Schmick believes that

the apparent elevation and depression of continental areas are reaUy the results

of grand secidar movements of the ocean. The sea, according to him, periodi-

cally attains a high level in each hemisphere alternately, the waters being at pre-

sent heaped up in the southern hemisphere. Professor Suess, again, believing

that in equatorial regions the sea is, upon the whole, gaining on the land, while
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                                                                                     795

in other latitudes the reverse would appear to be the case, points out that this is

in harmony with his -view of a periodical flux and reflux of the ocean between the
equator and the poles, lie thinks that we have no evidence of any vertical eleva-
tion afftscting wide areas, and that the only movements of elevation that take
place are those by which mountains are upheaved. The broad invasions and
transgressions of the continental areas by the sea, which we know have occurred
again and again, are attributed by him to secular movements of the hydrosphere

itself.

    Apart from all hypothesis and theory, we learn that tlie surface of the sea is

not exactly spheroidal. It reaches a higher level on the borders of the continents

than in mid-ocean, and it varies likewise in height at difPercnt places on the same

coast. The attraction of the Himalaya, for example, suffices to cause a difference

of 300 feet between the level of the sea at the delta of the Indus and on the coast

of Ceylon. The recognition of such facts has led Penck to suggest that the sub-

mergence of the maritime regions of North-west Europe and the opposite coasts of

North America, which took place at a recent geological date, and from wliich the

lands in question have only partially recovered, may have been brought about by

the attraction exerted by the vast ice-sheets of tlie Glacial period. But, as Dry-

galski. Woodward, and others have shown, the heights at Avhich recent marine
deposits occur in the regions referred to are much too great to be accounted for by

any possible distortion of the hydrosphere. The late James Croll had previously

endeavoured to show that the accumulation of ice over northern lands during

Glacial times would suffice to displace the earth's centre of gravity, and thus cause

the sea to rise upon the glaciated tracts. More recently other views have been

advanced to explain the apparently causal connection between glaciation and

submergence, but these need not be considered here.

Whatever degree of importance may attach to the various hypotheses of secvilar

movements of the sea, it is obvious that the general trends of the world's coast-lines

are determined in the first place by the position of the dominant wrinkles of the

lithosphere. Even if we concede that all ' raised beaches,' so called, are not neces-

sarily the result of earth-movements, and that the frequent transgressions of the

continental areas by oceanic waters in geological times may possibly have been

due to independent movements of the sea, still we must admit that the solid crust
of the globe has always been subject to distortion. And this being so, we cannot

doubt that the general trends of the world's coast-lines must have been modified

from time to time by movements of the lithosphere.

As geographers we are not immediately concerned with the mode of origin of

those vast wrinkles, nor need we speculate on the causes which may have deter-

mined their direction. It seems, however, to be the general opinion that the con-

figuration of the lithosphere is due simply to the sinking-in and crumpling-up of

the crust on the cooling and contracting nucleus. But it must be admitted that

neither physicists nor geologists are prepared with a satisfactory hypothesis to

account for the prominent trends of the great world-ridges and troughs. Accord-

ing to the late Professor Alexander Winchell, these trends may have been the
result of primitive tidal action. He was of opinion that the transmeridional pro-

gress of the tidal swell in early incrustive times on our planet would give the

forming crust structural characteristics and aptitudes trending from north to south.

The earliest wrinkles to come into existence, therefore, would be meridional or

Bubmeridional, and such, certainly, is the prevalent direction of the most con-

spicuous earth-features. There are many terrestrial trends, however, as Professor

Winchell knew, which do not conform to the requirements of  his  hypothesis                                                    but
                                                                                                                            ;

such transmeridional features, he thouglit, could generally be shown to be of later

origin than the others. This is the only speculation, so far as I know, which
attempts, perhaps not altogether unsuccessfully, to explain the origin of the main

trends of terrestrial features. According to other authorities, however, the area

of the earth's crust occupied by the ocean is denser than that over which the con-

tinental regions are spread. The depressed denser part balances the lighter elevated

portion. But why these regions of different densities should be so distributed no

one has yet told us. Neither does Le Conte's view, that the continental areas and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

the oceanic depressions owe tbeir origin to unequal radial contraction of the earth
in its secular cooling, help us to understand why the larger features of the globe

should te disposed as they are.

     Geographers must for the present be content to take the world as they find

it. What we do know is that our lands are distributed over the surface of a great

continental plateau of irregular form, the bounding slopes of which plunge down

more or less steeply into a vast oceanic depression. So far as geological research

has gone, there is reason to believe that these elevated and depressed areas are of

--primeval antiquity that they antedate the very oldest of the sedimentary forma-

tions. There is abundant evidence, however, to show that the relatively elevated

or continental area has been again and again irregularly submerged under tolerably

deep and wide seas. But all historical geology assures us that the continental

plateau and the oceanic hollows have never changed places, although from time

to time portions of the latter have been ridged up and added to the margins of the

former, while ever and anon marginal portions of the plateau have sunk down to
very considerable depths. "\Ve may thus speak of the great world-ridges as regions

of dominant elevation, and of the profound oceanic troughs as areas of more or

less persistent depression. From one point of view, it is true, no part of the earth's

surface can be looked upon as a region of dominant elevation. Our globe is a

cooling and contracting body, and depression must always be the prevailing move-

ment of the lithosphere. The elevation of the continental plateau is thus only

relative. Could we conceive the crust throughout the deeper portions of the

oceanic depression to subside to still greater depths, while at the same time the

continental plateau remained stationary, or subsided more slowly, the sea would

.necessarily retreat from the land, and the latter would then appear to rise. It is

improbable, however, that any extensive subsidence of the crust under the ocean

could take place without accompanying disturbance of the continental plateau;

and in this case the latter might experience in places not only negative but posi-

tive elevation. During the evolution of our continents, crustal movements have

again and again disturbed the relative level of land and sea, but since the general

result has been to increase the land surface and to contract the area occupied by

the sea, it is convenient to speak of the former as the region of dominant elevation,

and of the latter as that of prevalent depression. Properly speaking, both are

sinking regions, the rate of subsidence within the oceanic trough being in excess

of that experienced over the continental plateau. The question of the geographical

development of coast-lines is therefore only that of the dry lands themselves.

The greater land massss are all situated upon, but are nowhere co-e.xtensive

with, the area of dominant elevation, for very considerable portions of the con-

tinental plateau are still covered by the sea. Opinions may differ as to which

fathoms-line we should take as marking approximately the boundary between that

region and the oceanic depression                                                                                                                                                          and it is obvious, indeed, that  any line selected
                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

jnust be arbitrary and more or less misleading, for it is quite certain that the true

boundary of the continental plateau cannot lie parallel to the surface of the ocean.

In some regions it approaclies within a few hundreds of fathoms of the sea-level

in other places it sinks for considerably more than 1,000 fathoms below that level.

Thus, "while a very moderate elevation would in certain latitudes cause the land

to extend to the edge of the plateau, an elevation of at least 10,000 feet would

be required in some other places to bring about a similar result.

Although it is true that the land sm-face is nowhere co-extensive with the great

plateau, yet the existing coast-lines may be said to trend in the same general

direction as its margins. So abruptly does the continental plateau rise from the

oceanic trough, that a depression of the sea-level, or an elevation of the plateau, for

10,000 feet would add only a narrow belt to the Pacific coast between Alaska

and Cape Horn, while the gain of land on the Atlantic slope of America between

30° N. lat. and 40° S. lat. would not be much greater. In the higher latitudes of

the Northern Hemisphere, however, very considerable geographical changes would

be accomplished by a much less amount of elevation of the plateau. Were the

continental plateau to be upheaved for 3,000 feet, the major portion of the Arctic

Sea would become land. Thug, in general terms, we may say that the coast-lines
TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION E.                                          797

of Arctic and temperate Nortli America and Eurasia are further -withdrawn from

the edge of the continental plateau than those of lower latitudes.

In regions where existing coast-lines approach the margin of the plateau, they

are apt to run for long distances in one determinate direction, and, whether the

coastal area be liigh or not, to show a gentle sinuosity. Their course is seldom

interrupted by hold projecting headlands or peninsulas, or by intruding inlets,

while fringing or marginal islands rarely occur. To these appearances the northern

regions, as everyone knows, oU'er the strongest contrast. Not only do they trend

irregularly, but their continuity is constantly interrupted by promontories and

peninsulas, by inlets and fiords, while fringing islands abound. But an elevation

of some 400 or 500 fathoms only would revolutionise the geography of those

regions, and confer upon the northern coast-lines of the world the regularity which

at present characterises those of Western Africa.

It is obvious, therefore, that the coast-lines of such lands as Africa owe their

regularity primarily to their approximate coincidence with the steep boundary

slopes of the continental plateau, while the irregularities characteristic of the coast-

line of North-westeru Europe and the corresponding latitudes of North America

are determined by the superficial configuration of the same plateau, which in those

regions is relatively more depressed. I have spoken of the general contrast

between hi"-h and low northern latitudes, but it is needless to say that in southern

regions the coast-lines exhibit similar contrasts. The regular coast-lines of Africa

and South America have already been referred to, but we cannot fail to recognise

in the much indented sea-board and the numerous coastal islands of Southern Chili

a complete analogy to the fiord regions of high northern latitudes. Both are areas

of comparatively recent depression. Again, the manifold irregularities of the

coasts of South-ea.'itern Asia, and the multitudes of islands that serve to link that

contment to Australia and New Zealand, are all evidence that the surface of the

continental plateau in those regions is extensively invaded by the sea.

   A word or two now as to the configuration of the oceanic trough. There can

be no doubt that this differs very considerably from that of the land surface. It is,

upon the whole, flat or gently undulating. Here and there it swells gently up-

wards into broad elevated banks, some of which have been traced lor great

distances. In other places narrower ridges and abrupt mountain-like elevations

diversify its surface, and project again and again above the level of the sea, to form
the numerous islets of Oceania. Once more, the sounding-line has made us

acquainted with the notable fact that numerous deep depressions-- some long and

narrow, others relatively short and broad--stud the floor of the great trough. I

shall have occasion to refer again to these remarkable depressions, and need at

present only call attention to the fact that they are especially well-developed in

the region of the Western Pacific, where the floor of the sea, at the base of the

bounding slopes of the continental plateau, sinks in places to depths of three and

even of five miles below the existing coast-lines. One may further note the fact
that the deepest areas of the Atlantic are met with in like manner close to the
walls of the plateau-- a long ridge, which rises midway between the continents and

runs in the same general direction as their coast-lines, serving to divide the trough

of the Atlantic into two parallel hollows.                          __

But, to return to our coast-lines and the question of their development, it is

obvious that their general trends have been determined by crustal movements.

Their regularity is in direct proportion to the closeness of their approach to the

margin of the continental plateau. The more nearly they coincide with the edge

of that plateau, the fewer irregularities do they present ; the farther they recede

from it, the more highly are they indented. Various other factors, it is true, have
played a more or less important part in their development, but their dominant

trends were imdoubtedly determined at a very early period in the world's history--

their determination necessarily dates back, in short, to the time when the great
world-ridges and oceanic troughs came into existence. So far as we can read the
story told by the rocks, however, it would seem that in the earliest ages of whicb

geology can" speak with any confidence the coast-lines of the world must have been

infinitely more irregular than now. In Palaeozoic times relatively small areas of
--798 KEPOKT 1892.

the continental plateau appeared above the level of the sea. Insular conditions
everywhere prevailed. But as ages rolled on -wider and wider tracts of the

plateau were exposed, and this notwithstanding many oscillations of level. So
that one may say there has heen upon the whole a general advance from insular to

continental conditions. In other words, the sea has continued to retreat from the

surface of the continental plateau. To account for this change we must suppose

that depression of the crust has been in excess within the oceanic area, and that

now and again positive elevation of the continental plateau has taken place, more

especially along its margins. That movements of elevation, positive or negative,
have again and again afl'ected our land areas can be demonstrated, and it seems

highly probable, therefore, that similar movements may have been experienced

within the oceanic trough.

    Two kinds of crustal movement, as we have seen, are recognised by geologists.
Sometimes the crust appears to rise, or, as the case may be, to sinlc over wide
regions, without much disturbance or tilting of strata, although these are now and
again more or less extensively fractured and displaced. It may conduce to clear-
ness if we speak of these movements as regional. The other kind of crustal

disturbance takes place more markedly in linear directions, and is always accom-
panied by abrupt folding and mashing together of strata, along with more or less
fracturing and displacement. The plateau of the Colorado has often been cited as

a good example of regional elevation, where we have a ynde area of approximately
horizontal strata apparently uplifted without much rock-disturbance, while the

Alps or any other chain of highly flexed and convoluted strata will serve as an

example of what we may term axial or linear uplifts. It must be understood that

--both regional and axial movements result from the same cause the adjustment
--of the solid crust to the contracting nucleus and that the term elevation, there-

fore, is only relative. Sometimes the sinking crust gets relief from the enormous
lateral pressure to which it is subjected by crumpling up along lines of weakness,
and then mountains of elevation are formed ; at other times, the pressure is relieved

by the formation of broader swellings, when wide areas become uplifted relatively

to surrounding regions. Geologists, however, are beginning to doubt whether up-
heaval of the latter kind can affect a broad continental area. Probably, in most
cases, the apparent elevation of continental regions is only negative. The land

appears to have risen because the floor of the oceanic basin has become depressed.
Even the smaller plateau-like elevations which occur within some continental

regions may in a similar way owe their dominance to the sinking of contiguous

regions.

     In the geographical development of our laud movements of elevation and
depression have played an important part. But we cannot ignore the work done

by other agents of change. If the orographical features of the land everywhere
attest the potency of plutonic agents, they no less forcibly assure us that the
inequalities of surface resulting from such movement are universally modified by
denudation and sedimentation. Elevated plains and mountains are gradually
demolished, and the hollows and depressions of the great continental plateau
become slowly fiUed with their detritus. Thus inland seas tend to vanish, inlets
and estuaries are silted up, and the land in places advances seaward. The energies
of the sea, again, come in to aid those of rain and rivers, so that under the
combined action of all the superficial agents of change the irregularities of coast-
lines become reduced, and, were no crustal movement to intervene, would
eventually disappear. The work accomplished by those agents upon a coast-line
is most conspicuous in regions where the surface of the continental plateau is
occupied by comparatively shallow seas. Here full play is given to sedimentation
and marine erosion, while the latter alone comes into prominence upon shores that

are washed by deeper waters. When the coast-lines advance to the edge of the
continental plateau, they naturally trend, as we have seen, for great distances in

some particular direction. Should they preserve that position, undisturbed by
crustal oscillation, for a prolonged period of time, they will eventually be cut back

by the sea. In this way a shelf or terrace will be formed, narrow in some places,

broader in others, according to the resistance ofiered by the varying character of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                  799

tlie rock8. But no long inlets or fiords can result from such action. At most the

harder and less readily demolished rocks will form headlands, while shallow bays

will be scooped out of the more yielding masses. In short, between the narrower

and broader parts of the eroded shelf or terrace a certain proportion will tend to

be preserved. As the shelf is widened, sedimentation will become more and more
effective, and in places may come to protect the land from fuither marine erosion.

This action is especially conspicuous in tropical and subtropical regions, which are

characterised by well-marked rainy seasons. In such regions immense quantities

of sediment are washed down from the land to the sea, and tend to accumulate

along shore, forming low alluvial flats. All long-established coast-lines thus

acquire a characteristically sinuous form, and perhaps no better examples could bo

cited than those of Western Africa.

To sum up, then, we may say that the chief agents concerned in the develop-

ment of coast-lines are crustal movements, sedimentation, and marine erosion. All

the main trends are the result of elevation and depression. Considerable

geographical changes, however, have been brought about by the silting up of those

shallow and sheltered seas which, in certain regions, overflow wide areas of the

continental plateau. Throughout all the ages, indeed, epigene agents have striven

to reduce the superficial inequalities of that plateau by levelling heights and

fining up depressions, and thus, as it were, flattening out the land surface and

causing it to extend. The erosive action of the sea, from our present point of

view, is of comparatively little importance. It merely adds a few finishing touches

to the work performed by the other agents of change.

   A glance at the geographical evolution of our own continent will render this

sufficiently evident. Viewed in detail, the structure of Europe is exceedingly

complicated, but there are certain leading features in its architecture which no
Weprofound analysis is required to detect.
                                            note, in the first place, that highly

disturbed rocks of Archaean and Palaeozoic age reach their greatest development

along the north-western and western borders of our continent, as in Scandinavia,

the British Islands, North-west France, and the Iberian Peninsula. Another belt

of similarly disturbed strata of like age traverses Central Europe from west to

east, and is seen in the south of Ireland, Cornwall, North-west France, the

Ardennes, the Thiiringerwald, the Erzgebirge, the Rieseugebirge, the Bohmerwald,

and other heights of Middle and Southern Germany. Strata of Mesozoic and

Cainozoic age rest upon the older systems in such a way as to show that the latter
had been much folded, fractured, and denuded before they came to be covered

with younger formations. North and north-east of the central belt of ancient

rocks just referred to, the sedimentary strata that extend to the shores of the

Baltic and over a vast region in Russia range in age from Palaeozoic down to

Cainozoic times, and are disposed for the most part in gentle undulations : they

are either approximately horizontal or slightly inclined. Unlike the disturbed

rocks of the maritime regions and of Central Europe, they have obviously been

subjected to comparatively little folding since the time of their deposition. To the

south of the primitive backbone of Central Europe succeeds a region composed

superficially of Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata for the most part, which, along with

underlying Palaeozoic and Archaean rocks, are often highly flexed and ridged up,

as in the chains of the Jura, the Alps, the Carpathians, &c. One may say, in

general terms, that throughout the whole Mediterranean area Archaean and

Palafcozoic rocks appear at the surface only when thej' form the nuclei of mountains

of elevation into the composition of which rocks of younger age largely enter.
    From this bald and meagre outline of the general geological structure of

Europe, we may gather that the leading orographical features of our continent

began to be developed at a very early period. Unquestionably the oldest land

areas are represented by the disturbed Archaean and Palaeozoic rocks of the

Atlantic sea-board and Central Europe. Examination of those tracts shows that

they have experienced excessive denudation. The Archaean and Palaeozoic masses,

distributed along the margin of the Atlantic, are the mere wrecks of what, in

earlier ages, must have been lofty regions, the mountain-chains of which may well

have rivalled or even exceeded in height the Alps of to-day. They, together with

the old disturbed rocks of Central Europe, formed for a long time the only land in

our area. Between the ancient Scandinavian tract in the North and a narrow

interrupted belt in Central Europe stretched a shallow sea, which covered all the

regions that now form  our  Great  Plain                               while  immediately south  of  the central
                                                                    ;
--belt lay the wide depression of the Mediterranean for as yet the Pyrenees, the

Alps, and the Carpathians were not. Both the Mediterranean and the Russo-

Germanic sea commiuiicated with the Atlantic. As time went on land continued

to be developed along the same lines, a result due partly to crustal movements,

partly to sedimentation. Thus by-and-by the relatively shallow Russo-Germanic

sea became silted up, while the Mediterranean shore-line advanced southwards.

It is interesting to note that the latter sea, down to the close of Tertiary times,

seems always to have communicated freely with the Atlantic, and to have beeu

relatively deep. The Russo-Germanic sea, on the contrary, while now and again

opening widely into the Atlantic, and attaining considerable depths in its western

reaches, remained on the whole shallow, and ever and anon vanished from wide

areas to contract into a series of inland seas and large salt lakes.

     Reduced to its simplest elements, therefore, the structure of Europe shows two

--primitive ridges one extending with some interruptions along the Atlantic sea-

board, the other traversing Central Europe from west to east, and separating the

area of the Great Plain from the Mediterranean basin. The excessive denudation

which the more ancient lands have undergone, and the great uplifts of Mesozoic

and of Cainozoic times, together with the comparatively recent submergence of

broad tracts in the north and north-west, have not succeeded in obscuring the

dominant features in the architecture of our continent.

I now proceed to trace, as rapidly as I can, the geographical development of

the coast-lines of the Atlantic as a whole, and to point out the chief contrasts

between them and those of the Pacific. The extreme irregularity of the Arctic

and Atlantic shores of Europe at once suggests to a geologist a partially drowned

land, the superficial inequalities of which are accountable for the vagaries of the

coast-lines. The fiords of Norway and Scotland occupy what were at no distant

date land valleys, and the numerous marginal islands of those regions are merely

the projecting portions of a recently sunken area. The continental plateau

extends up to and a little beyond the 100-fathoms line, and there are many

indications that the land formerly reached as far. Thus the sunken area is tra-

versed by valley-like depressions, which widen as they pass outwards to the edge

of the plateau, and have all the appearance of being hollows of subaerial erosion.

I have already mentioned the fact that the Scandinavian uplands and the Scottish

Highlands are the relics of what were at one time true mountains of elevation,

corresponding in the mode of their formation to those of Switzerland, and, like

these, attaining a great elevation. During subsequent stages of Palseozoic times

that highly elevated region was subjected to long-continued and profound erosion

--the mountain country was planed down over wide regions to sea-level, and

broad stretches of the reduced land surface became submerged. Younger Palaeo-

zoic formations then accumulated upon the drowned land, until eventually renewed

crustal disturbance supervened, and the marginal areas of the continental plateau

again appeared as dry land, but not, as before, in the form of mountains of eleva-

tion. Lofty table-lands now took the place of abrupt and serrated ranges and

--chains table-lands which, in their turn, were destined in the course of long ages

to be deeply sculptured and furrowed by subaerial agents. During this process

the European coast-line woidd seem to have coincided more or less closely with

the edge of the continental plateau. Finally, after many subsequent movements

--of the crust in these latitudes, the land became partially submerged a condition

from which North-western and Northern Europe would appear in recent times to

be slowly recovering. Thus the highly indented coast-line of those regions does

not coincide with the edge of the plateau, but with those irregularities of its upper

surface which are the result of antecedent subaerial erosion.

Mention has been made of the Russo-Germanic plain and the Mediterranean

as representing original depressions in the continental plateau, and of the high

grounds that extend between them as regions of dominant elevation, which,
                  TRAXSACTIO>'S OF SECTION E.                           801

throughout all the manifold revolutions of the past, would appear to have per-

filsted as a more or less well-marked boundary, separating the northern from the

southern basin. Daring certain periods it was no doubt in some degree submerged,

but never apparently to the same extent as the depressed areas it served to sepa-

rate. From time to time uplifts continued to take place along this central belt,

which thus increased in breadth, the younger formations, which were accumulated

along the margins of the two basins, being successively ridged up against nuclei

of older rocks. The latest great crustal movements in our continent, resulting in

the uplift of the Alps and other east and west ranges of similar age, have still

further widened that ancient belt of dominant elevation which in our day forms

the most marked orographical feature of Europe.

    The Russo-Germanic basin is now for the most part land, the Baltic and the

North Sea representing its still submerged portions'. This basin, as already re-

Wemarked, was probably never so deep as that of the Mediterranean.  gather as

much from the fact that while meclianical sediments of comparatively shallow-

water origin predominate in the former area, limestones are the characteristic

features of the southern region. Its relative shallowness helps us to understand

why the northern depression should have been silted up more completely than the

WeMediterranean.  must remember also that for long ages it received the drain-

age of a much more extensive land surface than the latter, the land that sloped

towards the Mediterranean in PaloBOZoic and Mesozoic times being of relatively

little importance. Thus the crustal movements which ever and anon depressed

the Russo-Germanic area were, in the long run, counterbalanced by sedimentation.

The uplift of the Alps, the Atlas, and other east and west ranges has greatly con-

tracted the area of the Mediterranean, and sedimentation has also acted in the

same direction, but it is highly pi'obable that that sea is now as deep as, or even

deeper than, it has ever been. It occupies a primitive depression iu which the

rate of subsidence has exceeded that of sedimentation. In many respects, indeed,

--this remarkable transmeridional hollow continued eastward iu the Red Sea, the
--Black Sea, and the Aralo-Caspian depression is analogous, as we shall see, to the

great oceanic trough itself.

In the earlier geological periods linear or axial uplifts and volcanic action

again and again marked the growth of the land on the Atlantic sea-board. But

after Palnsozoic times no great mountains of elevation came into existence in that

region, while volcanic action almost ceased. In Tertiary times, it is true, there

was a remarkable recrudescence of volcanic activity, but the massive eruptions of

Antrim and Western Scotland, of the Fseroe Islands and Iceland, must be con-

.-sidered apart from the general geology of our continent. From Mesozoic times

onwards it was along the borders of the Mediterranean depression that great

moimtain uplifts and volcanoes chieiiy presented themselves ; and as the laud

surface extended southwards from Central Europe, and the area of the Mediter-

ranean was contracted, volcanic action followed the advancing shore-lines. The

occurrence of numerous extinct and of still existing volcanoes along the borders

of this inland sea, the evidence of recent crustal movements so commonly met

with upon its margins, the great irregularities of its depths, the proximity of vast

axial uplifts of late geological age, and the frequency of earthquake phenomena,

all indicate instability, and remind us strongly of similarly constructed and dis-

turbed regions within the area of the vast Pacific.

    Let us now look at the Arctic and Antarctic coast-lines of North America.
From the extreme north down to the latitude of New York the shores are

obviously those of a partially submerged region. They are of the same type as

Wethe coasts of North-western Europe.  have every reason to believe also that

t he depression of Greenland and North-east America, from which these lands have

only partially recovered, dates back to a comparatively recent period. The fiords

and inlets, like those of Europe, are merely half-drowned land valleys, and the

continental shelf is crossed by deep hollows which are evidently only the seaward

continuations of well-marked terrestrial features. Such, for example, is the case

with the valleys of the Hudson and the St. Lawrence, the submerged portions of

which can be followed out to the edge of the continental plateau, which is notched

by ttem at deptlis of 474 and 622 fathoms respectively. There is, in short, a

broad resemblance between the coasts of the entire Arctic and North Atlantic
regions down to the latitudes already mentioned. Everywhere they are

--irregular and fringed with islands in less or greater abundance highly denuded

and deeply incised plateaus being penetrated by fiords, while low-lying and

undulating lands that shelve gently seaward are invaded by shallow bays and

inlets. Comparing the American with the opposite European coasts one cannot
help being struck with certain other resemblances. Thus Hudson Bay at once

suo-gests the Baltic, and the Gulf of Mexico, with the Caribbean Sea, recalls the
Mediterranean. But the geological structure of the coast-lands of Greenland

and North America betrays a much closer resemblance between these and the

opposite shores of Europe than appears on a glance at the map. There is some-

thing more than a mere superficial similarity. In eastern North America and

Greenland, just as in Western Europe, no grand mountain uplifts have taken

place for a prodigious time. The latest great upheavals, which were accompanied

by much folding and flexing of strata, are those of the Apallachian chain and of the

coastal ranges extending through New England, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland,

all of which are of Palreozoic age. Considerable crustal movements affected the

American coast-lands in Mesozoic times, and during these uplifts the strata

suffered fracture and displacement, but were subjected to comparatively little

folding. Again, along the maritime borders of North-east America, as in the

corresponding coast-lands of Europe, igneous action, more or less abundant in
Palreozoic and early Mesozoic times, has since been quiescent. From the mouth of

the Hudson to the Straits of Florida the coast-lands are composed of Tertiary and
Quaternary deposits. This shows that the land has continued down to recent

--times to gain upon the sea a result brought about partly by quiet crustal move-

ments, but to a large extent by sedimentation, aided, on the coasts of Florida, by

the action of reef-building corals.

     Although volcanic action has long ceased on the American sea-board, we note
that in Greenland, as in the West of Scotland and North of Ireland, there is abun-

dant evidence of volcanic activity at so late a period as (he Tertiary. It would

appear that the great plateau-basalts of those regions, and of Iceland and the

Fieriie Islands, were contemporaneous, and possibly connected with an important

crustal movement. It has long been suggested that at a very early geological

period Europe and North America may have been united. The great thickness

attained by the Paheozoic rocks in the eastern areas of the latter implies the

existence of a wide land surface from which ancient sediments were derived.

That old land must have extended beyond the existing coast-line, but how far we

cannot tell. Similarly in North-west Europe, during early Paleozoic times, the

land probably stretched further into the Atlantic than at present. But whether,

as some think, an actual land connection subsisted between the two continents it
is impossible to say. Some such connection was formerly supposed necessary to

account for the emigration and immigration of certain marine I'orms of life which

are common to the Palpeozoic strata of both continents, and which, as they were

probably denizens of comparatively shallow water, could only have crossed from

one area to another along a shore-line. It is obvious, indeed, that if tlie oceanic

troughs in those early days were of an abysmal character, a belt of shallow water

·would be required to explain the geographical distribution of cosmopolitan maiine

life-forms. But if it be true that subsidence of the crust has been going on through

all geological time, and that the land areas have notwithstanding continued to ex-

tend over the continental plateau, then it follows that the oceanic trough must be

deeper now than it was in Palreozoic times. There are, moreover, certain geological

facts which seem hardly explicable on the assumption that the seas of past ages

attained abysmal depths over any extensive areas. The Palteozoic strata which

enter so largely into the framework of our lands have much the same appearance all

the world over, and were accumulated for the most part in comparatively shallow

Awater.  petrographical description of the Paltoozoic mechanical sediments of

Europe would serve almost equally well for those of America, of Asia, or of

Australia. Take in connection with this the fact that Piila;ozoic faunas had a
                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.       803

very much wider range tlian those of Mesozoic and latei" ages, and were characterised
above all by the presence of many cosmopolitan species, and we can hardly resist

the conclusion that it was the comparative shallowness of the ancient sea8 that

favoured that wide dispersal of species, and enabled currents to distribute sedi-

ments the same in kind over such vast regions. As the oceanic area deepened and

contracted, and the land surface increased, marine faunas were gradually restricted

in their range, and cosmopolitan marine forms diminished in numbers, while sedi-

ments, gathering in separate regions, became more and more diflerentiated. ]<"or

these and other reasons, which need not be entered upon here. I see no necessity for
supposing that a Palreozoic Atlantis connected Europe with North America. The

broad ridge upon which the Fserije Islands and Iceland are founded seems to

pertain as truly to the oceanic depression as the long Dolphin Ridge of the Soutli

Atlantic. The trend of the continental plateau in high latitudes is shown, aa I

think, by the general direction of the coast-lines of North-western Europe and East

Greenland, the continental shelf being submerged in those regions for a few hundred

Howfathoms only.  the Icelandic ridge came into existence, and what its age may

be, we can only conjecture. It may be a wrinkle aa old as the oceanic troufrh

Wewhich it traverses, or its origin may date back to a much more recent period.

may conceive it to be an area which has subsided more slowly than the floor
of the ocean to the north and south ; or, on the other hand, it may be a belt of

positive elevation. Perhaps the latter is the more probable supposition, for it

seems very unlikely that crustal disturbances, resulting in axial and regional

uplifts, should have been confined to the continental plateau only. Ba that as it
may, there is little doubt that land connection did obtain between Greenland
and Europe in Cainozoic times, along this Icelandic ridge, for relics of the same

Tertiary flora are found in Scotland, the Fieroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland.

The deposits in which these plant-remains occur are associated with great sheets

of volcanic rocks, which in the FseriJe Islands and Iceland reach a thickness of
many thousand feet. Of the same age are the massive basalts of Jan Mayen,

Spitzbergen, Franz Joseph Land, and Greenland. These lavas seem seldom to

have issued from isolated foci in the manner of modern eruptions, but rather to
have welled up along the lines of rectilineal fissures. From the analogy of similar

phenomena in other parts of the world it might be inferred that the volcanic action
of these northern regions may have been connected with a movement of elevation,

and tliat the Icelandic ridge," if it did not come into existence during the Tertiary
period, was at all events greatly upheaved at that time. It would seem most likely,
in short, that the volcanic action in question was connected mainly with crustal
movements in the oceanic trough. Similar phenomena, as is well known, are met
with further south in the trough of the Atlantic. Thus the volcanic Azores rise
lilce Iceland from the surface of a broad ridge which is separated from the conti-

nental plateau by wide and deep depressions. And so again, from the back of the

great Dolphin Ilidge, spring the volcanic islets of St. Paul's, Ascension, and Tristan

d'Acunha.

     I have treated of the Icelandic bank at some length for the purpose of sbowincr
that its volcanic phenomena do not really form an exception to the rule that such
eruptions ceased after Palreozoic or early Mesozoic times to disturb the Atlantic

coast-lines of Europe and North America. As the bank in question extends
between Greenland and the British Islands, it was only natural that both those

regions should be affected by its movements. But its history pertains essentially
to that of the Atlantic trough ; and it seems to show us how transmeridional
movements of the crust, accompanied by vast discharges of igneous rock, may come

in time to form land connections between what are now widely separated areas.

     Let us next turn our attention to the coast-lines of the Gulf of Mexico and the

Caribbean Sea. These enclosed seas have frequently been compared to the Medi-

terranean, and the resemblance is self-evident. Indeed, it is so close that one may

say the Mexican-Caribbean Sea and the Mediterranean are rather homologous than

simply analogous. The latter, as we have seen, occupies a primitive depression,
and formerly covered a much wider area. It extended at one time over much of

Southern Europe and Northern Africa, and appears to have had full communica-

 tion across Asia Minor with the Indian Ocean, and with the Arctic Ocean athwart
 the low-lying tracts of North-western Asia. Similarly, it would seem, the Mexican-
 Caribbean Sea is the remaining portion of an ancient iuknd sea wliich formerly
 stretched north through the heart of North America to the Arctic Ocean. Like
 its European parallel, it has been diminished by sedimentation and crustal move-
 ments. It resembles the latter also in the greatness and irregularity of its depths,
 and in the evidence which its islands supply of volcanic action as well as of very
 considerable crustal movements within recent geological times. Along the whole
 northern borders of the Gulf of Mexico the coast-lands, like those on the Atlantic
 sea-board of the Southern States, are composed of Tertiary and recent accumulations,
 and the same is the case with Yucatan ; while similar young formations are met
 with on the borders of the Caribbean Sea and in the Antilles. The Bahamas and

the Windward Islands mark out for us the margin of the continental plateau, which
 here falls away abruptly to profound depths. One feels assured that this portion

 of the plateau has been ridged up to its present level at no distant geological date.
 But notwithstanding all the evidence of recent extensive crustal movements in this

region, it is obvious that the Mexican-Caribbean depression, however much it may

 have been subsequently modified, is of primitive origin.'

     Before we leave the coast-lands of North America I would again point out

their leading geological features. In a word, then, they are composed for the most
part of Archoean and Palaeozoic rocks : no great linear or axial uplifts marked by
much flexure of strata have taken place in those regions since Palaeozoic times
while igneous action virtually ceased about the close of the Palaeozoic or the com-

mencement of the Mesozoic period. It is not before we reach the shores of the
Southern States and the coast-lands of the Mexican-Caribbean Sea that we

encounter notable accumulations of Mesozoic, Tertiary, and younger age. These
occur in approximately horizontal positions round the Gulf oV Mexico, but in the
Sierra Nevada of Northern Colombia and the Cordilleras of Venezuela Tertiary strata
enter into the formation of true mountains of elevation. Thus the Mexican-Caribbean
depression, like that of the Mediterranean, is characterised, not only by its irregular
depths and its volcanic phenomena, but by the propinquity of recent mountains of
upheaval, which bear the same relation to the Caribbean Sea that the mountains of
North Africa do to the Mediterranean.

   We may now compare the Atlantic coasts of South America with those of

Africa. The former coincide in general direction with the edge of the continental
plateau, to which they closely approach between Cape St. Roque and Cape Frio.
la the north-east, between Cape Paria, opposite Trinidad, and Cape St. Roque, the
continental slielf attains a considerably greater breadth, while south of Cape Frio
it gradually widens until, in the extreme south, it runs out towards the east in the
form of a narrow ridge, upon the top of which rise the Falkland Islands and South
Georgia. Excluding from consideration for the present all recent alluvial and
Tertiary deposits, we may say that the coast-lands from Venezuela down to the
South of Brazil are composed principally of Archsean rocks ; the eastern borders of
the continent further south being formed of Quaternary and Tertiary accumulations.
So far as we know, igneous rocks are of rare occurrence on the Atlantic sea-board.

Palaeozoic strata approach the coast-lands at various points between the mouths

of the Amazons and La Plata, and these, with the underlying and surrounding

Archaean rocks, are more or less folded and disturbed, while the younger strata of
Mesozoic and Cainozoic age (occupying wide regions in the basin of the Amazons,
and here and there fringing the sea-coast), occur in approximately horizontal
positions. It would appear, therefore, that no great axial uplifts have taken place
in those regions since Palaeozoic times. The crustal movements of later ages were
regional rather than axial ; the younger rocks are not flexed and mashed together,
and their elevation (negative or positive) does not seem to have been accompanied
by conspicuous volcanic action.

     ' Professor Suess thinks it is probable that the Caribbean Sea and the Mediter-
ranean are portions of one and the same primitive depression which traversed the

Atlantic area in earlv Cretaceous times. He further suggests that it may have been

through the gradual widening of this central Mediterranean that the Atlantic in later
times came into existence.
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                      805

The varying widtli of the continental shelf is due to several causes. Tiie

Orinoco, the Amazons, and other rivers descending to the north-east coast, carry

enormous quantities of sediment, much of which comes to rest on the submerged

elopes of the continental plateau, so that the continental shelf tends to extend

seawards. The same process takes place on the south-east coast, where the River
Plate discharges its muddy waters. South of latitude 40° S., however, another
cause has come into play. From the month of the Rio Negro to the terminal point

of the continent the whole character of the coast betokens a geologically recent

emergence, accompanied and followed by considerable marine erosion. So that in

this region the continental shelf increases in width by the retreat of the coast-line,

while in the north-east it gains by advancing seawards. It is to be noted, however,

that even there, in places where the shores are formed of alluvia, the sea tends to

encroach upon the land.

The Atlantic coast of Africa resembles that of South America in certain

respects, but it also offers some important contrasts. As the northern coasts of

Venezuela and Colombia must be considered in relation rather to the Caribbean

depression than to the Atlantic, so the African sea-board between Cape Spartel and

Cape Nun pertains structurally to the Mediterranean region. From the southern

limits of Morocco to Cape Colony the coastal heights are composed chie9y of

Archaean and Paleozoic rocks, the low shore-lands showing here and there strata of

Meaozoic and Tertiary age together with still more recent deposits. The existing

coast -lines everywhere advance close to the edge of the continental plateau, so that

the submarine shelf is relati%'ely narrower than that of Eastern South America.

The African coast is still further distinguished from that of South America by the

--presence of several groups of volcanic islands Fernando Po and others in the Gulf

of Guinea, and Cape Verde and Canary Islands. The last-named group, how-

ever, notwithstanding its geographical position, is probably related rather to the

Mediterranean depression than to the Atlantic trough.

     The geological structure of the African coast-lands shows that the earliest to
come into existence were those that extend between Cape Nun and the Cape of Good

Hope. The coastal ranges of that section are much denuded, for they are of very

great antiquity, having been ridged up in Palnsozoic times. The later uplifts

(negative or positive) of the same region were not attended by tilting and folding

of strata, for the Mesozoic and Tertiary deposits, like those of South America, lie

in comparatively horizontal positions. Between Cape Nun and Cape Spartel the

rocks of the maritime tracts range in age from Palteozoic to Cainozoic, and have

been traced across Morocco into Algeria and Tunis. They all belong to the Medi-

terranean region, and were deposited at a time when the southern shores of that

inland sea extended from a point opposite the Canary Islands along what is now

the southern margin of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis. Towards the close of the

Tertiary period the hnal upheaval of the Atlas took place, and the Mediterranean,

retreating northwards, became an almost land-locked sea.

I need hardly stop to point out how the African coast-lines have been modified

by marine erosion and the accumulation of sediment upon the continental shelf.

The extreme regularity of the coasts is due partly to the fact that the land is

nearly coextensive with the continental plateau, but it also results in large mea-

sure from the extreme antiquity of the land itself. This has allowed of the cutting-

back of headlands and the filling up of bays and inlets, a process which has been

going on between Morocco and Cape Colony with probably little interruption for

Wea very prolonged period of time.  may note also the effect of the heavy rains

of the equatorial region in washing down detritus to the shores, and in this way

in'otecting the land to some extent from the erosive action of the sea.

What now, let us ask, are the outstanding features of the coast-lines of the

WeAtlantic Ocean ?  have seen that along the margins of each of tlie bordering

continents the last series of great mountain-uplifts took place in Paheozoic times.

This is true alike for North and South America, for Europe and .'Vfrica. Later

movements which have added to the extent of land were not marked by the extreme

folding of strata which attended the early upheavals. The Mesozoic and Cainozoic

rocks, which now and again form the shore-lauds, occur in more or less undisturbed

condition. The only great linear uplifts or true mountains of elevation .which have
come into existence in Western Europe and North Africa since the Palaeozoic

period trend approximately at right angles to the direction of the Atlantic trough,

and are obviously related to the primitive depression of the Mediterranean. The
Pyrenees and the Atlas, therefore, although their latest elevation took place in
Tertiary times, form no exceptions to the rule that the extreme flexing and folding
of strata which is so conspicuous a feature in the geological structure of the

Atlantic sea-board dates back to the Paheozoic era. And the same holds true of

North and South America. There all the coastal ranges of highly flexed and folded
strata are of Palaeozoic age. The Cordilleras of Venezuela are no doubt a Tertiary
uplift, but they are as obviously related to the Caribbean depression as the Atlas

ranges are to that of the Mediten'anean. Again, we note that volcanic activity
along the borders of the Atlantic was much less pronounced during the Mesozoic
period than it appears to have been in earlier ages. Indeed, if we except the great
Tertiary basalt-flows of the Icelandic ridge and the Arctic regions, we may say that

 volcanic action almost ceased after the PaL-eozoic era to manifest itself upon the
Atlantic coast-lands of North America and Europe. But while volcanic action has
died out upon the Atlantic margins of both continents, it has continued during a

prolonged geological period within the area of the Mediterranean depression. And

ill like manner the corresponding depression between North and South America
has been the scene of volcanic disturbances from Mesozoic down to recent times.
Along the African coasts the only display's of recent volcanic action that appertain
til the continental margin are those of the Gulf of Guinea and the Cape de Verde

Islands. The Canary Islands and Madeira may come under the same category, but,
as we have seen, they appear to stand in relationship to the Mediterranean depres-

sion and the Tertiary uplift of North Africa. Of Iceland and the Azores I have
already spoken, and of Ascension and the other volcanic islets of the South Atlantic
it is needless to say that they are related to wrinkles in the trough of the ocean,
and therefore have no immediate connection with the continental plateau.

     Thus in the geographical development of the Atlantic coast^lines we may

note the following stages: First, in P.alieozoie times the formation of great
mountain-uplifts, frequently accompanied by volcanic action. Se.cotid, a pro-
longed stage of comparative coastal tranquillity, during which the maritime ranges

referred to were subject to such excessive erosion that they were planed down to

low levels, and in certain areas even submerged. Third, renewed elevation (nega-

.tive or positive) whereby considerable portions of the much denuded Archaean and
Palaeozoic roclis, now largely covered by younger deposits, were converted into
high lands. During this stage not much rock-folding took place, nor were any
 true mountains of elevation formed parallel to the Atlantic margins. It was

 otherwise, however, in the jMediterranean and ('aribbean depressions, where coastal
 movements resulted in the formation of enormous linear uplifts. Moreover, Tol-

canic action is now and has for a long time been more characteristic of these

depressions than of the Atlantic coast-lands.

     I must now ask you to take a comprehensive glance at the coast-lines of the

 Pacific Ocean. In some important respects these ofl'er a striking contrast to those

 wo have been considering. Time will not allow me to enter into detailed descrip-

 tion, and I must therefore confine attention to certain salient features. Examining
 first the shores of the Americas, we find that there are two well-marked regions of

--fiords and fringing islands namely, the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia,

 and of South America from 40° S. lat. to Cape Horn. Althougli these regions

 may be now extending seawards in jilaces, it is obvious that they have
 recently been subject to submergence. When the fiords of Alaska and British

 Columbia existed as land valleys it is probable that a broad land connection
 obtained between North America and Asia. The whole Pacific coast is margined
 by mountain-ranges, which in elevation and boldness far exceed those of the
 Atlantic sea-board. The rocks entering into their formation range in age from

 Arc])03an and Palaeozoic down to Cainozoic, and they are almost everywhere

 highly disturbed and flexed. It is not necessary, even if it were possible, to

myconsider the geological history of all those uplifted masses. It is enough for

                                                                                                   I

purpose to note tlie fact tliattbe^cqastal ranges of North America and the principal

chain of the Andes were all elevated in Tertiary times. It may be remarked,
further, that from the Mesozoic period down to tlie present the Pacific borders of
America have been the scene of volcanic activity far in excess of what has been

experienced on the Atlantic sea-board.

      Geographically the Asiatic coasts of the Pacific offer a strong contrast to those

of the American borders. The latter, as we have seen, are for the most part not
far removed from the edge of the continental plateau. The coasts of the mainland

of Asia, on the other hand, retire to a great distance, the true margin of the

plateau being marked out by that great chain of islands which extends from

Kamchatka south to the Philippines .and New Guinea. The seas lying between

those islands and the mainland occupy depressions in the continental plateau.

Were that plateau to be lifted up for 6,000 or 7,000 feet the seas referred to would

be enclosed by continuous land, and all the principal islands of the East Indian

--Archipelago-- Sumatra, Java, Celebes, and New Guinea would become united to

themselves as well as to Australia and New Zealand. In short, it is the relatively

depressed condition of the continental plateau along tlie western borders of the

Pacific basin that causes the Asiatic coast-lines to diU'er so strikingly from those of
America,

    From a geological point of view the differences are less striking than the
resemblances. It is true that we have as yet a very imperfect knowledge of the
geological structure of Eastern Asia, but we know enough to justify the conclusion

that in its main features that region does not differ essentially from "Western North

America. During Mesozoic and Cainozoic times the sea appears to have over-

flowed vast tracts of Mauchooria and China, and even to have penetrated into

what is now the great Desert of Gobi. Subsequent crustal movements revo-

lutionised the geograpliy of all those regions. Great ranges of linear uplifts came

into existence, and in these the younger foi-mations, together with the foundations

on which they rested, were squeezed into folds and ridged np against the nuclei of

Palaeozoic and Archaean rocks which had hitherto formed tlie only dry land. The

latest of these grand upheavals are of Tertiary age, and, like those of the Pacific

slope of America, they were accompanied by excessive volcanic action. The long

chains of islands that flank the shores of Asia we must look upon as a series of

partially submerged or partially emerged mountain-ranges, analogous geographi-

cally to the coast ranges of North and Central America, and to the youngest

Cordilleras of South America. The presence of numerous active and recently

extinct volcanoes, taken in connection with the occurrence of many great depres-

sions which furrow the floor of the sea in the East Indian Archipelago, and the

profound depths attained by tlie Pacific trough along the borders of Japan and the

--Kurile and Aleutian Islands all indicate conditions of very considerable instability
Weof the lithosphere.
                       are not surprised, therefore, to meet with much apparently

conflicting evidence of elevation and depression in the coast-lands of Eastern Asia,

where in some places the sea would seem to be encroaching, while in other regions

it is retreating. In all earthquake-ridden and volcanic areas such irregular coastal

changes may be looked for. So extreme are the irregularities of the sea-floor

in the area lying between Australia, the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, and
New Zealand, and so great are the depths attained by many of the depressions,

that the margins of the continental plateau are harder to trace here than any where

else in the world. The bottom of the oceanic trough throughout a large portion

of the Southern and Western Pacific is, in fact, traversed by many great mountain

ridges, the summits of which approach the surface ay:ain and again to form the

numerous islets of Polynesia. But notwithstanding the considerable depths that

separate Australia from New Zealand there is geological evidence to show that a

land connection formerly linked both to Asia. The continental plateau, therefore,

must be held to include New Caledonia and New Zealand. Hence the volcanic
islets of the Solomon and New Hebrides groups are related to Australia in the
same way as the Liu-kiu, Japanese, and Kurile Islands are to Asia.

     Having rapidly sketched the more prominent features of the Pacific coast-lines,

wo are in a position to realise the remarkable cor.trast they present to the coast-
808 EEroRT-- 1892.

lines of the Atlantic. The highly folded strata of the Atlantic sea-board are the
relics of great mountains of upheaval, the origin of which cannot be assigned to a
more recent date than Paleozoic times. During subsequent crustal movements
no mountains of corrugated strata were nplifted along the Atlantic margins, the
Mesozoic and Cainozoic strata of the coastal regions showing little or no disturb-

ance. It is quite in keeping with all this that volcanic action appears to have been

most strongly manifested in Palseozoic times. So many long ages have passed

since the upheaval of the ArchaBan and Palaeozoic mountains of the Atlantic sea-

board that these heights have everywhere lost the character of true mountains of

elevation. Planed down to low levels, partially submerged and covered to some

--extent by newer formations, they have in many places been again converted into

dry lands, forming plateaus now sorely denuded and cut up into mountains and
valleys of erosion. "Why the later movements along the borders of the Atlantic

basin should not have resulted in the wholesale plication of the younger sediment-
ary rocks is a question for geologists. It would seem as if the Atlantic margins
had reached a stage of comparative stability long before the grand Tertiary uplifts

of the Pacific borders had taken place ; for, as we have seen, the Mesozoic and

Cainozoio strata of the Atlantic coast-lands show little or no trace of having been
subjected to tangential thrusting and crushing. Hence one cannot help suspecting
that the retreat of the sea during Mesozoic and Cainozoic ages may have been due.
rather to subsidence of the oceanic trough and to sedimentation within the con-

tinental area than to positive elevation of the land.
     Over the Pacific trough, likewise, depression has probably been in progress

more or less continuously since Palieozoic times, and this movement alone must
have tended to withdraw the sea from the surface of the continental plateau in
Asia and America. But by far the most important coastal changes in those
regions have been brought about by the crumpling up of the plateau, and the for-
mation of gigantic mountains of upheaval along its margins. From remotest
geological periods down almost to the present the land area has been increased
from time to time by the doubling-up and consequent elevation of coastal accumu-
lations and by the eruption of vast masses of volcanic materials. It is this long-
continued activity of the plutonic forces within the Pacific area which has caused

the coast-lands of that basin to contrast so strongly with those of the Atlantic.
The hitter are incomparably older than the former, the heights of the Atlantic
borders being mountains of denudation of vast geological antiquity, while the
coastal ranges of the Pacific slope are creations but of yesterday as it were. It

may well be that those Cordilleras and mountain-chains reach a greater height
than was ever attained by any I'ahneozoic uplifts of the Atlantic borders. But the

marked disparity in elevation between the coast-lands of the Pacific and tho

Atlantic is due chiefly to a profound difl'erence in age. Had the Pacific coast-
lands existed for as long a period and sufi'ered as much erosion as the ancient rocks
of the Atlantic sea-board, they would now have little elevation to boast of.

     The coast-lines of the Indian Ocean are not, upon the whole, far removed from
the margin of the continental plateau. The elevation of East Africa for 6,000 feet
would add only a very narrow belt to the land. This would still leave Madagascar
an i.sland, but there are geological reasons for concluding that this island was at a
lar distant period united to Africa, and it must therefore be considered as forminf^

a portion of the continental plateau. The great depths which now separate it from

the mainhiud are probably due to local subsidence, connected with volcanic action
in Madagascar itself and in the Comoro Islands. The southern coasts of Asia, like
those of East Africa, approach the edge of the continental plateau, so that an ele-

vation of 6,000 feet would make little addition to the land area. With the same
amount of upheaval, however, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and West
Australia would become united, but without extending mucli further seawards.
Land connection, as we know, existed in Mesozoic times between Asia, Australia,

and New Zealand, but the coast-lines of that distant period must have differed

considerably from those that would appear were the regions in question to experi-

ence now a general elevation. The Archfean and Palieozoic rocks of the Malay

Peninsula and Sui^atra are flanked on the side of Ihe Indian Ocean by great
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  809

volcanic ridges, and by uplifts of Tertiary strata, which continue along the line of

the Nicobar and Andaman Islands into Burma. Thus the coast-lines of that section

of the Indian Ocean exhibit a geographical development similar to that of the Pacific
sea-board. Elsewhere, as in Hindustan, Arabia, and East Africa, the coast-lines
appear to have been determined chiefly by regional elevations of the land or sub-
sidence of the oceanic trough in Mesozoic and Oainozoic times, accompanied by the
outwelling of enornjous floods of lava. Seeing, then, that the Pacific and the

Indian Oceans are pre-eminently regions which, down to a recent date, have been
subject to great crustal movements and to excessive volcanic action, we may infer

that in the development of their coast-lines the sea has played a very subordinate
part. The shores, indeed, are largely protected from marine erosion by partially
emerged volcanic ridges and by coral islands and reefs, and to a considerable

extent also by the sediment which in tropical regions especiallj' is swept down to
the coast in great abundance by rains and rivers. Moreover, as the geological
structure of these regions assures us, the land would appear seldom to have
remained sufficiently long at one level to permit of much destruction by waves
and tidal currents.

     In fine, then, we arrive at the general conclusion that the coast-lines of the

globe are of verj' unequal age. Those of the Atlantic were determined as far bact
as Palgeozoic times bj' great mountain uplifts along the margin of the continental

plateau. Since the close of that period many crustal oscillations have taken

place, but no grand mountain-ranges have again been ridged up on the Atlantic

sea-board. Meanwhile the Palaeozoic mountain-chains, as we have seen, have
suffered extensive denudation, have been planed down to the sea-level, and even
submerged. Subsequently converted into land, wholly or partially as the case may
have been, they now present the appearance of plains and plateaus of erosion, often
deeply indented by the sea. No true mountains of elevation are met with any-

where in the coast-lands of the Atlantic, while volcanic action has well-nigh ceased.
In short, the Atlantic margins have reached a stage of comparative stability. The

--trough itself, however, is traversed by at least two well-marked banks of upheaval
    the great meridional Dolphin Ridge, and the approximately transmeridional

--Faeroe-Icelandic belt both of them bearing volcanic islands.

     But while the coast-lands of the Atlantic proper attained relative stability at
an early period, those of the Mediterranean and Caribbean depressions have up to

recent times been the scenes of great crustal disturbance. Gigantic mountain-
chains were uplifted along their margins at so late a period as the Tertiary, and

their shores still witness volcanic activity,

      It is upon the margins and within the trough of the Pacific Ocean, however,

that subterranean action is now most remarkaljly developed. The coast-lines of

that great basin are everywhere formed of grand uplifts and volcanic ranges, which,
broadly speaking, are comparable in age to those of the Mediterranean and Carib-
bean depressions. Along the north-east margin of the Indian Ocean the coast-lines
resemble those of the Pacific, being of like recent age, and similarly marked by tlio
presence of numerous volcanoes. The northern and western shores, however (as
in Hindustan, Arabia, and East Africa), have been determined rather by regional
elevation or by subsidence of the ocean-floor than by axial uplifts, the chief
crustal disturbances dating back to an earlier period than those of the East Indian
Archipelago. It is in keeping with this greater age of the western and northern

coast-lands of the Indian Ocean that volcanic action is now less strongly manifested

in their vicinity.

      I have spoken of the comparative stability of the earth's crust within thi^
Atlantic area as being evidenced by the greater age of its coastal ranges and the
declining importance of its volcanic phenomena. This relative stability is further

shown by the fact that the Atlantic sea-board is not much disturbed by earth-
quakes. This, of course, is what might have been expected, for earthquakes are

most characteristic of volcanic regions and of those ai'eas in which mountain-uplift.s
of recent geological age occur. Hence the coast-lands of the Pacific and the East

Indies, the borders of the Caribbean Sea, the volcanic ridges of the Atlantic basin,

the lauds of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Aralo-Caspian depressions,
                             --

tbe shores of the Red Sea, and vast tracts of Southern Asia, are the chief earth-

quake regions of the globe. It may he noted, further, that shocks are not only-

most frequent hut most intense in the neighbourhood of the sea. They appear to

oi'iginate sometimes in the volcanic ridges and coastal ranges, sometimes under the

Nowfloor of the sea itself.  earthquakes, volcanoes, and uplifts are all expressions

of the one great fundamental fact that the earth is a cooling and contracting body,

and they indicate the lines of weakness along which the enormous pressures and

Westrains induced by the subsidence of the crust upon its nucleus find relief.

cannot tell why the coast-lands of the Atlantic should have attained at so early a

--period a stage of relative stability why no axial uplifts should have been deve-

loped along their margins since Palasozoic times. It may be that relief has been

found in the wrinkling-up of the floor of the oceanic trough, and consequent forma-

tion of the Dolphin Ridge and other great submarine foldings of the crust; and it

is possible that the growth of similar great ridges and wrinkles upon the bed of

the Pacific may in like manner relieve the coast-lands of that vast ocean, and pre-

vent the foi'mation of younger iiplifts along their borders.

     I have already remarked that two kinds of elevatory movements of the crust

--are recognised by geologists namely, axial and regional uplifts. Some, however,

are beginning to doubt, with Professor Suess, whether any vast regional uplifts are

])ossible. Yet the view that would attribute all such apparent elevations of the land

to subsidence of the crust under tbe great oceanic troughs is not without its diffi-

culties. Former sea-margins of very recent geological age occur in all latitudes, and

if we are to explain these by sub-oceanic depression, this will compel us to admit, as

Suess has remarked, a general lowering of the sea-level of upwards of 1,000 feet.

But it is difficult to believe that the sea-floor could have subsided to such an extent

in recent times. Suess thinks it is much more probable that the high-level beaches of

tropical regions are not contemporaneous with those of higher latitudes, and that

the phenomena are best explained by his hypothesis of a secular movement of the

ocean--the water being, as he contends, alternately heaped up at the equator and

the poles. The strand-lines in high latitudes, however, are certainly connected

with glaciation in some way not yet understood ; and if it cannot be confidently

affirmed that they indicate regional movements of the land, the evidence, neverthe-

less, seems to point in that direction.

In concluding this impei'fect outline-sketch of a large subject, I ought perhaps

to apologise for having trespassed so much upon the domains of geology. But in

doing so I have only followed the example of geologists themselves, whose div.aga-

tions in territories adjoining their own are naturally not infrequent. From much

that I have said, it will be gathered that with regard to the causes of many

coastal changes we are still groping in the dark. It seems not unlikely, however,

that as light increases we may be compelled to modify the view that all oscillations

of the sea-level are due to movements of the lithosphere alone. That is a very

heretical suggestion ; but that a great deal can be said for it anyone will admit

after a candid perusal of Suess's monumental work, ' Das Antlitz der Erde.'

more scholarly and more satisfactory, he maintained, to adopt a definite translitera-
tion of each foreign alphabet, based, of course, on the best authorised form of the
name in each instance. Dealing more particularly with the question of Scottish
place-names, he refen-ed at some length to the errors in Gaelic spelling found on

names induced Sir Charles "Wilson some time ago to suggest the revision of the
nomenclature of the Highland sheets by a Committee of the Royal Scottish Geo-
graphical Society, and of this committee Dr. Burgess has acted as convener.

Scottish place-names, with a small grant.]

3. Bawfall in Formosa and some of the Effects on the Island and Mainland

                                of China. By J. Thomson.

      The following notes on the rainfall of Formosa are the result partly of personal
 observation while exploring the south of the island, and partly of meteorological

 and such other statistics as I have been able to consult.
      The island affords a striking example of the work of rain within a contracted

 area in altering the surface of the land, building np plains seawards, and ultimately

litting them for tillage and the support of an increasing population.
      It will be necessary to note the geographical position and configuration of the

island, ocean currents, temperature, and prevailing winds, in order to make the

 subject intelligible.

      Formosa lies between 21° and 25° north latitude, while the 121st degree of east
 longitude divides it into nearly equal parts from north to south. It is over 200 miles
 long, and its width varies from tifty to eighty miles. It is traversed by a spine of

lofty mountains throughout its whole length from north to south, having a maximum

 altitude of 12,000 feet.
       It will be seen that after the rains the drainage of this chain is necessarily

 carried over a very small area, and that the changes caused by erosiou and the
 deposit of detritus must be well defined. The Pacific Gulf Stream, known to the
 Japanese as * Korosiwo,' flows north on the eastern side, raising the mean tem-
 perature of Formosa to about ten degrees higher than that of tlie mainland. The
 prevailing winds throughout the year are the north-east and south-west monsoons.
 The former begins to blow about the end of October and continues on to April.

      In its passage across the ocean from the north it is charged with moisture

 taken up from tbe warm Gulf Stream, and coming in contact with the lofty moun-

 tain barrier of Formosa, it is forced up to a great altitude, where its burden of
 A'apour is liberated by the lighter and colder air. This is discharged over tbe forest-

' clad heights in copious rain.

     On the eastern side the rain descends through chasms and gorges in torrential
 streams, and cataracts carry it back to the ocean. The eastern side presents a
 rocky front to the sea. The denudation of the mountains by erosiou and its effects

 can hardly be traced on this side of the island, as the detritus is deposited in the

 deep sea adjoining the cliffs. On the west of the central chain, where the gradient
 is more gentle, we find an extensive plain, part of which has been built up within
 the historic era by the detritus washed down from the mountains, and the major
 part in a similar manner during the Carboniferous period, as may be gathered from
 extensive coral islands (and other geological formations) which now form part of the

 low-lying land redeemed from the bed of the ocean.

     But we need go no further back for evidence of the rapid upbudding of the

 western plain than the date of the Dutch occupation in 1634.

   --Two forts were erected one, Providentia, at the mouth of the Formosa River

 (Taiwanfu), the other on the island of Taiwan. The former may now be traced

 within tbe walls of Taiwanfu, more than five miles inland over the plain, while

 Taiwan with its fort has been long united to the mainland.
     Evidence of how this change has been accomplished exists in the table-lands

 and spurs of the central range, about fifteen miles inland from Taiwanfu, in the
 manner in which these lower ' no man's lands,' so named by the Chinese, are cut
 up and demolished by the drainage of the lofty chain, chasms cut out by
 torrents during the rainy season, vast funnel-shaped pits where the land has fallen in
 undermined by water, broad river beds cut deep into the table-lands, their banks

strewn witli rounded and polished boulders of gigantic proportions that have been

driven from inaccessible heights and rounded on their downward course to the
plain. The greater part of the plain is ' an alluvium,' a rich loam derived partly

from the shales of the central mountains, partly from the sandstones south, and

partly from the limestone hills which reach here and there above the level of the

lowland. These are the great and small Kangshan, the white bank, Apeshill,

Saracenshead, Fingshan ; also still more elevated hills inland approaching Baksa

WeValley ; by water, Lambay island near Tangkang.        see thus within the narrow

compass of the island of Formosa rainfall and its results, year by year adding

to the habitable plain, and creating extensive shoals between the island and

mainland.

Another phase of rain-work in Formosa is the effect which the central moun-

tain range has in withdrawing the moisture from the atmosphere as it sweeps over

the island during the north-east monsoon, and conferring on the mainland of
Fakim Kwangtung, a province of China, one of the finest winter climates in the

world.

                  .

                     By the Prince of Monaco.

     The western shores of Europe, especially those of Great Britam and Ireland,
are exposed to continual devastations by storms which come from the westward.
The only source from which we can obtain warning is the continent of North
America, and the warnings thence received are of the greatest value. But the
width of the North Atlantic is so great that American storms lose themselves, and
others are generated of which Europeans can at present receive no warning. The
North Atlantic is fairly rich in islands, and in nearly every group there is at least
one island of remarkable altitude, where the meteorological conditions are likely

to be quite distinct from those obtaining at the sea-level. The results already
achieved at the high-level observatory on Ben Nevis justify the confident expec-
tations that equally and perhaps more valuable results would be obtained by the
establishment of a pair of high- and low-level observatories in one of the Atlantic
groups of islands, preferably the Azores. These groups of islands either are

alreadj-, or will be shortly, connected by cable with Europe, and the author

strongly advocates that we should now establish meteorological observing stations

at carefully selected sea-level places having cable connection with Europe, and
at least one high-level observatory at the top of one of the remarkable peaks
suggested. Further, as it might be advantageous to have these observations col-

lected at an observatory where much attention is given to oceanographical work,
he ofiers to undertake at Monaco the collection and discussion of the observations

received daily, and the distribution of the results.

                      By Hugh Robekt Mill, D.Sc., F.B.S.E.

     The configuration of the Firths of Forth and Tay and of the neighbouring parts
of the North Sea was briefly described, references being given to previous papers

bearing on the physical conditions of the water.' Since the publication of these
papers the results of the observations at fixed stations by the Fishery Board for

Scotland furnish data for a more complete discussion. The new information

mainly concerns the rate of increase of transparency in the water from the river
seaward and the eflects of tidal action on temperature and salinity. The configura-
tion of the coast and the set of the tides, together with the relative strength of
current at springs and neaps, and the hour at which these extreme tides occur,

explain many apparent anomalies in seasonal change of temperature. In summer

estuary water is warmer, in winter colder, than that of the sea ; so that, disregard-
ing solar influence, the temperature of the water at a station near the mouth of an

estuary is either at a maximum or a minimum at high-water and low-water, the
maximum occurring with low-water in summer, with high-water in winter.

Apart from this, there is a diurnal range of temperature due to solar heating and

cooling by radiation, which in the absence of tides would produce a maximum in
the afternoon and a minimum in the early morning. Spring tides recur fortnightly

at the same hour, and evince the special tidal characteristics in an extreme degree.
It so happens that on the east coast of Scotland low-water springs occur in the
morning and high-water in the afternoon, and the observations at 9. Oh. and lo.Oh.
accordingly show the resultants of this effect at the maximum. In summer, when
low water occurs in the afternoon, the afternoon temperature at the Abertay
lightship is over 1° C. higher than in the morning, and when high-water occurs in
the afternoon the temperature is nearly 1° C. lower than in the morning, no matter

how strong the solar heating may be. ·

                    By H. Dickson, F.B.S.F., F.B.Met.Suc.

     The selection of subjects for elementary scientific instruction raises several

questions concerning the relations of the different branches of physical science to

each othei-. Apart from special applications to arts and manufactures, a want is
felt of a subject which shall at the same time afl^ord opportunities of illustrating
scientific methods and give examples of practical value in accounting for many
natural phenomena of common observation. The ordinarj' phenomena of meteoro-
logy, as embodied in the weather folk-lore current everywhere, are already
familiar to sailors, fishermen, and farmers, the classes it is most important to
reach, and by properly classifying and arranging the facts already known to them

tieveral laws may be made to suggest themselves. In this way the meteorological

elements, which in this restricted sense underlie a great part of biology, geology,
and geography, form an introduction to the fundamental notions of these sciences,
as well as to those of physics involved in their discussion.

     There is as yet no instruction in meteorology available anywhere in this
country, but in view of the rapid development of technical education it is urgent
tliat this should be remedied.

Councils, backed by the approval of the various bodies whose function it is to
regulate and extend scientific instruction. In this -way a demand for teaching in
meteorology would be created, and the supply shjould come from some of the main
fixed centres of technical education, which should not only supply systematic
instruction, but should be in a position to deal with questions referring to the
relations of meteorology to agriculture, fisheries, &c., and to- discuss the data
collected by the teachers sent out bearing on local observations and prognostics.

               5. The Desert of Atacama. 5y Mrs. Lillie Grove,

     The desert of Atacama spreads over two Chilian provinces, Atacama and Anto-
fagasta. It lies between the Pacific and the Andes, and between the rivers Loa and
Copiapo to the north and south. It rises gradually to the Cordillera real, forming
a kind of amphitheatre, in the midst of which are arid plains and vast salt lakes.
One of the latter. Lake Askotan, is quite dried up, and its bed of salt is dotted
with a few islands and tepid water puddles called ' water-eyes.' It is surrounded
by hio-h mountains, many of which are volcanic. Above this amphitheatre is the
tableland of the Andes, 13,000 feet high, called Pima, which word is the origin
of the name given to mountain-sickness.

     Turning to the industrial history of the desert, we find that it was a terror to

all except the conquering Spaniards until the end of the last century; and while
the silver mines of Potosi were being successfully worked the treasures of this
region lay unexplored. In 1832 Juan Yodoi, a shepherd, found the silver mine of
Chauarcillo, and then a legion of courageous and hardy cateadores (mine-seekers)
laid siege, as it were, to the mountains. The discoveries of silver and copper
mines, of beds of guano, of nitrates, and borate of lime followed one another in
quick succession, and laid the foundation of great commercial prosperity. The
Government gave its countenance and help to the work, sending out scientific
commissioners and giving security to capitalists.

     The great work which requires special notice is the railway from Antofagasta
to Uyuni, which is a marvel of engineering skill. It scales a plateau 13,000 feet
high "and winds through a desert plain. The whole journey lasts three days, and
is not entirely a pleasant experience, as the sun, falling on the white soil, makes

a blinding glare, and the heat and thirst are almost unbearable. On the way that
strange phenomenon of the desert, the mirage, was seen by the traveller. The

plain, which stretches out to the horizon, was dotted over with the graves of the
victims of the desert. It is interesting to notice that the soil and the air are such
that bodies do not decay in the ground, and the inhabitants are in the habit of
removing the corpses of their friends from place to place. At night the cold is
intense, the changes of temperature being a great hardship. As the line rises the
prospect becomes more varied : the road winds round the Limou Verde, and below
is the basin of Atacama in the midst of the desert, while all around are the mighty
volcanoes, Licancour, San Pedro, and others. Then the line descends into the
valley of the Loa. Halt for the night is made at Calama, ' The Queen of tlie
Desert,' where the hotel is comfortable on the whole. The journey is continued
on the next day past Askotan, on the edge of the lake, and CeboUar, where there
are mines of ice. From Calama another hardship is added to the heat, namely,
mountain-sickness, which aflects nearly everyone. It is caused partly by the
pressure of the atmosphere, partly by the dryness of the air, wliich cuts the face
mercilessly. OUague is the stopping-place for the second night, and the next
evening the arduous journey is completed, and the terminus Uyuni is reached.
Here the Boliviau Government intends to build a town, which will be the centre
of silver mining in South America.

7. So7ne Notes on a New Method for the Determination of Oeographiral
           Longitudes by Lunar Distances. By Dr. H. Schlichteb.

     Lunar distances as a means for the strictly accurate determination of geo-
graphical longitudes have been little used of late, partly on account of the
splendid chronometers with which ships are now provided, and partly owing to
the inaccuracies of the instruments commonly employed for lunars. For exploring
expeditions on land, however, chrouometers are of little value, and the other

astronomical phenomena which may be used besides lunar distances are either too

difficult of accurate observation by the majority of travellers, or occur too seldom,
or are not accurate enough.

     The author therefore introduces a new method of observation and measurement
of lunar distances, viz., by obtaining a parallel series of photographs of the moon

and a fixed star or planet on one plate, and afterwards measuring the distances on
the plate. For the elimination of all possible inaccuracies of the photographic
film or of the lens, the lunar distances thus registered are checked by repeatedly
photographing on the same plate two fixed stars, the positions of which are given
in the ' Nautical Almanac,' and the angular distance of which can easily be com-
puted therefrom. The angular distances of the photographic lunars are then found
by a simple proportion. The time for taking a set of eight photographic lunars on
one plate does not exceed three to four minutes, and micrometric measurements'
show with perfect accuracy the change of the lunar distances (owing to the move-
ment of the moon) during each interval of the eight observations. The minute
accuracy of the method is hereby established. The micrometric measurements on
the plate are made by means of the same ' rcseau' which is employed by the
principal observatories for stellar photography, and the measurements may there-
fore be regarded as absolutely correct. Results thus obtained give the correct

longitude of the place of observation.

     The author proposes to use this method for scientific expeditions into the
interior of continents, &c., as well as for the further determination and correction
of secondary meridians in navigation. For both purposes it is especially adapted
on account of its minute accuracy and great simplicity.

1. Notes on a Portion of the Kalahari. By E. Wilkinson.

These notes, which are accompanied by a map, deal with that portion of the

Kalahari lying north of a line between Kuis and Honing A'ley. The author i.-<

inclined to doubt the accuracy of the position of Kuis as given in previous map?,

and the location, if not the existence, of the fork of the Molopo Ki-\er which is re-

presented in them. The soil of the district appears to be a heavy loose sand,

which supports, nevertheless, an abundance of coarse grass, and is densely studded,

rather than covered, with low timber and bush. In the few places where water

is obtainable, the cattle look well, but the scarcity of water is the curse of the

district, and the natives say that it will pass the wit even of white men to find it

supply, and they contain valuable extracts from a report by Mr. Penning, F.G.S.,
on that subject. If, as Mr. Penning believes, water in sufficient quantities could be
obtained by boring, the author thinks that the country might have a future in the
hands of a powerful company which could afford to open up waters and use the
district as a vast cattle range, but he evidently does not think it can ever be a

             2. The GeograpJiy nf the Zimhabive liuins in Mashonaland.

                                    By J. Theodore Bent.

     The author began with a few remarks on the nature of the ruins, their position
and extent, the vast gold industry anciently carried on in their vicinity, and the
probable line of approach to them. lie then dealt with the early authorities on
the geography of the east coast of Africa: the Periplus, Ptolemy, Eratosthenes,
and the vague remarks of Herodotus. The position of Rhapta, Prasum, and
other points on this coast was discussed. The expedition to the land of Punt in
the reign of Queen llatusou, and the treasures brought back thence, and the
mythical expeditions related by Greeks of voyages in search of gold were then
dealt with, as also the Biblical and classical evidence concerning the voyages of the
Phosnicians and Arabians in search of gold, and the wealth of Southern Arabia in
the precious metal. The author then dealt with early Arabian evidence as to the
condition of Mashonaland in the centuries immediately after the introduction of
Mohammedanism, Arab travellers a.d. 8o1, and the evidence given us on this
subject by El Masoudi, Zaueddin, and others. The value of the Portuguese
evidence on this subject was thoroughly discussed from travellers and writers of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The author concluded by referring to the re-
discovery of the ruins by Karl Mauch, and the evidence of the finds in the recent

excavations,

   4. The Orientation and Architectural Features of the Hiiined Temples of

                    Mashonaland. Bij Robert M. W. Swan.

     The temples in Mashonaland seem all to have been oriented to either the rising
or the setting sun at one of the solstices, and in all the less ruinous temples very
obvious evidence remains of such orientation in the decoration on the exterior of
the walls of these temples. This decoration on the great temple consists of a
double band of a chevron pattern, and it extends along the part of wall which is
directly opposed to the rays of the rising sun at the midsummer solstice.

     Means were provided for marking the time of the occurrence of the solstice,
and in the interior of the great temple there is a high monolith which would
I'eceive the shadow of another monolith placed on the wall at the middle of the
decoration when the sun rose at the midsummer solstice.

     The great temple at the first glance seems to be rouglily elliptical in form, but
when carefully measured its walls are found to be built on a number of circular
curves of different radii, and the principle governing the length of these radii is
interesting. The great tower has a diameter at its base of 17"l7 feet (=10 cubits
·of 20-G2 inches), and this length multiplied by the ratio of circumference to
diameter (3T4) or by the square of this ratio gives either the radius or the

diameter, or half or double of these, of the curves of all the walls of the best

period which we have measured in Mashonaland.

     Altars were sometimes erected at the centres of these curves, and means were
provided for observing from these altars the culminations of stars of the northern

hemisphere.

--I. In the Western Soudan there are many tribes, hat two chief Hausa and

Fellani. Fellani ov Fulbe : these are warlike, fanatical, pastoral. The Hausa are

brave, but not so fond of war ; not fanatical, but commercial. Where the two

come in contact Hausa language predominates.

geography, meteorology and climate, political economy, nature of people and

social economy, slavery, education, towns, religion.

1. On Professor Alhrecht PencFs Proposed Map of the World on a Scale of
                         1 : 1,000,000. By E. G. Ravenstein.

    At the recent Geographical Congress of Bern Dr. Penck proposed the publica-
tion of a map of the entire world on a uniform scale of 1 : 1,000,000. This pro-
position was favourably entertained, and a committee was appointed to take steps

for its realisation. That the scale chosen is the most suitable for the purpose
will hardly be doubted by anyone practically acquainted with the mapping of

the world. To construct such a map on a projection embracing considerable

portions of the earth's surface, if not entire continents, would necessarily have led

to an amount of distortion quite inadmissible in a map on such a scale. Dr. Penck,
therefore, does wisely to accept the method of drawing each sheet on an inde-

pendent projection, which was first adopted in India, and has subsequently been

introduced into Germany, Austria, the United States, and other countries. By

this method the separate sheets are nearly equivalent and orthomorphic, the error

for a 5-degree sheet under low latitudes, never exceeding 4 l-1050ths. This is
less than the error due to the expansion of the paper in the printing-press. Each
sheet, up to 60° N., would embrace five degrees in each direction ; the more
northern sheets would embrace ten degrees of longitude each. The representation
of the whole earth, including the sea, would require 936 of these sheets, whilst the
land alone could be shown on 769 sheets.

      Physical and political features are to be adequately considered. Rivers are to

be in blue, bills iu brown. Contours are to be drawn at 100, 300, 500, and 1,200
metres, and the areas enclosed by tbem, which Dr. Penck assumes to be equivalent,
 are to be tinted. Those sheets which deal with countries already surveyed would
 be engraved in copper; the remaining sheets might be lithographed.

      The Greenwich meridian is proposed for acceptance, but all altitudes are to b©
in metres. The official spelling of all coimtries using the Latin alphabet is to
be retained, even in their ' spheres of influence.' Other alphabets are to be
 transliterated in accordance with a system to be agreed upon, whilst names in
 unwritten languages would be spelt phonetically.

     Dr. Penck estimates the cost of an edition of 1,000 copies of this map (land

 surface only) at 191,4.38/., and as the sale of this edition at 2s. a sheet would pro-
duce onl}^ 88,000/., the deficit of 103,438/. would have to be made up by the
 Governments concerned or by liberal private patrons.

      There is nothing Utopian about the scheme, as far as I can see. Difficulties

may arise as to the spelling of the names or the introduction of the metre, but the

--essential thing, to my mind, is the production of a map a map on an uniform

scale. If it is borne in mind that twenty-tive 5-degree sheets of such a map of
Africa were, some years ago, published by me, with the help of tlie Royal Geo-
graphical Society, and that twenty-one sheets of the same map are now in course
of preparation, and that all this was done by me unaided, it must be admitted that

better and speedier results might be brought about by an organised co-operation.

          A2. Recent Journey in Yemen. By Walter B. Harris.

     Mr. Walter B. Harris' paper on Yemen deals with a journey undertaken by
him in the early months of this year, and during the rebellion of the Arabs against
the Turks. Mr. Harris started from Aden early in January without guards, and

accompanied only by one of his trusted Morocco servants and a guide, all three
mounted on camels. Passing through Lahej, Mr. Harris continued his journey
over the desert until, after issuing from the mountain gorges of Khoreiba, he
reached Kataba, the Turkish frontier town, and by means of a disguise succeeded

in obtaining a permit to pass into Turkish territory. From Kataba to Yerim the
journey was a very dangerous one, and the travelling was nearly all accomplished
by night, the day being spent in hiding in the jungle. From Yerim the journey
was continued to Dhamar, and thus to Sanaa, the capital ; Mr. Harris having taken

nineteen days in accomplishing the distance, nearly three hundred miles.

     On his arrival at Sanaa he was seized by the Turkish authorities and thrown

into prison, where, owing to the unhealthy state of the place and the bad water

supplied to him, he was taken ill with fever. On the fifth day of liis imprison-
ment he was sent away to Hodaidah on the Red Sea coast under an escort of

Turkish soldiers, the journey occupying about five days, the distance being some-

thing under two hundred miles. Mr. Harris passed through much wonderfully
beautiful scenery, and has brought back an account of Arabia Felix which entirely
belies one's ideas of that country. By most people Arabia is considered to be a
desert, but Mr. Harris has found that Yemen at least is a country of magnificent

fertility, the great plateau, lying at an elevation of from seven to nine thousand

feet above the sea level, being in a state of excellent cultivation. Water is by no
means scarce ; in fact in many places there are rivers of no inconsiderable size.
Although the journey has been made once or twice before, Mr. Harris is probably
the first European who has reached Sanaa from Aden. After much hard travelling,
several narrow escapes, four days' imprisonment in a Turkish gaol, and a violent
attack of fever, Mr. Harris reached Aden towards the end of February with a
considerable number of photographs and a large collection of notes and sketches

pertaining to a country of which but very little is known. An account of the

rebellion was written by him to the ' Times,' and published on April 23. At any
time the journey would not be an easy one, and, considering that the country was
in a state of revolt, Mr. Harris had to overcome very many difficulties before

reaching Sanaa.

             5. The Eastern Lacs States of Siam in the Melconrj Valley.^

         By W. K. D. Beckett, ofH.M.'s Consular Service in Siam.

      This paper is briefly descriptive of a journey taken by Mr. "W. R. D. Beckett,
under instructions from H.B.M.s Minister at Bangkok, through the Eastern Laos
States of Siam, and extending over a period dating from November 25, 1891, to
April 4, 1892. Mr. Beckett's first objective point was the town of Korat, the
capital and the most important centre of those States, distant by the shortest route
165 miles north-east from Bangkok, and between which and Bangkok a line of
railway has already been commenced by the Siamese Government. Mr. Beckett,
however, did not take the usual and shortest route, owing to the fear of want of
transport ; but crossing to Patriew and Kabin, country districts some 100 miles
east of Bangkok, followed the main road leading south-eastwards to Sisophone,
near the inland sea of Cambodia, thence by bullock-cart track almost due north
across the hill-range, 800 to 1,100 feet high, which encircles the Eastei-n Laos
plateau, and onwards in a north-westerly direction to Korat. The river Moon, or
Pramoon, or Peemoon, as it is variously called, which runs from west to east across
the Eastern Laos States into the Mekong River, was forded about ten miles south-
east of Korat. After a stay of ten days Mr. IJeckett left Korat on January 3,
1892, and journeyed by bullock-cart, across the thinly populated and occasionally
undulating plateau stretching between that town and the river Mekong, almost
due north to the important town of Nongkhai on the latter river, lying slightly
south of the 18° of north latitude. Ten days were spent at Nongkhai, during
which a visit was paid to the interesting ruins of Wiengchan, the ancient capital
of a once most extensive kingdom which embraced the whole of the Eastern Laos

States in the V^alley of the Mekong. From Nongkhai Mr. Beckett descended the
river Mekong to Kemmarat. a village on the right bank, and striking across by
land to Oobone, a town on the Moon River equal almost in importance to Korat,
took boat down that stream as far as the rocky barrage at its mouth, and there,
changing boats, redescended the Mekong. Stoppages were made at Bassac, once

the capital of a large State, at the cataracts of Lih Pih below the island of Khong,
and at Chiengteng, an important Siamese town a few miles north of the Cambodian
frontier. After passing many dangerous rapids Mr. Beckett entered Cambodian

territory, and taking the steamer of the Messageries Fluviales Co. at Kratieh,
the highest point of the river navigable by steamers in the dry season, arrived at
Pnompenh, the capital of Cambodia, on March 23. Changing steamers here,

Mr. Beckett descended the Mekong to the sea, and reached the French port of
Saigon on the next day, returning thence to Bangkok by way of Singapore.
Mr. Beckett arrived at Bangkok on April 4, after an absence of lo2 days.

  6. Cadamosto -· ' The Marco Polo of West Africa.' By H. Yule Oldham.

      Alrise da Ca da Mosto, born at Venice in 1432, entered, like Columbus and
 other Italians, the service of Portugal, and at the instigation of Prince Henry the
 navigator made two voyages along the west coast of Africa in the years 1455 and
 1456. In the second of these the Cape Verde Islands were discovered for the first
 time. The journals of these voyages form one of the eai-liest personal narratives
 of an explorer, and are of particular value as a connecting link between the periods
 of Prince Henry and Columbus, the two great figures in the history of geographical

 discovery in the fifteenth century.

     As the trustworthiness of Cadamosto has been seriously impugned, the object

 of the paper is not merely to draw attention to the merits, but to vindicate the

 character, of this important traveller.

                       7. North Korea. By C. W. Campbell.

    The subject of this paper is a journey which -was undertaken by Mr. C. W.

 Campbell, a member of Her Majesty's Consular Service in China, through the
northern half of Korea to the Manchurian frontier in the autumn of 1889.

      Starting from Soul, the capital of Korea, on August 31, Mr. Campbell crossed
the peninsula by a north-easterly route to Won-san, the treaty port on the east

coast. The interesting portion of this traverse was the Keum Kang San, or

Diamond Mountains, which had not previously been visited by a European. They
 are a notably irregular section of the principal Korean range which descends from
the Ch'ang-pai Shan (Ever- White Mountains) of Manchuria, are the head-quar-
ters of Korean Buddhism, and possess some striking scenery which attracts
numbers of native tourists every year in spring and autumn.

     From Won-san the route followed the coast to Ham-heung and Puk-ch'ong,
whei-e it broke inland to Kap-san and the Yalu River. At Po-ch'on, a village on

a branch of the Yalu, Mr. Campbell procured guides and bearers, and continuing
northward through an uninhabited forest, made an attempt to ascend the extinct

volcano of Peik-tu San (White-Head Mountain), better known as the 'Long
W^hite Mountain,' which is an erroneous translation of the Chinese Ch'ang-pai
Shan, or Ever-White Mountain. It was first authentically visited in 1886 by
Mr. James and his party, who approached it from the Manchurian side. Besides
being the centre of much legend and fable in both ]\Ianchu and Korean history,
the TSTiite ^fountain is remarkable physically by reason of an Alpine lake which

has formed in the extinct crater at 7,000 or 8,000 feet above sea-level. Mr.
Campbell just failed to reach this lake in consequence of heavy falls of snow and
the illness of his principal guide. The return journey to Soul was varied by re-
crossing the peninsula to P'ong-yang. Altogether the ground covered was 1,300

miles, a good deal of which was unknown to geography.
     Korea is a hilly country, with poor roads, and worse government. The soil

is prolific, but the system of agriculture piirsued is lazy and primitive. There are

many indications of mineral wealth, alluvial gold being particularly widespread
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

however, the Government is extremely averse to the e.xploitation of mines by
foreigners, and little or nothing has been done under native auspices. The Korean
race is physically superior to the Japanese, and not inferior to the Chinese, The
national disposition is bright, good-humoured, and sans faqon, but improvidence
and laziness are prominent negative qualities. Fortunately for Western travellers,
the Koreans are not so pronouncedly 'anti-foreign' as their neighbours the

Chinese.

    Section F.--ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

--President of the Section The Hon. Sir Charles AV. Feemaxtee, K.C.B.

                   THVMSDAY, AUGUST A.

The President delivered the following Address :

I SUPPOSE that few Presidents of any Section of this Association begin the

preparation of their Addresses without taldng at least a mental retrospect of the

work of their predecessors. I have turned with great interest to the Address

delivered by the late Lord Neaves, who occupied tliis chair in 1871, when the

Association last met in Edinburgh. Lord Neaves rightly held that the subject of

statistics is ancillary to the main subject of the Section, Economic Science, and

his immediate predecessor, the lamented Professor Stanley Jevons, pointed out

at Liverpool in 1870 that even 'the name "statistics" in its true meaning denotes

all knowledge relating to the condition of the State or people.' I propose to devote

the main portion of my Address to a subject to which I have devoted much atten-

tion, and whicli is intimately connected with the welfare of an important section

of our people, and I shall hope to point out the means which may be taken to

promote their welfare without leading them, as Lord Neaves expressed it in his

concluding words, ' to dispense with ordinary and necessary prudence.' It is

impossible to exaggerate the change which has taken place since the date of Lord

Neaves's Address in the ideas of the public as to its responsibilities in regard to

what is called charity. While it recognises that much which was then held to be

'charity' is nothing more than justice to the poorer classes, its sense of the

dangers of pauperisation has been greatly intensified, and it justly regards many of

the charitable methods which would then have been unhesitatingly advocated as

not conducive to their best interests. I venture to claim a considerable part of

the change which has taken place as due to the efforts of the Charity Organisation

Society, which had then been recently founded, and of which I have the honour

this year to be Chairman. I claim that the Society has made men everywhere

think, and think seriously, of the duty incumbent upon them, not only of giving,

but of giving with care and discrimination, and that it has enlisted in the service

of their poorer brethren an army which, besides being always ready to be pru-

dently generous, is in a thousand cases williug to ensure, by personal effort, that

charitable help shall be wisely and kindly dispensed. Such personal effort realises

what was well described centuries ago in the Talmud as ' the doing of kind-

ness,' and is developing 'a system founded not on rights but on sympathy,

dealing not in doles but in deeds of friendship and of fellowship, and demanding a

giving of one's self rather than of one's stores.' It has naturally followed that col-

lateral subjects, such as the promotion of thrift and the better regulation of

benevolent and benefit societies, have during the last twenty years received a

greatly increased amount of enlightened attention.

     Before proceeding, however, to the main subject of my iVddress, let me briefly

refer to two questions more directly connected with the special work to which the

mygreater part of  official life has been devoted.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                        823

The first of these is the restoration of the g^old coinage, a question which has

for many years past exercised the minds of successive Chancellors of the Exchequer,

and has been a stumbliug-hlock to bankers and the commercial world. It had

long been felt that the machinery provided by the law, as laid down in the old

proclamations and embodied in the doinage Act of 1870, was of necessity powerless

to maintain the gold currency in an efficient condition. The law provided that

* where any gold coin of the reahn is below the current weight . . . every person

shall, by himself or others, cut, break, or deface any such coin tendered to him in

payment, and the person tendering the same shall bear the loss ; but as there was
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       '

no penalty for the disregard of this obligation, it became practically inoperative.

Gold coins, however much below the least current weight, passed freely from hand

to hand, and bankers received them from their customers and paid them away again.

Only the Bank of England and a few other public departments obeyed the law,

with the result that the principal sufferers were the banking establishments, who

in the course of business pay large amounts of gold coin into the Bank of England,

and were obliged to submit to the loss on all coins found to be light. The banks,

in self-defence, naturally paid in as many full-weight coins as possible and put the

light again into circulation. Not more than 1,500,000/. of light coin, therefore,

was annually withdrawn, and it was calculated that, at last, of the sovereigns in

circulation as many as 46 per cent., and of the half-sovereigns no fewer than 70

Aper cent., were below the least current weight.  Bill was brought in in 1884

for the withdrawal of light coins by the State and for the substitution for the

half-sovereign of a ten-shilling piece of the intrinsic value of 9s., so that a fund

might be provided to cover the expense of the operation and of the future main-

tenance of the currency in a proper condition ; hut this Bill was not proceeded

with. Of the subsequent Bills introduced none became law, until in 18S9 an Act

was passed withdrawing light gold coins of former reigns, and these coins were

finally called in under a proclamation issued in November 1890. The entire

operation was effected at a cost of about 50,000/. It is curious to note that this

is the first instance in which gold coin has been decried in this country, for the

guinea and half-guinea had never been declared uncurrent, and doctors and others

might have contended that their fees were still represented by coins which were

legal tender. The Act of 1889, with the subsequent proclamation, having served

its purpose by clearing the circulation of all the older gold coinages, there only

remained coins of the present reign to deal with. The Coinage Act of 1891 pro-

vides for the withdrawal of light gold coin by the State at its full nominal value,

and will apply equally to coins which will hereafter become light as to those

which have already fallen below the legal weight. No one can now or in the

future suffer for tendering a li^-ht sovereign or half-sovereign more than for making

a payment with a worn half-crown or shilling, and any Victorian gold coin

tendered at the Bank of England, provided that it has not been defaced and that

its weight has not been fraudulently reduced, is received and exchanged. For the

present, coins must be sent in in parcels of 100/. It is unnecessary to dwell upon

the advantage which tliese arrangements have conferred, and will confer, upon

the public, In 1842-45, when the previous withdrawal of light gold took place,

the coin was only paid for by weight at the Mint price of 3/. i7s. \Oid. per ounce,

and many were the misunderstandings and bitter the complaints to which the

conditions of withdrawal gave rise. No inconvenience or alarm, on the other

Land, is likely to attend the measures necessary under the Act of last year, which

make it possible to effect the gradual withdrawal of the light coin without friction.

To July 1 last the amounts withdrawn were: sovereigns 5,150,000/., and half-

sovereigns, 3,850,000/. It had been estimated that the average deficiency of weight

in each sovereign would be 2'57f/., and in each half-sovereign 2'65^7.,and the actual

deficiency found has been 2'65f/. in the case of sovereigns and 2'93</. in the

case of half-sovereigns. After the first withdrawals have been effected it is

probable that the deficiency will become less, as a certain amount of much worn

coin had no doubt been accumulated in banks in anticipation of the passing of the

Act. As far as the work has as yet proceeded, however, the cost of withdrawing

1,000,000/. in sovereigns has been found to be 11,050/., and of withdrawing
--824 REPOET 1892.

A3,000,000/. in lialf-sovereigns 24,418Z.  sum of 400,000/. was set aside by tlie

Act for the expenses of the withdrawal, which will be sufficient at this rate to

meet the loss on 26,593,000/. Elaborate investigations were conducted by the late

Professor Jevons in 1868, by Messrs. Inglis Palgrave and J. B. Martin in 1882,

and by the Mint in 1888, with a view of ascertaining the total amount of light

gold in circulation in the United Kingdom. Time does not admit of my analysing

the results here, and indeed, so far as actual facts are concerned, the problem can

never be solved, as a large number of coins become light each j'ear, and the

restoration of the currency, therefore, can never be complete. I might perhaps

mention, as an interesting fact, that the Mint examination just referred to showed

the gold coins circulating in Scotland to be less worn than those in circulation in

England and Wales, owing no doubt to the general use in the north of 11. notes.

     The other question connected with the currency to which I wish to refer is ono
which since the last meeting of the Association has been much discussed, and
which, though it has not as yet been the subject of legislation, is of primary

importance.

     In December last the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in an address at the
London Chamber of Commerce, described the changes which he thought it would
be desirable to make in the currency sj'stem of this country for the purpose of
increasing the central store of gold. The Baring crisis and difficulties which

accompanied it, and in particular the necessity for obtaining 3,000,000/. in gold

from the Bank of France at very short notice, had drawn the attention of the
business communitj- to the fact that the existing metallic reserve was very small
in relation to the enormous structure of credit founded upon it, and that it might
be found to be wholly insufficient. jMr. Goschen's proposal was to allow the
Bank to issue 1/. notes, requiring four-fifths of any additional amount of issue so
created to be covered by gold, while only the remaining fifth would be allowed to
be issued against securities. The eifect of this scheme, if 1/. notes proved popular,
would have been to increase the total amount of the central store of gold, and also
to increase the proportion borne by the gold in the Issue Department of the Bank
of England to the note-issue covered by it. At the same time the profits upon the
fiduciary portion of the additional issue would have sufficed to defray the cost of
that issue without additional charge to the public. The Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer considered that if a substantial increase were by these means secured in
the gold in the Issue Department, it would be safe to allow the Bank, in times of
crisis, an elastic power of issuing further notes against securities, upon conditions
stringent enough to secure this privilege from abuse. This elastic power of in-
creased note-issue was intended to take the place of the illegal suspensions of the
Bank Act which bad on several occasions been found necessarj^ in the past.

     This scheme was the subject of much discussion both in the Press and in

banking and business communities. There appeared to be a general consensus of
opinion that an increase in the central store of gold was ver}' desirable, but there
was difference of opinion as to the manner in which that increase might best be

brought about. Objection was also felt by many bankers, and by a large part of

the general public in the South of England, to the issue of 1/. notes.
     The conditions of the concluding session of the late Parliament were not

favourable for dealing with a large scheme of currency reform, and, as it was
evident that the scheme proposed would not receive such unanimous support as
would make it possible to pass it without very full discussion and consideration,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not bring his proposals before the House of
Commons in the shape of a Bill.

     I make no apology for devoting a large part of this .\ddress to the subject of

old-age pensions, although I am inclined to condole with my hearers and myself
on the necessity of discussing a question which has now been for many months
before the public, and which may by this time be considered to have been worn

somewhat threadbare. But the question is surely a great and important one, en
                                            TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                              825

the wise solution of which the welfare of a not inconsiderable part of our population!

may materially depend, and one, therefore, which should certainly find a place in

the discussions of this section of the British Association.

    All honour, let me say in the first place, to Canon Blackley, the pioneer of the-
movement so closely identified with his name and labours ! Canon Blackley was,
and is, in the opinion of many thou;^htful people, only in advance of his age, and

deserving of the credit of seeing that without compulsion no system of national

insurance worthy of the name can be carried into effect. His scheme, with others

subsequently proposed, was considered by a committee of the House of Commons

originally appointed in 1883, and reappointed in the Parliaments of 1885 and 1886,

' to inquire into the best system of national provident insurance against pauperism.'

The report of the Committee, issued in August 1887, stated that their inquiry had

' practically narrowed itself into an examination of one particular scheme,' namely,
Canon Blackley's, ' which had manifestly impressed itself, whether favourably or

unfavourably, upon the minds of witnesses, to the exclusion of all other proposals/

It might ' be briefly described,' they reported, as a scheme ' for the compulsory

insurance of all persons, of both sexes and of every class, by the prepayment

between the ages of 18 and 21 years of the sum of 10/. or thereabouts "into a

National Friendly or Provident Society, thereby securing to the wage-earning

classes 8s. per week sick-pay and 4s. per week superannuation pay after the age

of 70 years.' In pronouncing their opinion on the scheme, the Committee first

called attention to the evidence they had received from working-men and large

employers of labour in favour of enforced contributions to a National Insurance

Fund, the latter class of witnesses describing the benefits which had resulted from

the establishment of such funds among persons in their own employment. They

then proceeded to record the objections to the scheme laid before them from th&

administrative and actuarial points of view ; to the difficulty of enforcing the pay-

ments to the  fund                      to  the  exclusion of all  but wage-earners from benefit ;  to the
                                     ;

discontent which would be felt by the upper and middle classes at being called

iipon to contribute ; and, finally, to the proposal for compulsion, which they considered

' open to very strong objections.' It is clear, I think, that we are not prepared, a<t

any rate at present, for the adoption of so sweeping a measure.

Canon Blackley has, indeed, since expressed his willingness to admit the idea of

State aid towards pensions in accordance with the proposals of the National

Provident League, with which he is connected ; but he appears disposed to admit
this and other deviations from his original plan only as stepping-stones towards a

general system of compulsory contributions.

     I next turn to Mr. Chamberlain's scheme. Mr. Chamberlain and the voluntary

Committee of Members of the House of Commons with whom he is associated

propose to establish a State Pension Fund, to which Parliament should be asked to
make an annual grant, to be supplemented by contributions from local rates. The-

scheme is applicable to both men and women, and contains provisions for the-

payment of certain sums into the Post Office Savings Bank before the age of

twenty-five, and certain further sums during each of the succeeding forty years,

which would entitle men to pensions of 13/., and women to pensions of 71. 16s. per

annum at sixty-five. There are other provisions for the cases of widows of persona

dying before sixty-five, and for other contingencies. There can be no doubt that

this is a serious and businesslike attempt to grapple with the problem before us,

but it seems open to the objection that it only touches the fringe of the question.

By it only the willing fish would be swept into the net, while the too numerous

small fry, anxious to elude the cast of the fisherman, whose especial object it

nevertheless is to secure them, are allowed to swim away at their ease in the sea

of thriftle.ssness and prospective pauperism. No one who knows the mental

attitude and habits of thought prevalent among a large proportion of the working-

classes can have failed to note the force of the resistance which they are too often

inclined to oppose to any attempt, however gentle, to bring them into the

disagreeable position of making deKnite arrangements even for the immediate

future, and of practising anything like systematic self-denial. The inveterate

dislike to looking forward, the hopefulness that in some cases seems actually \x>

grow as misfortunes thicken, the daily evidence that 'muddling on' often does

--not in fact lead to any decisive or irretrievable catastrophe all these contribute to

encourage a 'happy-go-lucky ' existence, and to fortify the belief that without any

special etlbrt life maj^ not improbably be lived without great distress, and in due

time brought to a fairly satisfactory- end. With these fatalistic views and ideas,

can we wonder that there is so little thought of the morrow ? It is to be feared

that such a scheme as Mr. Chamberlain's, notwithstanding the manifest advantages

which it offers, would not be widely adopted except by the comparatively small

number of prudent people who are already prepared to make the effort necessary

to secure a provision for their old age.

    Many other schemes of more or less importance and interest have been put

forward.  Some are ingenious some appear to contemplate the problem from one
                                                                                                                      ;

Anpoint of view only ; others are, I had almost said, fantastic.  able and useful

work by Mr. J. A. Spender, published in February last, and entitled ' The State

and Pensions in Old Age,' with a preface by Mr. Arthur Acland, M.P., discusses

the merits of the more important proposals which had then been made, and

contains much valuable information.
    Among the contributions to the literature of the subject should be mentioned a

pamphlet by the Rev. T. AV. Fowle, rector of Islip, with tlie title 'The Poor

Law, the Friendly Societies, and Old-age Destitution : a proposed Solution.'

Mr. Fowle advocates the gradual extinction of outdoor relief within a period not

exceeding twenty-five years, and the allocation to the friendly societies of the sum

thus saved, which he reckons, including cost of management, at 3,000,000/. per

annum, on condition that they should in return guarantee a sufficient maintenance

to all their members permanently disabled by sickness or old age. He further

proposes that, in consideration of this subsidy, the societies should be required to be,

or to become, efficient, and to subject their tables, investments, and rules to the

sanction of a Government authority. I do not think the societies would consent to

this arrangement. It would doubtless have the eventual effect of putting them all

on a solvent basis, except those whose financial position is clearly hopeless, and

whose extinction might be contemplated, as Mr. Fowle contends, with equanimity.

But such an interference with the affairs of the societies generally would be

resented, and their opposition to it, and to any general scheme of pensions which

would affect their position and objects, could hardly be considered unnatural or

altogether selfish, composed as they are in the main of the flower of the working-

classes, keenly alive to the advantages of their independence, and to the evils

which any infringement of it might entail.

   A striking instance of the feeling in tliis matter is afforded by the speech of the

Grand Master of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows at the annual Congress of

--Delegates held at Derby in June last. Speaking of old-age pensions, Mr. Bytheway

said : ' For the State to assume that a man in these days was not in a position

to earn for himself sufficient to put bv' to keep himself in old age without assist-

ance from the State would have a most demoralising effect, and would be impolitic

on national grounds, and calculated to destroy that independence of character that

had done so much in the past history of our country to raise and elevate the

--people, and encourage thrift upon the only true basis industry, self-help, and self-

denial, and, therefore, to create a strong self-reliance in its train of good re-

sults. If the lazy or drunken were to fare alike with the temperate and

industrious, this would not encourage thrift ; and by giving pensions all round it
would certainly not be an encouragement to the better members of society, but

would act in a contrary direction. The suggestion that the medium for granting

State pensions should be tlirough the agency of friendly societies perhaps more

immediately concerned them.  As they had built up for themselves a position,

and accumulated large funds by the exercise of liberty in managing their own

affairs, he would not advise running the risk of losing this liberty and selling their

own birthright for a mess of pottage, and having the right of self-management

curtailed by any intermeddling on the part of the State, which would be sure to

follow if State aid were accepted by them in their aggregate capacity as Odd-

fellows. Any friendly society accepting such aid would, no doubt, very soon be

subject to State control; in fact, having expended public money, Government

would only be doing its duty by claiming complete supervision of the affairs of
any society so aided. Whatever form the national pension scheme took, it meant
an enormous burden being cast upon the country, and the rate and tax payers
would have to supply the means, to a very great extent. The lowest estimate
would mean many millions per annum. In fact, the members of the Manchester
Unity would be in the position of not only providing for themselves but contribut-
ing to a greater number in the aggregate who, through laziness, dissipation, and
want of thought to provide for a rainy day, neglected all the opportunities afforded
by such societies as theirs, or by any other means, to make any provision at all for
the future. This struck at the very root and foundation of friendly societies, and
would eventually endanger, if not destroy, all such institutions, as it would be
unjust that the careful and watchful should pay for the reckless and vicious, and

even be punished by having to provide for their maintenance. . . . He himself

thought that any scheme should be self-supporting, and that the public funds
should not be drawn upon to provide pensions. The country had been made what
it was by individual character, and friendly societies had done very much to form

that character among the hard-working population, and might now be regarded as

bulwarks of strength to it.'

     At another point in the working-man's social scale, we find the following
resolution passed by the Executive of the London Deckers' Union in March last.
While its political economy is perhaps not so good as that of tlie Oddfellows, and

--its language is stronger, it breathes the same spirit of dislike of interference with

the management of a Pension Fund : ' That this Executive Committee of the
Dockers' Union hereby declares its opinion that any section of Pension Fund not

Webeing directly controllable by payees should not be countenanced in any way.

are of opinion, also, that it is an insidious attempt to perpetrate an unjust taxation

upon wages. Also a means of retaining a large portion of the workers' earnings
for employers' own benefit; while the possible good of such a system is so remote,
the longevity of the toilers so low an average, and industrial mortality so higb

through insufficient wage and unhealth}' environment, that we consider it opposed

to economic fairness and a curtailment of remuneration, relieving capital and
property of burdens at the expense of the already overtaxed and underpaid

workmen.'

     Nor is the dislike to interference confined to schemes of State aid, for we read

that in February last a well-known manufacturing firm in Lancashire oflered to

subscribe 1,000/. a year towards a Sick and Pension Fund for their workpeople,
and that the proposal was rejected by a majority of more than two to one, on the

ground, no doubt, that it would be prejudicial to the perfect freedom of the latter.

    Among the other schemes, Mr. Vallance, the Clerk of the Whitechapel Board
of Guardians, the value of whose contributions towards the science of Poor Law

Administration and cognate subjects has been so widely acknowledged, suggests
that wage-earners should be encouraged to put hj small weekly sums, to be met
by similar sums contributed, under legal enactment, by their employers, with a
view to the formation of a bonus at death, if happening before sixty-five, or of
pension after that age. The well-known objection to all such schemes is, that an
employer might be tempted in some shape practically to deduct from wages the
amount which he would be called upon to contribute.

     The proposal of Mr. T. Fatkin, Secretary and JNIanager of the Leeds Permanent
Benefit Building Societ}', points to the investment of savings, under the manage-
ment of municipal bodies, in local securities yielding a higher rate of interest than
that given by the Government, the compound interest on which at 3 or 3^ per
cent, would give greater benefit to the investor. This scheme, again, is one of
which it is obvious that advantage would only be taken by persons firmly resolved
to make some provision for the future.

     I need not .specially refer to other schemes which have been recommended,
with the exception of that of Mr. Charles Booth, whose views on any subject

connected with the welfare of the poor must always command the highest respect.
Mr. Booth has made a proposal which from its comprehensive boldness has
828 REroRT-- 1892.

astonished many of Lis admirers, and which, coming from any other quarter, would,

I venture to say, have been generally characterised, if not as Utopian, at least as
affording to our social and political intelligences, in their present imperfect state
of development, no food for serious discussion. It is nothing less, as is well known,

than a scheme for universal pensions, or general endowment of old age. With

his usual straightfor«'ardness Mr. Booth at the outset informs his readers ^ that,

as there are at present 733,000 women and 590,000 men, or about 1,323,000 per-

sons in all, above sLxty-iive years of age in England and Wales, a universal pension
list for those parts of the United Kingdom alone would amount, at 13/. each, to
17,000,000/. per annum. This sum is reduced by an anticipated contribution of
4,000,000/. from the local authorities in consideration of the reduction which
would be efl'ected in the rates, and the total amount to be provided by Imperial
taxation for carrying the scheme into etl'ect throughout the United Kingdom is

estimated at 16,000,000/. per annum. Mr. Booth anticipates that such a sum
could be raised without dithculty, by direct and indirect taxation, which latter

might include increased duties on sugar and drink, ' provided there be any desire
that the thing should be done.' I should fear that the means proposed would be
quite sufficient to counteract any such desire, and Mr. Booth is unquestionably

right in adding that ' if the project does not so far commend itself to the com-
munity as to make the necessary sacrifice welcome, no sensible statesman could

be expected to take it up.'

     But even if there should be any such widely expressed desire, let us see whether
the scheme shoidd commend itself in any degree to our matured ideas of self-

government or to our long experience of the working of the Poor Law and charit-
able and other agencies. It is proposed that every man and woman in the United

--Kingdom should, after sixty-live, receive a pension duke and dock -labourer,

countess and costermonger. Every person, whatever his or her position or ante-
cedents, whether good or bad, rich or poor, thrifty or reckless, is to be treated

in precisely the same way. No man, however wealthy or neglectful of his plainest

duties to society, however drunken or improvident, as soon as he has reached the
magic age, is to be debarred from the right to receive his pension. Is there any

merit, I would ask, in living to sixty-five? and cannot a man or woman who has

attained that age be almost as great a discredit to society as at any preceding
time of life ? Surely the mere fact of attaining a certain age should not obliterate

the equally certain fact, it may be, that a man's whole career has been a negation
of his duty as a citizen and even as a decent human beinir ! Nor can I pass over
as futile some of the many objections to the scheme which Mr. Booth mentions,
and with which he deals. Among these are, that the hard-working and thrifty

would pay for the idle and worthless, and that it is tmjust as well as impolitic

that the undeserving and those who have done nothing to help themselves should

benefit equally with the thrifty and deserving. Mr. IBooth contends (I quote his

own words) that as 'according to the present law every drunken, immoral, laz}",
ill-tempered old man or woman now existing has a right to demand the shelter of

the workhouse,' there can, therefore, be no harm in according to such people a
weekly allowance of five shillings, which is in eft'ect less than they would cost in
the workhouse. I think the difierence between the two cases is obvious. The

financial results of each arrangement, to the payer of rates and taxes, may be
nearly identical, but surely we ought to look further than this and see to it that

the deserving citizen is not confronted with the spectacle of his undeserving
brother living upon an allowance which he has done nothing to earn, in as perfect
freedom as himself, and with every advantage, so far as the law goes, which he
himself enjoys. I do not think this would be a very edifying state of things, nor

one likely to promote thrift. To this second point Mr. Booth only answers that
' it is even more subtly dangerous to inquire into a man's character than into his
means, if the benefit to be received is to be kept free from all taint of pauperism.'
1 confess that it disturbs me little, as I conceive it would disturb our disreputable
friend still less, to add the taint of pauperism to the many worse taints with which

he has been polluted, and to which he has become indifferent, during a long and

ill-spent life. If he could look forward to his pension, as Mr. Booth proposes,

would he feel a glow of moral superiority and of conscious pride in his manhood ?

Hardly. His motto would only vary the Epicurean ' Let us eat and drink, for

to-morrow we die ' to ' Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow ' (that is, when
we complete our sixty-fifth year) ' we shall get pensions of 5s, a week.' But

in regard to his prospective pensioners generally, however deserving, Mr. Booth

admits ' that a provision for old age, obtained compulsorily under the law, and

paid out of taxation, would carry with it none of the moral benefit which would

attend the winning of a pension by direct personal sacrifice . . . nor would

it directly minister to independence of chtiracter,' though he contends, in a some-
what too sanguine spirit as it appears to me, ' that no one would make less

voluntary effort to save because of it, and that many would increase their exertions

in this direction.' I should have thought that, on the contrary, looking to the

widespread inclination to prefer provision against sickness to insurance for old

age, which is a well-known feature in the habits of the working classes, and to

which the arrangements of the friendly societies bear such striking witness, the

mere fact of having a pension of 5s. a week to fall back upon would be sufficient

to deter most of them from making further provision for the declining years which

they may nerer live to see. Granted, however, that the advantages of a universal

pension scheme from taxation were fully shown, there still remain several points

touched upon by Mr. Booth which should make the cautious mind pause before

consenting to its adoption. For instance, Mr. Booth says : ' It is not to be for-
gotten or disguised that year by year the sum needed ' (for pensions) ' must

steadily increase, faster very likety than the rate of iucrease of the whole popula-

Whention. . . . Happily, wealth is increasing faster than population.'  it is con-

sidered that the initial cost is estimated at 16,000,000/. per annam, this is a very

disquieting suggestion, and quite sufficient in itself to make the boldest hesitate

before plunging into such a sea of uncertaint}-. Then the administrative details

of carrying the scheme  into  effect would  necessarily be somewhat  complex                                           and
                                                                                                                    ;

Mr. Booth shows that, when the official army of registrars and superintendent-

registrars has been set in motion, the arrangements for fixing the age of the

applicant made, and the precautions against fraudulent claims in two places taken,

a great deal of difficult and harassing work will have been done. He contends,

indeed, that the sj'stem is simple as compared with any scheme of national insur-

ance, but he says enough to show that, as might be expected, a very considerable
amount of trouble both to officials and claimants will be inevitable. And, finally,

he makes no provision for the expenses of the scheme, which, he thinks, need not
exceed from 10s. to 20s. in each case, suggesting that this amount ' could be de-
ducted from the first payments of pension, at the rate of 2s. 6d. a week till paid.'
It is to be feared that, looking to the necessity which there certainly would be,
especially in towns, of keeping a constant watch over each case to prevent fraud,

such as the drawing of a pension after the decease of the pensioner, the .·services of
registrars would be in pretty continuous demand, and those services would have

to be paid for.

But it may be said that national pension schemes have been set on foot in other

countries, and that there is no reason why we should be behindhand in the good

work. It is true that in Germany three insurance laws have been passed, and

--according to Mr. Wilhelm Bode whose article in the ' National Eeview ' of March
--last should be read by all interested in the question the latest, that for old age

and sickness, is by far the most unpopular. It is generally called the ' IQebegesetz,'

or ' Sticking Law,' from the immense number of stamps which it is necessary to

use in carrying its provisions into effect, and its administration appears to have

Abeen found intolerable.  report on the working of the law during the first year

(1891), made by Herr von Botticher in the German Reichstag in February last,
shows that there were 173,668 claims for old-age pensions under this law during

the year, of which 132,917 were allowed, the average amount of pension being 125

marks, or 61. a year. It is to be obser»-ed that these persons obtained pensions

without having contributed anything to the insurance fund. Mr. Bode states that
830 REPORT-- 1892.

Ilerr von Botticber congratulated himself that a larger number of persons called
upon to insure had not absconded, and that the discontent caused by it was not
greater, adding that no wish was felt in the country for a continuation of social
reform laws. This latest social law certainly does not appear to have been
attended with encouraging results. Already a popular movement for its repeal
has made some way in Bavaria, but there is of course but little prospect of getting
rid of it at present. Meanwhile the self-help societies liave either ceased to exist
or have been greatly crippled, and Mr. Bode can only hope that they will one by
one come back, and that the energy of German manhood, sapped by the compulsory
system, ^^^1I return, and the dishonesty which it fostered die out. His article
concludes with an earnest appeal to England not to encumber herself ' with any

--big scheme of any impatient State socialist,' but to remain, 'what she has been so

long, the chosen land of the free of the men who help themselves.' I think such

an appeal should touch us nearly.

     In June 1891 a Bill was presented to the French Chamber of Deputies by
M. Oonstans, then Minister of the luterior, and M. Rouvier, Minister of Finance,

for the creation of a ' Caisse Nationale deo Ketraites Ouvrieres,' or pension fund for

the benefit of workmen and others employed in trade, farm labourers, and domestic
servants of both sexes, whose income does not exceed 3,000 francs (120/.) per
annum. All persons in this position will be considered to be willing to take
advantage of tlie benefits of the fund, unless they make a declaration of unwilling-

ness before the maj'or of their place of residence. It is proposed that the fund
should be formed by equal contributions from the depositor and his employer,
which are either to be paid into the newly established ' Caisse,' or into duly

authorised provident societies already existing, and by an addition to be made by
the State equal to two-thirds of those contributions. The latter are to consist of
not less than five centimes nor more than ten centimes per working-day contri-
buted both by the workman and his employer ; and, taking the average number of

actual working-days in the year at 280, so as to allow for holidays, slackness of
work, and sickness, it is calculated that, after thirty years of continuous saving,
five centimes per day put by from each source, and invested at 4 per cent., should
amount to a pension of 180 francs, and ten centimes per day to a pension of 360
francs, per annum. These amounts not being considered sufficiently high to tempt

the class whom it is desired to benefit, it is proposed, as mentioned above, that the

State should materially add to them. The term of years over which the contribu-
tions are to spread is limited to thirty, as, owing to compulsory army service, it is

considered that contributors will hardly have settled down to steady worlc before

the age of twenty-five, and that but few persons would be willing to continue the

necessary payments beyond the age of fifty-five or fifty-six. On arriving at the

time for pension, the contributor must be able to prove that his income is not more
tlian 600 francs per annum. The Bill also contains provisions for life insurance,
the State contributing towards the payment of the annual premiums ; for the

payment of their pensions to contributors who have become permanently incapaci-
tated through sickness; and for the relief of those who may be obliged on account

of accidents to interrupt their payments into the fund. Several other Bills have
been brought forward by independent deputies with analogous objects, into the

details of which time will not permit me to enter. It is interesting, however, to

note that some of the methods proposed for raising the funds necessary to enable
the State to grant pensions are hardly such as would commend themselves to our
ideas ; as, for instance, tlie proposal in a Bill presented by several deputies that all
collateral successions to property should be suppressed, and that a sliding scale of
succession duty should be fixed, rising from 1 per cent, on sums below 10,000
francs to no less than 75 per cent, on sums above 1,000,000 francs. Hardly less

interesting is the suggestion of another enthusiastic legislator that, at the central

office of the pensions department, to be placed in the Louvre, there should be a

museum in which a ' golden book ' should be kept for inscribing the names of

donors of not less than 100 francs to the pension fund, while the generosity of
donors of 10,000 francs should be recorded on a marble tablet, and that of princely
subscribers of not less than 100,000 francs by a bust.
               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  831

In Italy the question of establishing a National Pension Fund has also been

widely discussed, and in past years several schemes have been proposed to the

ALegislature.  Bill is now before the Chamber providing for the establishment of

a central governing body, whose duty it would be to administer funds partly sub-

scribed by authorised savings banks or other self-help societies and by individuals,

and partly by the State from various specified sources. Every Italian, man or
woman, certified to belong to the working-L-lasses, may subscribe to the fund, but
not more than 500 lire, or 20/. per annum, and every person who has subscribed for

not less than twenty years is to be entitled at sixty to a pension, the amount of
which is to be determined by the amount of the contributions made to the funds

with the addition of compound interest. No pension may exceed '201. per annum.

Provision is also made, in the case of the subscriber's death, for the payment to his

representatives of all contributions and interest. It is evident that this scheme

does not go very far in the direction of establishing a general Old-age Pension

Fund.

     In April 1891 the Danish Legislature passed a law giving every Danish sub-

ject, man and woman, the right to a pension at sixty years of age. Exception is
made of persons who have been convicted of crime, who have fraudulently made
over their property to relatives or others, who have brought themselves to distress
by extravagance or evil-living, who have during the preceding ten years received
relief from the poor-law (assistance publique), or who have been convicted of men-

dicity. Applications for pensions are to be addressed to the parish (commune),

who will make all inquiries, and fix the amount of the relief to be granted, which
may be in money or in kind. The relief may be withdrawn if the pensioner should

become ineligible through misconduct or spend his pension improperly, and, if he

marries, his pension is ipso facto withdrawn, and he becomes chargeable to the
poor-law. It -will be seen, therefore, that there is in Denmark no sentimental

objection to an inquiry into an applicants moral character and pecuniary position

such as Mr. Booth so strongly deprecates, and that the so-called pensions are but

an extension of the system of what we should call outdoor relief. The pension is

to be derived from the parish, subject to certain conditions as to the applicant's

place of birth, or, if the place of birth cannot be determined, from the poor-law,

and the State contributes half the expenses of the parishes in distributing the

relief, provided that those expenses do not exceed one million crowns (55,000/.) in
each of the years 1891-95, and two million crowns (110,000/.) in subsequent years.

No appeal lies against the decision of the communal authorities.

It is evident that, as only one of the three schemes last mentioned is in

actual operation, they cannot as yet be fully judged, but I venture to question

whether there is anything which we could think of following here. In this

country there is, no doubt, a holy horror of the workhouse, but there is also a

perhaps unreasonable prejudice in favour of 'going as you please,' and a scarcely

less pronounced aversion, upon the whole reasonable and certainly characteristic,

to being what the French would call 'administered.' I can hardly imagine

my countrymen, of any class or disposition, subjecting themselves to a regular

system of Government interference in afluirs of which the management, or mis-

management for the matter of that, they have always considered to be a Briton's

birthright. Lot us ask ourselves, atter looking at the question in all its

bearings, whether we must not give up the idea of anything like compulsion
in matters of thrift, if indeed we must not also give up the idea, when it

came to the point, of anything in the nature of Government help and

intervention.

    But is there, then, no way in which help can be rendered to our deserving poor?
Must the present state of things go on, and the public conscience continue to be

.shocked at the sight of thousands of old people lapsing hopelessly into pauperism ?

HowLet us examine the present state of things, and look a little into its causes.

is old-age pauperism brought about .'' There is doubtless a not inconsiderable part
of our population which might make at least some provision for old age, but which

prefers the careless living from hand to mouth, and considers subscription to a burial
club the only claim which the future has upon it. As I have already said, even
832 REPORT-- 1892.

where there is some thought of the morrow, inveterate habit leads many bread-

winners to think more of the immediate than of the comparatively distant future

and to provide rather against the risk of accident or illness by joining a sick-club

than against the remote prospect of destitution when the day of work is over.

When all this is conceded there must remain, no doubt, many cases of unforeseen

and undeserved misfortune, in which old age overtakes the toiler without his

having had a chance of making provis"ion for it-- cases where wages have hardly

ever been such as to allow of saving, where families have been large and sickly,

where the struggling widow, work and pinch how she might, has had difficulty in

--keeping the wolf from the door. These are the hardships with which we must all

sympathise these are the sorrows we should all wish to relieve. Putting

unavoidable misfortune aside, however, for the moment, let us consider whether

our present system is such as to offer tlie maximum amount of encourao-ement

to self-help and self-reliance, and the minimum amount of encourao-ement to an

«asy-going frame of mind which looks forward to pauperism with equanimitv.

What are the prospects, generally speaking, of the average worker who has made lio

provision for bis old age ? lie sees the system of outdoor relief in full operation ·

he knows that unless and until he becomes utterly helpless and friendless, a dole
will be made to him which will keep him from starvation, and he learns to look

forward to that dole without repugnance and without dismay. The circumstances

under which it is allotted to him make but little change'in his family arrange-

ments. Ills able-bodied children, if lie has any, are seldom called upon by the

Guardians to make any great sacrifice for him, and he sinks down into a more or

less contented, but complete and hopeless, pauperism. I say that a community

·which tolerates and maintains such a system incurs a grave responsibility, and so

long as it makes no effort to improve it, has no right to wax impatient at the
·crying evil of old-age pauperism. And if a change in the system is possible, surely
we ought to consider whether it cannot and ought not to "be made before we seek
by heroic measures to set aside arrangements susceptible of gradual improvement

·and substitute for them a state of things which would perpetuate many of the

worst evils of dependence. If we had reason to believe that the Poor Law could

only be administered in the manner indicated above, we should perhaps be justified

in at once looking outside it for means to improve the condition of our aged poor.
WeBut the very reverse is the case.
                                                                                                                                                                                   _  have abundant evidence that by^firm and

^patient administration the condition of whole districts in regard to pauperism may

be radically changed, to the great benefit, material and" moral, of the poorer

inhabitants. During the last twenty years experiments in this direction have been

made both in urban and rural districts, not conceived in the spirit of empiricism or

-caprice, but undertaken as the result of ripe experience and with a single eye to

the real interests of the poor, which have been attended with complete success.
The tendency of the reforms effected has been, as is well known, towards a great

reduction, and in some cases the total abolition, of outdoor relief. In the waiter

of 1869-70 the Guardians of Whitechapel, one of the poorest districts in London,

lad forced upon them the necessity of reviewing their position. Up to that time,

in the words of Mr. Vallance, the Clerk to the Guardians

'The system may be said to have been that of meeting apparent existing

circumstances of need by small doles of outdoor relief, the indoor establishments

.... being reserved for the destitute poor who voluntarily sought refuge in them.
Able-bodied men who applied for relief on account of want of employment were

«et to work under the Outdoor Relief Ptegulation Order, and, in return for such

work, were afforded outdoor relief in money and kind. Under this system, the

·administration was periodically subjected                                                                                                                                            to great pressure                                                                                 so much  so that the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

aid of the police had not infrequently to be invoked to restrain disorder and afford

-necessary protection to officers and property. Police protection was even at times

required for the Guardians during their administration of relief.'

In such circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that the Guardians should

have earnestly endeavoured to reform ' a system which was felt to be fostering

pauperism and encouraging idleness, improvidence, and imposture, while the

widows, and the aged and infirm were only relieved out of the workhouse on

conditions strictly applicable to their individual cases. The latter class were not
so relievedunless it was proved that they had been thrifty and had no children or
other relatives legally or morally liable to support them and able to do so, and

even they ceased to be a charge on the rates after the establishment of the Tower
Hamlets Pension Fund, which was formed for the express purpose of savin" the

really deserving poor from the Poor Law. The result has been that outdoor

relief has gradually ceased to exist in Whitechapel, and that no cases, other than

those of sudden or tirgent necessity relieved by the relieving officer in kind, have

been added_ to the Outdoor Relief lists for more than twenty years. Notwith-

standing this, tlie number of indoor paupers has not increased. Inquiry was made

into every case in which outdoor relief was withdrawn during the two years
ended Lady Day 1875, from able-bodied widows and deserted women, the most

helpless of all classes, with the result that out of 1G7 cases, comprising 600 in-

mdividuals, 77 were found to be doing as well as or better than when                                                                       receipt

of outdoor relief without further assistance, 52 were obtaining an independent

living after having received assistance from charitable agencies or other sources, 10
had been admitted to the workhouse, 18 had apparently left the district, two had

died, and eight only, owing to vicious habits or tlie refusal of the assistance offered,
were believed to be not doing well. It will thus be seen that of the 1C7 cases no less
than 129 had been taken from the ranks of pauperism, with the best results to them-

selves, to say nothing of the ratepayers, and with moral results to the community

at large which cannot be described in detail here, but which must be obvious.
Mr. Loch, the Secretary of the Charity Organisation Society, in his work ' Old-

age Pensions and Pauperism," has given details showing what the results have

been of a similar Poor Law policy in two other poor Metropolitan Unions, Stepney

and St._ George's-in-the-East, thelatter, taken as a whole, being the poorest of all

the Unions in London, and comparing them with the Unions of the Strand and

Bethnal Green. He has also shown the results of careful administration in Unions

the very opposite to the London districts abovementioned, namely, the rural

Unions of Brixworth in Northamptonshire and Bradfield in Berkshire, as compared

with the two similar Unions of Linton in Cambridgeshire and Midhurst in Sussex.
The facts brought out by these two sets of comparisons are striking and conclusive.

In Unions in which there has been a careful administration of the Poor liaw for a

period, more or less, of twenty years, it has been proved that the proportion of

paupers over sixty to population can iDe reduced in the country to about four per

cent., and in London, judging by its poorest Union, by more than half the present

number. Can it be doubted that in these cases the bugbear of old-age pauperism

has already been faced and in a great measure dispelled, and is there any reason,

beyond the force of habit and a vis mertice which surely might be grappled with,

why both town and country Guardians should not follow the example set them by

the pioneers of this movement, and by a common effort subdue the common

enemy ? Let us not, with the experience we liave to guide us, be led astray in

this matter, though some of our philanthropists and political economists seem

mclined to countenance a large increase of public expenditure in connection with

the relief of the poor. Among the many nostrums for the cure of the disease

under which the State is supposed to labour is a proposal by Mr. Bartley, M.P.,

embodied in the ' Old-age Provident Pension Bill ' which lie brought in during

the last session of Parliament. Mr. Bartley proposes that every person (man or

woman) of sixty-five, who is not a criminal or drunkard, and who is unable to

earn the wages of his calling, shall be entitled to a pension of 7s. per week from

the local authorit}', which is to be the County Council, provided that he has never

received poor-law relief. If he has purchased an annuity from the Post Office or

some friendly society, or paid a lump sum for the purchase of a deferred annuity

Irom the Post Office, or is prepared to pay a lump sum of not less than 10/. to the

local authority, or has partially provided for himself in other ways, to the satisfac-

tion of the local authority, he is to be entitled to a pension of Ss. Gd. per week,

with the addition of an extra amount according to the payments which he has

made. And, further, there are to be pensions, if the local authority should see tit,

of 3s. Gd. per week even for the persons declared ineligible, provided that they can

show unavoidable illness or misfortune. The necessary funds are to be raised by

a special rate to be called the 'Pension Rate.' I need not do more than call

attention to these provisions to show how disastrous such a law would be. Tlie

burden which would be imposed on the County Councils of deciding upon the

merits     or demerits  of  each  case                        the  wide  discretion  allowed  in  the  award  of
                                                           ;

pensions, even to the criminal and drunkard, if only what can be construed into

' unavoidable misfortune ' can be proved ; and tlie danger that absolutely dillerent

--constructions of the law would prevail in dili'erent localities all combine to make

it next to impossible but that its operations should be fatal to the exercise of

thrift, and should bring back in redoubled force many of the evils of extensive out-
door relief, with greatly increased burdens on the ratepayer. Among the political
economists I regret to say that an eminent professor, and, what is more (I speak

with bated breath), a former President of this Section, has thrown his great weight

into the scale of wide, if not lavish, distribution of outdoor relief. I am not

quite sure that I understand Professor Marshall's position, but he propounds in the

' Economic Journal ' sixteen questions which he thinks should be considered before
any large scheme is undertaken for the relief of the aged, and which seem
incidentally to show his antagonism to most of what I had thought to be the
generally accepted maxims of poor-relief.

     But let it not be supposed that advocates of a firm and careful administration

of the Poor Law consider it the only thing required to prevent or deal with all

cases of old-age pauperism. In the best-regulated Unions, especially in towns,

-- --there will always be cases too many, ahts ! of highly deserving old people who

are unable to maintain themselves, and of whom no just person could bear to think

as condemned to outdoor relief, and still less to incarceration in a workhouse. These
are precisely the cases which are best brought out where outdoor relief has either

--been entirely abolished or is quite the exception. For these and experience in
--well-managed Unions has shown how comparatively few they are there surely

remains the exercise of a well-ordained charity which will step in and prevent a

consummation so much to be deprecated. Children and other relatives, who under

a loose system of poor-relief are too apt to consider that in one shape or other their

parents and aged kinsfolk may naturally be left to the tender mercies of the Poor
Law, are brought together and induced to contribute to their support ; and pension
societies, such as the Tower Hamlets Pension Committee, the Local Pension

Committees of the Charity Organisation Society, and the like, are willing and

anxious to come to the rescue. Nor is this organised assistance to those whom the

late Duke of Albany called ' the aristocracy of the poor ' of use to the recipients

only. In hundreds of cases which have come under my own knowledge in East
London, for instance, it has been the means of inspiring in men and women a holy

zeal for charity which, without any hateful feeling of patronage on the one side, or

of cringing dependence on the other, gives a scope, such as none other can supply, for
a true friendship between rich and poor and blesses both the giver and the receiver.

I have endeavoured to show, in these few and necessarily brief remarks about one

of the great social questions which occupy men's minds to-day, that for the

promotion of the best interests of our aged poor there may be a 'more excellent
way ' than a vast organisation of State-aided pensions. May we work out

this and other similar problems, as Englishmen do, calmly, wisely, and to good

effect

     But, turning to our immediate duty as members of this Section, let us en-
deavour to ascertain what we can do to inculcate and foster sound views on these
and similar subjects. In the proceedings of this British Association for the

Advancement of Science we may see how intimately the work of Section F is

related to that of the Sections in which the pliysical and mechanical sciences are

studied. The extraordinary advances which have of late years been made in

the application of science to industry have materially added to the wealth of

the working-classes, and that wealth is more easily earned than in the past. But

their knowledge of the great economic laws upon which true progress must

depend lias not kept pace ·s^itli their increased resources ; nor can this be the case

until they are able to grasp the principles of our subject. It may fairly be urged

that the advance in physical science is drawing its relitions to economic science

closer day by day. May we not be about to witness some of the enormous develop-

ments caused by the substitution of machinery for hand-labour which we have for

some time past been led to expect ? The rapid exhaustion of coalfields, to which

Sir Robert Ball has recently again called attention, is leading to the utilisation of

Gpower from other sources, a question with which the President of Section will

Wedoubtless deal.  are told that the falls of Niagara develop a force of 4^

million horse-power, or the equivalent of all the steam-power used in the world,

and that steps have been taken for the immediate utilisation from this source of

100,000 horse-power, or the equivalent of one forty-fifth part of the steam-power

of the globe. Advances such as these in the utilisation and transmission of

energy must, by extending the means of production, profoundly affect the wage-

earning capacity of the workman, and consequently the general relations between

employers and emploj'ed ; and it is the privilege of members of this Section to
prepare their countrymen for the altered condition under which they may be

called upon to live and work. They must never be weary in setting before all

sections of the community the necessity of being ready to fiice such momentous

changes as those which I have indicated, and, if I may be permitted to borrow

an illustration from electrical science, I would say that their duty is analogous

to that of the 'transformers,' of which so much has lately been heard. They

deal less with euergy itself than with its control, but their function is so to change

forces of tin wonted ' potential ' that those forces may cease to be dangerous and

disruptive, and may be made to weld the various efforts of humanity into coherence

and strength.

In 189 dwellings resided 9o4 persons, of whom 114 were under five years of age.

The density of population was 240 per acre, as against 64, the city average. The

death-rate "has crept up to an average of over 50 per 1,000 for the past four years,

as against a city average of only 18 per 1,000. The buildings (two-story brick) in
this area were mostly erected before 1830, were very deficient in ventilation, and
had become so unsanitary as to be condemned by the medical officer of health.
Over ninety of them were back-to-back houses. The Corporation will clear the whole

tract, and erect a five- or six-story apartment house thereon, similar to the Jersey

Street dwelhngs in Manchester. These dwellings were constructed in 1891-0:2

by a private company. The building is 17G feet long, 48 feet deep, and six stories

high ; is fireproof, and provided front and rear with balconies for providing access
Ato the 149 apartments. Excellent ventilation is secured.

--the worst features of slum life is impossible. The conduct of the tenants is suf-

ficiently under the guidance of the superintendent to insure health and happiness to
a considerable degree. Certain voluntary societies organised among the tenants, it

is hoped, will have a further influence for good among them.
     Whenever, therefore, a slum gets so unhealthy that it can be condemned as

imhealthy, the way is open to forcible interference by the municipalit)'. If such

buildings can be made to pay, they will of course multiply through private enter-
prise, and a demand for sanitary dwellings may perhaps be cultivated among the

denizens of the slums.

           5. Parliamentarij Heturns on Social and Economic Subjects.

                                    By C. S. Locn, B.A.

     Figures are used every day as ' decisive and conclusive arguments,' as means of
agitation, or as means of instruction. AVe have to deal especially with figures as
they are drawn up in parliamentarj' returns. One out of many instances of the

--misuse is quoted. In ' Facts for Londoners ' the Fabian Society publish, by way of

agitation, such statements as the following : ' In London one person in every five
will die in the workhouse, hospital, or lunatic asylum. In 1887, out of 82,545
deaths in London, 45,507 being over twenty, 9,399 were in workhouses, 7,201 in
hospitals, and 400 in lunatic asylums ; or, altogether, 17,000 in public institutions.'
' One in every three London adults will be driven into these refuges to die.' ' One
in eleven of the whole metropolitan population is driven to accept Poor-law relief
during any one year.' 'In spite of all, twenty-nine deaths were referred in 1888
to direct and obvious starvation.'

      Deaths in Public Institutioiis.--' Workhouse,' in the Registrar-General's returns,
includes Poor-law infirmaries and the district hospitals of the Metropolitan
Asvlums Board for infectious diseases. Without explanation the reader would not
understand this. The evidence taken by the Select Committee on Hospitals shows
that the poor are not driven to these institutions to die, but go only too readily.
Nor are people driven to die in lunatic asylums, which, like the district hospitals,
are provided for the general benefit of the community. Figures show how, since

1867, when the Metropolitan Poor Act was passed, there have been very many

fewer deaths in workhouses, and a larger proportion in the Poor-law infirmaries

and hospitals and asylums of the board. And ' hospital' in the Kegistrar-General's

return includes such dift'erent institutions as the Herbert Military Hospital and a

--cancer hospital, i^'c. institutions not to be ' put under one hat.' Artisans who earn

good wages are rightly in long illness in-patients at these hospitals, and they con-

tribute to them, as the Hospital Saturday Fund lists show. Besides, many hospital
cases are accidents. The argument of ' the facts' comes to this, that the better our
medical provision, the worse our social state. The figures, too, are incorrect.
London institutions outside the metropolitan division are not included. Nor is
allowance made for non-Londoners dying in London institutions. Lastly, the
return is misapplied. The object of it was to show what allowance was to be made
                   --

                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                                                                 837

for deaths in institutions in census returns ; and wbetlier, comparing year witk

--year and hospital with hospital, hospital mortality could be prevented or reduced.
      The ' Starvatio7i' Returns. 'Twenty-nine cases were referred in 1888 to direct

and obvious starvation.' The figures for 1888 were the smallest then on record.
This is not noted. It is a common error to take one year's returns only and to ignore

the historical context of a return. Further, cases, as entries in the returns show,

are not due ' to direct and obvious starvation,' but to many other causes besides.

--The correctness of the verdict, too, is sometimes very doubtful, as instances show.
     The Poor-law Eeturns. -'One in eleven of the whole metropolitan population

is driven to accept Poor-law relief.' This includes admission to Poor-law

infirmaries, lunatic asylums, and the idiot and imbecile asylums of the Metropolitan

Asylums Board, and so on. So that the statement, as it stands, is quite misleading.

Besides, probably 2, and not 3i, is the multiplier to obtain, from the number of
paupers in a day, their number in a year. The multiplication by 3|^, a moot point,
ifi known to be very doubtful.

Conclusions : that returns should not be used without reference to their

historical and social context, and should be analysed before use so that the reality

of their definitions may be tested, and differences as well as similarities in the units

on which they are based clearly shown.

   --The Compilation of Returns. The need of more care in the compilation of

returns is shown by reference to Mr. Burt's return of aged paupers, the recent return

{May 1892) on the same point, and the yearly and day census of pauperism, Lord
Lymington's return on the number of members of friendly societies who are paupers,

and the return of the Charity Commissioners on the application of charitable funds

to elementary education. It is suggested that when, on general grounds, it has

been decided to compile a return, the form of it might be settled by a select com-

mittee after talring expert evidence ; that if the information desired cannot be

supplied, as evidence might show, in the form of a return, the proposed return

might be abandoned ; that some kind of preface might be affixed to a return,

showing  (I)  the  method  on  which  it was  compiled                                      giving  (2)  explanatory  matter,
                                                                                         ;

as, e.g., supplied by the Local Government Board in their Appendix E; and (3)

references to previous returns of a similar nature ; also (4) short accounts of the

Aofiicial proceedings in certain returns, e.g., the ' starvation ' returns.                              complete

catalogue and subject index might be compiled of papers in some departments of

social work by such a society as the Statistical Society.

   --Limitation of the Returns System. Many returns at every point touch the

domain of character. It is a question whether we do not err in classifying, e.g., by
wages, &c. (cf. the classes A, B, C, &c., of Mr. C. Booth's tables) ; and whether we

would not get truer results by analysing or counting by types. Social science can

show few results of long-continued impartial investigation such as in natural

science can frequently be found.

    6. The Relation of Ethics to Economics. By J. S. Mackenzie, M.A.

      Political economy, being a practical science, falls entirely within the sphere in
which ethical considerations apply, and it is consequently affected by ethics at

every point ; but the chief points of contact may be conveniently summed up

under four headings :

   --I. The Place of Ecojiomics in Social Science. Political economy has had an

exaggerated prominence, which, from an ethical point of view, cannot be justified.
This prominence is partly due to the recent development of industrial life, and
partly to the fact that economic study lends itself more readily to abstract treat-

ment than the other aspects of social life. An effort must be made to correct this

one-sidedness, and to treat economic questions in subordination to questions of
social well-being in the larger sense.

   --II. Eco7iomic Methods. There are, broadly speaking, three different methods

--of economic study : (1) The historical method, considering what is and has been.

(2) The analytic method, investigating what tends to be. (3) The moral method,
«ndeavouring to discover what ought to be. Without disparaging the two former
838 EEroRT-- 1892.

methods witliin their own limits, we must insist on the subordination of the study
of what is, and what tends to be, to the study of what ought to be. And at least

--the three studies must be carefully distinguished.
     III. The Divisions of Economics. Regarding production, distribution, and con-

sumption as the chief departments of economic science, we have to notice a ten-
dency to give undue prominence to production. From an ethical point of view,
we must insist on the importance of distribution and consumption. Also produc-

tion must be studied, not merely with reference to the thing produced, but also to

the person producing. With regard to consumption, we have to consider the

effects of difierent kinds of consumption : (1) on the well-being of the consumer;
(2) on that of the producer. The importance of this side of economic study has
been partly obscured by the Utilitarian theory. The theory of value has been
somewhat obscured in the same way. Objective values must be studied as well

--as subjective.
     IV. Applied Economics. Political economy is an art as well as a science, and
it is chietiy in its aspect as an art that it is aflected by ethical considerations. In

applying economics to the guidance of conduct, it is necessary to consider the

question of justice. On this subject recent ethical thought has thrown an im-

portant light by the introduction of the conception of the organic unity of society.

The conception of justice thus reached may be opposed to the conceptions of
abstract freedom and abstract equality. The chief thing to be insisted on, from
this point of view, is that everyone must be treated both as means and as end.

--"VVe arrive in this way at two great commandments: (1) Thou shalt not exploit.

(2) Thou shalt not pauperise. The application of these principles in detail is by
no means easy. It iti n problem that will require the same strenuous application
as that which has already been devoted to questions of production and exchange.

--The following Papers were read :

           1. Old-age Fensions. By Rev. W. IMOORE Ede, M.A.

Pending promised information by Local Government Board, Mr. C. Booth's

reduced estimate is that 25 9 of population over sixty-hve apply for relief each

Ayear, and yO ppr cent, who reach sixty-live are paupers before they die.  large

amount of suffering of the aged not included in these figures

The Poor-law refuses all help to those not absolutely destitute. The unskilled

labourer cannot save enough to support himself entirely, so bad policy to save

anything.

The reform needed is such a change of method as will render it possible for

everyone to make provision for old age if he will.

Insurance presents many practical difliculties, of which irregularity of employ-

ment and cost of working are chief, and would not touch the poorest,

Mr. Chamberlain's scheme is right in suggesting that cost of pension should be

borne to extent of one-half by taxfition.

Endowment, as .suggested by Mr. C. Booth, would be too costly, as to give

everyone over sixty-five r)S. a week would require raising 10,000,000/. extra taxation.

Everj-one does not require such help. To give three who can do without it a

pension in order to secure that the fourth shall have it on sound principles may be

logical, but is not practical.

The readers suggestion is to combine the principle of Mr. Chamberlain's scheme

to the extent of throwing half the burden on taxation with Mr. Booth's endow-

ment proposal, and give 2«. Qd. a week to everyone over sixty-five whose income is
less than, say, CO/, per annum. Every man would be left free as to how he found

his half of the pension. Those who could do nothing for themselves would be

 2. The Poor-law : can it he Maintained ? By Rev. T. W. Fowle, M.A.

     The Poor-law of 18.34 is on its trial, serious humanitarian, political, moral,
and economic difficulties arising out of it. It was a sharp remedy for evils now
passed awav. Impossibility of jilterinir it upon less stringent lines without destroy-
ing the scientific basis upon which it stands, and to which it owes its \alue.
Hence need and opportunity for a new system. Analogy of educational system
and of uncommon English methods.

making them responsible with State subvention for the relief of all disabled

    4. The Better PTousinfj of the Wage-earning Classes in Eural Districts.

                          By Rev. J. 0. Bevan, M.A., F.G.S.

     After a review of the past the writer enlarges upon the tendency of the evils
of insanitary dwellings to become permanent, and enforces the necessity of taking

instant and active steps to abate such evils. He touches upon certain requisites in
the location and building of a house on right principles, and shows how many of

these requisites are persistently lacking in ordinary dwellings for the labourers in

rural districts, whose health is aflected, whose morals are vitiated, and whose wage-
earning capacity is lessened in consequence of the state of things universally prevalent.

He calculates that six-and-a-half to seven millions of pounds are lost to the labouring

and artisan class year by year in England in wages by reason of sickness. Further-
more, he considers the matter in respect of the migration to the towns, which has

assumed considerable proportions of late years. He goes on to point out what
may be done by voluntary means and educational effort on the part of landlords,

medical officers, and clergymen, and proceeds to touch upon the efforts recently
made by the Legislature to bring the force of law to bear in such wise as to effect a
useful and healthful reformation, to inaugurate a new period, and to mark a new
advance alike in national comfort, happiness, and prosperity.

The following Papers were read :

                                        1. Adam Smith and his Belations to recent Economics.

                                                                B^j L. L. Price, M.A.

                                                                                                                                                                             .

There are difficulties in discussing the writings of Adam Smith, and it is not

easy to say anything new. Some rumours have been recently current of charges

of plagiarism, but these require special knowledge, if they are to be treated satis-

factorily, and are easier to advance than refute. It is more agreeable to indicate

some of the qualities which seem to have given the ' "Wealth of Nations ' its unique

place in economic literature. First among these should be ranked its literary

merits, and these are largely due to the strong motive by which the book is in-

spired. Adam Smith felt a passion for freedom, which has been ascribed to the

circumstances of his age, and considered by some critics to be now out of date. But

the argument for liberty has a perpetual application. Adam Smith appeals to the

layman as well as the economic expert, and the qualities which attract the one might

have been supposed to deter the otlier. But by writers of almost every school in

England he has been regarded as the parent of modern economics. In the genera-

tion after him Malthus and Ricardo, differing on method, agreed in ownino- his

teaching. At a later time representatives of the historical school, like Cliffe Leslie,

Lave highly esteemed him, and considered him an employer of the inductive

method                                  and  Professor  Marshall has                                                                        traced  back  to  him  the  beginnings  of the
                                     ;

theory of measurable motives, and regarded him as largely deductive. Nor is it

merely the central theory of value which may be found in germ in the ' Wealth of

                                        but it is surprising to find how close
AdamNations                                                                                                                                                   Smith is to the latest results
                                      ';
--of inquiry on the laws governing the distribution of wealth on wages, on profits,

and even on rent. His exposition of free trade has been subjected to much able

criticism on various grounds, but he seized hold of the most important and endur-

ing arguments. His insistance on the true character and real functions of money is

a touchstone to which there are few protectionist arguments that can be brought

without destructive results to their validity.

2. The Effects of Consumption of Wealth on Distrihution. By William

     Smart, M.A., Lecturer on Political Economy in Queen Margaret College,

      Glasgow.

The most pressing question of economics is that of distribution. Its most

hopeful solution seems to be in the direction of distribution according to product,

as likely to give an equal rational basis for all kinds of income. Our recognition

of the current want of proportion between income and wealth produced is due

mostly to                               Socialist theory                                                                           but  as  this  founds it on a superficial  theory of value,
                                                                                                                                ;

we have to find another basis for its quite just conclusions. The first problem
Howstated.
                                        is the contribution of each factor to product to be measured, consider-

ing that what has to be distributed is not product but value of product P But

another problem concerns, not the sharing, but the total value to be shared:--

1. Value is not in the producers hand; while production is going on value is

changing. Is it desirable that the wage earner should follow the change ? 2. In

virtue of the progress of invention and organisation the kst comer sets the pace for

his trade, reduces prices, and yet maintains wage. If reduced prices sweep away

the remuneration of those whose capital is fixed, how can the worker continue to

be paid the former wage ?

     These difficulties suggest, however, that distribution is not altogether dependent
on income received, but on the uses to which incomes are put. Consumption of
wealth, theoretically in our hands, practically is dictated by the merchant; the
importance of this as regards the disposition of social wealth ; the true meaning of

various are the eHects on social possibilities; the place of services in consumption.

non -consuming; (3) as to wise consumption.

             3. On Coprjright and Patents. By Robekt A. Macfie.

     in the first the writer contends for some valuation by a competent responsible
board or referees of the work to be privileged, and a regulation of the remunera-
tion receivable therefrom in the interests of the public, inter alia favouring the

royalty sj'stem of rewarding authors. He is of opinion that the working classes

are wronged, and public interests injuriously atlected, by the forty-two years of
absolute monopoly assured under the present law.

     As to the second, patents for inventions, the writer contrasts the present with

the originally prevalent ideas on the subject of inventions and the remuneration of
first inventors. Pie would have the value of novelties estimated, and exclusive
privileges granted with more circumspection and with due regard to the necessity
of using the inventions of different minds in combination, and to the inconsistency
of nakedly exposing British manufacturers to only superficially equal competition
with their rivals abroad, even the exactions of patentees forming a burden which

acts as a favour to foreigners who carry on their business in places such as Holland,

where there are no burdens of the kind to be borne.

1. The Continuance of the Supply of Wheat from the United States tvith

   Profit to the Western Fanners. By Edwakd Atkinson, Ph.D., LL.D.

In 1870 and 1873 the price of wheat in Mark Lane averaged a fraction above

64s. per quarter.

     Such have been the reductions in the cost of producing wheat in the Western
States, 1,200 to 1,500 miles from the seaboard, that the farmer now derives as good

a return for his capital and labour at 32s. per quarter, or less, as he did in the

former period at 64s.
     The application of the self-binder to the reaper in 1 876 removed the only sub-

stantial limit to the production of wheat in the United States except the price, as

the area now occupied in its production is only 2 per cent, of the area of the

country, omitting Alaska.

     The Western farmers of the United States have thriven in the face of declining
prices and advancing wages; they are not heavily burdened with mortgages, and

are creditors rather than debtors.
     Official proofs cited in the relation to six typical States, proving that while

more than half t lie farms are free from mortgage, the total incumbrance is less than

25 per cent, on the assessed value of all farms.

The purpose of these investigations   is  their   bearing  upon  the silver question
                                                                                                                                                         ;

this matter is elucidated and the present aspect of that question is stated.

£5. Ler/islation in Am3rica and ElseivJtere on Itehalf of Destitute and Neglected
                             Childnn. Bij RosA M. Bakratt.

The object of this paper is to show what rrreat advances almost every country,

except England, has made in recent years with regard to legislation on behalf of

neglected children.

The Chamber of Deputies in France has under consideration very wide-reaching

proposals on this subject, of which a part became law in July 1889. Under this

law certain associations, or rassistrmce publique, or private individuals may be

appointed guardians of children under sixteen years of age (n) if the parents from

destitution  or  other  causes voluntarily give them up                                                                                                                                                    (6) of those children whose
                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

parents are legally deprived of their control through being criminals or habitual

drunkards.

As to America. The laws of Michigan as they concern neglected children have

been so successful that they have been copied, with but slight diflerences in detail,

by the States of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ehode Island. By these laws any ill-
treated child under the age of sixteen may be removed from its parents and placed
under the protection of public authority. New York, Massachusetts, Maryland,

Connecticut, Indiana, California, Colorado, Illinois, and Ontario partially, have also

most  stringent  laws   as to neglected children                                                                                          in  most cases the Governments give
                                                                                                                                       ;

grants in aid of efl'orts to rescue them.

In Italy and Germany also great efforts are now being made to consolidate

charitable efforts on behalf of the poor, and to give increased authority and power

and State aid to such workers.

Voluntary charitable elforts in order effectually to check the increase of pauper-

ism and crime must have Government aid and protection.

  4. A Flea for the Study of Railway Economics. By W. M. Acworth.

     Railway economics is a recognised subject of instruction with a large literature

of its own (see 'Economic Journal' for June for list) in other countries. Here
the study is non-existent. And yet railways deserve study, both from their pre-

eminent financial importance, from the fact that the transportation industry lies at
the base of all other industries, and from the extreme difficulty of the problems
involved. The position of English railway statistics is at present simply dis-
creditable, and, in the absence of information, the subject has become a happy
hunting-ground for the crotchet-monger, and England, which invented railways,
has dropped out of sight among the railway experts of the world ; is, for instance,

practically ignored at the International Kailway Congress now meeting at St.

Petersburg. Three subjects of immediate practical importance are suggested as

requiring special study :
     1. Tiae reduction of passenger fares begun in Hungary, extended to Austria,

Holland, France, and expected in Germany ere long. How far does this afford a

precedent for England P Reasons are suggested for thinking that Ireland might
with great advantage copy the Hungarian example, while in Great Britain such a

course is out of the question.

     2. The question of goods rates is commonly understood to have been finally

settled la&t session ; but there is reason to believe, on the contrary, that it is only
just beginning. There is great need for the guidance of trained economists with

no personal interest to serve.

     3. The construction of new railways, which ai-e urgently needed, has been
practically put a stop to by the extravagant standard of construction and working
demanded by English public opinion. On the other hand, cheap railways are
making very rapid progress in Holland, Belgium, Italy, and elsewhere, and accord-
ing to the testimony of the Prussian Minister of Commerce, given on moving the
third reading of a Light Railway Bill for Prussia, they have proved of inestimable
value to those countries. Is it not possible that we in this country had better

have inferior railways in remote districts rather than none at all ?

     II. Registration districts of the county classified according to percentage of

--illegitimacy for period 1868-91 (inclusive). One district Seafield, 7 per cent.

is below the average for Scotland ; all the other twenty-three districts are above.
Highest, Kirkmichael with 2-1 per cent. Seven of the eight lowest districts are

seaboard parishes with a fishing population. The twelve districts with the highest

percentages are all purely rural.

percentage of illegitimacy in Scotland, Banffshire, Seafield, Marnoch, and New
Byth. New Byth is believed to have the highest percentage in the three kingdoms.

It reached 42 per cent, in 1889 (36 legitimate births, 26 illegitimate).

pulsory powers to county councils. Table showing illegitimacy was much less
in the early part of this century, prior to the system of joining farm to farm and

demolishing cottages.

             2. Taxation of Building Land. Bg Maek Davidson,

     The subject of the paper is taxation of building land. It deals with three pro-

posals: (1) the taxation of ground-rents, (2) assessment of unoccupied land
capable of yielding ground-rent, and (3) acquisition by the couununity of the

unearned increment of land. The chief question of economic interest concerning-

the first is whether, according to the present system of rating, ground-rents are
taxed for local purposes or not, for no problem is to be met with in regard to the

levying or incidence of such an impost. The question is one of assessment, and,
according to the method of as.^essment adopted, rent of ground already pays rates
equally with rent of houses. To tax it additionally would be to alter the principle
on which rating proceeds, and would tax lands of identical values at difforcnt rates.
844 BEPORT-- 1892.

On the other hand, the second proposal is in keeping with the system of local

rating adopted, for vacant land, being excepted from rating, is treated diH'erently
from other real property. The third proposal is the most complex ; because it is
not a matter of taxation, but of the acquisition of property, and the difficulty of
the problem consists in the fact that it is desired to appropriate real property
without assuming the right to administer it. The unearned increment is an
additional value given to land by a certain increase in the demand for it ; and the
increased demand is caused by certain pecuniary advantages which settlement on
the land conveys. In so far, therefore, as the community which causes the demand
acquires the unearned increment accruing therefrom, the consequence will be that
that community will acquire the advantage over others which formerly augmented
the rental paid. The actual economic result, however, is probably indeterminate.
In conclusion, the author discusses the possible method whereby the unearned
increment could in practice be absorbed by the community.

                         4. T/te Methods of Industrial Uemuneration}

                        By David F.'Schloss, M.A., S.C.L.

    An employee engaged on time-wage sells to his employer the labour performed

·within a given period, irrespective of the amount of this labour; if on task-wage,
he sells the labour performed within a given period, undertaking to produce within
that period a specified output ; if on piece-ifacje, he sells a specified amount of
labour (the amount necessary for the production of a specified output), irrespective
of the period within which this labour is performed. [Note that all forms of the
wage-system, whether express and primary reference be made to a time-basis or a
result-basis, are alike in effect based on a more or less definite standard of remu-
neration, i.e., a fixed ratio between time, output, and pay, the price per unit of
exertion tending to be the same, under whichever method the operative be
employed.] There is also the special method of proffressive war/es, under which

the employee, if his labour exhibits a specified degree of efHciency, obtains in

addition to his fixed or minimum time-wage or piece-wage & premium.
     Wages, if paid in respect of the labour performed by a man working ' single-

handed ' are individual wat/es ; if paid in respect of the joint labour of a group,
collective xvages. In addition to collective tn.sk-wage, collective jiiece-ioage, and

collective jirogressive wages we find the method of contract loork, under which
the lump sum paid as the price of the work done by the group is apportioned by,

first, deducting the time-wages of its subordinate members, and then paying to the
leading member or members out of the balance a piece-work remuneration varying

in amount inversely with the sum of these time-wages, and directlv with the speed
maintained by the group ; and the method of co-operative work, distinguished
from all other forms of collective wages by the fact that the price of the work is

     Payment by results, whether piece-wage or progressive wages, applied to the

remuneration of the foreman or leader of a group sometimes induces a severity of

supervision objected to by the working-classes, who stigmatise as ' the siveating

employed under a time-wage foreman, are employed under a foreman or other
superintendent paid by results, or work under a ' sub-contractor,' i.e., a subordinate
employer.

5. The Criminal and the Habitual Offender from, an Economic, Statistical,

       and Social Standpoint. By J. F. Sutherland, M.D. (Edi-.i.)

The author sets forth in extenso, for the first time so far as he is aware, an

analysis of the criminal returns, with the object of proving how, under a system of

procedure which should have been condemned long ago as antiquated and hurtful,

--a large and increasing number of offenders (habitual) for the most part idlers and
--drunkards thrive iu an industi'ious community, and not only so, but the ineffec-

tual attempts to reform the individual, ainl to make him or her tiolens ant volena

a contributor to the national wealth and prosperity, are made at enormous cost

from funds provided by the industrious members of societj%
    The annual bill which the nation pays without murmur for the repression of

crime falls little short of 8,000,000^., and the results so far as the * habitual ' is

concerned are simply nil. Nay, more, it can be demonstrated that there is every

encouragement to continue idle and debauched.

It will be observed that the number of apprehensions. Sec, by the police in tlie

United Kingdom and Ireland for otfeuces against the laws which society from time

to time has framed for its protection number over a million (1,148,190), or 1 to

33 of the population ; England contributing 755,740, or 1 to 39 of the population ;

Scotland 151,480, or  1  to 2G of the  population                                                     and  Ireland  240,970,  or  1 to                                   19.

This is a black record, but in truth tilings are not so bad as they look. These

enormous totals, be it understood, do not represent so many units of the population

who have by choice or by force of circumstances gone under in the struggle. Far

from it. What investigation shows is this, that under the system one individual

or unit is responsible for as many as five, ten, ticenty, forty, andfifty apprehensions

iu the course of a single year. These are the non-producing units whom the

Avriter desires to see deprived of the liberties and opportunities which permit them,

without let or hindrance, not merely to otl'end against a code of decency and

morality, but to live lives of idleness at the expense of the industrious taxpayer.

After the million and odd have been examined and sifted they dwindle dowr»

to less than a fourth of their original proportions, and these 255,314 have to be

looked for and found within the prisons of the country: 137,000 persons are

responsible for the 255,314 commitments to prison. Of these the really worthless

and idle are few. They are made up of 12,380 felons, &c., and 10,100 habitual

(petty) oft'enders.

     In the community there are four well-defined specimens of the hostes humani
qeneris. First, the genuine criminal or felon who is only responsible for 2 per cent,

of the entire apprehensions, and 36,650 of the same (jenus at large ; second, th&

' casual ' offender, 100,000 or thereby in number.                                                    As   a rule,  the  ' casual                                    is  an

industrious and productive member of the commonwealth, but occasionally com-

mits follies which bring him or her within the grasp of the law. Third, the

'habituals,' 10,100 in number, Scotland's share being 1,500. These neither toil

nor spin, have no settled abode, live among the worst environments, sanitary and

otherwise. This is the class fully matured for seclusion from society, upon whose

resources they are a constant and heavy drain.

     The writer puts forward the followinpr remedial proposals :
     1. In the first group, the Felon, &c., tlie author has no specific to recommend.
Compulsory national education, sanitary reform, elevating influences, prison reform,
and reform of criminal procedure have done much for this class.
     The figures having reference to the petty offenders present disquieting elements.

For years there has been such a steady increase as to suggest the inquiry now

made.
     2. The ' Casuals.'
     3. The 'Ilabituals.' After six convictions for the offences specified within

twelve months or less period, or twenty extending over any period, the 'repeater'
should he declared an ' habitual,' and should be removed from society for an
indefinite period, and placed in a retreat.

    Among the 'Habituals' there are three pronounced types requiring diSerentiation

in treatment.

     For the worst class, made up of the refractory and incorrigible, there is ample
room in some of the all but unutilised poor-houses up and down the country, or
in a prison or part of a prison set aside for the purpose. In twenty workhouses,
with accommodation for 3,340 inmates, only 803, or 26 per cent., can be found to
occupy places, and in other three, with 1,186 places, 568, or 48 per cent.

By what process selection is made of a Sectional President of the British Associa-
tion is 10 me unknown. I may confess that it was pleasant to receive the request

of the Council to preside at the meetings of Section G, even though much of the
pleasure was due to its unexpectedness. I ventured to believe I might accept
the honour gratefully, trusting to your kindness to assist me in fulMlling its
obligations. Amongst engineers there are many with greater claims than I have
to such a position, and who could speak to you from a wider practical experience.
Here, in Section CI, I think it may be claimed that the profession of engineering
owes much to some who from circumstances or natural bias have concerned them-

selves more with those scientific studies and experimental researches which are
useful to the engineer than with the actual carrying on of engineering operations.
Here, at so short a distance from the University wdiere Eankine and James

Thomson laboured, I may venture to feel proud of being amongst those whose

business it has been rather to investigate problems than to execute works.

     The year just passed is not one unmemorable in the annals of engineering.

By an elfort remarkable for its rapidity, and as an example of organisation of

labour, the broad gauge system has been extinguished. It has disappeared like

some prehistoric mammoth, a large-limbed organism, perfect for its purpose and

created in a generous mood, but conquered in the struggle for existence bj' smaller

but more active rivals. If we recognise that the great controversy of filty years
ago has at last been decided against Brunei, at least we ought to remember that
the broad gauge system was one only o'i many original experiments, due to his

genius and courage, experiments in every field of engineering, in bridge building,
in locomotive design, in ship construction, the successes and failures of which
have alike enlarged the knowledge of engineers and helped the progress of

engineering.

     The past year has seen the completion of the magnificent scheme of water
supply for Liverpool, from the Vyrnwy, carried out from 1879 to 1885 by
Mr. Hawksley and ^Ir. Deacon, and since then completed under the direction of
the latter engineer. Tliis is one of the largest and most striking of those works of
municipal engineering, rendered necessary by the growth of great city communities,
and made possible by their wealth and public spirit. For the supply of water to
Liverpool the largest artificial lake in Europe has been created in Mid- "Wales by
the construction across a mountain valley of a dam of cyclopeau masonry, itself
one of the most remarkable masonry works in tlie world. The lake contains an
available supply of over 12,000 million gallons, its size having been determined,
not only to supply forty million gallons daily for tlie increasing demand of
Liverpool, but also to meet the necessity imposed by Parliament that an unpre-
848 REPORT-- 1892.

cedentedly large compensation, amounting to ten million gallons daily and fifty

million gallons additional on tbirty-two days yearl^^, should be aHbrded to the

Severn. The masonry dam, though a little less in height than some of the French
dams, is of greater length. It is nearly double the length of the great dam at

Verviers.* Although masonry dams were an old expedient of engineers, it is in

quite recent times, and chietiy in consequence of the scientific investigations of

French engineers, that they have been revived in engineering practice. Since the

construction of the Vyrnwy dam another very large dam, the Tansa dam, has

been completed in Bombay. This dam has a length of two miles and a height of

118 feet, and it is 100 feet thick at the base. The reservoir will supply 100 million
gallons per day. In the United States a still greater work of the same kind has

been commenced on the Croton River in connection with the water supply of New

York. This dam will have a length of 2,000 feet and a height of 285 feet. Its
greatest thickness will be 215 feet. It will be very much the boldest work of its kind.

Eeturning to the Liverpool supply, the water taken from the lake at the most

suitable level into a straining tower provided with very complete hydraulic

machinery passes through the Ilirnant tunnel, and thence by an aqueduct, partly

consisting of rock tunnels, partly of pipes 39 in. to 42 in. in diameter, sixty-eight

miles in length, being the longest aqueduct yet constructed. The crossing of the

Mersey by an aqueduct tunnel has proved the greatest engineering difficulty to be

surmounted. The tunnel has been carried through layers of running sand, gravel,

and silt. At first slow progress was made, but later, by the adoption of the

Greathead system of shield, with air locks and air-compressing machinery, as much

as fifty-seven feet of tunnel were driven and lined in one week. The whole work

is now complete, and Liverpool has available an extra supply of very pure water,

amounting to forty million gallons daily.

   A scheme of water supply for JIanchester from Lake Thirlmere in AVestmore-

land, on an equally large scale, is approaching completion. Birmingham is likely

to carry out another work of the same kind. And London, at a greater distance

from pure water sources and under greater difficulties from the complexity of

existing interests, has come to realise that, within fifty years, a population of

12^ millions will probably have to be provided for. To supply such a population

a volume of water is required ten times as great as the whole available supply from

Lake Vyrnwy.

Here in Edinburgh one remembers that the birthplace of the steam-engine is

Anear at hand.  century and a quarter ago James Watt made an invention

which has profoundly influenced all the conditions of social, national, commercial,

and industrial life. It is due to the steam-engine more than to any other single

cause that the population in this country has tripled since the beginning of the

century, and that we have become dependent on steam-power for fuel, for transport,

for manufactures, in many cases for water supply, for sanitation, and for artificial
light. From some German statistics it appears that there are probably now in the

world, employed in industry, steam-engines ex(irting forty-nine million horse-

power, besides locomotives exertiug six million horse-power. Engines in steam-

ships are not included. The steam-engine has become a potent factor in civilisation,

because it places at our disposal mechanical energy at a sufficiently low cost,

and the efforts of engineers have been steadily directed to diminishing the
cost at which steam-power is produced. Members of one great branch of our

profession are much concerned in the production of mechanical energy at a

sufficiently cheap rate. They require it in very large quantity for transformation
into light and for re-transformation into mechanical energy under conditions more

convenient than the direct use of steam-power. Perhaps it will not be in-

appropriate if, in Section G, I first discuss briefly some of the causes which have

made the steam-engine inefficient, and the extent to which we are getting to a

scientific knowledge of the methods of evading them. I pi-opose, then, to consider

some of the methods of economising the cost and increasing the convenience of

 mechanical power by generating it at central stations and distributing it, and,
lastly, how far means of transporting energy are likely to make available cheaper

sources of energy than steam-power.

      Let us go back for a moment to James Watt. Q'he most distinct feature about

 the invention of the steam-engine is that it arose out of studies of such ques-
 tions as the relation of pressure and temperature of steam, the heat absorbed
in producing it, and its volume at ditferent pressures.

     Armed with this knowledge. Watt was able to determine that the quantity of
steam used in a model atmospheric engine was enormously greater than that "due
to the volume described by the piston. There was waste or loss. To discover the
loss was to get on the path of hnding a remedy. The separate condenser, by
diminishing cylinder condensation, annulled a great part of the loss. So great was
Watt's insight into the action of the engine that he was able to leave it so perfect

that, except in one respect, little remained for succeeding engine builders, e.xcept to
perfect the machines for its manufacture, to improve its details, and to adapt it to

new purposes. Now it very early became clear that there were two directions of

advance which ought to secure greater economy. Simple mechanical indications
showed that increased expansion ought to insure increased economy. Thermodynamic

considerations indicated that higher pressures, involving a greater temperature range

of working, ought to secure greater economy. But in attempting to advance in either
of these directions, engineers were more or less disappointed. Some of Watt's eno-ines

worked with 5 lb. of coal per indicated horse-power per hour. Many engines with

greater pressures and longer expansions have done but little better. The history of
steam-engine improvement for a quarter of a century has been an attempt to secure
the advantages of high pressures and high ratios of expansion. The difficulty to be
overcome ha.s proved to be due to the same cause as the inefficiency of Watt's
model engine. The separate condenser diminished, but it did not annul the action
of the cylinder wall. The first experiments which really startled thoughtful steam
engineers were those made by 5lr. Isherwood between 1860 and 1865. Mr.
Isherwood showed that in engines such as those then in use in the United States
Navy, with the large cylinders and low speeds then prevalent, any expansion of
the steam beyond three times led, not to an increased economy, but to an increased
consumption of steam. Very little later than this M. Hirn undertook, in 1871-5, his

classical researches on the action of the steam in an engine of about 160 indicated
horse-power. Experiments of greater accuracy or completeness, or of greater insight
into the conditions which were important, have never since been made, and Ilirn with

Lis assistants, MM. Hallaner and Dwelshauvers Dery, has determined, once for all,

the whole method of a perfect steam-engine trial. M. Hirn was the first to clearly
realise that the indicator gives the means of determining the steam present in the

cylinder during every period of the cycle of the engine. Consequently, superheating

in ordinary cases being out of the question, we have the means of determining the
heat present and the heat already converted into work. The heat delivered into
the engine is known from boiler measurements, combined with calorimetric tests of
the quality of the steam, tests which Hirn was the first to undertake. The balance

or heat unaccounted for is, tlien, a waste or loss due to causes which have to be
investigated. Hirn originated a complete method of analysis of an engine test,

sliowing at every stage of the operation the heat accounted for and a balance of
heat unaccounted for ; and the latter proved to be a very considerable quantity.

     Meanwhile theoretical writers, especially Rankine and Clausius, had been per-
fecting a thermodynamic theory of the steam-engine, based primarily on the
remarkable and irrefragable principle of Carnot. Tbe result of Ilirn's analj'sis was
to show that these theories, applied to the actual steam-engine, were liable to lead
to errors of 50 or 60 per cent., the single false assumption made being that the
interaction between the walls of the cylinder and the steam was an action small
enough to be negligeable.

     In this country Mr. Mair Ilumley, following Ilirn's method, ma^le a series of
experiments on actual engines with great care and accuracy and completeness. All
these experiments demonstrated the fact of a large initial condensation of steam on
the walls of the cylinder, alike in jacketed and unjacketed engines. This con-

850 REPORT-- 1892.

densed steam is re-evaporated partially during expansion, but mainly during-
 exhaust, and serves as a mere carrier of heat from boiler to condenser, in conditions
not permitting its utilisation in producing work.

      It became clear from Ilirn's experiments, if not from the earlier experiments of
Isherwood, that for each engine there is a particular ratio of expansion for which
the steam expenditure per horse-power is least. Professor Dery has since deduced
 from them that the practical condition of securing the greatest efficiency is that
 the steam at release sliould be nearly dry. In producing that dryness the jacket
Las an important influence. In spite of much controversy amongst practical
 engineers about the use of the jacket, it does not appear that any trustworthy
 experiment has yet been adduced in which there was an actual loss of efficiency
 due to the jacket. In the older type of comparatively slow engines it is a rule
 that the greater the jacket condensation, the greater the economy of steam, even

when the jacket condensation approaches 20 per cent, of all the steam used. It

 appears, however, that as tl;e speed of the engine increases, the influence of the
jacket diminishes, so that for any engine there is a limit of speed at which the
value of the jacket becomes insignificant.

     Among steam-engine experiments directed specifically to determine the action

 of the cylinder walls, those of the late Mr. Willans should be specially mentioned.
Mr. Willans' death is to be deplored as a serious loss to the engineering profession.
His steam-engine experiments, some of them not yet published, are models of what
careful experiments should be. They are graduated experiments designed to indi-
cate the effect of changes in each of the practically variable conditions of working.

They showed a much greater variation of steam consumption (from 46 to 18 lb.
per indicated horse-power hour) in different conditions of working than, I think, most
practical engineers suspected, and this has been made more significant in later experi-
ments, on engines worldng with less than full load. The first series showed that in
full-load trials the compound was superior to the simple engine in practically all
the conditions tried, but that the triple was superior to the compound only when

certain limits of pressure and speed were passed.

     As early as 1878 Prof. CotteriU had shown that the action of a cylinder wall
was essentially equivalent to that of a very thin metallic plate, following the tem-

perature of the steam, the exceedingly rapid dissipation of heat from the surface
during exliaust especially being due to the evaporation of a film of water initially
condensed on its surface. In permanent refjime the heat received in admission
must be equal to that lost after cut off. In certain conditions it appeared that a
tendency would arise to accumulate water on the cylinder surfaces, with the effect
of increasing in certain cases the energy of heat dissipation. Recently Prof. Cot-

teriU has been able to carry much further the analysis of the complex action of

condensation and re-evaporation in the cylinder, and to discriminate in some degree
Ijetween the action of the metal and the more ambiguous action of the water film.
I3y discarding the less important actions, Prof. CotteriU has found it possible

to state a semi-empirical formula for cylinder condensation in certain restricted
cases, which very closely agrees with experiments on a wide variety of engines. It

is to be hoped that, with the data now accumulating, a considerable practical
sdvance may be made in the clearing up of this complex subject. There are, no
doubt, some people who are in the habit of depreciating quantitative investigations

of this kind. They are as wise as if they recommended a manufacturer to carry
on his business without attending to his account books. Further, the attempt to
obtain any clear guidance from experiments on steam-engines has proved a hopeless
failure without help from the most careful scientific analysis. There is not a
fundamental practical question about the thermal action of the steam-engine,
neither the action of jackets or of expansion or of multiple cylinders, as to which
contradictory results liave not been arrived at, by persons attempting to deduce
results from the mass of engine tests without any clear scientific knowledge of the
conditions which have afi'ected particular results. In complex questions funda-
mental principles are essential in disentangling the results. Intt^preted by what
i« alrei'lv known of thermodynamic actions, there are very few trustworthy engine
tests which do not fall into a perfectly intelligible order. There i.- only one known ·
                                                                                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                          851

method, not now much used, by which the cylinder condensation can be directly

combated. Thirty years a^o superheating the steam was adopted with very con-

siderable increase of economy. It is likely that it was thought by the inventor of

superheating that an advantage would be gained by increasing the temperature

range. If so, his theory was probably a mistaken one." For the cooling action of the

cylinder is so great that the steam is reduced to saturation temperature before it

has time to do work                                                                               but  the  economy  due  to  superheating  was  unquestionable,
                                                                                               ;

and was very remarkable considering how small a quantity of heat is involved in

superheating. The heat appears to diminish the cylinder wall action so much as

almost to render a jacket unnecessary. The plan of superheating was abandoned

from purely practical objections, the superheaters then constructed being dangerous.

Recently superheating has been tried again at Mulliouse by M. Meunier, and his

experiments are interesting because they are at higher pressures than in the older

trials and with a compound engine. It appears that even when the superheater

was heated by a separate lire there was an economy of steam of 25 to 30 per cent,

and an economy of fuel of 20 to 25 per cent., and four boilers with superheating

were as efficient as five without it.

It may be pointed out as a point of some practical importance that if a

trustworthy method of superheating could be found, the advantage of the triple

over the compound engine would be much diminished. For marine purposes the

triple engine is perfectly adapted. But for other purposes it is more costly than

the compound engine, and it is less easily arranged to work efficiently with a

varying load.

     There does not seem much prospect of exceeding the efficiency attained already

in the best engines, though but few engines are really as efficient as they might be,
and there are still plenty of engines so designed that" they are exceedingly unecono-
mic?.l. The very best engines use only from 12 to 1.3 lb. of steam per indicated
horse-power hour, having an absolute efficiency reckoned on the indicated power
of 16 per cent., or, reckoned on the ertective power, 13 per cent. The efficiency,
including the loss in the boiler, is only about 9 per cent. But there are internal

furnace engines of the gas-engine or oil-engine type in which the thermal efficiency
is double this.

      In his interesting address to this Section in 1878, Mr. Easton expressed the
opinion that the question of water-power was one deserving more consideration
than it had lately received, and he pointed to the variation of volume of llow
of streams as the principal objection to their larger utilisation. Since that time
the progress made in systems of transporting and distributing power has given

quite a new importance to the question of the utilisation of water-power. There
seems to be a probability that in many localities water-power will, before long, be

used on a quite unprecedented scale, and under conditions involving so great

convenience and economy that it may involve a quite sensible movement of

manufacturers towards districts where water-power is available.

     If we go back to a period not very distant in the history of the world, to the

middle of the last century, we reach the time when textile manufactures began to

pass from the condition of purely domestic industries to that of a factory system.
The fly-shuttle was introduced in 1750, the spinning-jenny was invented in 17G7,
and Crompton's machine only began to be generally used in 1787. It was soon

found that the new machines were most suitably driven by a rotary motion, and
after some attempts to drive them by horses, water-power was generally resorted

to. In an interesting pamphlet on the Rise of the Cotton Trade, by John
Kennedy, of Ardwick Hall, written in 1815, it is pointed out that the necessity
of locating the mills where water-power was available had the disadvantages

of taking them away from the places where skilled workmen were found, and
from the markets for the manufactured goods. Nevertheless, Mr. Kennedy states

that for some time after Arkwright's first mill was built at Cromford all the

principal mills were erected near river falls, no other power than water-power
having been found practically useful. 'About 17P0,' says Mr. Kennedy, 'Mr.
Watt's steam-engine began to be understood, and waterfalls became of less value.

Instead of carrying the workpeople to the power, it was found preferable to place
the power amongst the people.'

852'  REPORT-- 1892.

     The whole tendency of the conditions created by the use of steam-power has
been to concentrate the industrial population iu large communities, and to restrict
manufacturing operations to large factories. Economy in the production of power,
economy in superintendence, the convenience of the subdivision of labour, and the
costliness of the machines employed, all favoured the growth of large factories.

--The whole social conditions of manufacturing centres have been profoundly

influenced by these two conditions that coal for raising steam can be easily
brought to any place where it is wanted, and that steam-power is more cheaply
produced on a large scale than on a small scale. It looks rather, just now, as if
facilities for distributing power will to some extent reverse this tendency.

     Let me tirst point out that water-power, where it is available, is so much

cheaper and more convenient than steam-power that it has never been quite
 Tanquished by steam-power.

      I find, from a report by Mr. Weissenbach, that, in 1876, 70,000 horse-power
derived from waterfalls were used iu manufacturing in Switzerland. According
to a census in 1880, it appears that the total steam and water power employed in
manufacturing operations in the United States was 3,400,000 horse-power. Of
this, 2,185,000 horse-power, or 64 per cent., was derived from steam, and 1,225,000
borse-power, or 36 per cent., from water. In the manufacture of cotton and
woollen goods, of paper and of flour, 700.000 horse-power were obtained from
water, and 515,000 horse-power from steam. If statistics could be obtained
from other countries, I believe it would be found that a very large amount of

water-piwer is actually made available. The firm of Escher S\'y3S & Company, of

Zurich, have constructed more than 1,800 turbines of an aggregate power of

lll,4i;0 horse-power.

     With a very limited exception all the water-power at present used is employed
in the neiglibourhood of the fall where it is generated. If means Avere avaiLabl«
for transporting the power from the site of the fall to localities more convenient for
maiiufiictures, there can be no doubt that a niucli larger amount of water-power
would be used, and the relative importance of water and steam power in soniii
countries would probably be reversed. It is because recent developments seem to
make such a transport of power possible without excessive cost and without

excessive loss that a most remarkable interest has been excited in the question of

the utilisation of water-power. Take the case of Switzerland, for instance. At

the present time Switzerland is said to pay to other countries 800,000/. annually
for cnal. But the total available water-power of Switzerland is estimated at no
less than 582,000 horse-power, of which probably only 80,000 are at present
utilised. I found a year ago that nearly every large industrial concern in Switzer-
land was preparing to make use of water-power, transported a greater or less
distance. Besides the great schemes actually carried out at Schaffhausen, Belle-
garde, Geneva, and Zurich, where water-power is already utilised on a very large
scale, there is a project to develop 10,000 horse-power on the Dranse, near Martigny.

   --Hence it is easy to see that problems of distribution of power that is, the
--transformation of energy into forms easily transportable and easily utilisable have

now a creat interest for engineers.

      Besides the power required for manufacturing operations, there is a steadily
increasing demand for easily available mechanical energy in large towns. For
tramways, for lifts, for handling goods, for small industries, for electric lighting,
and sometimes for sanitation, power is required. Hitherto steam-engines, or more
lately gas-engines, have been used, placed near the work to be done. But this

sporadic generation of power is uneconomical and costly, especially when the work

is intermittent; the cost of superintendence is large, and the risk of accident
considerable. Hence attention is being directed to systems in which the mechanical
energy of fuel or falling water is first generated in large central, stations, trans-
formed into some form in which it is conveniently transportable and capable of
being rendered available by simpler motors than steam-engines.

     Just as in great towns it has become necessary to supersede private means of
water supply by a municipal supply just as it has proved convenient to distribute

                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

coal-gas for lighting and heating, and to provide a common system of sewerage, so
TraNSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  853

it will probably be found convenient to liare in all large towns some means of

obtaining mechanical power in any desired quantity at a price proportionate to the

quantity used, and in a form in Avhich it can be rendered available, either directly

--or by simple motors requiring but little skilled superintendence.
     Telodynamic: Transmission. First, then, let me say a few words as to modes of

distributing power which it is possible to adopt. In 1850, at Logelbach in Alsace,
M. Ferdinand Ilirn used a flat steel belt to transmit power directly a distance of
eighty metres. Subsequently a wire rope was nsed on grooved pulleys. This
worked so well that a second transmission to a distance of 240 metres was erected^
The details of the system were worked out with great care with a view to securing
the least cost of construction, the least waste of energy, and the greatest durability

of the ropes. So successful did this system of telodynamic transmission prove that
within ten years M. Martin Stein, of Mulhouse, had erected 400 transmissions,

conveying 4.200 horse-power, and covering a distance of 72,000 metres.

      Just at this time a very able and far-seeing manufacturer at Schaffhausen,
Herr Moser, had formed a project for reviving the failing industries of the town
by utilising part of tlie water-power of the Khine : Hirn's system of wire rope
transmission rendered this project practicable. The works were commenced in
]8G3. Three turbines of 760 horse-power were erected on a fall which varies

from 12 to 16 feet, created by a weir across the river. From the turbines the
power is transmitted by two cables, in one span of 302 feet, acro.ss the river.
Similar cables distribute the power to factories along the river bank. In 1870
the transmission extended to a distance of .3,400 feet. Power is sold at rates

varying from 5/. to 6/. per horse-power per annum. In 1887 there were twenty-

three consumers of power paying a rental of 3, .500/. per annum for power. The
project has been financially successful, and is still working. At Zurich, Freiberg,
and Bellegarde there are similar installations, and a large scheme of the same
kind has recently been carried out at Gokak in India. Wire-rope transmissions
are of great mechanical simplicity, and the loss of power in transmission is exceed-
ingly small. They are extremely suitable for certain cases where a moderate
amount of power has to be transmitted a moderate distance to one or to a few
factories. On the other hand, tliey become cumbrous if the amount of power
transmitted exceeds 600 or 1,000 horse-power. The wear of the ropes, which
 only last a year, has proved greater than was expected, and is a source of con-

 siderable expense.

      The practical introduction of a system of distributing power by pressure water
 is due to Lord Armstrong. Such a system involves a central pumping station, a
series of distributing mains, and suitable working motors. From its first intro-
 duction the peculiar advantages of this system for driving intermittently working
 machines, such as lifts, dock machinery, railway cranes, and hauling gear, became
 obvious. But, with intermittent working machines, there arose the need of an
 appliance lor storing energy during periods of minimum demand and restoring it
in periods of maximum demand. Tlie invention of the accumulator by Lord
 Armstrong made the system of hydraulic transmission a success, and at the same
 time fixed its character as a system .specially adapted for those cases where inter-
 mittent work is required to be done. Lord Armstrong's system of hydraulic
 distribution by water at a pressure of 700 or 800 lb. per square inch, with the use
 of accumulators for equalising the variations of su])ply and demand, has now been
 widely adopted. The most exten.sive scheme of i hat kind hitherto executed i«
 the important scheme carried out by the Hydraulic Power Company. Over fifty
 miles of pressure mains have now been laid in the streets of London. The Falcon
 Wharf pumping station contains four sets of compound pumping engines, each of

 200 horse-power. Two additional pumping stations have now been erected, and
 1,500 lifts are worked from the pressure mains. The minimum charge for water

 is 2s. per 1,000 gallons. This rate of charge is economical for .such machines a.s
 lifts, but it would be extravagant for machines working continuou.sly. It would
 be equivalent to a charge of nearly bOl. per horse-power per year of 3,000 working
 hours, apart from interest and maintenance of machines.

      J shall indicate later on that in some cases where local conditions are favour-

able, where there is cheap water-power, and the possibility of constructing high-

level storage reservoirs, then hydraulic transmission can be adopted with success

for distributing power for ordinary manufacturing purposes. But neither telo-

dynamic transmission nor hydraulic transmission has proved suitable as methods

for the general distribution of motive power from central stations. Distribution

by steam and distribution by hente^ water have both been tried in the United

States, but not witli very remarkable success. Only two other methods are

--available distribution by compressed air and distribution by electricity.

For many years compressed air has been used to distribute power in tunnelling

and mining operations to considerable distances. It is only recently that it has

been used as a general method of distributing power to many consumers. la

many installations the machinery has been rough and unscientitic, and the waste

of energy very considerable. It is through experience gained and improvements

carried out in the remarkable system now at work in Paris, and known as the

Popp system, that the great advantages of compressed air distribution have been

proved. The Paris system has very gradually developed. About 1870 a small

compressing station was ei-ected to actuate public and private clocks by intermittent

pulses of air conveyed along pipes chiefly laid in the sewer.s. In 1889 about 8,000

clocks were thus driven. Meanwhile the compressed air had also been applied to

drive motors for small industries. The demand for power thus supplied grew so

rapidly that a second compressing station was built in the Rue de Saint Fargeau.

In 1889 steam air compressors of 2,000 horse-power were at work, and additional

compressors were under construction. The pressure at that time was five atmo-

spheres, and the largest air mains were 12 inches in diameter. Ingenious and

.simple rotary machines were used as air motors for small powers, and for larger

powers any ordinary steam-engine was converted into an air motor. Professor

Kennedy made tests in 1889, which were communicated to this Association. He

found that a motor four miles from the compressing station indicated 10 horse-

power for 20 indicated horse-power expended at the compressing station, an efficiency

of 50 per cent only. There were then 22-5 motors worked from the air mains.

Since 1889 more extended investigations have been made by Professor lliedler,

of Berlin, and the chief part of the waste of work has been traced to inefficiency

of the air compressors. Compound air compressors of much higher efficiency have

now been constructed. The plant at the Saint Fargeau station has been increased

Ato 4,000 horse-power.    new station has been erected on the Quai de la Gare,

intended ultimately to contain compressors of 24,000 horse-power. Compressors

of 10,000 horse-power are already under construction.

Compressed air transmission, whether or not it is the most economical system,

is undoubtedly applicable for the distribution of power on a very large scale and

to very considerable distances. There is nothing in any of the appliances which

is noyel or imperfectly understood. The air is used in the consumer's premises in

machinery of well-understood types, and old steam engines can be converted into

air motors without difficulty and without alteration of existing transmissive

machinery in the factories. Not least important, the air can be measured with

accuracy enough for practical purposes by simple meters, and charged for in

proportion to the power consumed. Air compressors and air motors are not as

efficient as dynamos and electric motors, but in one respect distribution by air and

electricity are similar. For distances which are not more than a few miles the loss

of energy in transmission is small enough to be insignificant.

There is yet one other mode of power distribution which promises to become

the most important of all, and which, in tlie case of transmission to very great

distances, if such transmission becomes necessary, has undoubtedly great advantages

over every other method.

     About electrical distribution of power I shall not venture to say much, partly
Ijecause I am not an electrical expert, partly because it has been lately pretty fully

discussed. In the United States there has been an enormous development of

electric tramways, which are essentially cases of electric power distribution. In

this country we have the South London and some other railways worked electri-

cally. There are others also on the Continent. But electrical power distribution
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                               855

to private consumers for industrial purposes Las not yet made as much progress as
might have been expected. Perhaps electrical engineers have been so busy with
problems of electric lighting that they have had no time to settle the corret^pond-
iug problems of power distribution.

    No doubt continuous current distribution presents at the moment the fewest

difficulties, or, at any rate, involves the fewest comparatively untried expedients.

Several continuous current plants for distributing power are in operation, of which

perhaps tlie most interesting is that at Oyonaz, which was described in Section G-

last year by Professor G. Forbes. There 300 horse-power obtained by turbines is

transmitted 8 kilometres at 1,800 volts. It is then let down by motor transformers

Ato a voltage suitable for lighting and driving motors.      number of small work-

shops are driven, the power being supplied at a fixed rent.

At the Calumet and Hecla mines on Lake Superior, at the Dalniatia mines in

California, and some other places, energy derived from turbines is transmitted

distances of a mile or two by continuous electric current-', and used in driving

mining machinery, and some cases of the use of electiical distribution in mines in

this country were mentioned by my predecessor in his Address last year.

At Bradford a few electric motors are b'jing worked from the electric lighting

mains. The largest of these is of 20 hovse-power. The price at which the elec-

tricity is supplied is not given, but I believe the cost is high when reckoned for

continuous working. It would seem that it must be so when the electric current

is generated by steam-power.

     At Schaffhausen an electric transmission has now been constructed alongside
of the wire-rope transmission. The power is derived from two turbines, and is
transmitted across the Rhine, a distance of 750 yards, at 024 volts. The current
drives a spinning-mill, in which the largest motor is 3.^0 horse-power. The power

is sold, I believe, at '31. per horse-power of the motors per aimum.

    Many engineers have now apparently come to the conclusion that alternating

currents will be better for power transmission to considerable distances than con-
tinuous currents. One interesting alternate current transmission, partly for power,
partly for lighting purposes, has been for some time in operation at Genoa.

    On the line of the aqueduct bringing water from the Gorzente rivulet three
electric stations are being established. The reservoirs are i?,050 feet above Genoa,
and as this is a much greater fall than is required Jor water-supply purposes, part

can be used to generate about 1,600 horse-power.

In the first of the power stations erected there are 1 urbines of 450 horse-power

Adriving two dynamos.  second larger station was completed in November. In

this there are eight alternate current dynamos of 70 horse-power each. Six alter-

nators are worked in series, transmitting a current of G,0CO volts. The current is

transmitted sixteen miles by bare copper wires, 8'0 mm, diameter, placed overhead.

The current is used both for lighting and power purposes.

Another method of using alternating currents was adopted in the remarkable

experiment at Frankfort last year. In that case energy obtained by turbines at

LaufTen was transmitted to Frankfort, a distance of 108 miles, and used for

lighting and driving a motor. The current was obtained at low tension, trans-

formed up to a tension of 18,000 to S7,000 volts for transmission, and then trans-

formed down again for distribution. The loss in the conducting wives ranged from

5 horse-power, when the turbines worked at 100 horse-power, to 25 horse- power,

when the turbines worked at 200 horse-power. The efficiency of dynamo, two

transformers, and line ranged from 08 to 75 per cent.-- a remarkably satisfactory-

result.

     There can be little doubt that if efficient and durable transformers can be con-
structed, they do give a considerable advantage to an alternate current system.

To an ordinary engineer it appears also that the system of producing current at low
tension in the dynamo, and using it at low tension in the motors, permits the con-
struction of dynamos and motors more mechanically unexceptionable than those

working at high voltage.
     I have spoken of the growth of a demand for power distributed in a convenient

form in towns. The power distribution in London, Manchester, Birmingham,
8j6 report-- 1892.

and Liverpool by pressure water, and that by compressed air in Paris, shows how

Alapidlj', when power is available, a demand for it arises.  striking instance may

be found in the small town of Geneva.

In 1871, soon after the completion of the earlier system of low-pressure water

supply, Col. Turrettiui applied to the municipal council to place a pressure eno^ine

on the town mains for driving the iactory of the Society for Manufacturing Physi-

cal Instruments. The plan proved so convenient that nine years after, in 1S80,

there were in Geneva 111 water-motors supplied from the low pressure mains,

using 34,000,000 cubic feet of water annually, and paying to the municipality

nearly 2,000/. a year. The cost of the pov-fer was not low. It was charged at a

rate equivalent to from 36Z. to 48/. per horse-power per year of 3,000 worhing

hours. But even the hijih price did not prevent the use of power so conveniently

obtainable.

      Since then a high-pressure water service has been established, the water being

pumped by turbines in the Phone. From this high-pressure service power is
su])plied more cheaply. On the high-pressure system the cost of the power is

about O'ld. per horse-power hour, or 81. per horse-power for 3,000 working hours.

In 1889 the annual income from water sold for power purposes on the low-

pressure system was 2,085/., and on the high-pressure system 4,500/. On the high-

pressure system the receipts in 1889 were increasing at the rate of 880/. per year.

In 1889 the motive power distributed, on the high-pressure system alone,

amounted to 1 ,.500,000 horse-power hours, there being seventy-nine motors of aa

aggregate working power of 1,279 horses.

In Zurich there is a quite similar system and power, amounting to 9,000,000

horse-power hours in the year, distributed hydraulically to various consumers,

who pay a rental of 1,200/. per ajiuum. It will be noted that all this power in

Geneva and Zurich is obtained from water which has been pumped, and it is the

low cost of the water-power which does the pumping which makes this possible.

     But, further, in both Geneva and Zurich the whole of the dynamos supplying
electric light are also driven by turbines using pumped water. The convenience

of this arises in this way. The fall obtainable in the river in both cases is a small

one, and varies. Large turbines are required, and these cannot work at a constant

speed. Further, it is expensive to use 'these large low-pressure turbines to drive

directly dynamos which only work with a considerable load for a short portion of
the day. The low-pressure turbines in the river are therefore used to pump water

to a high-level reservoir, and they work with a constant load all the twenty-four

hours.

     From the high-level reservoir water is taken as power is required to drive
the dynamos, and the turbines driving the dynamos are small high-pressure tur-

bines, working always on a constant iall at a regular speed, and easily adjusted by

a governor to a varying load. The system seems a roundabout one, but it is per-

fectly rational, eflective, and economical.

    Few persons can have seen Niagara Falls without reflecting on the enormous

energy which is there continuously expended, and for any useful purpose wasted.

The exceptional constancy of the volume of flow, the invariability of the levels, the
depth of the plunge over the escarpment, the solid character of the rocks, all mark

out Niagara as an ideally perfect water-power station, while, on the other hand,

the remarkable facilities of transport, both by steam navigation on the lakes and

by four systems of railway, afford commercial advantages of the highest importance.

I'rom a catchment basin of 240,000 square miles, an area greater than that of

France, a volume of water amounting to 205,000 cubic feet per second descends

from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, a vertical distance of 326 feet, in 37^ miles.

Supposing the whole stream could be utilised, it would supply 7,000,000 hor.se-

power. This is more than dotxble the total steam and water power at present

employed in manufacturing industry in the United States.

Immediately below the Falls the river bends at right angles, and flows through

a narrow sorge. The town of Niagara Falls on the American side occupies the

table-land in this angle.

    The earliest traders who settled near the Falls erected stream mills in the
TRANSACTIOXS OF SECTION G.  857

upper river in 1725 for preparing timber. Later, the Porter family erected fac-
tories on the islands in the rapids above the falls. It was not, however, till about
thirty years ago that any systematic attempt was made to utilise part of the water-
power of the Falls. Then a canal was constructed from Port Bay, about three-
quarters of a mile above the Falls, to a forebay or head-race along the cliff over-
looking the lower river. In 1874 the Cataract Mill was established, taking power
from this canal, and other mills were gradually erected till about 6,000 horse-power
was utilised, Tliese mills have been exceedingly prosperous, but since the growth
of a feeling against the disfigurement of the Falls it has become impossible to
extend works of the same kind.

     The idea of a method of utilising the Falls, capable of greater development, and

free from the objections to the hydraulic canal with mills discharging tailw.ater on

the face of the clitf, is due to the late Mr. Thomas Evershed, Division Engineer of

the New York State Canals. He proposed to construct head-race canals on un-
occupied land some two miles above the Falls. From these the water was to fall

through vertical turbine pits into tail-race tunnels, converging into a great main
tunnel, discharging into the lower river. Apart from an inappreciable diminution

of the volume of How over tlie Falls, this plan avoids any disfigurement of the
scenery near the Falls, and permits a head of nearly 200 feet to be made available.
It is, however, essential to such a plan that work should be undertaken on a very
large scale. In 1SS6 the Niagara Falls Company was incorporated, and obtained
options over a considerable area of land, extending from Port Day for two miles
along the Niafjara River. In 1889 the Cataract Construction Company was formed

to mature and carry out the constructional works required.
     The present plans contemplate the utilisation of 100,000 effective horse-power.

The principal work of construction is a great tmmel 7,250 feet long, which is
to form a tail-race to the turbines, starting from land belonging to the company
and discharging into the lower river. The tunnel is 19 feet by 21 feet, or 386

square feet in area, inside a brickwork lining ] G inches thick.
     The base of the tunnel is 205 feet below the sill of the head gate, and permits

a fall of 140 to be rendered available at the turbines. The brickwork of the tunnel
is lined for 200 feet from the mouth with cast-iron plates.

     The tunnel has been excavated with remarkable rapidity with the aid of drills
worked by compressed air.

     The main head-race, about 200 feet wide, will run for about 5,000 feet parallel
with tbe river, having entrances from the riv-er at both ends. Near the lower
reach the Soo Paper Company is already arranging to utilise 6,000 horse-power,
discharging the water from the turbines through a lateral tunnel into the main
tunnel. Near this lower reach will also be placed two principal power stations,
from which ])ower will be distributed, either electrically or otherwise in ways not
yet fully determined. The first turbines to be erected in these power stations will
be twin turbines of the outward flow type of 5,000 effective horse-power. These
turbines have a vertical shaft for driving dynamos or other machinery placed above

ground.
     According to Mr. Evershed's original plans, it was intended to distribute water

by surface canals to ditlerent power users, each of whom would sink his own tur-

bine pits, connected below by lateral tunnels to the main discharge tunnel. Some
of the power at Niagara will undoubtedly be used in this way, and in the case of
industries requiring a large amount of power it will be economical to purchase a
site and water rights.

     Such a plan is, however, not adapted to smaller factories. Obviously for them
it would be more economical to develop the power in one or more central stations
by turbines of large size under common management. Further, once given the
means of distributing power instead of water, an important extension of the pro-
ject becomes possible.

     Besides supplying power to industries which may locate themselves at Niagara,
the power may be transmitted to the existing factories in Buffalo and Tonawanda,

     Arrangements aie already proceeding to transmit 3,000 horse-power to
Buflalo, a distance of 18 miles, to woik an electric lighting station.

858 REPORT-- 1892.

     In 1890 Mr. Adams, the President of the Niagara Construction Company,
visited Europe to examine systems of power distribution. It was in consequence

of tbis visit that the important modification of the plans of the company involved

in the substitution, to a large extent, of a system of power distribution for a sys-

tem of water distribution came to be adopted. The American engineers were

anxious to obtain the best European advice as to the methods best suited to the
Alocal conditions.
                    commission was formed, consisting of Lord Kelvin, Dr. Cole-

man Sellers, Professor Mascart, and Colonel Turrettini, and an invitation was given

to engineers and engineering firms in Europe and America to send in competitive

projects for the utilisation of the power at Niagara and its distribution to different

consumers at Niagara and in Buffalo by electrical or other means. Many of the
plans sent in were worked out with great care and completeness. As to the

hydraulic part of the projects there was some approach to general consent as to
the arrangements to be adopted, but as to the methods of distributing the -power
there was an extraordinary diversitj'.

Generally the commission reported in favour of electrical distribution, with

perhaps a partial use of compressed air as an auxiliary method.

Generally also they reported in favour of methods of distribution by con-

tinuous currents in preference to alternating currents. Since the date at which

the commission reported, the Frankfort-Lautfen experiment has been made, and in

the opinion of some electrical engineers a distinct advance has been achieved in

the use of alternating currents at high potential.

The company has not yet decided to adopt any plan for the central stations

except in a tentative way. One or more turbines of 5,000 horse-power are to be
erected, and probably at first this power will be distributed to Buff'alo by an

alternating current system.

     The cost of a steam horse-power at Buffalo is reckoned at $35 per annum. I
believe the company will be able to deliver power at from SIO for large amounts
and a greater price for small amounts, this price being reckoned for twenty-four

hour days.

     The new industry of electric lighting has made necessary the provision of large

amounts of motive power. Electric traction siinilarly depends on the supply of

motive power. New chemical and metallurgical processes are being introduced

which entirely depend for their commercial success on the supply of motive power
at a low price.

      Niagara is likely to become, not only a seat of large manufacturing operations

of familiar types, but also the home of important new industries.

The following Papers were read :

1. The World's Columhian Expositiov for 189o. By James Drkdge, Mem-

     ber of the Boyal British Commission, and Robert S. McCormick,
     American Representative in London of tlie Columhian Exposition.

The great size of Jackson Park, which was assigned by the municipality of

Chicago as a' site for the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, enabled Messrs.

D. H. Burnham and J. W. Root, the engineers and architects of the Chicago Com-

mission, to prepare a general plan of the exhibition buildings, upon the basis of at

least 50 per cent, more covered space than was available at the Paris Exhibition

of 1889, while at the same time an ample area was left, which the skill of the

landscape gardeners, Messrs. Olmstead & Co., has converted into a noble park that

TRANSACTIONS OF SKCTION 0.  859

Everyone by this time must be familiar with the form of the triangular piece of
ground on which the exhibition will be held : it skirts the south-western shore of

Lake Michigan and covers an area nearly twice as large as that of Hyde Park.
There is thus sufficient space to allow of the construction of many miles of public

--walks, and also for the erection of a series of great buildings to say nothing of very
--numerous pavilions which will be devoted to different branches of art and indus-

try, and which collectively will cover no less than 150 acres, or about twice as
much as the covered area of the Paris Exhibition of 1889.

     There are uo fewer than eleven main buildings, devoted respectively to Agricul-
ture, Machinery, Manufactures and Liberal Arts, Electricity, Mines and Mining,
Transportation, Horticulture, Women's Industry, the Fine Arts, Fisheries, and the

Exhibits of the United States Government. Besides these there is also a great
monumental building reserved for the Administration. This latter occupies a

dominating position at the end of a vast court, around which are grouped five of

the principal structures above referred to, and devoted respectively to Agriculture,
measuring 500 feet by 800 feet ; Machinery, 492 feet by 846 feet ; Manufactures and
Liberal Arts, 787 feet by 1,687 feet ; Electricity, 345 feet by 700 feet ; and Mines and
Mining, 350 feet by 700 feet. The effective areas of these buildings are further
increased by very extensive annexes, especially those devoted to Agriculture, which
include several great pavilions for live stock, forestry, dairy farming, and extensive
ranges of sheds for the exhibition of cattle. The principal fafades of these five

buildings just mentioned form the north and south enclosures to the great central

coiu't, at the western end of which is the Administration building, while the eastern

end is extended into the lake by a pier of large dimensions. In the centre of the
court is a basin, which will be enriched by monumental fountains, and which forms
a connection between the extensive and ornamental waterways of Jackson Park
and Lake Michigan. Each of the principal buildings, so far at all events as archi-
tectural effects are concerned, has been designed by a different American architect,
all of them selected on account of their eminence in the profession. Certain lead-
ing conditions have been observed by them so as to secure harmony in the general
effects, both as regards proportions and classic character ; in other respects each
architect has had an entirely free hand in his designs. The buildings themselves,
which are magnificent in dimensions and most elaborate in detail, will thus form
exhibits illustrating the development to which the science of architecture has been

brought in the United States. As the remaining principal buildings on Jackson
Park are more or less independent of one another, greater freedom of design was

permitted to the architects, but they are also intended to serve as exhibits contri-

buted by Chicago architects. The Transportation building, 250 feet by 960 feet,
is simple in its outline and almost barbaric in the richness of its decoration
the Horticultural building, almost as big as our own Crystal Palace, is, like
it, a magnificent example of construction in iron and glass. The "NN'^omen's
building, 196 feet by 386 feet, is the design of a lady architect, and is severely
classic in its outline. The Art galleries will undoubtedly be the most beautiful
structures that have ever been seen at any exhibition. The leading characteristic
of the Fisheries building will be its picturesqueness, and the United States
Government is erecting a structure remarkable for its elaborate architectural
effect and the beauty of its decoration. There is no room to speak of the
many pavilions that will be scattered over the ground ; they will include con-
tributions from every State of the Union, from every nation exhibiting, as well as
those erected by the numerous exhibitors privileged to occupy buildings for them-
selves. The most varied and interesting of these will occupy a space of ground
projecting from Jackson Park, and which will form practically a street of nations
a mile long. The work of the exhibition has now advanced so far that it is within
measurable distance of completion, and it will scarcely be doing justice to the
Chicago executive to say that in extent, beauty, and completeness it will as far
surpass the Paris Exhibition of 1889 as that exhibition eclipsed all its predecessors.

     The Administration building, of which the main feature is a dome 120 feet in
diameter, rising to a height of 275 feet from the ground, is a beautiful example of

boldness in design ; in the other buildings, with one exception, there is nothing
--

unusual in the dimensions or the treatment, from an engineer's point of view. The

roofs are neither very great in span nor original in design, the main object liaving

wisely been to cover a vast area in the cheapest and the most expeditious manner

consistent with a realisation of the best effects for the special purpose for which

each building was intended. Considerable interest, however, attaches itself to the

foundations of all the main buildings. In constructing these, the system found

most useful for the great permanent buildings of the city of Chicago has been

adopted for these temporary structures ; that is to say, a system of independent

platform foundations, each unit of which distributes, independently of all the

others, a safe proportion of the load which has to be supported by the thin bed.

This is a peculiarity which the local conditions of the ground render advisable.

The exception above referred to when spealdng of the engineering features of

the exhibition buildings is found in the great hall devoted to Manufactures and the

Liberal Arts : this will have the largest roof that has ever yet been constructed. The

building covers an area of over thirty acres, and consists of a centrid galleiy, 387

feet clear span and no less than 210 feet in height : the length of this vast hall is

1,237 feet and the great roof is hipped at each end. It is surrounded with a series of

galleries, insignificant by contrast, both as regards height and span. The trusses

forming the great roof are of steel, and resemble to some extent, especially as re-

gards size, the somewhat smaller and considerably lower arches of the machinery

hall of the Paris Exhibition, which up to the present has surpassed any other

structure of the kind.

It will be remembered with what interest engineers of every nation watched

the erection of that great roof, which was undoubtedly a triumph of the contractor's

skill. The erection of the Liberal Arts building is a work of much greater magni-

tude, but it is being carried out bj' simpler means and with greater facility than

tlie Paris machinerj- hall.

   A travelling stage, wide enough to include two trusses and the whole width of

the building, is employed. On this staging are two towers, framed in timber, higher

than the roof. The erection of the trusses is carried on from the ground and from

the staging to a height of about 100 feet, that is to say, to the level of the main plat-

form of the stage. The upper halves of each pair of trusses are put together

upon this platform, and when the lower portions are completed and connected by the

longitudinal bracing, the inner members of the upper and lower sections are con-

nected by means of pins, so as to form lunged joints. By means of powerful hoist-

ing apparatus, worked from the floor of the stage, the upper halves are then hoisted

Whento their final position, turning on the hinges.  fully raised the central

joint is made good, the outer members of the upper and lower halves are rigidly

connected, the hinges are removed, and the permanent joints are completed by

riveting. In this way the work is rapidly carried on, and it is expected that the

building will be ready for the great inaugural celebration in October next.

chiefly dealt with are those at present coming under the administration of local
authorities, comprising ashbin refuse, and market garbage, fish, and other offal,
street sweepings, excremental matter, and manufacturers' refuse, the latter being a
term substituted for 'trade refuse' in order to discriminate between shop and
market refuse and the waste products of manufacture.

    The methods of disposal now generally adopted are, in most instances, in-
complete, wasteful, and injurious to the public health. They may be briefly

classified as follows :

           Combustion. It is easy tn burn ashbin refuse, by means of
               arrangements the most simple or the most complete, from a

               heaped fire in the open air up 1o an elaborate 'destructor,'
              involving heavy capital outlay ; but it is by no means easy
               to burn it without any smoke, smell, or noxious fumes being

              given off. However, the system of burning is now carried
              on in many places, and in some very satisfactorily, and this

             --is the process to be recommended.

           Sending to Sea. This arrangement, which is, of course, only
               practicable for seaboard towns, is not altogether unobjection-
               able, as a considerable portion of the refuse floats and is
               sure to be washed ashore. It is also said to interfere
               seriously with fishing, as the floating articles get into the
               nets. In addition, it is essential that the refuse should be
               taken right out to sea, and this is impracticable in stormy
              weather, when the system breaks down, causing great in-

           convenience.

                                               Street Sweepings.

     These contain sufficient horse-droppings to be saleable as manure in most cases,
though their value is largely affected by the nature of the road material and the
quantity of mineral dust contained. They are generally sold for manure, some-
times dumped or tipped, and they maj- be readily burned.

                                                   Excrement.

     The use of the public sewers to convey a mixture of domestic sewage and
liquid manufacturers' refuse, diluted with a goodly quantity of town's water, and
in many cases with surface water from the streets, is the system now generally in

favour with sanitary authorities for 'getting rid of the most dangerous class

of refuse. Its ultimate disposal is, in the great majority of cases, not fully

provided for, and in many not at all. It is often turned into the nearest

water-course, intercepting sewers being provided for carrying it to a point below

the town producing it.
     Manufacturers' refuse has no business at all in the public sewers, and the

producers should be made to dispose of it themselves. The existing laws are
sufficient to compel them to purify the effluent before passing it into any water-
course. The sanitary objections to the use of sewers as a means of conveyance are
very serious, and some of them maj be indicated by the mention of the terms
' sewer gas,' ' alternately wet and dry surfaces,' ' leakage.' It is also costly as
compared with other systems. Filtration through sand and through fibrous
material, by pressure and precipitation, by chemical and mechanical processes, are
systems more or less imperfectly adopted by municipal authorities for dealing with
liquid refuse, and they leave a large residue in the form of sludge which is, in
some places, simply deposited on the ground in heaps or sloughs. At_ Ealing
sewage sludge is being burnt in the destructor very successfully, and this is the
proper method of disposal. The authorities of London now barge it out to sea in
what is known as the ' Sludge Fleet,' and the amount of black mud stirred up by
the passage of a large vessel to or from the Port of London is said to be less than
 formerly in consequence. It remains to be seen whether the enormous dredging

operations liitherto carried on in the docks and the river will be rendered unneces-

sary by the adoption of the present system.
     Intermittent downward filtration, irrigation, and Webster's electrical precipi-

tation process followed by combustion are linal and complete methods of disposal

of sewage, while those systems which aim at producing manure may be considered
as complete when a market can be found for the product.

     Collection from house to house, either on the pail system or on the privy

system, is still largely practised, and is in many respects strongly to be recom-
mended, particularly in that it provides the most direct means of conveying the

noxious material to the destructors.

                           Manufacttjeees' Eeftjse.

The liquid waste products of mamifticturers are rarely dealt with by those who

produce them. They are disposed of, as described above, by being turned into the
public sewers, which are maintained by rates pressing equally on those who turn in
an unlimited amount of liquid refuse and those who produce none. For the

disposal of solid refuse manufacturprs usually have to pay the local authority in

cases where they do not themselves dump it on vacant ground.

  --2. Outline of a Scheme for the Solution of the Problem. The paper pleads that

a systematic and comprehensive system should be elaborated and approved by the
leading sanitary engineers, and it sets forth an outline of the scheme by which
each class of refuse should be made to assist in the final disposing of the other.

Manufacturers' refuse alone is excluded, as it belongs distinctly to the province of

the private individual, and not to that of the local authority. Its composition is
so varied and its treatment so dithcult as to interfere with any scheme proposed for
the treatment of towns' refuse. The mixture together of all kinds of waste products

from manufactures and the mixture of the mixture with sewage matter often

Arender the ultimate treatment well-nigh impossible.  scheme is, however, indi-

cated by which each manufacturer may use his solid refuse to assist him in disposing

--of his liquid refuse.
     o. Destructors. Destruction by fire is the method recommended for the final

Andisposal of all refuse.  account of the development of this system precedes a

short description of each of the furnaces tried in this country or abroad which

Ahave received any considerable share of public attention.  fuller description of

each of the principal furnaces at present in use in this countiy follows.

     High temperatures are recommended as insuring (with proper arrangements)

thorough ' cremation ' of the fumes, and also rendering available an immense power

from the burning of ashbin lefuse, market garbage, fish, and other offal, street

sweepings, privy and pail excrement, and sewage sludge (when not mixed with

liquid manufacturers' refuse, which is said to be often incombustible). Hitherto it
has been generally believed that one ton of ashbin refuse, when burned, gives off

heat equivalent to 1"2 I.H.P. for twenty-four hours. That is equivalent to about

6 I.H.P. per cell or furnace of the destructor from which the figures were obtained.

The author has proved by recent experiments that burning in the Horsfall

destructor at Oldham one ton of mixed refuse (of which the proportions were

--found by observations extending over eleven weeks to be approximately ashbin

refuse, 95 per cent. ; fish offal, ?> per cent. ; market garbage, 1 per cent. ; street

sweepings, 1 per cent.) will convert 328 gallons of water at 67° F. to steam at

70 lb. pressure per square inch. Of this 150 gallons are at present used in pro-

moting combustion (by steam jets), so that from each ton of refuse burnt there is

available, say, 1,780 lb. of steam at 70 lb. pressure, which is equivalent to

89 I.H.P. for one hour, or 3'75 I.H.P. for twenty-four hours, as against 1'2 (the

generrtlly accepted figure), or over three times as much. It is equivalent to nearly

15 I.H.P. per cell or furnace. If the power were valued at 1^. per I.H.P. per

hour, which is less than is now the cost at some first-class electric-lighting stations,
there is a value of 5s. per ton burnt to put againrt the cost of burning. At

Oldham this is Is. 10c?., without counting any returns from sale of mortar, &c., and

including a charge of 7 percent, (or Qd. per ton net) for interest on capital outlay,

repairs, and depreciation, in addition to wages and gas and water rates, and in fact

all charges. It does not of course include the cost of collection and cartage, which

may be taken at, say, 2*. per ton. Then we bave Is. 2d. per ton as the net value
Aof the refuse -when burnt on this system.
                                            rougrh outline scheme is described for

the burning of London sludge at Barking and Crossness when mized with ashbiu

refuse barged down by steam power.

     Sites for destructors in special reference to areas of cartage and population are

dealt with, and also a calculation is given showing how the refuse of any com-

munity is sufficient to provide it with electric light at no extra cost beyond that

now involved in refuse disposal. Village refuse is also treated briefly, and united

action of sanitary engineers to bring about the general adoption of the combustion
system is urged.

    4. The Alsorption and Filtration nf Sewage on Sandy and other Soils.

                  By RiCHAED F. Grantham, M.Inst. C.E., F.G.S.

     The author refers to the remarkable results of the experiments conducted for
the last two years at St. Lawrence by the Massachusetts Board of Health upon the

filtration of sewage.

     The results are compared with instances of sewage farming upon sandy soils.
     The examples of sewage irrigation at Edinburgh, Dantzig, and Berlin are
described, and the effect upon the sandy soil in each case, as well as the average
quantity of sewage treated per acre per day, is alluded to.
     The particulars of the iilter tanks constructed and the materials used by the
Massachusetts Board in their experiments are stated, and a table is given to .show
the quantities treated and the effect upon the nitrogenous matter.
     The tanks were 6 feet deep, built water-tight; 17 feet 4 inches in diameter at
the top and 16 feet 8 inches at the bottom. Two-inch drain-pipes and a thickness
of a foot of gravel and sand, decreasing in coarseness upwards, were laid and spread
at the bottom. Above this layers of sand and of gravel and othei- materials were
placed in several tanks. The sewage was delivered on to the surface of the filters

intermittently.

    The volumes of sewage dealt with in sewage farms are contrasted with the quan-
tities experimented upon, and Dr. Frankland's experiments for the Eivers Pollution
Comniissioners are shown to corroborate the results of the Massachusetts Boards
investigations as regards the quantities and degree of purification.

     The action of the filters is shown to be not merely straining the sewage, but in
consuming and destroying the organic impurities, and this action is due to the
presence in it of organisms which require a supply of oxygen for their existence
and multiplication. The interstices in the sand and gravel afford air-spaces for
these organisms to multiply ; but top soil and mould retain so much moisture that,
although the bacteria are filtered out, a large percentage of albuminoid ammonia is

left in the effluent.

    From the quantity of sewage disposed of on the Berlin sewage farm per acre
and from that ordinarily absorbed by intermittent downward filtration are calcu-

lated the areas of land that according to the same ratios would be required for the
disposal of the London sewage, and these are compared with the space required for
the volumes according to the ratio shown by the experiments.

     It is suggested that there would be no difficulty, from the nature of the forma-
tion of the Maplin and Foulness Sands, in reclaiming and underdraining them and
laying them out for filtration areas.

     The route that has been proposed by Messrs. D. and T. Stevenson, civil
engineers, Edinburgh, passes up the valley of the Forth from Grangemouth by

                                        ' Ordered to be printed in cxtenso.

Alloa and Stiiiinj^ to Loch Lomond, the surface of which is only 22 feet above the
mean level of the sea ; thence across the narrow neck of land at Tarbet to Loch

 Lonor.

     The length of the canal from the Forth to Loch Long is 30 miles, the proposed

-- --depth ."^O feet, and the width at bottom 72 feet. The Inck-<, of which there are

onlv two one at each end will be capable of passing the larjxest ships afloat
 or about 600 feet in length and 80 feet wide, with smaller locks alongside for small

·craft.

      There are no serious engineering difficulties to be overcome. The depth of
cutting does not average 50 feet, and is principally in soft materials. The tunnel
which it is proposed to construct through the high grounds near Loch Lomond is a
large one, namely, 2j miles in length, with 150 feet headway ; it, however, can be
made an open cutting if thought desirable.

     For the supply of water to the locks Loch Lomond affords an ample reservoir,
for it is the summit level of the canal, and has a gathering ground of 21,000 acres.

     By this canal vessels from the Clyde to ports on the East Coast of Scotland

would save a distance of 529 to 238 miles, while from the Forth to porta on the
West Coast of Scotland, South-west of England, Ireland, America, and the
Mediterranean, the distances saved would Ije from 487 to 140 miles.

     From Tyne ports to the St. Lawrence lliver the distance saved would be 150
mUes. From West of Britain to North-east of Ireland, and to middle western
parts of the Continent, the distance saved would be 377 to OS miles.

     The traffic which would benefit by this canal, an examination of the Returns
of Shipping shows, would amount annually to at least 9,000,000 tons.

     The estimated cost of the undertaking is 8,000,000/. Since the above scheme
was put forward a project has been set on foot to make a ship canal on what has
been styled the 'direct route' from Grangemouth across the high table-land, over
which the present barge canal goes to Yoker on the Clyde.

     The objections to this ' direct route ' are that, as designed, it will not admit the
largest class of vessels now afloat; it necessitates having twelve locks : the time of
passage through it will be 11| hours, as against 8A by the Loch Lomond route ; it
'will be difficult, or impossible, to obtain a sufficient supply of water for the locks
it debouches above Greenock into a narrow part of the Clyde already crowded ; it
cannot be entered or left at low water, hence delays ; and it will be more expensive

Tto construct.

      This system of carriage is novel. It is specially economical, as it dispenses
with the employment of manual labour in the loading, running, or discharging of

the carriages, the whole work being performed by a fixed engine. This engine
may drive several lines of a system simultaneously, as is at present done in coal
mines. The engine may work the lines through the agency of the endless wire
rope system of haulage or of electricity. The author has constructed three
different sets of apparatus. The full-size set has been employed experimentally to
deal with bales containing each nine cubic feet and weighing 400 lb. weight.
The smallest size is that of the model, 20 feet by 10 feet, shown at work.

     The system was designed in order to supply a felt want in the distribution of
cargoes over an extended floor space. The author submits that it promises assist-

ance in the carriage of packages generally.

     The machinery may be fully employed, as there are no railway sidings or

stations. The trains run continuously, and take on and discharge their loads
while they run. They may take on loads at about six difierent places, each of
                      --

                          TIUNSACTIONS OF SECTION O.                 865

which is independent of the other. They may also discharge their loads at as
many places, and these discharging places may be altered at any moment as

required.

     The trains always run in the same direction, as the lines are continuous curved

loops, and they may succeed each other as closely as may he necessary to

accommodate the traffic. The system is elastic, and is capable of indehnite
extension and of the application of extended automatic appliances. Much com-
plexity of work may be done by a moderate application of power.

      It is submitted that the system (which is patent) is competent to produce great
convenience and economy in the carriage of packages.

                                                  U.vplanation of the Model.

    The model exhibited represents a new system of carriage, which has been

inAented so as to convey packages in the most economical manner. It has been

constructed to show how the system works. No men, boys, or horses are required

in the loading, running, or discharging of the trains.

    The apparatus exhibited may have six loading and any convenient number of
discharging places ; but by additional automatic means the system may be in-
definitely extended, so that packages may be carried between any desired number

of points without failure or confusion.
     The loading places may, in general, be fixed and not movable, as in the model,

the arrangement represented being that intended for the discharge of cargoes and
to suit the hatchways of vessels.

2. On Electric Locomotives. By Alexander Siemens.

     The communication describes the tests made in active work of two electric

locomotives supplied by Messrs. Siemens Brothers & Co. to the City and South

London Railway. Each locomotive carries two electric motors, together capable

of giving 100-brake horse-power; the armatures are wound directly on the axles, so

Wm.as to do away with all gearing, a plan suggested by the late Sir  Siemens.

The tests were made by simultaneous readings of speed, amperes and volts on

the locomotives, and of amperes and volts on the station dynamos; the results are

plotted on a series of curves, the mean values of which are summarised iu the

accompanying table :

 3. The Utilisation of the Energy of Flowing Wafer. Descriptio7i of the

   Purdon-Walters Motor. By Messrs. Purdon and Walteks, Westminster.

      The motor, which was illustrated by the cartoons exhibited, is designed to
 convert the energy of tiowinir water into mechanical power for the purpose of
 driving electric, pumping, grinding, and other plant.

      The machinery of the motor is carried on a pontoon, below which is a lower

 deck or platform attached to it by uprights. When at work the motor is moored

 at right angles to the direction of the current, and adjusts itself automatically to
 the varying levels of flood or tide. The lower platform covers in the moving parts
 and provides for the motor taking the ground without damage in shallow water,
 and even being worked in that condition.

      The mechanism acted upon by the water consists of blades fixed at even
 intervals to an endless chain passing over two vertical end wheels, the links of the
 chain gearing with flat .surfaces provided on the wheels. The bearings for the
 wheel shafts are placed at such a level on the pontoon that half the chain and
 blades, controlled by fixed guiding rollers, are submerged in the water, while the

 other half are suspended in the air.
      The back portion of the pontoon is constructed with a watertight deck inter-

 po.sed between the end wheels and the upper and lower parts of the chain, so that

 when motion is imparted to the chain the blades which are submerged have a clear

 passage through the water between the lower platform and the pontoon, and
 return in the air above it. The remaining portion of the pontoon for carrj^ing the
 gearing and machinerj' to be driven is in the form of an open barge, covered with
 light shedding where required and boarded up fore and aft, outside the end
 wheels, from the lower platform, to protect the blades in the water and to permit
 of the motor being towed.

      The space between the pontoon and lower platform through which the current
 has to pass from the front of the motor to the blades at the back is in the form of
a bell mouth, contracted laterally by means of curved wing vanes placed at each
end, and vertically by the inclination of the bottom of the pontoon and the lower

platform.

       In this space the current i.s diverted into the line of action of the blades, at

right angles to the stream, by means of curved guide vanes ; and the blades are
also curved to receive the pressure and allow of a free escape of the water into the
0]ien stream beyond. The whole arrangement is in fact that of the well-known

turbine rod.

     The bell mouth has the eff"ect of concentrating the energy of a large sectional

area of stream at a higher velocity than its natural flow on a comparatively small
 blade area, the advantage obtained being that the weight of the moving chain and
consequent friction is considerably reduced, and the speed of the chain increased.

     The action of the machinery impelled by the current is as follows :
     The current impinging on the blades forces those in the water forward with
the chain which revolves the end wheels and carries round the blades each in turn,
to be submerged and acted upon by the water. One of the end wheels is provided
with .spur gearing revolving a second motion shaft, from which any higher speed
can be obtained by the employment of pulleys and belting.
     The energy of a stream varies as the cube of the velocity, and maybe expressed
by the formula

                                      ^ =~ Q, v^ ft. lbs. per second,

The actual causes of tbe violence which is admitted to occur are then shown

to be partly internal, due to avoidable errors in construction, and partly and

principally to the concussion of the waste valve in closing at a high speed.

     The author then mentions the attempts made by various inventors to diminish

this violence by cushioning the blow of the valve, which, while partially success-
ful in their immediate object, result at the same time in impairing the efficiency

of the machine, and shows that the explanation sometimes given of this result

--viz., that it prevents the instantaneous action imagined to be necessary i»

untenable. The true reason of the observed effect is shown to he merely that the

slowness of shutting produced by cushioning chokes the flow, and, this being so^
a method is at once suggested of shutting slowly without choking the flow, and

consequently without impairing the efficiency of the machine.
     It having been thus shown that all existing causes of violence are removable,

it does not appear that there is any other reason to prevent the extended use of

this principle, and in some respects it is much more suitable for use on a large

scale than on a small, notably on account of the smaller coefficient of friction in

large pipes.

   A large engine was constructed to prove the above ideas in practice and dis-

cover any unforeseen practical difficulties. The proportions of this engine were

deduced from theoretical considerations, discarding the empirical rules formerly in

use, as it was found that the theory of the machine indicated the advantage of
proportions differing from these. It was also evident that the periods of time
during which the main valve was open and shut would be of great importance,

and the most suitable times were therefore determined and machinery designed
to give the valve exactly this motion. Very much higher velocities were also used

in the flow-pipe than had hitherto been used, with the effect of greatly increasing-

the power of a machine of given size.
     The flrst engine made on this basis was successful, and three others have since

been made differing in some practical details. The principal features of these
engines are the use of an annular slide valve for the waste valve, moved by a cam

in order to obtain exactly the motion required and bring the valve to its seat
without any impact, the gradual shutting of this valve being prevented from

checking the momentum of the water by the provision of a space into which some

of the water flows during the shutting of the valve. This space or antechamber
is emptied of water during the opening of the main valve, being provided with an
air-valve which admits air at that time, and allows the air to escape as the

chamber fills with water.

Precisely similar engines have been also used to compress air, the air being

compressed in a chamber similar to the antechamber spoken of above, and its

quantity being capable of exact regulation by placing the air-valve in a tube, the

depth of which below the roof of the chauiber is regulated by a screw.

The general results obtained from these engines are

An1. Entire absence of violence as predicted.   indicator diagram of the in-

ternal pressLire exhibited further shows this.

2. Very high efficiency, amounting to over 70 per cent, when pumping water^

and over 80 when compressing air.

3. That the construction is simple and much less costly than the ancient

method, and the management of the engines is easy and the wear slight.

4. Evidence that a similar construction is equally feasible for engines having

flow-pipes 3 feet or 4 feet diameter.

     In short, it has been established as a fact of actual experience that the simple

and useful principle of the hydraulic ram may safely and very advantageously be

extended to nearly all cases where water-power is used for pumping or for

compressing air, and that there is no need at all to continue in future the use of

the antiquated indirect methods, but there are very strong reasons for not doing so.

     The author farther mentions the result of recent experience in using still
higher velocities in the flow-pipe with a view to still further increasing the power

of engines of a given size. A'elocities eight times as great as used in ordinary
--

    TRANSACTIONS OF SKCTIO.V 0.  869

rams have beeu alreadj employed, and the author expects to employ even greater

velocities in future.

     The great aid supplied by these macliines to the problem of transmission of
power is then pointed out. The incidental advantages of using compressed air for

this purpose ore great, but the practical objection hitherto has been the loss of

power incurred in compressing air. As this loss is by the use of the above
method almost entirely eliminated, this method of transmitthig power will, it is
believed, compare favourably with any known method. The reason for the very

great ethciency obtained in compressing air (besides simplicity of the apparatus)
is that it is accomplished with hardly any heating, because the air during com-
pression (1) is surrounded by and is in contact with cold water in very large
quantities; (2) is compressed in a chamber which is washed inside and out a:
every stroke by large quantities of cold water ; and (3) metal surfaces similarly
cooled can be added in the midst of the air to any desired extent.

     5. On a Neiv Furm of Windmill. By Professoi- James Bltth, M.A.,

                     Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College.

     At the York meeting of the British Association Sir "William Thomson sug-
gested the construction of cheap windmills to run dynamos for charging accumu-
lators ; but, as i'ar as I know, no practical triiil was made till the summer of 1887,
when I erected my first electric windmill in the village of Marykirk in Kincardine-
«bire. At that time I procured a set of thirteen accumulators, and constructed a

windmill of the old English type, having four arms or whips and canvas sails. I

also tried various forms of wind-wheel of the American type, and all these I found
to answer very well so long as the wind had a moderate speed, but, like all other
experimenters with windmills, I soon found that they had either to be made self-
reefing or stopped altogether when a breeze came. This is obviously very unsatis-
factory, as the best of the wind for storage purposes is lost ; and hence this

--problem presented itself how to construct a windmill that would satisfy the

following requisites :

     1. It must be always ready to go.

     2. It must go without attendance for lengthened periods.

      a. It must go through the wildest gale, and be able to take full advantage of it.

A possible solution of the problem is presented in the liobinson Anemometer,

which consists of lour hemispherical cups attached to four arms and moving in a

horizontal plane about a vertical axis. From the theory of this instrument, which
is only, however, approximate, it appears that, whatever may be the speed of the

wind, the speed of the cups attained a certain terminal value, and that the
couple due to the wind-pressure was exactly equal to that produced by the resistance
of tbe motion through the air and the friction on the bearing. It immediately
follows that a large machine made on this principle is likely to have the same

property, and hence could be allowed to run without danger even in the strongest

breeze, and when doing no work.
     Last summer I erected a machine of this kind, which has been considerably

improved within the past three months. The cups are replaced by semi-cylindrical

boxes attached to four strong arms, each about 20 feet long. Two boxes are placed

on each arm with a narrow gap between. The diameter of the outer box is 6
feet and its height 10 feet, while the diameter of the inner box is 3 feet,
and its height 10 feet. The arms are fixed in metal sockets, which are
attached to a strong vertical shaft made of round iron five inches in diameter.^
The lower end of the shaft carries a massive pit wheel which actuates a train of
gearing, and drives a fly-wheel 6 feet in diameter with the requisite speed for a
dynamo, connected with it by a belt in the ordinary way. This machine works
very satisfactorily, and is at present being used to charge thirteen new E. P. S. cells.
 With a good wind I reckon that it gives about four horse-power. I have also
tested it in a strong gale by allowing it to run with no load, and the result was
perfectly satisfactory, as a safe terminal speed was attained and all racing avoided.
870 REPORT-- 1892.

Hence I think that electrical windmills, at least for small installations, are likely
to assume this form, as they require little or no attention. It is obvious, however,
that mills of great size and strength of this form may be constructed, and, if neees-
sarv, several could be placed in any well-exposed position, each having its own
dynamo and set of accumulators. Regarding the electrical connections, only a
word is necessary. The only thing needed is that the circuit be broken when the
dynamo is running at less than the storing speed. This is easily managed by
having a governor attached to the dynamo shaft which makes and breaks contact
in a mercury pool at the required speed. I have also tried a foi'm of governor
which throws a greater or lers number of cells into the charging circuit as the

wind varies, and in this way the machine is always doing some work.

G. Flexible MefaUic Tubing. Bij Gilbert R. Redgrave, As^oc.Inst.C.E.

     The author states that numerous etTorts have been made in recent times to
produce tubes of metal capable of being bent into any required form. The con-
ditions under which it becomes possible to obtain tlexibility in tubing are investi-
gated, and it is pointed out that this property depends upon a multiplicity of small
.segments or moving paits, securely jointed together, provision for movement being
made at the joints. In tubes of rigid metal various methods of forming these joints
are considered, and it is shown that success can best be obtained in tubes composed
of spirally wound strips or fillets of metal, which must be so disposed that the longi-

tudinal joint is not only sound, but is possessed of play or sliding power within
certain fixed limits. Owing to the great difficulty experienced in making a good
joint of metal against metal, all the earlier attempts to make a flexible joint de-
pended upon the presence of a strip of indiarubber inserted between the coils. In
con.sequence of the liability of indiarubber to deteriorate when employed in this
way, it became necessary to devise means to make a tight joint without rubber,
and this has now been accomplished. The new flexible metallic tubes are the in-
vention of Mons. E. Levavasseur, and he was led to the discovery by his successful
attempts to produce necklaces and bracelets of the well-known snake pattern. In
the first instance thise ornaments were manufactured by means of spirallv wound
strips of thin metal of two diHerent sections, so arranged that the joints produced by

the lower fillet were covered by a second fillet wound above it, thus, ^^r~L_ni_r~~.

At a later date Mons. Levavasseur manufactured similar objects by the use of a
single spirally wound fillet in the shape of the letter S, the coils being so disposed
that tht head of one S was clasped by the tail of the next, and from various modi-
fications in the form of the metal strip many beautiful and flexible chains were thus
produced, some of them being subsequently passed beneath a hydraulic press and

flattened into an oval section. It will readily be understood that all these tubes

were relatively very small in size, and made no pretence of being perfectly tight.
About six years ago, however, the inventor, on obser\ ing the clumsy contrivances
to obtain flexibility in the hose used in Paris for watering the roads, was induced

to turn his attention to the fabrication of pipes or tubes of larger dimensions, and
this he at first attempted to do by employing the S section already used lor
jewelleiT, with the addition of a thin strip of indiarubber inserted along the joint.
Some very SQCcessful tubes were made in this way, but finding that the rubber
"was liable to become rapidly worn out, and that in certain cases it soon oxidised
or became useless, Mons. Levavasseur determined to prepare a tube in whicli

rubber could be dispensed with. To do this an entirely new section was designed,

--which may be described as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           double channel. In coiling this strip the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,

smaller notch fits into the larger one, and room is allowed for a certain amount
of play, so that a species of piston joint is obtained, as the small notch works
within the larger one in a very similar way to that in which the piston travels in
the cylinder. In tubes thus made, it becomes possible to omit the rubber and to
obtain a perfectly tight joint between the metal surfaces. The amount of play or
flexibility depends to some extent on the size of the pipe, the thickness of the

metal strip emploj'ecl, and the character of the section. The strips are rolled
between a series of molettes, which produce the reijuisite corrugation, much on
the same principle that the larger sections in iron and other metals are rolled in
the mill. IJecentl}', by an improvement in the processes of manufacture, it has
become possible to produce a flexible pipe in which the coils are soldered together
or otherwise united by a tight joint, as the tube is formed, and the flexibility is
obtained by the extension and compression of V-shaped folds in the metal. Statis-
tics are given of the strength of various tubes, m.any of the smaller sections having
withstood strains amounting to 2,000 lb. per square inch, and some account follows
of the industrial applications of flexible tubing and the numerous purposes in the
arts for which this invention may be applicable.

2. The Destruction of Lightning Protectors by recent Ilunieipal Legislation.

                              By W. H. Preece, F.lt.S.

     The immunity of private houses from being struck by lightning is very marked,
and this is considered to be due to the fact that the lead on our roofs and the iron
stack-pipes that drain these roofs, connected as they are together, ibrm admirable

lightning protectors. Any chare'e of atmospheric electricity which may fall upon

a house so protected is conveyed harmlessly away to the earth. Householders are
now required to remove these pipes from direct connection with the drains, and to
leave an air space between the end of the pipe and the grating of the drain. The

result is that the electric conduction of the pipe is broken, the stack-pipe ceases to
be a lightning protector, and houses are left exposed to the dangers of atmospheric

electricity.

     The remedy is very simple. The pipe need not be entirely cut away ; three-
fourths of its circular section may be removed for the distance required, and one-
fourth may be left to maintain the old electrical connection, or if the separation
has been effected, then the stack-pipe should be connected with the drain by a

wire or rod so as to restore a path for the charge to the earth.

     Householders are also now compelled to put up stack-pipes to ventilate their

soil-pipes, erecting above their roofs a metal tube Ibrming a prominent object,
exposed to the atmospheric charge, and terminating frequently in an earthenware
pipe on the first floor. They are thus liable to be struck by lightning without
ofl'ering any means of escape. They should be connected electrically with the
earth, either directly or indirectly, through the stack-pipes, which would then

make them sources of safety rather than of danger.

3. Secondarij Batteries ill use at the Central Telegraph Office, London, for

              Telegraphic Purposes. Bi/ W. H. Peeece, F.B.S.

     In a paper entitled ' The Use of Secondary Batteries in Telegraphy,' com-
municated to the British Association at the meetiug held at Montreal in 1884, an
account of a series of experiments was given whicli had been carried on during
the preceding twelve months to determine the suitability of secoadary batteries

for telegraphic purposes.

     Since that time the use of secondary batteries has been extended, and for the
past seven years they have been used to supply current to two large groups of
circuits, one group consisting of 110 single needles, and the other of 100 Morse
inkers and sounders.

     To provide a ready means of replacing the battery in case of failure, the leads
from the working and reserve cells, which are placed in the basement, are first led
up to the test-board in the instrument room, and there joiaed to a switch ; thence
the leads are again led to a test-board in the battery room, where the two groups
are split up into sub-groups of ten circuits each. The connections are made in
this manner for two reasons : first, for facilitating a change of a faulty battery, and
second, to prevent a general stoppage of the whole group in the event of a short
circuit at any of the instruments, tlie resistance of the leads between the instru-
ments and the subdividing connections in the basement beiug sulHcient to prevent
more than three amperes being taken from the battery by any one of the instru-
ments, even when a short circuit is on. To prevent any damage to the instruments

or risk of fire fuses are placed in the battery leads at each instrument.

     The circuits on the groups mentioned are all metropolitan, and are all,
approximately, of the same resistance, no equalising resistances being therefore
necessary. The current in each circuit ranges between seventeen and twenty

milliamperes.

     The E.M.F. for the single needles is twenty volts, ten cells positive and ten
cells negative, with earth in the centre. For Morse working the E.M.F. is

eighteen volts.

      In addition to these two groups another set of twenty-two cells has been in
use since 1889, supplying current for driving the motors of the Delany multiplex
distributors. Each of these motors requires a current of about -12 ampere, and
 there are ten of them at present driven from this source. Fuses are placed in the
 leads to each motor. There is no spare set for this work.

    A considerable extension of the accumulator system has recently been made,

 advantage being taken of the transfer of all the Continental service to the General

 Post Office building in St. Martin's-le-Grand. This transfer was made on
 October 17, 18!)1, and since that date the whole of the Continental circuits have
 been operated by currents from secondar}- cells.

      There are fifty-nine of these Continental circuits, and as they are of various
 lengths, some requiring repeaters in England, whilst others go direct to the
 Continent, a somewhat different arrangement has been adopted. In addition to
 these varying conditions it was found Impossible to use the same polarity in all
 countries, the German, Dutch, and Belgian lines taking positive, and the French

 negative.

      It was also necessary to provide an arrangement which would cause the stop-
 page of the minimum number of lines should a main fuse be burned or a battery

  fail.

      The fifty-nine lines are divided into four groups ; but as the force required for
 these long lines is 100 volts it is evident that the risks of allowing a dangerously
 heavy current passing out from the instrument to line, should it make earth neaV
 the sending station, are increased. To provide against this, resifitances of 100 volts
 are placed in the battery leads at each instrument, so that it is absolutely im-
 possible that more than one ampere can flow even with earth on the line close up
 to the instrument. Independent three-ampere fuses are also fitted to each instru-
 ment to prevent any damage to lines or instruments should the safety resistance

 be short-circuited.
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.  873

     As it is sometimes necessary to put repeaters in on the Englisli side of the
cable on some lines which nominally work direct to the Continent, the resistance
blocks on several of the instruments are wound to 1,000 ohms, and fitted with a
switch which enables either 100 ohms or 1,000 ohms to be inserted in the battery

circuit, and thus the current is kept constant. In addition to the independent
three-ampere fuses main fuses to break at ten amperes are placed on each group

of circuits in the accumulator room.
     All the coils are kept well charged, and the E.M.F. is not allowed to fall

T)eIow 1-95 volt per cell. Where spare or reserve sets are provided the charging
is carried on at any convenient time, and on those where no spare is in use the
charging is done at night, when the minimum disturbance is caused by the slight
increase of E.M.F. which is inseparable from simultaneous charging and working.

      Accumulators are also used for working the Paris telephone circuits. Their
E.M.F. is so constant that they are found to be eminently adapted for the

purpose.

     4. Power Transmission hij Alternating Current. Bij Gisbert Kapp.

     Some two years ago the municipal authoritier. of Cassel, in Germany,determined
to become purveyors of electric light, and to place the generating station on the
site of the waterworks pumping station, which is situated on the river Fulda, about
four miles from the town. The object in choosing this site was partly to bring

both undertakings under the same management, and so reduce administrative

expenses, but chiefly to utilise an existing turbine plant.

     Owing to the great distance between the generating station and the town, it

was necessary to work at high pressure and to use some system of transformation
in the town, whilst to make the best use possible of the existing power plant it was
necessary to combine with the supply some system of storage. This problem was
solved in a very successful manner by a German engineer, Herr Oskar von Miller,
who had been called in by the municipality to carry out the work. The plan

adopted by von Miller was briefly this. He determined to transmit power by

single phase alternating current from the generating station to a sub-station or
rather to two sub-stations in Cassel, and to use this power for the supply of direct

current on the three-wire system. At one of the sub-stations he established a
battery which is charged during the hours of light load, and assists the dynamos
during the hours of heavy load, so that the maximum power available shall suflice

for ;3,500-60-C.P. lamps wired.

     At the generating station are two 60 K.W. alternators, which can be used

singly or in parallel, and the current is transmitted through an underground con-
centric cable over a distance of about four miles to the sub-stations. The alterna-
tors are designed for a terminal pressure of from 2,000 to 2,200 volts, and the
loss of pressure in transmission, when both are working full power, is under 10 per

cent.

     Each sub-station contains an alternating continuous current transformer, con-
sisting of a 60 K.W. alternator, coupled with two continuous current dynamos, one
on either side. The latter machines are connected with each other and with the
mains in the usual way adopted in three-wire distribution. At one of the sub-
stations there is a battery, also arranged on the three-wire system. The mains

 throughout the district are coupled so that the battery sub-station can supply

current to the other sub-station through the town mahis. To start any one of the
two transformers it is only necessary to switch on the two dynamos which begin to
 work as motors, and, alter observing by a synchroniser that the speed of the
 alternator has reached the required amount, to close the high pressure alternating
current switch, when the alternator works as a motor supplying power to the two
 dynamos which are directly coupled to it. It will thus be seen that not only are
 the two alternators at the generating station worked in parallel, but also the two
 sub-station alternators erected in different parts of the town are worked iu parallel.

The dynamos are Brown's design and the alternators are my design, both made by

 the Oerlikon Engineering Works, but I must distinctly state that I can claim no

credit whatever for the Cassel installation; and that the whole credit for ihis
(probably the earliest) example of power transmission by alternating currents is due
to von Miller, who, at a time when most electricians were still in doubt as to the

possibility of parallel running, boldly laid down a plant, the success of which was

not only dependent on parallel running, but also on the economical and safe trans-
mission of power by single phase alternating current, using for this purpose the

ordinary type of alternator as made for lighting. The plant was started on May

15 last year, and has been working since then without a hitch.

    By the courtesy of Herr von Miller I am able to give the following readings of
the working of the battery sub-station taken at my request about a month ago.

Although at that time of the year the load is necessarily light the total efficiency
of the transformer, even if we neglect the correction due to lag, is satisfactory.

wheel is interposed between each electric motor and its corresponding driviiif
wheel in auch manner that they can all be thrown in and out of gear at the

pleasure of the driver.

     The electric motors, which are the most delicate part of the machine, are
carried on a platform supported by the springs, and consequently are not subject to
the shocks caused by inequalities of the road.

     Another advantage of this type of engine is that it can be constructed of any
reasonable size, and maj' therefore be far in excess of the power of the largest
steam locomotive, wliich is limited by the size of the boiler. The dead weight
also of this engine would be considerably less in proportion to that of the steam
locomotive, as the tractive force is obtained by gripping the central rail, and not
by gravity. It is especially applicable to lines where the gradients are steep.

                6. Coin-counting Machine at the Royal Mint.

                         By Lieut. W. B. Basset, E.N.

    It was originally the practice to make up the bronze coinage when ready to be
sent out from the Mint into parcels of definite value after they had been ' told
lip ' by the scale in the manner well known to bankers, without actually counting
the number. This plan was, however, found to lead to uncertainty, since it

requires considerable accuracy to finish coins of exactly equal weight to each

other.

Although the average weight of bronze coins is correct it might occur that the

aggregate error in a parcel of 1,000 or 1,200 coins would amount to the weight of

several pence.

     In order to avoid this discrepancy it became necessary to count the bronze
coins instead of weighing them, the usual quantity contained in one bag being 51.
worth, or 1,200 pence.

    The counting has for many years been effected mechanically in two ways.
In the first method a man held beibre him a flat tray, of about 100 square inches
area, lined with a brass plate, this plate having in it a number of circular recesses,

each culpable of receiving and holding a coin. In this tray he placed a quantity

of coins, and after shaking them level he threw out the upper layer, leaving a

certain number of coins in the recesses of the plate. After filling up any recesses-

that might be vacant he inverted the tray, allowing the coins, which would be of

a known number, to fall out. The operation was then repeated. This method is

rather slow and laborious, although very certain, and a step in advance was taken

by the construction of a machine having a thin steel plate, rotated by hand, with

Aholes in it disposed in two circles.  tube or hopper is fixed over each circle of

holes, with its mouth just clear of the rotating plate, and these tubes are tilled up

with coins lying flat on each other, thus feeding themselves into the holes in the

plate as it revolves, and dropping out before completing a revolution. The machine

is stopped by an automatic catch as soon as the plate has revolved a certain

number of times. These machines, which were constructed by Messrs. James

Watt & Co., of Birmingham, are still in use, and have worked well for a number

of years ; but a certain amount of trouble and manual labour are required to keep
up the supply of coins to the feeding tubes, and the machine which is the subject
of this paper has been designed to work with less labour on the part of the

attendants than was formerly the case, as well as ensure a greater rapidity.
     This machine has now (July 1892) been working at the Eoyal Mint for six

months with satisfactory results. It is capable of counting pence at the rate of

tifty per second, or 3,000 per minute, or four bags, each worth 6/., in about one
and a half minute, which corresponds to one ton of copper coinage in forty-five

minutes.

The machine consists of four separate counters, each of which can be worked

independently of the other three. They are placed in pairs, two on the right hand

and two on the left, upon a platform or stage, so as to allow head room for an

attendant below, thus economising floor space. The coins are brought in a quantity
876 EEPORT-- 1892.

of a ton at a time upon a trolly, and are contained in bags of half a hundredweight

each. Four of these bags are placed upon the cage of a lift, which raises them

automatically to such a position that two attendants above can remove them to

Hat tables, one on each side, upon v^bich they are emptied, and the coins, being

spread out, are fed down by hand to a slanting table, where they lie, one coin

deep, with their rims touching, a iiat superimposed cover preventing the possibility

of one coin overlapping another.

From this table they are allowed to move out one at a time, along a groove or

channel, the width of one coin, and, being inclined at an angle of 45°, they pass by

gravity between the edges of two driving wheels, which are actuated by an electro-

motor, and which grip the coins as they arrive, forcing them witli considerable

pressure along the groove. Each coin thus pushes the one in front of it, until they

reacli a wheel, which is so arranged thit its teeth fit into the spaces between the

coins, and which is driven round by the coins as they pass it. This is called the

counting wheel, since it shows by its revolutions the number of coins that have

been delivered. Wheels with teeth of diHerent pitch can be substituted for count-

in"' coins of different sizes.

The coins having thus registered themselves fall through a tube into a bag

placed at a convenient height from the tioor.

The counting wheel, above mentioned, i^ allowed to revolve until it has de-

livered a certain number of coins                                                                                                                             it is then stopped automatically, and at the same
                                                                                                                                                           ;

instant the driving wheels, higher up in the groove, are released I'roni acting upon

the coins, and cannot again bo brought into action until a lever is moved by an

attendant. In the meantime the bag containing 1,"200 pence, or 5/. worth, has been

removed, and a fresh bag substituted.

The principal advantage of this method of counting is that an intermittent

supply of coins does not atlect the accuracy of the count, since if the supply of

coins to the driving wheels ceases from any cause the only result is that the wheel

stops, and, until a fresh coin starts it, it remains stationary.

The machine at the Mint is capable of counting pence, halfpence, piastres,

half-piastres, and Hong Kong cents, and it counts on an average over two million

coins per month without error.

           7. Antifriction Materials for Bearings used without Ltihrlcants.

                       By KiLLiNGWORTH Hedges, M.hist.C.E.

     The use of oil as a lubricant in machines is to separate the rubbing parts so as
to prevent the interlocking of the metallic particles of the bearings. Heavy
lubricants effect this separation better than those of a more limpid kind, but
absorb more power.

     The actual composition of the metal forming the bearing makes little difference,
provided oil in sufficient quantity can be introduced. This is proved by the little
wear shown on the cast-iron bearings used for shafting. The use of oil involves
loss of power when the pressure per square inch on the bearing is very low,
Professor Coleman Sellers considering that even up to 50 lb. on the square inch
the viscidity of the unguent acts as a sensible retardant. Dry bearings, or those
in which no lubricant is required, although only recently introduced into modern
work, were probably the original type of bearings, as they were used in the

Eoman mill-stones found at Pompeii ' and up to the present day for all the bear-

ings in the Nubian water-wheels employed for irrigation work in Egypt. In the
present time bearings of stone, adamas, and glass have been tried, also a variety
of mixtures of plumbago, but none was so successful as the solid form of graphite

Abearing, which was often employed by millWrights for the footsteps of shafts.

modification has recently been reintroduced into the United States, where the
ktest form of dry bearing is composed of plumbago mixed with wood fibre and
pressed when in a moist condition into suitable moulds. This bearing has been

highly praised by the Committee of the Franklin Institute, who state that ' dry

bearings not only diminish the first cost of construction, but lessen the cost of
personal attention, and show a great saving in working cost.'

    Many experiments by the author led to the introduction of a material known

as carboid, composed of finely powdered carbon mixed with steatite, the mixture

having the advantages of plumbago as regards lubricating properties, but showing-

little sigDS of wear after tests extending to two years' constant use.

Professor Sellers finds that the coefficient of friction Avith the dry bearings he

experimented on was lower than with metal bearings as usually operated, and

points out the advantage they possess of having a constant frictional resistance

whether the bearing is run warm or cold, so that the friction can be provided for

in the power. Professor Unwin's experiments with carboid show that the co-

efficient is independent of the area of contact, and only increases if the temperature

becomes excessive, but not with increased pressure, and tends to diminish with

increased speed.

   --General Deductions. First cost of a dry bearing used for shafting or ordinary

machinery is less than with the usual brass or patent metal bearing, and, besides,

the economy shown by the absence of lubricants, there is saving in the wa^es-

required for oiling and cleaning ; and in trades where unskilled labour is employed

the risk of  oiling machinery in  motion  is  entirely obviated                                                                                 also in mills the drip

    Applications of Carboid. Up to the present time these have been principally

for shafting and the bushing of loose pulleys; also for steam-heated rolls such

as are used in cloth factories and paper mills. It has been shown experimentally

that it can be adapted for use in axle-boxes of tramway cars and for ligbt rollino-

stock generally, the existing brass being either replaced or a carboid liner

cemented in.

8. Notes on the Design of Steam Generators especially wlapted for High
          Pressures.^ By B. II. Thvvaite, G.E., F.G.S., of Liverpool.

     The increasing and laudable desire of engineers to obtain a higher efficiency
from their thermo-dynamic motors and steam-generating equipment has directed
attention more particularly to the defects and large margin for improvement in the
steam generators of the Cornish, Lancashire, and Marine types.

     These types the author, in bis analysis, unavoidably condemns, and shows that
in their design eflects of a thermo-chemical and thermo-physical nature, of high
importance, are ignored. These effects, he explains, are responsible for the reduc-
tion of the strength integrity of the joints, and consequent safety of the steam
boiler, and cause structural defects and weakness, requiring constant attention.

     The irregular method of heat application in these internal flue-boilers, specified,.
is criticised, and the result of careful tests in this connection are recorded.

     The author formulates a series of axioms that he considers should be respected
by the designers of steam-generators, but especially those requiring to withstand

very high-working pressures.
     The author submits designs of high-pressure safety steam-generators, in which

the formulated canons of design of a perfect steam-generator are applied as far as

practicable.

    The designs submitted are boilers constructed by Messrs. Clark, Chapman &

Co., Gateshead, and are of the class known as the tubular type, designed so as to-

permit the highest pressures to be obtained with safety and with comparatively
light metallic proportion of constructional parts.

     Smokeless combustion arrangements are described, and methods by which
perfect erosive or scale removal circulation is established, and also arrangements
by which a certain flexibility of heating surface is obtained, so as to permit of free-

dilatation or expansion of the transmitting elements of the steam generator.

                     9. The Strength of Small Chains.
              Bij Professor H. Hele-Shaw, M.Inst.C.E.

The autlior has frequently found the result of using small chaiu most unsatis-

factory.

     In the tirst place, no small chain which he has been able to procure seemed to
give a reasonable amount of strength in proportion to its weight and the tensile

strength of the material.

     In the second place, no maker will usually give any guarantee of strength

-- --below a certain size generally f ths of an inch although in some special cases

makers will guarantee the strength as low as \ inch.
     Below xijflis of an inch no strengths are ever quoted in textbooks, engineering

pocket-books, or books of engineering reference.

     The results are then given of an examination of various well-known books

concerning this subject.

     From these data, which are not very satisfactory in themselves, it is seen that

there are no results for chain of less than ^\, inch diameter ; whereas enormous
quantities of chain under this size are made and sold.

     Recently a numerous series of tests on the strength of small chaiu have been
made in the Walker Engineering Laboratory. Tbese tests include all sizes of

chain up to \ inch diameter that could be obtained either in shops or from whole-

sale makers.

The result of these tests is given in five table-, under the following heads :

Table I., Single Jack ;  Table II., Double  .Tack :    Table III., Ordinary  Welded
                                                                                                                   ;

Table IV., Triumph (American) ; Table V., Miscellaneous (Brazed and Odd-size

Welded).

In every size three tests of ultimate strength were made, the results of which,

in lbs., have been recorded, the average being given in another column, These

tables of results have been plotted in a diagram exhibited, giving the areas in

square inches as absciss.T and the strength in lbs. as ordinates. It will be seen

that the want of uniformity in results is sufficient to explain why no values for
strength are given b)' the makers, and why the recorded results in books difler so

much. Nevertheless there is sufficient agreement to justify the following rules

being used to give an approximate idea of strength, tliougb, of course, for working

purposes a large factor of saft^ty must be employed :

              Let P = Working strength in lbs.
                       A = Area in square inches.

                         C = Constant.
              Then V = C A.

--The constants are as follows:

              Kind of Chain                                 C

              (I) Single Jack. . . .1x10^

              (L') Double Jack      10<x. . . :i

              (4) Triumph        .  .       .          . 10 x 10*

These results are easily remembered, and, as was seen from the lines drawn

on the diagram representing the formula!, give values well below the average

-- --strength, and may fairly be taken with the proper factor of safety' say 4 as the

working strength of the chain.

The chief elTect to be noticed is the extraordinary strength of the new Ameri-

can chain, which, on an average, is twice as strong lor every corresponding tize as

the English Welded Chain ;  five times as strong as    the  Double  Jack  Chain and
                                                                                                             ;

nearl)' eleven times as strong as the Single Jack Chain; and, in most cases, gave

way, not as in the case of the Jack Chain and Welded Chain at the joints, but

in the material itself.

   A further experiment was made of twisting a piece of iron wire into the form

of the American link, and then testing the link and afterwards the wire itself,
--

TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                                 870

when it was found that the strength of the link was abo-t IJ time the streng-th

of a single section of the iron wire from which it was made.

     The author understands that this chain is not yet marijifactured in this coiintrv,

but steps are being taken to introduce tlie machines necessary for the purpose.
Specimens of various kinds of chain were exhibited to the Section.

    The author acknowledges the assistance of Mr. W. E. Kerslake, Assistant

Lecturer in the Walker Engineering Laboratoiies, ia making the tests and

preparing the diagrams.

              By Daviu a. Stevexsox, B.Sc, F.Il.S.E., M.L'st.C.E.

     The paper points out the growing necessity and importanc:' of fog signals on our
coast. Details are then gi^en of the duration of fog in this country, the maxi-

mum number of hours in Scotland being .305 hours per aunum.

     The most powerful sound signal in use is stated to ha^e been found by experi-
ment and practice to be the ' Siren,' actuated bj^ compressed air. The various
motors are then described ; namely, motion of sea by waves and tide, manual
labour, clockwork, steam engines, hot-air engines, gas engines, and oil engines.
Examples of each are given in detail, and their relative advantages and disadvan-
tages discussed. In conclusion the author states in his view the best motor for
fog signal purposes yet tried is undoubtedly the oil engine, and concludes by point-
ing out how feeble and unreliable at their best are, and must be, fog signals which
appeal to the ear, and states that, in his opinion, the solution of the matter will
probably be found in the adoption of some such method as that recently proposed
by Mr. Charles A. Stevenson, namely, an electric cable or conductor laid down oft'
a coast or danger, so as to act on an instrument attached to each vessel, and so
warn the sailor of his proximity to it, and therefore to the coast or danger.

3. On the Progress of the Dioptric Lens as nsfd. in Li.jhthouse Illumination,
             By Charles A. Stevenson, B.Sc, F.B.S.E., M.Inst.G.E.

Fresnel, in 1820, devised and constructed a lens for first -order lights of 920 mm.

focal distance. It was composed of a central lens, with refracting prisms con-

centric with it, which gradually decreased in breadth as they I'eceded from the

centre. The separate pieces of which these lenses were made up were cemented

together and mounted in metallic frames 30 inches square.

In 1835 the late Mr. Alan Stevenson introduced the Fresnel apparatus into

Great Britain. In doing so he made several improvements, one of which was that

he increased the height of the lens from 30 to 39 inches. This refractor had eight

prisms above and eight prisms below the central lens. Since that time Alan

Stevenson's lens was almost universally used until a comparatively recent date,

Awhen a revolution in the size of lenses took place.  few years ago inventors were

trying to obtain greater power by increasing the diameter and volume of the

flames ; but Messrs. Stevenson pointed out, in 1869, that after a certain point an

increase of diameter of the luminary not accompanied by a corresponding increase

of the radius of the apparatus was a mistake, as the light became exfocal and

hence divergent, and that the proper way to secure greater power was to enlarge

the diameter of the apparatus. In 1885 they had a lens made to their design of
                                                               --

],330 mm. focal distance, and a height of 5 feet. This lens, which was named

' hyper-radiant,' was tried at the South Foreland against other lenses, and with a
large ten-ring gas burner it was found to give a light from one and a half to twice
as intense as the ordinary lenses which were pitted against it with the same large
burners in their foci, thus proving conclusively that to get the power out of large
burners it was imperatively necessary to increase the diameter of the apparatus.

In 1883 Messrs. Stevenson got an otl'er from Messrs. Barbier for a lens of 1,840 mm.

Jocal distance.
      All refracting lenses from the day of Alan Stevenson were cylindrical for fixed

lights, and plano-convex for revolving lights, and no alteration of any moment has
been made in the mode of their construction until 1886, when, instead of making
the lenses cylindrical or plano-convex, I proposed to give them a spherical form

 that is to say, circular not only in the horizontal but also in the vertical section.

This design was carried into practice in the apparatus for one of the Fair Isle
lighthouses. The introduction of the spherical refractor has made practicable the
construction of very much larger and, consequently, more powerful apparatus, and
occupyins: much less space both in the daylight size and diameter of lantern. It
 has rendered practicable the qiiadrilateral arrangement with hyper-radiant lenses
which have already been erected at Fair Isle, the lenses being cut so as to give two

·flashes from each side of the quadrilateral. An experimental one, made for Mr.

AVigham, is to be tried in Ireland. It is 2 m. focal distance, and the spherical
refractor is 7 ft. 6 in. in diameter, and will give one flash from each side of the
quadrilateral. The vspherical refractor should not be carried too lar above the focal
plane, and equiangular prisms should then be employed.

    A5. System of Purifying the SnioJcefrom Domestic and other Fires.

                                   By Colonel E. Duliek.

      This process consists in mixing the smoke as it leaves the flue with a small
quantity of steam, generated in a boiler forming part of the kitchen range.

      The mixed steam and smoke pass into an open chamber, the top part of
which is provided with a number of pipes, placed in the direction of the prevailing
wind, through which the air passes and helps to cool the gases. At the extreme
top of this chamber, just before passing into the atmosphere, the gases are met by
 a very fine shower of water issuing from minute holes in a pipe.

      The result of this treatment is a very thorough washing of the smoke, and the
 almost complete removal of all solid matters (soot and dust) and a large proportion
of the sulphurous acid always present in coal smoke. The removal of the soot and
dust is so perfect that a piece of wet cotton held in the issuing gases remains
 perfectly white even after a lengthened exposure.

     The amount of steam required is small, and may be neglected in an estimate of
the cost of working the process, as it is generated by means of heat which would
not otherwise be available for any useful purpose. The only item of cost to
consider is that of water. The amount used in the apparatus at Sloane Gardens is

found to be about ten gallons per hour ; this includes the condensed water from the
 steam.

      This apparatus treats the smoke from a large kitchen range burning about
 20 lb. of coal per hour, but it is capable of treating the smoke from several such
tires. It is important to notice that the draught is not sensibly impaired by the
 apparatus, any slight retarding of the flow of the gases being more than com-
 pensated by the action of the jet of steam.

      The results of a number of experiments with the apparatus at atmospheric
temperatures varying from 92° Fahr. (33°-3 C.) in the shade (part of the time the
apparatus was exposed to direct sunshine) to 50° Fahr. (10° C.) showed that

almost the whole of the soot was removed and a considerable proportion of the

sulphurous acid.

    It may be mentioned that the apparatus is exceedingly ^^imple to work, bein"

in fact almost automatic.

6. The London Sewage Q^iestion. By Cbawfokd Barlow, B.A., M.I.G.E.

     The following obaervations and suggestions are made on the assumption that
the recommendations of the joint report of Sir B. Baker and Mr. Binnie are car-
ried out. This report advises that two new intercepting sewers shall be con-
 structed, one north and the other south of the Thames, which are to discharo-e at
the present outfalls ; and it suggests that a decision in respect to the question of

disposal shall be postponed until the present arrangements have been tested.

    A considerable reduction of the difficulties will be effected if the volume of the

liquid to be dealt with is reduced, say, by conveying some of the rain direct to the
river. Suggestions of somewhat similar character have been alreadv considered
and condemned on account of the great cost and interference with private property,
but an arrangement whereby a partial separation of rain from sewage (to be
accomplished by conducting the rain off roads, open spaces, squares, parks, public
buildings, &c., direct to the river) would, while being effective, avoid these objec-

tions.

      There are certain old sewers which were constructed in times past in the
valleys and hollows, and were made of large dimensions, so as to be able to convey

--the flood waters to the river before the main drainage system was designed.
      Five of these the Eanelagh, the King's Scholars Pond, and the Fleet on the

--north side of the Thames, the Falcon and the Eflra on the south are capable of

discharging large volumes of liquid, and, in fact, are the ones which now chiefly

relieve the main drains in times of heavy rains.

     To utilise these for carrying off ram water only, intercepting sewers could be
constructed on each side of them, to be connected with the nearest main drainage
sewers, and the rainfall from all the neighbouring streets could be conveyed by
small conduits into these great carriers, and so direct to the river. Also new con-

duits could be constructed for taking off rain water only to the river.

     The great advantage of such an arrangement is, that the liquid so conveyed
would involve no further expense, whereas if the same liquid were conveyed by
intercepting sewers to the outfalls it would, in consequence of its mixture with
sewage, have to be chemically treated, and the resulting sludge removed.

   --The main objection to the present system is the discharge of sewage into the

river either by storm overflows or in the form of effluent or sludge.

     The diy weather quantity of sewage is given at the present time as 180,000,000
gallons per diem, but when the proposed new intercepting drains are completed the
total amount of sewage discharge at Barking and Crossness will be close upon
300,000,000 gaUous per diem, and the resulting effluent must produce most dis-

astrous results to the river for miles on each side of the outfalls.

     The amount of sludge is at the present time 40,000 tons per week, but when
these new arrangements come into operation it will be increased to 70,000 tons (of
which 7,000 tons is absolutely solid matter), and the deposition of this amidst the
sandbanks at the mouth of the Thames will most assuredly affect the width, depth,

and position of the navigable channels there, and thereby cause obstruction to the

navigation, with the great probability of deposits of sewage mud being formed on

all the shoals and shores in the neighbourhood.

    In dealing with this question neither Londoners nor the many other persons who

are interested in the sanitary condition of the river shotild pennit the London County
Council to depart in any way from the recommendations of the lloyal Commission
of 1884, that is to say, that they shall not allow them to discharge any effluent
into the river nearer London than Hole Haven, or to deposit sludge anywhere ex-
cept in the open sea ; and as these conditions will involve an enormous expense
fresh considerations should be given to a land treatment, especially as Berlin,

882 BEPORT-- 1892.

Paris, and many other cities have adopted this method (and according to the latest

accounts) with great success.
     Land treatment would be best effected by pumping up the sewage from the

north side at Abbey Mills to an elevation of about 50 or 60 feet above ordnance
datum, and conveying it by a conduit passing along the contour ; an area of land
of over 50,000 acres would be thus available for the selection of farms. The
termination of this conduit might be made either at Hole Haven or at some con-
venient place on the river Crouch, and there such liquid as was not used on the
land could be disposed of either chemically or in any other manner thought advis-

able.

     It is to be borne in mind that if a portion of the rain is carried direct to the
river, as has been suggested, the liqiiid in the sewers will be less in quantity and not
so variable, whilst it will be more concentrated, and hence better suited for placing
on laud.

     In Sir B. Baker's and Mr. Binnie's report one of the suggestions for the future
alleviation of the discharge of sewage into the Thames at the present outfalls is the
construction of a new outfall sewer from Barking to Shell Haven.

     If some modification were made in the laying out of this, it could be arranged
for a commencement of a land treatment.

    The London ratepayers are not so much aSected by the unsanitary condition
of the river as other persons and interests outside the boundary of the London
County Council's jurisdiction ; consequently it would seem that the London sewage

system should be controlled by a trust or corporation which should include
representatives of all the different and various interests which are affected by the
disposal of the London sewage ; such as the ratepayers of Loudon (represented by
the London County Council), the traders, dockowners, shipowners, manufacturers
(represented by the Loudon Chamber of Commerce), and residents along the

shores of the river, and all who are affected by the sewage.
     With regard to the important question of ways and means, in addition to the

amount which the London County Council can procure from the ratepayers, a
further revenue might be obtained by taxing all persons, manufacturers, dock and,
ship owners who foul the river in any way. Such arrangement would doubly assist
to purify the Thames.

     8. On the Extinction of Fires in Ships' Holds. By H. C. Carver.

      It is pointed out in the paper that the conditions peculiar to fires in ships'
holds and on land respectively difi'er widely, and that methods of extinction
valuable in the one case are comparative!}' useless in the other. Examples of this

are cited.

     It is practicable to establish throughout a ship's hold a plenum of an artificial
atmosphere deadly to fire ; and if such a plenum be maintained long enouo-h to

allow the heated materials of a fire to cool down to below their temperature of
ignition, the fire peril will be subdued with certainty. Unless, however, a plenum

of the artificial atmosphere be maintained, there is danger of fresh air leakin"- into
the hold, and keeping the fire alive.

     Numerous plans have been devised for putting into ships' holds fire-annihilatino-
gases, produced by chemical reaction, in quantities altogether insufficient for esta-

blishing a plenum. It appears to the author that such plans are unsatisfactorv,
not only owing to the failure to produce a plenum in the holds, but also because
shipowners would be unwilling to have their vessels constantly burdened with a
supply of special reagents large enough to yield a continuous production of gas for
days together.

    Owing to these objections, the author thinks that the efficient protection of
vessels against hold fires by the injection of an artificial atmosphere would be,

commercially speaking, impracticable, were there no means, other than the
employment of special chemical reagents, available for the purpose.

     Fortimately, in steamers at least, there are other means, always ready to hand,
which meet the requirements quite satisfactorily. For the boiler furnace fumes

are a fire-annihilating medium ; and the volume of these, flowing to waste from a
steamer at sea, is largely in excess of what is required for maintaining a plenum in

a hold.

    An apparatus applicable to steamers is described, for abstracting a sufficient

quantity of furnace fumes from their ordinary passages to the air, for cooling the
fumes by water to a temperature of 80° to 90° Fahr., and for forcino- them"into
the holds through pipes. The apparatus has no moving parts, and is set in action
by merely turning on three valves.

     The character of the apparatus, the unfailingness of the fumes supply, and the
efficacy of the fumes against fire combine to render the system a thoroughly

dependable one.

     The apparatus is so arranged that it can also be used for rapidly ventilatino- a

hold in an emergency.

                                                                                                                                          3 L2
884 KEPORT-- 1892.

     Tugs aud salvage steamers can be fitted with the apparatus to protect other

vessels in port.

     Sailing vessels not haviii;r donkey boilers require a modified type of the
apparatus, embracing a furnace in which to burn coal for the production of fumes.

     Examples are cited of the employment of furnace fumes in extinguishing fires.
     Allusion is made to the frequent practice of using steam against fires in steamers'
holds, and the author states his views regarding the capabilities of this system,

arguing that, though it is of great value in many cases, it cannot be relied on with

certainty.

                9. On a new Form of Steam Brake for Locomotives.
                                 By William Cross, O.E.

     It is not known who was the originator of the plan of fitting a small steam

cylinder to relieve and as ust the fireman in the hard manual labour of ' setting the
brakes/ but so obvious a device was scarcely likely to have escaped attention even
in the early days of locomotive engineering. Though the arrangement was ex-

ceedingly simple aud powerful it was soon found to possess many grave disadvan-

tages, the chief of these being the difficulty of properly graduating the action so as

to pull up the train steadily without jerk, and the impossibiUty of keeping an even
pressure in the cylinder for any length of time as required vvhen descending long
grades. Various forms of reducing valves have been tried from time to tiine, but
to the best of the writer's knowledge none of these has proved very satisfactory
or reliable in practice. For these reasons it was found the fireman always pre-
ferred to use the hand brake, on the action of which he could rely, only using the
steam brake in cases of emergency, with the then great probabiUty of either being
too late to be of any service, or of its not working properly on account of disuse.

     It seemed to the writer tliat the only way to make a steam brake of real value
would be to fit it in such a way that the men were compelled to use it every time
they applied the hand brake, and to make its action coincide with that of the latter
in such manner that the further the handle was pulled round, the harder the
steam brake would go on, and vice versa.

     The practical way Jin which this idea is carried out consists in arranging a

floating lever or hunting screw between the usual vertical rod of the hand brake
and th'e valve controlling the steam supply of the steam brake cylinder in such a

way that, as the man commences to turn the handle to put on the hand-brake, he

admits steam to the brake cylinder ; but the piston of the latter, so soon as it com-

mences to move, cuts oft' its own supply through the agency of the floating lever.

If, therefore, he continues to turn the handle, the piston moves in exact accordance

with it until the maximum available steam pressure is reached ; if he now still

continues to turn, the hand brake comes into action in the ordinary manner, and
this latter also takes place if the steam, were altogether shut oS' from the brake

cylinder at the boiler.

     The action thus nearly resembles that used in steam steering gear, gun training
gear, steam reversmg gear, &c., aud has been aptly described as ' making a thing
move two ways at the same time.'

    10. On a new Form of Gas Engine. By Joseph Day, A.il.Inst.C.E.

     For practical purposes it may be assumed that all gas engines are worked on
one of two systems or cycles, viz., that of Beau de Rochas, involving an impulse

every other revolution, and that under which an impulse is obtained at every
revolution. The former has been made so world-renowned by the Messrs. Crossley
that no long explanation is needed. Suffice it to say that in an engine constructed

upon this cycle the piston acts alternately as a pump and as a motor. The only

objection that can be urged against this system is that as only every other stroke of
the engine is available for useful work, the proportions and magnitude of the engine,
as compared with an engine doing work at each stroke, must be as 2 : 1.

      Further, there is the necessity for equalising the power thus intermittently

 given off by means of a heavy fly-wheel.
      Several attempts have been made to obtain a satisfactory engine upon the other

 cycle, viz., that nnder which impulse is obtained at every revolution. This result
 was accomplished by the old type of Stockport engine, by Mr. D. Clerk's engine,
 and others ; but in all these engines a second cylinder was provided in which a
 supplementary piston did the work alternately done by the working piston in

 the cycle first referred to.
       This led to complication and loss of efficiency, and the principle has, speaking-

 generally, been abandoned.
       "NMth the object of combining the advantages of both systems the writer

 developed and completed the engine now known as the ' Day ' gas engine.

      In this engine simplicity has been the pruicipal object sought, and it is difficult

to see how a gas engine could be made to work with simpler or fewer parts.

      The construction of the engine is as follows :
      The piston is of the trunk form, and through a connecting rod works on to the
crank pin. The crank works in an inclosed chamber, the crank shaft projecting

through a boss bearing, terminating in a gland.

     On the upward stroke of the engine it is obvious that a partial vacuum is
produced by the retreat of the piston, and this vacuum is taken advantage of to

induce a flow of gas and air, in controlled proportions, into the crank chamber
through an automatic reflex action valve. It is equally clear that on the down-

--ward movement of the piston the mixture thus introduced is compressed in
--practice, it is compressed to about 2 lb. to the inch and by this means ia

possessed of sufficient motive power to charge the working end of the cylinder.

--This is accomplished by the following device : C!ommunicating from the crank

chamber to the lower part of the working end of the cylinder is a port or passage,
and this is closed by the piston until the latter, at the end of its stroke, uucoA-ers
it. Immediately tlie gas mixture, being compressed as explained, flies up through
the passage and charges the cylinder ; the piston returns, closes the port, com-
presses the mixture in the usual way against an ignition tube, and an explosion
results, causing the descent of the piston. The exhaust of the waste products is
accomplished by the opening of a somewhat similar port communicating to the
atmosphere opposite the inlet port above described, which is opened by the piston
slightly in advance of the opening of the inlet port. Thus, when the incoming
charge is admitted, the explosion in the cylinder has been reduced to atmospheric
pressure. The incoming charge is made to assist in the clearance of the waste
products by its being diverted upwards by a fin on the top of the piston, and thus
setting up an eddying action, tending to drive out the contents of the cylinder
through the open exhaust port. Thus it will be seen that with one piston and
one cylinder an impulse is obtained at every revolution of the engine. It will also
be apparent that the engine will run with equal facility and efficiency in either

direction.

     The speed obtainable is very great, there being no tappets, cams, or levers,
and in a small engine as much as 1,100 revolution.^ per minute have been obtained.
At this speed firing was irregular, but at 500 revolutions the explosions were

absolutely regular.

     For the same reason the engine runs extremely quietly.
     The writer claims to have produced an engine

(1) With fewer working parts than any other.                   degree  of

(2) That occupies less .space.
(3) That without any alteration will run in either direction.

      The President delivered the following Address :

 On an irregular, and unfenced patch of waste land, situated on the outskirts of
 a small town in which I spent part of my boyhood, there stood a notice-board

Abearing the inscription ' Free Coup,' which, when translated into the language

 of the Southron, conveyed the intimation, ' rubbish maybe shot here.' This place,
 with its ragged mounds of unconsidered trifles, the refuse of the surrounding
 households, was the favourite playground of the children of the neighbourhood,
 who found a treasury of toys in the broken tiles and oyster-shells, the crockeiy
 and cabbage-stalks, which were liberally scattered around. Many a make-believe
 house and road, and even village, was constructed Iw these mimic builders out of
 this varied material, which their busy little feet had trodden down until its

 undulated surface assumed a foirly coherent consistence.
      Passing by this place ten years later I found that its aspect had changed

 terraces of small houses had sprung up, mushroom-like, on the unsavoury founda-
 tion of heterogeneous refuse. Still more recentlj' I notice that these in their turn
 have been swept away, and now a large factorj', wherein some of the most

 ingenious productions of human skill are constructed, occupies the site of the

 original waste.

      This commonplace history is, in a sense, a parable in which is set forth the
 past, present, and possible future of that accumulation of lore in reference to
 humanity to which is given the name Anthropology, and for the studj' of which

 this Section of our Association is set apart. At first nothing better than a heap of

 heterogeneous facts and fancies, the leavings of the historian, of the adventurer,
 of the missionary, it has been for long, and, alas ! is still, the favourite playground
 of dilettanti of various degrees of seriousness. But upon this foundation there ia
 rapidly rising a more comely superstructure, fairer to see than the original chaos,
 but still bearing marks of transitoriness and imperfection, and I dare hazard the
prediction that this is destined in the course of time to give place to the more solid

fabric of a real science of anthropology.

    We cannot yet claim that our subject is a real science in the sense in which

that name is applied to those branches of knowledge, founded upon ascertained
laws, which form the subjects of most of our sister Sections ; but we can justify
our separate existence, in that we are honestly endeavouring to lay a definite and
stable foundation upon which in time to come a scientific anthropology may be

based.

     The materials with which we have to do are fully as varied as were those in

my illustration, for we as anthropologists take for our motto the sentiment of

Chremes, so often quoted in this Section, hu7nani 7iihil a nobis alienum putamus,
and they are too often fully as fragmentary. The bones, weapons, and pottery
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                .887

which form our only sources of knowledge concerning prehistoric races of men,

generally come to us as much altered from their original forms as are the rusty
polyhedra which once were the receptacles for biscuits or sardines. The tradi-

tions, customs, and scraps of folk-lore which are treasures to the constructive
anthropologist are usually discovered as empty shells, in form as much altered
from their original conditions as are those smooth fragments of hoUow white

cylinders which once held the delicate products of the factory of Keiller or Cairns.
     I have said that anthropology has not yet made good its title to be ranked as

an independent science. This is indicated by the difficulty of framing a definition

at the same time comprehensive and distinctive. Mr. Galton characterises it as

the study of what men are in body and mind, how they came to be what they

are, and whither the race is tending ; General Pitt-Rivers, as the science which
ascertains the true causes for all the phenomena of human life. I shall not try to

improve upon these definitions, although they both are manifestly defective. On the
one side our subject is a branch of biology, but we are more than biologists compiUng

a monograph on the natiu-al history of our species, as M. de Quatrefages would

have it. Many of the problems with which we deal are common to us and to
psychologists others are common to us and to students of history, of sociology, of

                                                                           ;

philology, and of religion ; and, in addition, we have to treat of a large number of

other matters aesthetic, artistic, and technical, which it is difficult to range under

any subordinate category.
     In view of the encyclopaedic range of knowledge necessary for the equipment

of an accomplished anthropologist, it is little wonder that we should be, as we
indeed are, little better than smatterers. Its many-sided affinities, its want of

definite limitation, and the recent date of its admission to the position of an

independent brancli of knowledge have hitherto caused anthropology to fare badly

in our universities. In this respect, however, we are improving, and now in the

two great English universities there are departments for the study of tlie natural

history of man and of his works.
     Out of the great assemblage of topics which come within our sphere I can only

select a few which seem at present to demand special consideration. The annual
growth of our knowledge is chiefly in matters of detail which are dull to chronicle,
and the past year has not been fertile in discoveries bearmg on those great

questions which are of popular interest.

On the subject of the antiquity of man there are no fresh discoveries of serious

Myimportance to record.  esteemed predecessor at the Leeds meeting two years

ago, after reviewing the evidence as to the earliest traces of humanity, concluded

his survey with the judgment, ' On the whole, therefore, it appears to me that the

present verdict as to 'Tertiary man must be in the form of " Not Proven."' Sub-

sequent research has not contributed any new facts which lead us to modify that

finding. The most remarkable of the recent discoveries under this head is that of

the rude implements of the Kentish chaUi-plateau described by Professor Prest-

wich ; but while these are evidently of archaic types, it must be admitted that

there is even yet room for dift'erence of opinion as to their exact geological age._

Neither has the past year's record shed new light on the darkness which

enshrouds the origin of man. What the future may have in store for us in the

way of discovery we cannot forecast ; at present we have nothmg but hypothesis,

and we must still wait for further knowledge with the calmness of philosophic

expectancy.

     I may, however, in this connection refer to the singularly niteresting observa-
tions of Dr. Louis Robinson on the prehensile power of the hands of children at
birth, and to the graphic pictures with which he has illustrated his paper. Dr.
Robinson has drawn, from the study of the one end of life, the same conclusion
which Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson deduced from the study of his grandfather,

that there still survive in the human structure and habit traces of our probably

arboreal ancestry.

    Turning from these unsolved riddles of the past to the survey of mankmd as it

mappears to us in the present, we are confronted that wide range of outlook with

many problems well-nigh as difficult and obscure.
888 REPOET-- 1892.

Mankind, whenever and however it may have originated, appears to us at

present aa an assemblage of tribes, each not necessarily homogeneous, as their

component elements may be derived from diverse genealogical lines of descent.

It is much to be regi-etted that there is not in our literature a more definite

nomenclature for these divisions of mankind, and that such words as race, people,

nationality, tribe, and type are often used indiscriminately as though they were

synonyms.

In the great mass of knowledge with which we deal there are several collateral

series of facts, the terminologies of which should be discriminate^d. In the first

place there are those ethnic conditions existing now, or at any other point in time,

whereby the individuals of manldnd are grouped into categories of different com-

prehension, as clans or families, as tribes or groups of allied clans, and as nations,

the inhabitants of restricted areas under one political organisation. This side of

our subject constitutes ethnology.

In the second place, the individuals of mankind may be regarded as the

descendants of a limited number of original parents, and consequently each person

has his place on the genealogical tree of humanity. As the successive branches

became in their dispersion subjected to the influences of diverse environments, they

have eventually differentiated in characteristics. To each of these subdivisions

of the phylum thus differentiated the name race may appropriately be restricted,

and the sum of the peculiarities of each race may be termed race-characters.

This is the phylogenetic side of anthropology, and its nomenclature should be

kept clearly separate from that of the ethnological side. The great and growing

literature of anthropology consists largely of the records of attempts to discover

and formulate these distinctive race-characters. Race and tribe may be terms of

equal extension, but the standpoint from which these categories are viewed is

essentially different in the two eases.

There is yet a third series of names in common use in descriptive anthropology.

The languages in use among men are unfortunately numerous, and as the com-

ponent mdividuals in each community usually speak a common language, the

mistake is often made of confounding the tribal name with that of the tribal

language. Sometimes these categories are co-extensive ; but it is not always so,

for it is a matter of history that communities have been led to adopt new languages

from considerations quite independent of phylogenetic or ethnic conditions. These

linguistic terms should not be confoimded with the names in either of the other

myseries, for, as  learned predecessor once said in a presidential address, it is as

absurd to speak of an Aryan skull as it would be to say that a family spoke a

brachycephalic language.

In the one clan there may be, by intermarriage, the representatives of different

races ; in the one nation there may be dissimilar tribes, each derived by composite

lines of ancestry from divergent phyla, yet all speaking the same language.

   We have an excellent illustration of the confusion resulting from this disregard

of precision in the case of the word Celtic, a tenn which has sometimes been

employed as an ethnic, sometimes as a phylogenetic, and sometimes as a linguistic

species. In the last-named sense, that to which I believe the use of the name

should be restricted, it is tlie appropriate designation of a group of cognate languages

spoken by peoples whose physical characters show that they are not the descendants
of one common phylum in the near past. There are fair-haired, long-headed

families in Scotland and Ireland :  fair, broad-headed  Bretons                                  dark-haired, round-
                                                                                              ;

--headed Welshmen ; and dark-haired, long-headed people in the outer Hebrides,

McLeans, ' Sancho Panza type ' men obviously of different races, who differ not

only in colour, stature, and skull-form, but whose traditions also point to a com-

posite descent, and yet all originally speaking a Celtic tongue. The use of the
word Celtic as if it were the name of a phylogenetic species has naturally led to

--hopeless confusion in the attempts to formulate race-characters for the Celtic

skull confusions of a kind which tend to bring physical anthropology into dis-

credit. Thus Eetzius characterises the Celtic crania as being dolichocephalic, and

compares them with those of the modern Scandinavians. Sir Daniel Wilson

considers the true Celtic type of skull as intermediate between the dolichocephaU

                                                                                                                      i

and the brachycephali ; and Topinard figures as the typical Celtic skull that of an

Auvergnat, extremely brachycephalic, with an index of 85 !

Our traditional history tells that we, the Celtic-speakino: races of Britain, are

not of one common ancestry, hut are the descendants of two distinct series of

immigrants, a British and a Gaelic. Whatever may have been the origin of the

former, we know that the latter are not homogeneous, but are the mixed

descendants of the several Fomorian, Nemedian, Firbolg, Tuatha de Danaau, and

Milesian immigrations, with which has been combined in later times a strong

admixture of Scandiiiavian blood. It is now scarcely possible to ascertain to

which of these component strains in our ancestry we owe the Celtic tongue which

overmastered and supplanted the languages of the other tribes, but it is strictly in

accordance with what we know of the history of mankind that this change should

Wehave taken place.  have instances in modern times of the adoption by conquered

tribes of the language of a dominant invading people. For example, Mr. Hale has

lately told us that the speech of the Hupas has superseded the languages of those

Californian Indians whom they have subdued. In like manner, nearer home,

the English language is slowly but surely supplanting the Celtic tongues them-

selves.

   We may here parenthetically note that what has been observed in the case of

language has also taken place in reference to ritual and custom. Observances

which have a history and a meaning for one race have, in not a few instances, been

adopted by or imposed upon other races to whom they have no such significance,

and who in incorporating them give to them a new local colour. These pseudo-

morplis of the earlier cultures are among the most perplexing of the problems

which the student of comparative religion or folk-lore has to resolve.

But we want more than a perfect nomenclature to bring anthropology into range

Wewith the true sciences.  need a broader basis of ascertained fact for inductive

reasoning in almost all parts of our subject ; we want men trained in exact method

who will work patiently at the accumulation, verification, and sorting of facts, and

Wewho will not prematurely rush into theory.  have had enough of the untrained

writer of papers, the jerry-builder of unfounded hypotheses whose ruins cumber our

field of work.

The present position of our subject is critical and peculiar ; while on the one

hand the facilities for anthropological research are daily growing greater, yet in

Wesome directions the material is diminishing in quantity and accessibility.  are

accumulating in our museums treasures both of the structure and the works of man,

classified according to his distribution in time and space ; but at the same time

S'ome of the most interesting tribes have vanished, and others are rapidly disap-

pearing or becoming fused with their neighbours. As these pass out of existence

we, with them, have lost their thoughts, their tongues, and their traditions ; for

even when they survive, blended with other races, that which was a religion has

become a fragmentary superstition, then a nursery tale or a child's game, and is

destined finally to be buried in oblivion. The unifying influences of commerce,

aided by steam and electricity, are eifectuaUy effacing the landmarks between

people and people, so that if we are to preserve in a form fit for future use the

shreds which remain of the myths, folk-lore, and linguistic usages of many of the

tribes of humanity, we must be up and doing without delay. It is on this account

that systematic research such as that which Mr. Risley has advocated with regard

to the different races of India is of such pressing and urgent importance. It is for

this reason likewise that we hail with pleasure the gathering of folk-lore while yet

it survives, and welcome such societies for the purpose as the Folk-lore Congress

recently inaugurated.
      I have said that in the department of physical anthropology our facilities for

research are increasing. The newly founded anthropometric laboratories are

beginning to bring forth results in the form of carefully compiled statistical tables,
embodying the fruits of accurate observations, which are useful as far as they go.
W'ere these extended in their scope the same machinery might easily gather parti-
culars as to the physical characters of the inhabitants of different districts, which
would enable the anthropologist to complete in a systematic manner the work

which Dr. Beddoe has so well begun. I would commend this work to the

consideration of the provincial university colleges, especially those iu outlying

districts.

     Of all the parts of the human frame, the skull is that upon which anthro-

pologists have in the past expended the most of their time and thought. "We have

now, in Great Britain alone, at least four collections of skulls, each of which includes
more than a thousand specimens, and in the other great national and university
museums of Europe there are large collections available for study and comparison.

Despite all the labour that has been bestowed on the subject, craniometric

literature is at pi-esent as unsatisfactory as it is dull. Hitherto observations have
been concentrated on cranial measurements as methods for the discrimination of

the skulls of different races. Scores of lines, arcs, chords, and indexes have been

devised for this purpose, and the diagnosis of skulls has been attempted by a pro-

cess as mechanical as that whereby we identify certain issues of postage-stamps
by counting the nicks in the margin. But there is underlying all these no unify-
ing hypothesis, so that when we, in our sesquipedalian jargon, describe an Austra-

lian skull as microcephalic, phsenozygous, tapehio-dolichocephalic, prognathic,

platyrhine, hypselopalatine, leptostaphyline, dolichuranic, chamaeprosopic, and

microseme, we are no nearer to the formulation of any philosophic concept of the

general principles which have led to the assumption of these characters by the
cranium in question, and we are forced to echo the apostrophe of Von Torok,
' Vanity, thy name is Oraniology.'

     It was perhaps needful in the early days of the subject that it should pass
through the merely descriptive stage but the time has come when we should seek

                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

for something better, when we should regard the skull not as a whole complete in

itself, nor as a crystalline geometrical solid, nor as an invariable structure, but as a

marvellously plastic part of the human frame, whose form depends on the co-opera-

tion of influences, the respective shares of which in moulduig the head are capable

of qualitative if not of quantitative analysis. Could measurements be devised

which would indicate the nature and amounts of these several influences, then, indeed,

would craniometry pass from its present empirical condition and become a genuine

Wescientific method.                                                             are yet far from the prospect of such an ideal system, and

all practical men will realise the immense, but not insuperable, difficulties in the

way of its formulation.

In illustration of the profound complexity of the problem which the craniolo-

gist has to face, I would ask your indulgence while I set out a few details to show

the several factors whose influence should be numerically indicated by such a mode

of measurement.

The parts composing the skull may be resolved into four sets : there is, first,

the brain-case                                                                   secondly, the parts which subserve mastication and the preparation
                                                                              ;

of the food for digestion                                                                                                               thirdly,  the cavities containing the  organs  of  the senses
                                                                                                                                     ;

of hearing, sight, and smell ; and, fourthly, those connected with the production

of articulate speech. If our measurements are to mean anything, they should give

us a series of definite numbers indicating the forms, modifications, and relative

size of these parts, and their settings with regard to each other and to the rest of

the body.

     To take the last point first, it needs but a small consideration to show that the

parts of the skull are arranged above and below a certain horizontal plane, which

18 definite (although not easily ascertained) in every skull, human or animal. This
is the plane of vision. The familiar lines of Ovid

                                                                                 Pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terram,
                                                                                 Os homini sublime dedit ; ccelumque tueri

                                                                                 Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus

are anatomically untrue, for the normal quadruped and man alike, in their most

natural position, have theii- axes of vision directed to the horizon. Systems of
measurement based upon any plane other than this are essentially artificial.
There are at the outset difficulties in marking the plane accurately on the
ekull, and it is to be deplored that the anthropologists of difi"erent nations should
                                                               ;

have allowed themselves to be affected by extraneous iniiueuces, which have
hindered their unanimous agreement upon some one definite liorizontal plane in

craniometry.

The Frankfort plane drawn through the upper margins of the auditory foramina

and the lowest points of the orbital borders has the advantage of being easily

traced, and difl'ers so little from the plane of A'ision that we may without substantial

error adopt it.

The largest part of the skull is that which is at once the receptacle and the

protector of the brain, a part which, when unmodified by external pressure, prema-

ture synostosis, or other adventitious conditions, owes its form to that of the cere-

bral hemispheres which it contains. Speaking in tbis city of (leorge and Andrew

Combe, I need not do more than indicate in this matter that observation and

experiment have established on a firm basis certain fundamental points regarding

the growth of the brain. The study of its development shows that the convolu-

tioning of the cerebral hemisphere is primarily due to the connection, and different

rate of growth, of the superficial layer of cells with the underlying layers of white

nerve fibres ; and that, so far from the shape being seriously modified by the con-

straining influence of the surrounding embryonic skull, the form of the soft mem-

branous brain-case is primarily moulded upon the brain within it, whose shape it

may however be, to some extent a secondary agent in modifying in later gTowth.

We have also learnt that, although in another sense from that of the crude

phrenology of Aristotle, Porta, or Gall, the cerebrum is not a single organ acting

as a functional   unit, but consists of parts, each of  which  has its specific province
                                                                                                                                                                               ;

that the increase in the number of cells in any area is correlated with an increase

in the size and complexity of pattern of the convolutions of that area ; and that
this in turn influences the shape of the enclosing shell of membrane and subse-

quently of bone.

     The anatomist and the physiologist have worked hand in hand in the delimitation
of these several functional areas, and pathology and surgery have confirmed what

experimental physiology has taught. The topography of each part of the cerebrum,

80 important to the operating surgeon, should be pressed into the service of the

anthropologist, whose measurements of the brain-case should have definite relation

to these several areas. In the discussion which is to take place on this subject, I

hope that some such relationships will be taken account of. This is not the place

to work out in detail how this may be done ; I only desire to emphasise the funda-

mental principle of the method.

     The second factor which determines the shape of the individual skull is the size
of the teeth. That these differ among different races is a matter of common

observation ; thus the average area of the crowns of the upper-jaw teeth in the
male Australian is 1,536 sq. mm., while in the average Englishman it is only 1,286

sq. mm., less than 84 per cent, of that size.'

     It is easy to understand how natural selection will tend to increase the size of
the teeth among those races whose modes of feeding are not aided by the cook or
the cutler; and how, on the other hand, the progress of civilised habits, assisted by
the craft of the dentist, interferes with the action of selection in this matter among

the more cultured races.

     For larger teeth a more extensive alveolar arch of implantation is necessary
and as the two jaws are commensurately developed, the lower jaw of the macro-
dontal races exceeds that of meso- or micro-dontal races in weight. Thus that of

a male Australian exceeds that of the average Englishman in the proportion of

100 : 91.
     To work this heavier jaw more powerful muscles are needed. In the average

well-developed Englishman with perfect teeth the weight of the fleshy portion of
the great jaw-muscles, masseters, and temporals is 00 grammes, while the weight
of those as ascertained in two Australians was 74 grammes.

      Correlated with this greater musculature a sharper definition of the areas for
the attachments of the jaw-muscles is required. The muscular fascicles are approxi-

never less than ten individual cases.

mately of uniform size iu both microdonts and macrodonts, aa the range of motion

of the jaw ditfers little in different races ; but when the skull is smaller on account

of the smaller size of the brain which it contains, the temporal crest ascends higher

on the side-wall. In the average Englishman the temporal crests at their points

of greatest approximation anteriorly across the brows are 112 mm. apart, but iu

the Australian they are only separated by 103 mm. : the interstephanic distances
in these two are respectively 132 and 114 mm.

The more powerful stroke of the mandibular teeth upon the anvil of the upper-

jaw teeth in macrodonts renders necessary a proportionally stronger construction

of the bases of support for the upper alveolar arch. In any skull this arch requires

to be solidly connected to the wall of the brain-case to which the shock of the

impact is ultimately transmitted, and in order to protect from pressure the deli-

cate intervening organs of sight and smell, the connection is accomplished by the

reversed arches of the infraorbital margins with their piers, malar and maxillary,

founded on the frontal angular processes. These foundations are tied together by

the strong supraorbital ridge, so that the whole orbital edge is a ring, made up of

the hardest and toughest bone in the skeleton.

   A twofold modification of this arrangement is required in the macrodont skull .,

The bony circum-orbital ring becomes stronger, especially along its lateral piers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and also as the alveolar arch is longer, and consequently projects farther forward,

its basis of support must be extended to meet and bear the malar and maxillary

piers. But macrodonts are often microcephalic, and therefore the frontal region of

the skull must be adjusted to form a foundation for this arch. In the average

English male skull, held with its visual axes horizontal, a perpendicular drop])ed

from the anterior surface of the fronto-nasal suture will cut the plane of the

alveolar arch between the premolar teeth or through the first premolar. In an

Australian skull the perpendicular cuts the horizontal plane at the anterior border

of the first molar teeth.

It is obvious, therefore, that to ensure firmness the piers of the arches must be

obliquely set ;  hence  the jaw is prognathous                                                                                                             but it  is also needful that the supra-
                                                                                                                                                        ;

orbital arcade should be advanced to meet and bear these piers, as the mandibular

stroke is always vertical.

But the inner layer of the skull is moulded on the small frontal lobes of the

brain, so this forward extension must affect only the much thicker and tougher

outer table of the skull, which, at the period of the second dentition, here separates-

from the inner taljle, the interval becoming lined by an extension of the mucosa of

the anterior ethmoidal cell. In this way an air-space, the frontal sinus, is formed,

whose development is thus directly correlated to the two factors of brain development

and size of the teeth. If the frontal lobes are narrow in a macrodont skull, then

the foundations of the outer or malar piers of the orbital arch must be extended

outwards as well as forwards, the external angular process becoming a prominent

abutment at the end of a strong low-browed supraorbital ai"ch, whose overhanging

edge gives to the orbital aperture a diminished vertical height.

The crania of the two most macrodont races of mankind, Australian and

African, differ iu the relation of the jaw to the frontal bone. In the microcephalic

Australian the maxillae are founded upon the under side of the shelf-like projec-

tion of the outer table of the frontal, which juts out as a buttress to bear it. On

the other hand, the nasal processes of the mesocephiilic negro ascend with greater

obliquity to abut on the frontal, and have, by their convergence, crushed the nasal

bones together, and caused their coalescence and diminution.

The crania of the two most microcephalic races present distinctive features of

contrast along the same lines. The Bushman's skull is usually orthognathous,

with a straight forehead and a shallow fronto-nasal recess, while the Australian

skuU is prognathous with heavy overhanging brows. These conditions are

correlated to the mesodontism of the Bushman and the macrodontism of the

Australian respectively.

In the course of the examination of the relations of brain development to skull

growth, some interesting collateral points are elicited. The frontal bone grows

from lateral symmetrical centres, which medially coalesce, union taking place
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                             893

usually between the second and sixth years of age. It has been noticed by
anthropologists that luetopism, as the anomalous non-union of the halves of this
bone has been termed, is rare among microcephalic races, occurring only in about
1 per cent, among Australian skulls. Increased growth of the frontal lobes
as the physical accompaniment of increased intellectual activity interposes an
obstacle to the easy closure of this median suture, and so in such races as the
.ancient Egyptian, with a broader forehead, metopism becomes commoner, rising
to 7 per cent. In modern civilised races the percentage ranges from 5 to 10.
In following out the details of this enumeration, I have spoken as if the micro-
dontal condition had been the primary one, whereas all the available evi-
dence leads to show that the contrary was the case. The characters of all the
early crania, Neanderthal, Engis, and Oromagnon, are those of macrodonts. The
progress has been from the macrodont to the microdont, as it probably was from the

microcephalic to the macrocephalic.

     The effects of the variations in size of the teeth are numerous and far-reaching.
The fluctuation in the weight of the jaw depending on these variations has an
important influence on the centre of gravity of the head, and affects the set of the

skull on the vertebral column. This leads to a consequent change in the axes of
the occipital condyles, and it is one of the factors which determines the size of the
neck-muscles, and therefore the degree of prominence of the nuchal crests and

mastoid process.

    As the teeth and alveolar arches constitute a part of the apparatus for

articulate speech, so these varieties in dental development are not without con-
siderable influence on the nature of the sound produced. The necessarily larger

alveolar arch of the macrodont is hypseloid or elliptical, more especially when

it has to be supported on a narrow frontal region, and this is associated with a
more extensive and flatter palatine surface. This, in turn, alters the shape of
the mouth cavity and is associated with a wide fiat tongue, whose shape par-
ticipates in the change of form of the cavity of which it is the floor. The mus-
culature of the tongue varies with its shape, and its motions, upon which articular
speech depends, become correspondingly modified. For example, the production

of the sharp sibilant s' ' requires the approximation of the raised flexible edge

of the tongue to the inner margins of the teeth behind the canines, and to the

palatine margin close behind the roots of the canine and lateral incisor teeth.

This closes the vocal tube laterally, and leaves a small lacuna about 5 mm. wide

Aanteriorly, through which the vibrating current of air is forced.  narrow strip

of the palate behind the medial halves of the median incisors bounds this lacuna

above, and the slightly concave raised tongue-tip limits it below.  ·

AVith the macrodont alveolar arch, and the correspondingly modified tongue,

sibilation is a difficult feat to accomplish, and hence the sibilant sounds are

practically unknown in all the Australian dialects.
     It is worthy of note that the five sets of muscular fibres, whose function it is to

close laterally the flask-like air-space between the tongue and the palate, are much
less distinct and smaller in the tongues of the Australians which I have examined

.than in the tongues of ordinary Europeans.

     There is a wide field open to the anatomical anthropologist in this investigation
of the physical basis of dialect. It is one which requires minute and careful work,

but it will repay any student who can obtain the material, and who takes time
and opportunity to follow it out. The anatomical side of phonology is yet an
imperfectly known subject, if one may judge by the crudeness of the descriptions

of the mechanism of the several sounds to be found even in the most recent text-

books. As a preliminary step in this direction we are in urgent need of an appro-

priate nomenclature and an accurate description of the muscular fibres of the

tongue. The importance of such a work can be estimated when we remember that
there is not one of the 260 possible consonantal sounds known to the phonologist

which is not capable of expression in terms of lingual, labial, and palatine muscu-

lature.

    The acquisition of articulate speech became possible to man only when his
alveolar arch and palatine area became shortened and widened, and when his
                                                                                         --

894 REPORT-- 1892.

tongue, by its accommodation to the modified moutli, became shorter and more

horizontally flattened, and the higher refinements of pronunciation depend for

their production upon more extensive modifications in the same directions.

I can only allude now very briefly to the efl^ects of the third set of factors, the
Wesizes of the sense organs, on the conformation of the skull.
                                                                                         have already noted

that the shape and the size of the orbital opening depend on the jaw as much as on
Athe eye.
                 careful set of measurements has convinced me that the relative or

absolute capacity of the orbital cavity is of very little significance as a character-

istic of race. The microsome Australian orbit and the megaseme Kanakan are

practically of the same capacity, and the eyeballs of the two Australians that I

have had the opportunity of examining are a little larger tlian those of the averao-g

of mesoseme Englishmen.

     The nasal fossfe are more variable in size than the orbits, but the superficial area
of their lining and their capacity are harder to measure, and bear no constant pro-
portion to the size of their apertures, because it is impossible without destroying

the skull to shut off the large air sinuses from the nasal fossas proper for purposes of
measurement. Thus the most leptorhine of races, the Esquimaux, with an average
nasal index of 437 has a nasal capacity of 55 c.cm., equal to that of the platy-
rhine jVustralian, whose average is 54-5, and both exceed the capacity of the lepto-
rhine English, which average about 60 c.cm. There is an intimate and easily

proved connection between dental size and the extent of the nasal floor and of
the pyriform aperture.

     These are but a few of the points which a scientific craniometry should take

into consideration. There are many others to which I cannot now refer, but which

will naturally occur to the thoughtful anatomist.

In this rapid review of the physical side of our subject the study of these

race-characters naturally suggests the vexed question as to the hereditary trans-

mission of acquired peculiarities. This is too large a controversy for us now

to engage in, but in the special instances before us there are grounds for the

presumption that these characters of microdontism and megacephaly have been

acquired at some stage in the ancestral history of humanity, and tliat they are

respectively correlated, with diminution of use in the one case, and increase of

activity in the other. It is a matter of observation that these qualities have be-

come hereditary, and the point at issue is not the fact, but the mechanism, of the
Wetransmission.
                      know that use or disuse affects the development of structure

in the individual, and it is hard to believe that the persistent disuse of a part

through successive generations does not exercise a cumulative influence on its

ultimate cotidition.

     There is a statement in reference to one of these characters which has gained

an entrance into the text-books, to the effect that the human alveolar arch is

shortening,^ and that the last molar tooth is being crowded out of existence. I

have examined 400 crania of men of the long and round-barrow races, Romano-
British and early Saxon, and have not found among all these a single instance of
absence of the third molar or of overcrowded teeth. On the other hand, out of

H200 ancient Egyptian skulls 9 per cent, showed displacement or disease, and per

cent, showed the want of one molar tooth. Out of 200 modern English skulls there
was no tliird molar tooth in 1 per cent. So far this seems to confirm the current

opinion.

Yet the whole history of the organism bears testimony to the marvellous per-

sistence of parts in spite of contumely and disuse. Take, for example, the present
Weposition of the little toe in man.
                                                                know not the condition of this digit in

prehistoric man, and have but little information as to its state among savage

tribes  at  the  present  day                      but  we  do  know  that in civilised  peoples, whose  feet
                                                ;

are from infancy subjected to conditions of restraint, it is an imperfect organ

                                       Of every function shorn
                          Except to act as basis for a corn.

     In 1 per cent, of adults the second and third joints have ankylosed ; in 3 per
cent, the joint between them is rudimentary, with scarcely a trace of a cavity ; in
TEANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  895

20 per cent, of feet the organ has lost one or more of its normal complement of
muscles. But though shorn of some of its elements, and with others as mere

shreds, the toe persists, and he would be a bold prophet who would venture to
forecast how many generations of booted ancestry would suffice to eliminate it

from the organisation of the normal man.

      Nevertheless, although it is ditiicult to demonstrate, in the present imperfect
state of knowledge, the method whereby race-characters have originated, I
think that the most of our anthropologists at least covertly adopt the philosophy

of the ancient proverb, ' The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children's

teeth are set on edge.'

      But there are other branches of anthropology of far greater interest than
these simple problems upon which we have tarried so long. The study of
man's intellectual nature is equally a part of our subject, and the outcomes of

that nature are to be traced in the tripartite record of human progress which we

call the history of culture. It is ours to trace the progress of man's inventions

and their fruits in language and the arts, the direct products of the human

mind. It is also ours to follow the history of man's discovery of those secrets

of nature to the unfolding of which we give the name of science. The task

is also ours to inquire into that largest and most important of all sections of the
history of culture which deals with the relation of human life to the unseen world,
and to disentangle out of the complex network of religion, mythology, and ritual
those elements which are real truths, either discovered by the exercise of man's
reason, or learnt by him in ways whereof science takes no account, from those

adventitious and invented products of human fear and fancy which obscure the view

of the central realities. In this country it matters less that our time forbids us
to wander in these fascinating fields wherein the anthropologist loves to linger,
as the munificent benefaction of Lord Gifibrd has ensured that there shall be an
annual fourfold presentation of the subject before the students of our Scottish
universities. There is no fear that interest in these questions will flag for want of
diversity in the method of treatment or of varieties in the standpoints of the

successive Gifibrd lecturers.

     From the ground of our present knowledge we can but faintly forecast the
future of anthropology, when its range is extended by further research, and when
it is purged of fancies, false analogies, and imperfect observations. It may be that

there is in store for us a clearer view of the past history of man, of the place and
time of his first appearance, of his primitive character, and of his progress. But

has this knowledge, interesting as it may be for its own sake, any bearing on the

future of mankind ? Hitherto growth in knowledge has not been accompanied
with a commensurate increase in the sum of human happiness, but this is probably
due to the imperfection which characterises even our most advanced attainments.
For example, while the medical and sanitary sciences, by their progress, are
diminishing the dangers which beset humanity, they have also been the means of
preserving and permitting the perpetuation of the weaklings of the race, which, had
natural selection exercised its unhindered sway, would have been crushed out of

existence in the struggle for life.

     It is, however, of the essence of true scientific knowledge, when perfected, that
it enables us to predict, and if we ever rise to the possession of a true appreciation
of the intiuences which have afiected mankind in the past, we should endeavour to
learn how to direct these influences in the future that they shall work for the pro-
gress of the race. With such a knowledge we shall be able to advance in that

practical branch of anthropology, the science of education ; and so to giude and
foster the physical, intellectual, and moral growth of the individual that he mil

be enabled to exercise all his powers in the best possible directions. And, lastly,

we shall malve progress in that kindred department, sociology, the study of which

does for the community what the science of education does for the individual. Is

it a dream that the future has in store for us such an anthropological Utopia P

896 REPORT-- 1892.

The followiDg Papers and Reports were read :

         1. On the Organisation of Local Anthropological Research.

                              Bij B. W. Brabeook.

The writer has been authorised by a joint committee of delegates from the

Society of Antiquaries, the Follilore Society, and the Anthropological Institute

to communicate to the Section a plan for an ethnographical survey of the United

Kingdom, by which observations should be made simultaneously in selected

localities on the ancient remams, the local customs, and the physical characters of

the people. The delegates would largely rely for assistance in carrying out this

scheme upon the corresponding societies of the British Association, and an analysis

of the two hundred or more papers published by such societies in connection with

Hthe subjects of Section recorded during the last seven years shows that as many

as twenty-nine local societies have been engaged in valuable original anthropo-

logical work. These and other societies, as well as those in union with the Society

of Antiquaries, would doubtless be willing to act upon a uniform plan. As mate-

rials for the formation of such a plan of action the writer refers to Mr. Payne's

archseological survey of the county of Kent, aud to those of other counties which

have already been completed on the same model ; to the collection of Gloucester-

shire Folklore and the ' Handbook of Folklore,' published by the Folklore

Society, and to the second edition of ' Notes aud Queries on Anthropology,' just

completed by the Anthropological Institute. He also refers to the reports of the

Anthropometric Committee, and especially to the scheme for collection of photo-

graphs, in respect of which Mr. Galton lias favoured him with some practical

AHsuggestions.     these will have to be reduced by the delegates to a brief and

simple code of instructions. The matter is one that will not brook undue delay, as

the evidence is fast slipping out of our grasp.

4. Discovery of the Common Occurrence of Paloiollthic Weapons in Scotland.
                                By Rev. Frederick Smith.

     The author shows that the opinion of scientific men, with regard to the ques-

tion of the occurrence of the relics of PaUeolithic man in Scotland, is down to the

present time of a negative character. It is pi-etty confidently asserted that north

of a line across the Lower Middle of England ' implement-bearing strata ' do not

<iccur.

But from an inspection in 1883 of the alluvial deposits of the South of England

and North-east France, as well as in a part of the Rhine Valley, he was led to

infer that it was well-nigh impossible that Paljeolithic man could have been shut

out of Scotland during the enormous lapse of time represented by the implement-

yielding strata of the south. This conclusion was based also upon the result of

eleven years' observations upon rivers and river phenomena made previous to 1883

in the valleys of  Scotland                                      and  on his return north  in  that year he  determined to
                                                              ;

put to proof the negative opinions regarding this question. This quest has been

prosecuted now for nine years, with, in the face of general opinion, extraordinarily

affirmative results.

    He has made systematic research in the soils, with the striking result that in

the neighbourhood of Perth certain angular stones occur commonly in the soils of

certain areas, and are entirely absent from others.
                                                                --

He has made patient and long-continued search in modern and ancient gravel

Kameteds, in the beds of existing rivers, in '                  ' deposits, and finally in certain

phases            of boulder      clay ;  and  he  finds  that  each  piece  of  research yielded some

--corroborative evidence, but that the boulder clay i.e., certain characteristic por-

tions yield abundant evidence, in the shape of glaciated, broken, and crushed
specimens of the vreapons of Palaeolithic man. He believes them to be as common

in certain ancient soils, and in these certain phases of the boulder clay in Scotland,

as they are in any areas or deposits in England or France.

                  The material in which the weapons mainly occur represents ancient river-accu-

mulated beds, exact equivalents of those of the Ouse and Thames and Somme

Valleys, which are characterised by their weapons, and remains of extinct mamma-

lia               and  they were formed   in exactly identical circumstances during a long period

of time, terminated in the north by an inception of glaciers, which did not affect

such valleys as now contain undisturbed implement- and bone-bearing strata.

Kemains of the mammoth and other extinct forms have been found in the north, but

the ponderous steps of glaciers down the valleys of mountainous England and

Scotland cannot have left many recognisable osseous remains.

The actual tangible results of the author's years of research are the best proof

of his success^ in what he undertook to prove. He has collected at least 350

specimens, which he believes to be definite evidence of the long-continued sojourn

of Palaeolithic man north of the Border; the large majority of these specimens he

proposed to exhibit at the Association's meetings in Edinburgh; many of the

specimens in this collection he considers as characteristic and unassailable as any

from Southern England or France.

                                                   I. Exposition des Faits.

     1°. Quand la premiere circonvolution frontale est doubl(5e longitudinalement,
la circpnvolution du corps calleux reste presque toujours simple, mais d'autant
plus mince ou etroite que la frontale interne est plus d^velopp^e en largeur.

     II e.xiste un veritable balancement entre les deux circonvolutions sous le rapport
de la largeur.

     2°. Quand la frontale interne n'est pas double longitudinalement et lorsqu'elle
est en outre pen large, alors apparait tres souvent sur les cerveaux humains bien
d6velopp6s un sillon longitudinal dans I'epaisseur de la circonvolution du corps
calleux. Ce sillon, que Ton ne trouve pas chez les anthropoides, mais qui existe
chez divers herbivores a titre de complication limbique, r6apparait chez I'homme
comme formation frontale supplementaire.

      II peut arriver que ce sillon acquiert un developpement tel qu'il a ^ti5 parfois
confondu avec la erande scissure sous-frontale de Broca, et que celle-ci a pu etre

ddcrite sur certains cerveaux comme 6tant un simple sillon de dedoublement de la

circonvolution frontale interne.

    C'est en dtudiant le cerveau d'un homme tres distingu(5 (Eugene Vdron) que
M. Manouvrier a pu saisir, en voie de riSalisation, cette substitution d'un sillon

n(5o-sous-frontal a la scissure sous-frontale classique. II en a observe les divers
degres de developpement sur une s6rie de cerveaux, et a pu ainsi moutrer, sur le
cerveau du Professeur Adolphe Bertillon la realisation complete de la disposition
morphologique qu'il d6crit.

                                              II. Interpretation de ces Faits.

     M. Manouvrier attire d'atord I'attention sur le fait qu'il s'agit la de v^ritables
compensations au profit du lobe frontal.

     II rappelle ensuite que Broca a montr6 Thoinologie de la circonvolution du
corps calleux {gyrus fornicatus) avec une partie du grand lobe limbique et sa
diminution graduelle dans la sf^rie des mammiferes au profit des lobes cer^braux
adjacents, et plus specialement chez I'homme au profit du lobe frontal.

    II considere done la formation fronto-limbique decrite ci-dessus comme in-

diquant, dans I'^spece bumaine, la phase la plus recente de I'empietement du lobe
frontal sur le grand lobe limbique, et comme indiquant une veritable fusion, pro-
bablement pbysiologique aussi bien que morphologique, entre ces deux lobes, tres
Traisemblablement dans le sens d'lm perfectionnement frontal et intellectuel.

     II a constats le progres en question du lobe frontal sur tous les cerveaux
d'faommes plus au moins celebres ou distingu6s qu'il a pu examiner a Paris. Mais
il ajoute que les faits sur lesquels il vient d'attirer I'attention sont extremement

frequents et ne sont pas rares meme chez les negres.

7. The Indo- Europeans^ Conception of a Future Life and its Bearing upon
           their Religions. Bij Professor G. Hartwell Jones, M.A.

In a previous paper read in 1891,' The Barbaric Elements in Ancient Greece and

Italy,' the view was propounded that («) the Classics were of deep scientific

interest                               (6)  the  level  of  culture               among  the  early Greeks    and      Italians was                                       low
                                    ;

(c) their culture dated from contact with the East ; (d) the criteria mast be sought

in archaeology, in its widest sense, as much as in the science of language.

This monograph deals with a section of the above subject, which will, in its

turn, throw light upon ethnology; only by division of labour and unbiassed

research can truth be reached in mythology ; here the crudest notions of these
people are discussed. The belief in a future life which is, as Lessing and

Schopenhauer have said, an integral portion of religion, is deeply rooted and a

common inheritance of Indo-Europeans, but the richer the endowments of the

race the nobler its aspirations after immortality. It has been stated by Peschel

that some negro tribes have no such idea, but then they would equally doubt

their present existence. The doctrine in some countries was gradually transformed

or degenerated.

The different opinions regarding immortality in vogue to-day are not new, for

even as early as the Vedic hymns are found

  --(1) Deathlessness in thought, in children. This idea is frequently found in

Greece, and the survival in posterity is a prominent feature of Roman thought.

This, however, does not faU within the scope of the present inquiry.

    An(2) actual life beyond the grave possessed peculiar attractions for Indo-

European races, though they are not agreed upon the sphere in which the dis-

embodied spirit lived, some looking for it on earth, others in heaven.

Three heads naturally suggest themselves :

I. The connection of body and soul.
TI. The condition of the deceased.
III. The relations betiueen the departed and those left behind.

                                                                                  I.

   --The nature of the soul. In primitive times souls are ascribed to the uni-
-- --verse the anima mundi to nymphs of various Irinds, to the lower animals, to

fountains, or trees. Heaven is the source from which the soul of man is derived,

and to which it returns after purification. As to its creation, it has no corporeal

element, it was created before the body ; sometimes it is identified with fire. The

etymology of the expressions for soul are instructive, e.g., Sanskrit atlndriya, or

' transcending the                               .senses ;                        Greek Ov^os, from  a  root  meaning  to  agitate                                        eo too
                                                                               '                                                                                      ',

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.       899

the notion of ' air,' ' vapour,' ' shade.' Still more common is the idea of ' breath.'

--Its seat is the heart or blood.
     The way in which death was regarded. At the moment of dissolution, the soul
escapes through the mouth or nostrils ; it leaves with a groan ; it passes to the
ethereal regions. Death is often looked upon as a kind of sleep. Tlieir stoicism in

the face of death is attested by the frequency of suicide, or of substitution, or the
prohibition of mourning. This was because, e.g., of the dread of decrepitude,
assurance of the preservation of the family, frailty of life, and confident hope of a
life to come. Yet, early language is rich in e%iphemistic terms, e.g., to die is
' to be missing,' ' to depart,' and the Goddess of Fate is ' The Sparing One.'

                                                                                   II.

   --The character of the spirit-iuorld. The theory of a future life prevalent in the

animistic stage is that of continuance, the tastes and occupations being the same as

in this world, e.g., even Homer has not outgrown this. But this existence is

incomplete and dreary; the ghosts gibber and are doomed to silence.

   --The influence of this idea upo7i ritual and belief. The severance was not com-

plete, for the welfare of the spirit depended upon the proper treatment of the body
else it wandered disconsolate. (This notion is a leading feature of Indo-European

mythology.) («) Hence the observance of rites. At first the body was disposed
of by inhumation, probably to preserve the identity of the deceased, but in certain
conditions of life, e.g., during war or the chase, cremation was employed. At least

a handful of dust had to be sprinkled over the corpse before the spirit could obtain
repose ; its neglect was regarded with horror. The same motive dictated the

rearing of cenotajjhs,

     (b) The tomb was constructed on the model of the house ; this custom is not

confined to ' Turanians.'

     (c) The deceased was furnished with all necessaries for bis new home,

attendants and wives, dogs and horses, weapons, clothing, and earthenware.

   --The abode of the dead. (a) The earliest theory is that the soul became

ethereal, passing into the wind, or fire, or constellations.

    A(S) region somewhere upon earth. The exact locality was uncertain, because

of the nebulous character of their life, for they followed certain Great Spirits.

Then the region of bliss was placed in the "West.
     The influence of surroundings is noteworthy here; thus, to the aesthetic mind

of the Greek such a monotonous existence was repulsive, but it is not likely that
this was the original conception. At a later period an attempt was made to
combine these worlds.

     The germs of a theory of recompense and punishment are found early, e.g.,
^Xeyvat may be equated with the Indian Bhrigu (Weber) and Taprnpor with

taldtala (Benfey). No doubt the idea gained in clearness when they came into

contact with the Semites. Transmigration, regeneration, and puri/lcation belong

to a later time.

                                                                             III.

   --The relation between the living and the departed. In addition to the care taken

at burial, there was constant communication, e.g., in dreams. Hence the respect

--shown to (1) kindly spirits, like the pitaras, fravashi, manes, &c. the givers of

wealth ; (2) the evil-disposed, like the lemures or larvce. This gave rise to ancestral
worship, and is connected with the sustentation of the family ; children were buried
under tbe eaves of bouses, and did not need propitiation. Thus the worshippers
were actuated by (1) fear, (2) sympathy.

--900 REPORT 1892.

                              FRIDAY, AUGUST 5.

     The following Papers and Reports -were read:

1. Exhibition of Photographs, Weapons, ^^c, of Toba Indians of the Gran

                              Chaco. By J. Geaham Kerr.

     The specimens exhibited had been obtained from a tribe of the Tobas on the
banks of the Rio Pilcomayo. Amongst weapon? the chief were bows and arrows,
the former being noteworthy from their reinforcement by a backstring. The

arrows were of cane with long wooden points made of cascaranda. An arrow

with an iron head was also shown, the head beiug formed of fencing wire beaten
out. Other weapons shown were a club made of cascaranda and a short and highly
artistic lance of the same material. Amongst other implements was exhibited a
Toba fire-drill ; the method of using it was explained : also several examples of

the textile productions of the Tobas and a rude sketch of the human figure as
drawn by a Toba chief.

     2. Exhibition of pre-Palceolithic Flints. By J. Montgomerie Bell,

    On the heights of the North Downs of Kent, at an altitude of from 600 to 750

feet, a large series of flints has in the past few years been collected, chiefly bj'

Mr. Benjamin Harrison, of Ightham, who first directed attention to them, as
possessing signs of human handiwork. These fiints, if accepted as the work of

man, possess a peculiar interest, as their age is undoubtedly very great, and their
general style represents an early stage in human culture. In age they are plainly
anterior to the River-valleys, because they are found in patches of old gravel-beds
which lie upon the uneroded plateaus between the valleys which slope northward
to the Thames. These valleys belong to the Palreolithic or River-valley age ; but
the valleys are eroded out of the plateaus, which form the relics of an older sur-

face, and may in popular speech be named pre-PaliBolithic.
     The peculiarity of the flints exhibited is that they are not shaped into particular

forms by the will and skill of the workman as Palajolithic flints are. They are

simply stones taken from the groimd, and used almost in the state in which they
are picked up, only the edges are altered ; they are chipped flints rather than

shaped flints, used tools not made tools. Historically we liave relics of such a
stage in the stones used by the Bushmen and by the Tasmaniaii, and it is probable
that such a stage was general in human history. The ditticulty in identifying
flints of this class as having actually been human implements is that they are

neither flaked nor bulbed : these, the hall-marks of flint work, are absent ; they

have only the marks of use. Hence some authorities hav6 accepted them, and
others have rejected them. The writer gave the reasons which had convinced him
of their authenticity, namelj", that the chipping is regular and purpose-like, such
as nature is not likely to have hit upon ; it is sometimes within a hollow curve,
where natural agencies could not act ; the edges of many unbulbed flints have far
more regular marks of wear, which is the true indication of use by man that
many bulbed flakes possess, whose edges have undoubtedly been used ; and lastly,
there is a sequence in the types which leads into the types of the River-valley
period: this is especially visible in a series of pear-shaped flints with chipped
edges similar to, and almost identical in form with, the pear-shaped hache of St.

Acheul.

           3. The Present Inhabitants of Mashonaland, and their Origin.

                                   By J. Theodore Bent.

     The recognised name Makalanga, and its connection with the Portuguese name
 for the Monomatapa people, and further identification of names as given by
 Bocarro and the traces left of Monomatapa towns and villages, are discussed in

 the paper.
TRAN5ACTI0NS OF SECTION H.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     901

     The Portuguese writer Dos Santos describes the people of Monomatapa much

as they are to-day.

     Origiu of the Makalangas much more obscure, but references to them adduced

from earl}' Arabian writers prove beyond doubt that a similar people inhabited
this country 1,000 years ago.

     Customs are still inherent in the race, pointing to external influence. The
dynastic names of the chiefs, the succession to the chiefdoms.

     The totems of the Makalangas.

     Their religion and monotheistic teudeucy, sacrifice to ancestors, and sacrifice of
goats to ward off calamities.

     The burial of their dead.
     The day of rest during the ploughing season, co-operative labours, circumcision,
and reference to points which connect them with an Asiatic or northern origin.
     Similar instances produced from private life. The pillows or head-rests. The

5. On the Value of Art in Ethnology. By Professor A. C. Haddon.

In order to study such an intricate subject as decorative art from the point

of view of the biologist, it is necessary tirst to confine one's attention to savage

art, where the problems are presented in a simpler form. In taking a definite area

into consideration, such as Biitish New Guinea, it is found that there are several

distinct and well-defined artistic provinces. The Torres Straits district is charac-

terised by the prevalence of straight and angled lines, to the exclusion of curved

lines, and the representation of animal forms, the latter being associated with

totemism. In the Gulf district the human face and form are the basis of almost all

their art. In the Port Moresby district decoration is in the form of panels, and

mainly straight and angled lines; whereas in the South Cape and Archipelago

district there is a wonderful richness of design, in wliicli curved lines are

abundant. It is well known that in this latter district there has been a great

mixture of race. It would appear that homogeneous peoplss have a uniform style

in their art, but that race mixture tends to varied artistic treatment. It is an

established dictum in biology that all life comes from pre-existing life, so we may

assert for savage art, and possibly for that of more civilised peoples, that all

artistic designs arise from, or are suggested by, natural objects. Savages do not

invent or create patterns or schemes of ornamentation                                                                                                                                                                                                          the latter are arrived at by
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

 G. Similarity of Certain Ancient Necropoleis in the Pyrenees and in North

                           Britain. By Dr. Phene, F.8.A.

     In the personal surveys and investigations made by the author in Western
Europe tradition was often the beacon which led to the most interesting dis-
coveries. The tradition of St. Patrick driving the serpents, not of Ireland, as
popularly uow expressed, but of Sligo into the Atlantic, whence they returned to

Donegal, led to the examination of ancient relics very similar to those existing in
the Pyrenees and in several parts of England and Scotland, wliich have been
rendered classical by the Arthurian legends, which legends evidently had existence
in those localities long prior to the age of the historical Arthur. In the present
case the author selected Luchon, a spot where the traditions of the Pyrenees are
most concentrated, and where remarkable customs have been till very lately

practised, -wliicli locality abounds "with interments of a peculiar kind more or less

surrounding a great central mound, serpentine in form, tlie head of which, evidently

formerly constructed with a souterrain chamber, has been cut away, and in the

cavity a small church erected in its place. The walls of this antique little church

are covered with votive tablets of early Christian and Pagan Roman times ; the

exhumations from the more lofty curvature of the mound, which exhibited deposi-

tions of chronological sequence, in which earlier successive interments of relics

and cinerary remains appear always to have been respected by subsequent

depositors, as shown from the undisturbed relics of earlier date (now to a great

extent in a local museum), which go back through successive stages of varied

national occupation from Roman to early Keltic and even less determinable ancient

times, the relics of which consist of rude pottery and flint ehippings. Strange

rites are still celebrated on the mound and in the surrounding districts by proces-

sions with banners and chanting, and the locally surrounding interments are so

arranged that the position of the various very ancient tombs, which are small Kist

vaens, sometimes only a foot square with cinerary matter covered by single stones

of rude and insignificant appearance, are frequently an imitation of the sinuosities

of the great mound which contained the successive layers of relics so recovered.
The mound appears to a great extent artificial. In his researches in the Pyrenees

the author was assisted by two well-known antiquaries, and who certified to the

remarkable facts. Almost all the above features have been discovered by the

author in certain localities of Somersetshire, Bedfordshire, Argyllshire, and else-

·where. When the author read his first paper on such mounds before the British

Association in Edinburgh in 1871 he had then made no exhumations from any

such mounds. The great mound, to which his first paper referred, is formed of a

natural deposit cut into shape, the excised portions being close at hand : it had
a chamber in the centre of the head made of large blocks of granite, and contain-

ing a great quantity of burnt bones, wood, and hazel-nuts. It appeared not to have

been disturbed, and a flint or chalcedony instrument delicately serrated was found.

This mound also, as well as one in the locality referred to in Ireland, and that in the

APyrenees, are distinctly serpentine in form.  large surrounding area is occupied

by grand cairns varying from ten to sixty feet in diameter ; they are arranged like
the chambers of interment in the Pyrenees in a serpentine form, apparently repeating

the form of the great mound. The interiors of these cairns also, in each case,

contain sepulchral chambers or Kist vaens.

                   7. A Contribution to the Ethnology of Jersey.
                           By Andrew Dunlop, M.D., F.G.S.

     The author has examined 239 living persons out of a possible 54,000, choosing
invariably those which could be ascertained to be pure descendants of the oldest
established families in the island. The following is the result of the investigation
as to the colour of eyes and hair in percentages :

Eyes
                                                                                                                                                                       ;

                                                                                                                             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                903

dark eyes would appear lower, and of fair hair higher, in Jersey than they most
prohahly would do under the doctor's system of classification. Eed-haired persons
are not numerous in Jersey. The average cephalic index of the 239 persons was
80'6 (the lowest 678, and the highest 87"5), equal to Broca's mesaticephalic class.
The average height of the 110 males measured was 5 feet 7^ inches, but the
figures of height were not considered reliable.

     The author concluded that the blood of the Jersey people is largely derived
from the old Celtic aboriginal stock, resembling the populations of the Celtic
districts of France and I3ritain, the Teutonic or Scandinavian admixture not

being large.

8. On the Past and Present Condition of tlie Natives of the Friendly Islands,
                               or Tonga. By R. B. Leefe.

     The author pointed out that there is no inflection of the verb word in its

conjugation, the tenses and persons being expressed by means of prefixes. Many

English words are incorporated with the language ; every word ends in a vowel,
and while two vowels may come together this is not allowable with consonants.

The number of pronouns is large ; a dual and plural, inclusive and exclusive, of
the person addressed exist. The prefix faka- turns the noun into an adjective.

The natives are purely agriculturists and fishermen, and on one atoll have a

distinct species of fish upon which they feed.

The author complained much of the government introduced by the missionaries

as being one calculated to lessen the happiness of the people to the profit of Man-

chester manufacturers                                                                                                        for instance, one of the first  new laws  introduced was one
                                                                                                                          ;

enforcing the covering of the body above the waist as well as below.

Much time is wasted on the laborious manufacture of tupa cloth, which is

marked with devices to show from what town it emanates. The making of copra

(dried cocoanut) is also a settled occupation of the people. Canoe building, onco

»n art, is fast disappearing, and ' in this, as in truthfulness, honesty, and morality,

civilisation is fast doing its work, and spoiling one of the originally finest races

under the sun.'

The natives still cook in their earth-ovens. The nets are now usually of

European twine, instead of the native fibre aka. To obtain fish by poisoning the

water is a common method.

The building of the houses, which is said to have much deteriorated since

Eiuropean intercourse, is still above the level of that of most Pacific islanders.

Scientifically their plan is faultless, strength being afforded where the greatest

strain comes, and the houses can only be levelled by fire or hurricane, no naila

being used, but instead thereof the beams, &c., are fastened with cocoanut husk,

and hence their elasticity.

The women are well cared for, and, with the exception of the arduous manu-

facture of the native cloth, have an easy time. In the question of dress and

morality the author condemned the views of the missionaries. Love, in our sense

of the word, ending in lasting friendship, is unknown to the natives. The population

is fast diminishing in numbers.

                        9. Bamma Island and its Natives.
                By P. W. Bassett-Smith, Surg. B.N, F.B.M.S.

    Damma Island is the largest of the Serwati group, in the Banda Sea, and is

under Dutch protection. As far as the author was able to make out, there were
two more or less distinct types of people. The first with dark brown skins, coarse

black hair, either straight or with a tendency to curl, sometimes closely cut

roundish faces and heads, dark eyes, high cheekbones, nose much sunken at the
base, nostrils dilated, mouth rather large, and lips much misshapen by betel chewing,
the bolus of which they kept half protruding in a disgusting way ; body with but
little hair, occasionally a short wiry beard and whiskers ; height about 5 ft. 6 in.,

limbs well formed, ankles and wrists not particularly small, expression quiet and

rather dull.

    The second a coppery brown, much lighter race, with strong frizzly hair, either

cut short or standing out in a mop, coloured a rich orange yellow with lime, and

evidently a great source of pride to them ; face oval, eyes dark, sparkling, and full

of  life ;  nose  aquiline,  often  slightly  hooked  at  the  tip,  nostrils  wide                        mouth  small,
                                                                                                        ;

lips well cut, no hair on the face, at least not when young adults, teeth good

expression bright and intelligent, limbs well shaped, rather delicate wrists and

ankles, average height 5 feet 5 inches or under. Some of these were so graceful

and handsome as to fill anyone who observed them with admiration ; it was not a

single individual, but many ; and one instinctively made friends.
    The first type we found mostly in the coast villages, the other on the hill

side. There was also a mixture between these two types, Malays and Papuans.

The women were shorter in stature, with their hair done up in a knot at the

back of the head. AVhen young they were pleasant to look at, but apparently soon

aged, and with their very pendent breasts were ugly.

  --The average measurements of the hillmen were : Height 5 feet 5 inches,

length of head 7^*5 inches, width of head 6 inches, cephalic index 82, length of
arm 32 inches, and of leg 35 inches.

or psycliological dnta for establishing a criminal type was pointed out. But the

author said that one conclusion was forced upon him. If there was not an
absolutely marked criminal type all would agree that criminals fell far below a
high anatomical and physiological standard of brain, body, and mind. The weak

point in criminal anthropology was that while criminals had been weighed,

measured, observed, and described, tlie classes of society from which most of them
came, but who had not been convicted of breaking the law, had not been ob-
served in the same way, and had not had the same scientific tests applied to them.
There was little use in gauging the criminal by the standard of the well-fed, the
respectable, and the comfortable classes of .society. The scientific method would

be to apply the test to whole sections of the lower labouring classes of society,

including the criminals. There was a large class of human beings whose brains

suffered manifestly from arrested development of normal function. This existed in

any and every degree, and might extend to any and every mental and moral faculty.

A human being only slightly imbecile in mind had many anatomical and psychological

resemblances to the criminal. Scientific anthropology that covered the whole'

ground must deal with the idle, the vagrant, the pauper, the prostitute, the

drunkard, the imbecile, the epileptic, and the insane, as well as the criminal and

the class to which he usually belonged. If inquiry established physical, hereditary,

and psychological bases of criminality, the State would have to treat the criminal

from a point of view entirely different from the punitive method. Such was the

contention of the modi-rn school of that department of study. One physiological

aspect of the question had not obtained the observation it was worthy of, and that
was the developmental aspect, nor had the evolutional aspect had sufEcient atten-

tion paid to it. Many were criminals because their brains were the same as those

of their ancestors, aiid their environment had changed only in the present genera-

tion. In some districts of the country there were actually no criminals, yet when

some of the people of those districts went to live in great cities they became
habitual criminals. The too sudden exposure to new environments and conditions,

with the necessary attempts at adaptation to those environments, was one of the

great factors of criminality and of certain forms of insanity. The later years of

adolescence were those in which the great inhibitory moral and social faculties
that fit men to live in a well-ordered civil modern society attain such perfection as

they are capable of, and it is during this period that most of our criminals become

such. It is in the early years of adolescence that epilepsy arises in the greatest

degree, and in the later years that 'adolescent insanity,' hysteria, dipsomania,

asthma, phthisis, and other developmental diseases of the mental, motor, or nutri-
tive functions arise. Criminality in certain cases seems to class itself among such

developmental defects. The essential likeness of the epileptic and the criminal

hrain is one of the most striking of Dr. Benedikt's observations. What are to

the doctor symptoms of diseases are to the policeman and the magistrate proofs

of criminality. In the rich family the doctor looked after the case ; in the poor

family the policeman and the gaoler. Yet both cases were equally phases of brain

Adevelopment due to hereditary weakness.  deformity in the hard palate which

became high in the centre and V-shaped he found to exist in 35 per cent, of criminals,

37 per cent, of epileptics, 55 per cent, of the adolescent insane, and Gl per cent,

of idiots and imbeciles, as compared with 19 per cent, of the general population,

and the hard palate has a close relationship to the base of the anterior lobes

of the brain in man, those lobes being closely related to the mental functions. He
had seen and studied many cases of crime or vice in which moral responsibility

did not exist. All considerations pointed to two great sources of criminality. The
first was the not fully evolved man who was fitted to do his work in a primitive

society, but who could not accommodate himself to the conditions of a life of a
highly organised and extremely artificial modern society, and who fell into crimi-

nality and swelled the list through his environment. The second was the patho-

logically non-developed man, whose development had been arrested towards the end

of the period of adolescence before his inhibitory and moral qualities had attained

their full strength.

Tlie following Papers were read :

1. On a Coiffure from the South Seas. By Sir W. Turner.

Sir William Turner exhibited the coiffure of a Kanaka labourer, who had been

employed on a sugar plantation in Queensland. The mode of dressing the hair in

locks, each of which was tied round with a slender ribbon, half a millimetre in

width, formed of vegetable fibre, was described. The free end of each lock was

not confined by the ribbon, and the hair was curly at this end, and somewhat

auburn-tinted probably it                                   had been artificially bleached :  834 such locks were
                                                         ;

present in the coiffure, and it was estimated that about 120 hairs were in each

lock, making in all about 100,000 hairs in the coiffure. The locks were tied

together into a bunch with bands of tape, so that the coiffure had projected

upwards for 17 inches from the top of the head in the manner figured by Dr.

Prichard, in vol. ii. of the ' Natural History of Man,' in a native of Ombai Island.
Captain Cook, in vol. ii. p. 78 of his 'Voyages/ figures a man of the island of Tanna

in whom a similar mode of dressing the hair is described, but in this case the

locks were not tied together into a top-knot, but hung pendulous over the neck and

shoulders.

2. On the Articular Processes of the Vertebrce in the Gorilla compared with
    those in Man, and on Costo-vertehral Variation in the Gorilla. By
     Professor Steuthers, M.D., LL.D.

  -- --The paper was founded on the observation of twenty gorilla skeletons, two of

which a male and a female the author exhibited to the Section. In the female
specimen the ribs are placed on the spine a vertebra lower than usual, giving eight
cervical vertebr.-B. That vertebra has the usual characters of the normal seventh,
including the foramen in the transverse process. The thirteenth rib is well formed
three lumbar vertebrce, the last (twenty-fourth vertebra) not ossified to the sacrum.
It is an old gorilla, the sacro-ihac joint on one side ossified. In three of the

twenty gorillas there were fourteen ribs instead of the usual thirteen. In man an

additional rib occurs more frequently at the neck than below. In the gorilla it

would seem to be the contrary. The lowest rib in man is small and variable ; in

the gorilla the lowest rib is long.

     Articular processes are adapted to the different movements of the several
regions of the vertebral column. The early type, seen throughout the vertebral

--column in reptiles and birds, is retained in the lumbar region of mammals the

anterior pair form the zygantrum, the posterior pair the zygosphene. The place
of change to the dorsal type is generally at several vertebrae in front of the last

rib. In man it is normally just above the last rib. In the gorilla the change
occurs generally a vertebra lower, which is just above its last rib. The place
varies sometimes both in man and in the gorilla, tending to follow any variation

in the number or position of the ribs.
      Approximation of the lumbar articular processes, going downwards, does not

occur in the female gorilla until the lumbo-sacral joint is reached. In the male
exhibited to the Section the approximation is seen on all the four lumbar vertebrae,
but all male gorillas do not show this until the last two vertebrae are reached. This
approximation of the lumbar articular processes, going downwards, in the gorilla

contrasts strongly with the opposite condition in man, in whom the width apart

of the processes increases from the third vertebra downwards, and is very marked
above and below the last vertebra, though not invariably below it.

     The lowest lumbar vertebra (twenty-fourth vertebra) is known to be frequently
ossified to the sacrum in the gorilla, at least in old males. The author has found

--this union to have taken place in eight of the cases seven males and one female

--and not to have occurred in twelve eight males and four females. But three of
-- --the twelve two males and one female were not adult. In man the tendency
                            --

TRANSACTIONS OP SECTION H.      907

rather is to increase the number of free vertebris in the lumbar region by detach-
ment, of the upper sacral vertebra. The diflerences alluded to have reference
mainly to the ^reat freedom of the lumbar region in man compared with that in
the gorilla, and to the greater thoracic development in the gorilla.

3. On the Prohahle Derivation of some Characteristic Sounds in Certain
      Languages from Cries or Noises made by Animals. By J. Mansel
      Weale.

    The atithor relates how he first noticed the resemblance between the lullaby

of a native voer-looper and the croaking of frogs at Boouiplatz, Orange River
Free State. Later he was often puzzled in KafFraria by the resemblance between
the sounds of distant Kafir dance-music and that made by the frogs in vleys or

ponds. He attempted to analyse this impression, and came to the conclusion

that it principally arose from the rhythmic cadence, combined with the hand-

clappings, mingled with the vocal sounds and drum-beat. These conclusions led
him to collect specimens of frogs from a small vley. Out of these two very

minute species gave out loud rapping sounds when confined in a jar ; and sub-
sequently, although extremely common in Kaifraria, they were described as new
by M. Boulenger in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.) catalogue of Batrachia

salientia, 1882. These, as well as the other species collected, belong to African

groups widely distributed, especially through the tropics. About the same time

(1864) he also arrived at the conclusion that the models of the so-called bee-hive
huts of the natives were the termitaria, or white ants' nests, as they are commonly

called ; that possibly primaeval man sheltered himself in deserted termitaria,

adapting to them a roof of boughs or leaves, such as the anthropoid apes are
known to construct.

     Hence it would seem probable that all those primitive races constructing
circular-planned dwellings started from the tropics, and that their music and
language were to a large extent based on their interpretation of the natural
sounds around them, and more particularly on the frog-concert Nkuquak being,
as he later found in Efik, the Old Kalabar word for a concert, and quak, to clap

hands, beat a drum.
     The author quotes Burchell, Schweinfurth, Winterbottom, and other observant

and careful travellers for descriptions of frog and native music, contrasting and

comparing them together. He further shows that, so far as the evidence he has

collected goes, neither monkeys, anthropoid apes, nor babies, European or African,

--clap hands until taught that it is, in fact, an acquired habit distinct from the

stamping of feet. The arms and legs of children when young are thrown upwards
and outwards, the hands striving to grip and the feet to push. In North Euro-
pean nations, more especially ourselves, feet and sticks are still often iised to
accompany music, but hand-clapping only as applause. Similarly castanets, bones,
and rattles, except in what are termed nigger minstrelsies, are rare in use, and,

before these last were introduced from America, confined principally to ballets.

The author notices that they seem to commend themselves to certain classes, which

regard operas and theatres with dislike.
      In Southern Europe, throughout Africa and the East, as also with all savage

tribes, they are common, and form an essential part of the music.

     He also traces the oKoKvyr) of the Greeks, the Cybele, Hestia, and Osiris chants,

the modern ululuing of Cairo, and the Alleluia Chorus to these animals, quoting

Aristotle, Carl Engel, and others.
     Next he notices the mode of beating an accompaniment to the Paddlers' song

In Africa and America, and its imitation of the frog, this beating of time being

also sometimes accompanied by a drum among the Kroomen. In support of this
he quotes E. Lauder, Winwood Reade, Harrison, Rankin, Schomburgk, and
im-Thurn, showing that the imitation is so perfect that persons are again and again
deceived by it, as the author states to have been at times the case with himself in

Kaflraria.

     He next calls attention to certain vocal sounds of an iaii or iaii kind, their
908 KEPOET--1892.

production by ceitain frogs and toads, their use in names of rivers, Sec, and their

reproduction, as well as of certain kwa and aap or paa sounds in human language.
     lie quotes Livingstone, Darwin, Theocritus, and others, to show that the notes

of frogs have called forth admiration from many cultured Europeans.
     At the same time he points out that it is the ' relation ' in art which produces

admiration.

     With primitive man utility was the first thought, how to protect and preserve
himself. Hence his pleasures and tastes

     The rain following the sun was foretold by the Batrachians, the Kwakwa,
which the Greeks and many otliers believed were sent down from the sky. Hence

Ti-kwa, the Kwa unknown deity up-above, the lla of the Ohuana, the Kue-

akengteng or Kaang of the Bushmen of the Blue Mountains, the Ra or sun-god
of Egypt, the 11a of India, the Ptah and Heka of Egypt, and the Quaqua priests

of the Mexican war-god and of Thaloc.
     The frog, he believes, was probably or possibly the origin of the Aius loquens or

loqua.r,X\\e unknown voice, as is Ka, the unknowable, in Sanskrit.

    He points out that the drums speak articulately throughout Africa, and that

the hand-clapping, finger-snappings, and cracking seem also to have or have had
meanings like the clicks and the consonants.

     In order to verify his conclusions the author went to language, not as a proof

of itself, but as a secondary reference. He diflers in his conclusions as to the
value of grammatical construction, since the common people do not conform to the
rules laid down by grammarians. In unwritten tongues he believes that by com-

paring words with observations of material facts, mental peculiarities, and
customs it is far easier to trace their origins than where a language has been long

committed to writing. He considers that grammars have been frequently tam-

pered with, as have words, in the interests of rulers and priests. The result of
his researches is that, differing as their languages now do, all the Africans are
closely connected, and at some distant period were connected also with the
Monkey and Naga races of India, as is evidenced by the gigantic statue at Sravana
Belj'ola in Mysore, by certain customs, and by words identical in form and meaning
in the language of Africa and India.

    He points out that Budas existed in Africa and India, and that probably they

did, and perhaps still, exist in Australia and South-Central America.

     He agrees with some statements made bj- Father Torrend in his ' Comparative
Grammar of the South African Bantu Languages,' and the statement by this

authority that the Tongus use snakes as dogs confirms the conclusion he had

--previously arrived at that Ja or Jah is the equivalent of Sa or Sah.

     The value of the prefixes in the so-called Bantu languages as determining race
origins he denies, and believes that their use has been misinterpreted.

     He believes that an observation of natural facts gives a clue to man's history

which is borne out by language, that the mental capacity of wild races inhabiting

tropical and semi-tropical climates has been much underrated, and that this is due
to a misunderstanding of the relations between man and nature there.

     He further believes that he has been able to explain by what causes, apart
from natural selection, but upon which it acted, woman first and afterwards man

became divested of his hairy coat. His theory, if correct, explains many other

subjects which hitherto have evaded research and puzzled inquirers. For instance,

the tradition about elf-locks, the use of stone-flakes, and why they are found scat-

tered about the surface of the world, their forms and meanings, besides several
imintelligible parables, riddles, and myths.

    Lastly, he agrees with those conclusions of Dr. W. Stukeley which he has

-examined, and believes that, could he have had access to the facts the author
possesses, he would have advanced our knowledge of antiquity and true religion
instead of having been doomed to ignominy as a crack-brained lunatic.

     The author acknowledges his indebtedness to the works of many travellers and
vocabularists in verifying his conclusions. Dr. Winterbottom's work on Sierra
Leone first led him to believe that he was on the right spoor, while ' Livingstone's
Travels ' supplied him in Africa with valuable facts and suggestions.

    At times he has felt so sceptical as to the value of the work he was doing that
he has abandoned it for years. With this feelinp strong on him he read Schwein-

furth's * Heart of Africa/ and from this admirable repertory of careful observation

he drank in new hope and fresh faith. He cannot express too strongly the value

he sets on it, or the admiration it has called forth by its profoundly philosophical
reflections and manly, honest tone.

     Finally, whatever love of natural history the author has he o\^-es mainly to an
early perusal of the ' Voyage of a Naturalist in the Beagle.'

4. On the Frehensile Power of Infants. By Dr. Louis Robinson.

5. The Integumentary Grooves on the Palm of the Hand and Sole of the
    Foot of Man and the Anthropoid Apes. By David Hepiscen, M.B.,
     CM., F.B.8.E., Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy, University of Edin-

      burgh.

     After a short introductory statement the author drew attention to recent
literature dealing with this subject, and then proceeded to summarise and contrast

the functions of the hand in man and apes. This was followed by a comparison
of the obvious surface characters and differences found in the hands of man and
apes. The grouping of the muscles and their modes of action were next dealt

with. It was then shown that it was possible for the flexor, adductor, and
opposing muscles to leave their imprint on the palm.

    As a result of flexion the skin of the palm and of the digits is thrown into

folds separated by grooves, whose direction is always more or less transverse to

the long axis of these parts, but the transverse direction may be modified bv
special conditions, such as the increased development of certain muscles. The
movement of adduction or contraction results in the narrowing of the palm, and

this is indicated by grooves v.'hich run in the long axis of the palm ; but since the
muscles of this group arise in relation to the middle line of the hand, the grooves
radiate more or less distinctly from a point in front of the wrist.

     Similarly the movement of opposition is indicated by oblique lines, but these

usiially blend with the radiating lines.

     Following this, the hand of each ape was taken in turn, its principal characters
pointed out, the grooves on its palm indicated by reference to casts and drawings,
and the variations from the typical arrangement of the grooves accounted for.
After the palm of the gibbon, orang-utan, chimpanzee, and gorilla had been treated

in this way the hand of man was similarly discussed.
     Here it was shown that the same grooves prevail throughout the series, but

that the lines of flexion become modified as the muscles in the ball of the thumb
and ball of the little finger increase in size and importance. From being transverse
in the gibbon, they gradually become more and more oblique, until, as in man, the
outer end of the anterior line is pushed towards the cleft between the index and
medius digits, while the inner end of the middle line is smoothed down so that it
no longer reaches the inner border of the palm. Again, wiiat is a posterior
transverse line in the gibbon is lost in man.

     Of the radiating or longitudinal lines only one is left in man, and that occupies
the middle of the palm; but even this may not be constant. The oblique line
which in man surrounds the ball of the thumb is partly due to oi)i)osition and
partly due to adduction, so that it may also be regarded as one of the radiating

series of grooves. Lines to indicate opposition of the little finger are ill-defined

even in man, where they may be seen as faint lines running somewhat parallel to

the oblique line of the thumb, i.e., outwards and forwards from the inner border of
the palm.

     Following the hand, the foot was treated in a similar way. First, a summarv
and contrast of its functions in man and apes, then a statement of tlie surface
characters and differences in the feet of man and the apes. In the foot there are
                           --

910 REPORT-- 1892.

--no muscles of opposition, so that only two groups of muscles, viz. flexors and
--adductors are concerned in producing the plantar grooves, which are there-

 fore restricted to transverse and longitudinal or radiating grooves, with such

modifications of these as special circumstances may produce. Then there followed

 a detailed description of the naked-eye characters and the plantar grooves of the
feet of the gibbon, orang, chimpanzee, gorilla, and man. The last was discussed,
first, in reference to the foot of the newborn infant ; second, in reference to the
foot of the Australian aboriginal ; and third, in reference to the foot of civilised
man.

      In all the apes and in the foot of the newborn infant it was shown that the
same arrangement of transverse and longitudinal lines prevailed, subject to such
modifying causes as the length of metatarsal bones, the amount of web between
individual digits, the size of the hallux, and the angle at which it springs from the
inner border of the foot. In the apes the flexion lines of the hallux and sole of
the foot are distinct from each other, and it is only in the case of man, after his
great toe has become parallel to the other digits, that these lines become to a
certain extent blended. Of adduction lines, i.e., longitudinal or radiating, the new-
born human infant shows distinctly the one which indicates adduction of the

hallux.

      After the foot has become chiefly an organ of support and locomotion the
character of the grooves undergoes considerable change. This may be seen clearly
in the foot of the Australian aboriginal, where the primitive and original grooves
are smoothed out, while a new set makes its appearance. These are hnes to
express flexion, and are represented by two or three transverse lines between the
ball of the heel and ball of the great toe. Adduction is also indicated by an

indefinite mesial line of small dimensions. In the foot of civilised man the use of

boots has greatly restricted the freedom of movement, and consequently the lines
are still more indefinite, although they conform to the plan laid down.

 A7. Discussion on Human Osteometry was opened hy Dr. J. G. Gaeson.

    Sir Wm. Turner explained a method, which he had devised, of taking the

capacity of crania by the use of shot poured into the cavity of the skull through a
funnel, the spout of which was two centimetres long and two centimetres wide. The

details of the method are given in his ' Memoir on Human Crania in the Reports
of H.M.S. Challenger,^ Part XXIX. It was claimed for the method that it gave the

actual capacity, and did not overmeasure it, as is the case with Broca's method.

A demonstration of the method was given on a skull, the exact cubic capacity of

which had been previously determined by means of water.

of these cases in certain districts appeared to vary much ; their relative percentage
frequency is for English children 10-8, Irish 19'9, Jew 7'5 ; among the upper social
class 11'5, falling to 10'2 among poorer children. Among these 'development

cases' the power of resistance is low, many becoming thin, with disordered nerve-

system. Of the 50,000 childi en 7"3 per cent, were reported by teachers as dull,

and of the 5,851 ' development cases ' 40 per cent, were dull at lessons. The most

important defects were found to be those of the cranium as indicated by the pro-

portion among them delicate, dull, and with nerve-disorder or v/eakness ; many of

these cases are doubtless due to rickets. Small heads were specially common

among girls, the only defect to which they seem specially liable. The palate

comes next in frequency and importance. The import of defects of external ear

and other parts is shown. It is seen that all forms of defectiveness in develop-

ment of visible parts of the body have a significance ; they are commoner among

boys than girls, but deviations from the normal development are accompanied by

              6. On some very Ancient Skeletons from Medum, Egypt,
                                   By J. G. Garson, M.D.

     The series consists of twelve skeletons and several skulls obtained by Mr.
Flinders Petrie from Medum, in Egj^pt, and bave been determined by bimto belong

to the fourth dynasty, which dates from 3800 to 4000 B.C. If this is correct these

bones are the remains of persons who lived, in round numbers, about 6,000 years

--ago.
     Stature. Estimated from the length of the femur and tibia, according to the

European standard, the average stature of the people they represent would have

been about 1'64 metre, or 5 feet 4i inches.

      The average lengths of the tibia and radius are the same as in Europeans, accord-

ing to Rollett's averages, but those of the femur and humerus are shorter. The

proportion which the tibia bears to the femur is as 83-5 to 100, that in Europeans

is 80'4, and in the negro it is 82"9. The radio-humeral index in the Medum speci-

mens is 7S'S, in Europeans 72'5, and in negroes 79. It is very apparent, therefore,

that the proportions of both the upper and lower limbs of the Medum skeletons

agree closely with those of negroes, and difiFer essentially from those of Europeans.

      The pelvic measurements give a brim index of 85'7, while in the European it is

80, and in the negro 89. In this respect the negro affinity is not so marked as in

 the  limbs,  but  still  the  pelvic  characters  are  more  negro  than  European.

.

      The characters of the skull agree generally with those of Egyptians of later

date. The muscular ridges are moderately well developed, the sutures are simple

in character and either open or nearly obliterated. The cephalic index averages

75-8. This is almost the same as that of ancient Egyptians measured by Broca,

which averaged 75'3. Ten of the Medum specimens are dolichocephalic, eleven

are mesaticephalic, and two are brachycephalic (the limits of these groups being

respectively 70 to 74-9, 75 to 79-9, and 80 to 84-9). The cephalic index of Nubians

and negroes ranges from 73 to 75 ; that of Europeans is 78.

    The nasal index of the Medum slaills averages 47'9, while that of Nubians is

55'1, and that of Europeans is 46. Ten of the Medum specimens are leptorhine,

seven are mesorhine, and two are platyrhine.

      The orbital index of the Medum skulls averages 86'8, the gnathic index is

95"5, the upper face index (Kollmann) is 56'4, and the total face index (Kollmann)

84"8, the Stephanie index is 90S, and the bigonial is 75.

          8. On Trepanning -the Human Skull in Prehistoric Times.

                             By Robert Munro, M.A., M.D.

   A few years ago the Most Hon. the iMarquis of Bute, K.T., presented to the

National Museum of Scotland some portions of the osseous remains of a human

body which were taken out of a grave near Mountstuart House, on the island of
Bute. Along with these bones were also found an urn, a jet necklace, and a small
bit of thin bronze of an indeterminate character, all of which justified the opinion

that the interment took place in the early Bronze Age.

    According to Dr. Beddoe, to whom these bones were submitted for examination,
their owner was a young woman whose wisdom teeth had not yet appeared.

     But the special point to which Dr. Munro directed attention was a cup-shaped
hollow, situated on the left side of the frontal bone, and having in its centre a
small perforation. This hoUow lay immediately above the temporal fossa, and its
       --'                             ;

       TRANSACTIOXS OF SECTION H.      913

anterior margin, wbicli just overlapped the temporal ridge, was exactly one inch
from the outer angle of the orbit. The exterior edge of the concavity, which
measured about au inch in diameter, was slightly raised above the normal surface
of the surrounding bone, and presented an appearance somewhat like an everted
lip. This lip was a particularly noteworthy feature, as it was the result of a patho-
logical process, which could only taiie place in the liviug body. The actual perfora-

tion, which did not exceed a quarter of an inch in its greatest diameter, took the

form of a bluntly defined triangle bounded by thin edges.

     From a careful study of these facts, no experienced surgeon, Dr. Munro main-
tained, could come to any other conclusion than that this perforation had been in-

tentionally performed on the living subject, and that the subject survived the opera-

tion for a considerable time, possibly many years. In other words, they had here
the unwritten records of a successful case of trepanning in the early Bronze Age
but for what purpose the operation was performed there was no evidence to show.

     But, however correct this induction might be, it was onl}' a single example on
which it was founded, and, consequently, the evidence was inadequate to prove the
wider generalisation which it was the author's object in his communication to
establish, viz., that trepanning the human skull for therapeutic purposes was not
an uncommon surgical operation among the Neolithic inhabitants of Europe. Such
a generalisation must be based on a number of examples widely distributed both
in space and time, and to these the author then hriefly referred. Commencing with
the year 1878, when Dr. Prunieres first directed attention to a worked piece of a
human skull from a dolmen at Lozere, he traced the gradual development of opinion
on this subject as influenced by the various subsequent discoveries till 1876, when
Dr. Paul Broca delivered his memorable address at the International Congress of

Prehistoric Archasology at Buda-Pesth, and finally demonstrated that the prehistoric

--people of France practised two forms of trepanning one during life (trepanation

chirurgicale) and the other after death {trepanation posthume). Since Broca's time
further evidence in support of this opinion has come to light, and the story in the

hands of Dr. Munro is carried down to the present time. The various hypotheses
as to the object for which the operation was performed were then discussed, and it
was finally shown that in some cases at least the motive was a pure surgical

purpose. The author concluded his paper as follows :

     ' On a previous occasion, when treating of the lake dwellings of Europe, I drew

Bpecial attention to the advanced state of the culture and civilisation which their

Aremains indicated. similar reflection is now suggested by the facts which I havo

just brought under your notice. It is impossible to suppose that the widely scat-

--tered races inhabiting primeval Europe a country then so inaccessible owing to
--its impenetrable forests and marshes, impassable mountains, and great rivers could

have developed at so many independent centres a custom indicative of such a high
order of speculative intelligence. It is therefore to the original home of the
Neolithic civilisation, wherever that may be, that we must look for the origin of the-
custom of trepanning the human skull, and even there its antiquity would be

probably lost in the long vista of preceding ages.'

               Deformations connected tkerexvith. By E. H. Man.

    Mr. E. H. Man gave an account of the use of narcotics by the Nicoharesp,
notably in connection with the habit common among so many of the races of

Transgangetic India and the Archipelago of taking frequent quids of betel-nut
and quicklime throughout the day ; so firm a hold has this practice on both sexes
that ' betel-quid-taking-time ' is a recognised expression, signifying an interval of
some fifteen minutes' duration. Betel-chewing is commenced at the early ago of

ten or twelve, but instances are by no means rare of children who havo acquireil

the habit before attaining six and even four years of age ; it is but fair to add

that this infantile precocity is not encouraged by the parents. Among the sup-

posed benefits resulting from the custom are preservation of the teeth and mitiga-
tion of the attacks of malarial fever, which is so prevalent in these islands. Strange

as it may appear, the sense of taste does not seem to be vitiated in the slightest

degree, nor is the appetite impaired.

     The intentional stairiing and unintentional dental deformation ·which this habit
produces in a few weeks, under certain conditions, are explained, and the mis-
statements due to misapprehension of the real facts of the case which are found

in earlier accounts of these islanders are severally noted. Mr. Man concluded bis

paper with a few remarks on the cranial and facial deformations, which are con-
sidered by the natives of the central and southern communities to be of the highest

importance, and to the production of which the Jsicobarese mother devotes much
care and attention during the first two years or so of a child's life. The method

pursued is described carefully, and it is satisfactory to note that it cannot cause
the little one even momentary discomfort.
