                    REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

     Beport of the Council for the Year 1896-97, presented to the General
                Committee at Toronto on Wednesday, August 18, 1897.

     The Meeting at Montreal in 1884 was the first occasion on which tlie
Association held a Meeting beyond the limits of the United Kingdom.
Some of the Members then considered that it was a hazardous experiment

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

but the decided success of that Meeting fully justified the innovation,
and when an invitation was received for holding another Meeting in the
Dominion of Canada, in the University City of Toronto, the General
Committee accepted it with unanimity.

     The Executive Committee at Toronto have succeeded in making very
complete preparations for the reception, not only of British Members of our

Association, but of several Continental and numerous American Men of

Science who propose to take part in our proceedings. The Council desire
to record their grateful sense of the e0"orts made by Professor Macallum and

his colleagues to render this Meeting a success, and of the liberality with
which those efibrts have been supported by the Dominion Government,
the Government of the Province of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.
The Council also desire cordially to thank the Associated Cable Companies
for granting, under certain restrictions, free ocean telegraphy during the
Meeting to Members coming from the United Kingdom. The Council
have likewise to offer their thanks to the several Railroad and Steamship
Companies which have afforded special facilities to Members.

     The Council have nominated Sir Donald Smith, High Commissioner for
the Dominion of Canada, the Hon. Arthur Sturgis Hardy, Premier of the
ProAdnce of Ontario, and the Mayor of Toronto to be Vice-Presidents of

the Association.

    The Council heard with great regret that Mr. Alan Macdougall, who

was appointed one of the Local Secretaries for the Toronto Meeting, had
died after a long illness. Mr. Macdougall took an active part in the pro-
ceedings which gave rise to the invitation to Toronto, presented to the
Association in the year 1894, at the meeting at Oxford.

     The Council have been informed by Mr. Vernon Harcourt that he

does not intend to offer himself for re-election as General Secretary after

the Toronto Meeting. Mr. Vernon Harcourt has held the office of General
Secretary for fourteen years, and the Council desire to record their sense
of the invaluable services which he has constantly rendered to the
Association during this period. The Council recommend that Professor

Roberts-Austen, C.B., F.R.S., be appointed General Secretary in succession
to Mr. Harcourt.

     Professor Schafer having informed the Council that it would be incon

                                                                .

                                                                   REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.        Ixxxiii

venient for him to attend the Meeting at Toronto, they have requested
Professor Roberts- Austen to undertake the duties of General Secretary

during the Meeting in his place.
     The Council have received reports from the General Treasurer during

the past year, and his accounts from July 1, 1896, to June 30, 1897,
which have been audited, will be presented to the General Committee.

    The Council have elected the following Foreign Men of Science, who

have attended Meetings of the Association, to be Corresponding
Members :

Dr. F. Kohlrausch, Berlin.                                         Prof. E, Zacharias, Hamburg.
Dr. van Rijckevorsel, Kotterdam.

     The following Resolutions were referred to the Council for considera-
tion and action, if desirable :--

      (1) ' That the Council be requested to take such steps as they think
best to bring before the Government the question of the establishment of

a National Physical Laboratory, in general accordance with the recom-
mendations contained in the Report appended hereto, and to invite the

·co-operation of the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, the Royal Astronomical Society, the Physical Society, and

other kindred societies, in securing its foundation.'

     The Council, after considering this question, resolved to appoint a
Committee to bring the proposal before the Government.

     The Committee consisted of the following Members :

The President of the Royal Soc ety                                 -Royal Society.

Professor G. F. Fitzgerald

The Astronomer-Royal .

Mr. A. Vernon-Harcourt .
Captain Abney
Dr. John Hopkinson

Professor W. E. Ayrton .

The Royal Society of Edinburgh was also represented by Lord Kelvin.
The Council have been informed that, at the request of the Committee,

a Deputation waited upon Lord Salisbury, and have recently learned
that a Committee has been appointed by the Treasury : ' To consider

and report upon the desirability of establishing a National Physical

Laboratory for the testing and verification of instruinents for physical
investigation ; for the construction and preservation of standards of
measurements and for the systematic determination of physical constants
4ind numerical " data" useful for scientific and industrial purposes, and to
report whether the work of such an institution, if established, could be
associated with any testing or standardizing work already performed

wholly or partly at the public cost.'

    The following will be the members of the Committee :--

                                                                                                 e2

The T.ord Rayleigh, D.C.L., F.R.S.              Robert Chalmers, Esq., of the
                                                    Treasury.

     (2) ' That it is of urgent importance to press upon the Government
the necessity of establishing a Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain,

which, by collecting information with regard to the native races within
and on the borders of the Empire, will prove of immense value to science

and to the Government itself.'
     The Council referred this question to a Committee consisting of the

President and General Officers, with Sir John Evans, Sir John Lubbock,.
Mr. C. H. Read, and Professor Tylor. The Report of the Committee was

as follows :

   A' central establishment in England, to which would come informa-

tion with regard to the habits, beliefs, and methods of government of

the primitive peoples now existing would be of great service to science,

and of no inconsiderable utility to the Government.

1'              The  efforts  of  the  various  societies  which  have, during  the last
             .

twenty years, devoted themselves to collecting and publishing ethno-

logical information have necessarily produced somewhat unequal, and

therefore unsatisfactory, results. Such societies had, of course, to depend

upon the reports of explorers, who usually travelled for another purpose

than that in which the societies .were interested ; and such reports were

naturally unsystematic, the observers being mostly untrained in the

science. Again, whole regions would be unrepresented in the transac-

tions of the societies, perhaps from the absence of the usual attractions of
travellers, e.g. big game or mineral riches. This has been to some extent
corrected, at least as to the systematic nature of the reports, by the pub-
lication of " Anthropological Notes and Queries " by the Anthropological

Institute, with the help of the British Association.

     ' If it be admitted that the study of the human race is an important
branch of science, no further ai'gument is needed to commend the gather-

ing of facts with regard to the conditions under which aboriginal races

now live, and, if this work is worth doing, it should be done without
delay. With the exception, perhaps, of the negro, it would seem that

none of the lower races are capable of lining' side by side with whites.

The usual result of such contact is demoralisation, physical decline, and!

steady diminution of numbers ; in the case of the Tasmanians, entire
disappearance. Such will probably soon be the fate of the Maories, the
Andamanese, the North American Indians, and the blacks of Austi-alia.
While these exist it is possible to preserve their traditions and folk-lore,
and to record their habits of life, their arts, and the like, and such direct

evidence is necessarily more valuable than accounts filtered through the
recollection of the most intelligent white man.

     ' It is scarcely necessary to enlarge upon this point, as no one will
seriously question the value to science of such information. But it does

seem necessary to urge that no time be lost.

    ' 2. As to the benefit to the Government of these inquiries, the history

of our relations with native tribes in India and the Colonies is rich in

examples. No one who has read of the ways of the African can doubt

that a thorough study of his character, his beliefs and superstitions, is a

jiecessity for those who have to deal with him. And what is true of the

natives of Africa is also true, in a greater or less degree, of all uncivilised

races. Their ideas of common things and common acts are so radically
different from those of civilised man that it is impossible for him to

understand them without a special training.
     ' Even in dealing with the highly civilised natives of India it is most

necessary that an inquirer should be familiar with their religion, and

with the racial prejudices which the natives of India possess in common

Avith other civilised nations.

   A' training in knowledge of native habits is now gone through by our

--officers, traders, and missionaries on the spot ; and by experience some-

---times dearly bought they, after many failures, learn how to deal with

the natives. By the establishment of such a Bureau as is here advocated
·much might be done to train our officers before they go out, as is now
done by the Dutch Government, who have a handbook and a regular

course of instruction as to the life, laws, religion, &c., of the inhabitants

·of the Dutch Indies. The experience thus gained would then mature

rapidly, and they would become valuable servants to the State more

·quickly.

      ' The collecting of the necessary information for the Bureau could be

done with but little expense and with a very small staff only, if the
scheme were recognised and forwarded by the Government. If instruc-
tions were issued, for instance, by the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office,

the Admiralty, and the Intelligence Branch of the War Office, to the

officers acting under each of these departments, not only that they were

at liberty to conduct these inquiries, but that credit would be given to
them officially for good work in this direction, there is little doubt that

many observers qualified by their previous training would at once put

themselves and their leisure at the disposal of the Bureau.
     ' The Bureau itself, the central office, would be of necessity in London

-- --in no other place could it properly serve its purpose and preferably, for

the sake of economy and official control, it should be under the adminis-
tration of some existing Government office. But the various interests
involved make it somewhat difficult to recommend where it should
he placed. The Colonial Office would obviously present some advantages.

"The British Museum has been suggested, with good reason, and there

·appears to be no insuperable difficulty if the Trustees are willing to

undertake the responsibility of controlling such a department.

A' The staff would not be numerous.  Director accustomed -to deal

·with ethnological matter would necessarily direct the conduct of the

inquiries, and until the material assumed large proportions, two or three

<;lerks would probably suffice. If the value of the results were considered

to justify it, the increase of the area of operations over the world would

probably call for additional assistance after the Bureau had been at work

for a few years.
     ' The Bureau of Ethnology in the United States aims chiefly at pub-

lishing its reports, but its area is limited to America. The scope of the
·present proposal is so much wider that the Committee think it better not

to deal with the question of publication at present.
      ' If this report be adopted by the Council it will be necessary to

approach the Government, and impress upon them the importance of
liaving such an organisation for carrying out these recommendations.

IxXXvi                          --REPORT 1897.

For this purpose a Deputation should be appointed, and it would be well
to invite the Council of the Anthropological Institute to appoint two
members.'

    The Council resolved that the Trustees of the British Museum be re-

quested to consider whether they could allow the proposed Bureau to be

established in connection with the Museum : and if they are unable to

sanction this proposal, that the authorities of the Imperial Institute be
requested to undertake its establishment.

     The matter is now under the consideration of the Trustees of the
British Museum.

                REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.                     Ixxxvii

    At this meeting an invitation which has been received from the
Corporation of Glasgow to hold the Annual Meeting of the Association

in 1901 in that city will be presented to the General Committee.
     The Council, acting on behalf of the Association, have presented to

Her Majesty the Queen the following Address of Congratulation on the

completion of the sixtieth year of her reign :

To the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty.

May it please your Majesty,

     We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the President and
Council of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,

desire most respectfully to approach your Majesty with the expression of

our sincere and heartfelt congratulations on the completion of the sixtieth

year of your Majesty's auspicious reign.
     During that reign, which has exceeded in length that of any of your

illustrious predecessors, the increase in prosperity of your Majesty's

subjects has been unparalleled.
     This advance in the welfare of the nation has been in no small degree

due to the astonishing progress of science during this period, and its
application to the details of daily life ; and we thankfully recognise the
interest constantly displayed both by your Majesty and by members of

your Royal Family in the promotion of science. Of this, the acceptance
by His Royal Highness the late lamented Prince Consort of the Presidency
of this Association at Aberdeen, in the year 1859, was a conspicuous

illustration.

     That your Majesty's subjects in all parts of the globe are united in
their efforts to promote the advancement of knowledge is evinced by the
fact that the Association holds its annual meeting this year at Toronto,
on the invitation of one of the principal Dependencies of your Empire, the

great Dominion of Canada.
     There, as here, the Members of the Association will ever pray that

your Majesty may long be spared to rule over a contented, grateful, and

united Empire.

                Signed on behalf of the Council,

                                                  Lister,

                                                  President.

June 23, 1897.

    The Address was laid before the Queen by the Home Secretary, who

has informed the Council that Her Majesty was pleased to receive the
same very graciously.

                                   PRESIDENT.

Once more has the Dominion of Canada invited the British Association
for the Advancement of Science to hold one of the annual meetings of its
members within the Canadian territory ; and for a second time has the
Association had the honour and pleasure of accepting the proffered

hospitality.

     In doing so, the Association has felt that if by any possibility the
scientific welfare of a locality is promoted by its being the scene of such a
meeting, the claims should be fully recognised of those who, though not

dwelling in the British Isles, are still inhabitants of that Greater Britain
whose prosperity is so intimately connected with the fortunes of the
Mother Country.

      Here, especially, as loyal subjects of one beloved Sovereign, the sixtieth
year of whose beneficent reign has just been celebrated with equal rejoic-
ing in all parts of her Empire ; as speaking the same tongue, and as in

most instances connected by the ties of one common parentage, we are
bound together in all that can promote our common interests.

     There is, in all probability, nothing that will tend more to advance
those interests than the diffusion of science in all parts of the British
Empire, and it is towards this end that the aspirations of the British

Association are ever directed, even if in many instances the aim may not

be attained.

   We are, as already mentioned, indebted to Canada for previous hos-

pitality, but we must also remember that, since the time when we last
assembled on this side of the Atlantic, the Dominion has provided the

                                                                                         b2
--4 REPORT 1897.

Association with a President, Sir William Dawson, whose name is alike

well known in Britain and America, and whose reputation is indeed

Weworld-wide.  rejoice that we have still among us the pioneer of

American geology, who among other discoveries first made us acquainted

with the 'Air-breathers of the Coal,' the terrestrial or more properly

arboreal Saurians of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia Coal-measures.

On our last visit to Canada, in 1884, our place of assembly was Mont-

real, a city which is justly proud of her McGill University ; to-day we

meet within tlie buildings of another of the Universities of this vast

--Dominion and in a city, the absolute fitness of which for such a purpose

must have been foreseen by the native Indian tribes when they gave to a

--small aggregation of huts upon this spot the name of Toronto 'the place

of meetings.'

     Our gathering this year presents a feature of entire novelty and ex-

treme interest, inasmuch as the sisfer Association of the United States of

--America, still mourning the loss of her illustrious President, Professor

--Cope, and some other learned societies, have made special arrangements

to allow of their members coming here to join us. I need hardly say how
welcome their presence is, nor how gladly we look forward to their taking

part in our discussions, and aiding us by interchange of thought. To
such a meeting the term ' international ' seems almost misapplied. It may

rather be described as a family gathering, in which our relatives more or

less distant in blood, but still intimately connected with us by language,

literature, and habits of thought, have spontaneously arranged to take

part.

     The domain of science is no doubt one in which the various nations of
the civilised world meet upon equal terms, and for which no other pass-

port is required than some evidence of having striven towards the advance-
ment of natural knowledge. Here, on the frontier between the two great

English-speaking nations of the world, who is there that does not inwardly

feel that anything which conduces to an intimacy between the representa-
tives of two countries, both of them actively engaged in the pursuit of

science, may also, through such an intimacy, react on the affairs of daily
life, and aid in preserving those cordial relations that have now for so
many years existed between the great American Republic and the British

Islands, with which her early foundations are indissolubly connected ?
The present year has witnessed an interchange of courtesies which has
excited the warmest feelings of approbation on both sides of the Atlantic.

I mean the return to its proper custodians of one of the most interesting

of the relics of the Pilgrim Fathers, the Log of the ' Mayflower,' May this

return, trifling in itself, be of happy augury as testifying to the feelings of
mutual regard and esteem which animate the hearts both of the donors
and of the recipients !

    At our meeting in Montreal the President was an investigator who

had already attained to a foremost place in the domains of Physics and
                    ADDRESS.                      ?

Mathematics, Lord Rayleigh. In his address he dealt mainly with topics,

such as Light, Heat, Sound, and Electricity, on which he is one of our
principal authorities. His name and that of his fellow-worker. Professor

Ramsay, are now and will in all future ages be associated with the dis-
covery of the new element. Argon. Of the ingenious methods by which

that discovery was made, and the existence of Argon established, this is
not the place to speak. One can only hope that the element will not
always continue to justify its name by its inertness.

The claims of such a leader in physical science as Lord Rayleigh to

occupy the Presidential chair are self-evident, but possibly those of his

successor on this side of the Atlantic are not so immediately apparent.

I cannot for a moment pretend to place myself on the same purely scien-

tific level as my distinguished friend and for many years colleague, Lord
Rayleigh, and my claims, such as they are, seem to me to rest on entirely

difierent grounds.

     Whatever little I may have indirectly been able to do in assisting to

promote the advancement of science, my principal efforts have now for

many years been directed towards attempting to forge those links in the

history of the world, and especially of humanity, that connect the past

with the present, and towards tracing that course of evolution which plays

as important a part in the physical and moral development of man as it

does in that of the animal and vegetable creation.

    It appears to me, therefore, that my election to this important post

may, in the main, be regarded as a recognition by this Association of the

value of Archreology as a science.

Leaving all personal considerations out of question, I gladly hail this

recognition, which is, indeed, in full accordance with the attitude already

for many years adopted by the Association towards Anthropology, one of

the most important branches of true ArchiBology.

It is no doubt hard to define the exact limits which are to be assigned

to Archaeology as a science, and Ai'chseology as a branch of History and

ABelles Lettres.    distinction is frequently drawn between science on

the one hand, and knowledge or learning on the other ; but translate the
terms into Latin, and the distinction at once disappears. In illustration

of this I need only cite Bacon's great work on the ' Advancement of

Learning,' which was, with his own aid, translated into Latin under the

title ' De Augmentis Scientiarum.'

It must, however, be acknowledged that a distinction does exist be-

tween Archseology proper, and what, for want of a better word, may be
termed Antiquarianism. It may be interesting to know the internal

arrangements of a Dominican convent in the middle ages ; to distinguish
between the difierent mouldings characteristic of the principal styles of

Gothic architecture ; to determine whether an English coin bearing the
name of Henry was struck under Henry II., Richard, John, or Henry

III., or to decide whether some given edifice was erected in Roman,
6 REPORT-- 1897.

Saxon, or Norman times. But the power to do this, though involving no

small degree of detailed knowledge and some acquaintance with scientific

methods, can hardly entitle its possessors to be enrolled among the votaries

of science.

   A familiarity with all the details of Greek and Roman mythology and

culture must be regarded as a literary rather than a scientific qualifica-
tion ; and yet when among the records of classical times we come upon
traces of manners and customs which have survived for generations, and
which seem to throw some rays of light upon the dim past, when history
and writing were unknown, we are, I think, approaching the boundaries

of scientific Archseology.

     Every reader of Virgil knows that the Greeks were not merely orators,

but that with a pair of compasses they could describe the movements of
the heavens and fix the rising of the stars ; but when by modern Astro-
nomy we can determine the heliacal rising of some well-known star, with
which the worship in some given ancient temple is known to have been

connected, and can fix its position on the horizon at some particular spot,

say, three thousand years ago, and then find that the axis of the temple is
directed exactly towards that spot, we have some trustworthy scientific

evidence that the temple in question must have been erected at a date

approximately 1100 years B.C. If on or close to the same site we find that

more than one temple was erected, each having a different orientation,

these variations, following as they may fairly be presumed to do the

changing position of the rising of the dominant star, will also afibrd a

guide as to the chronological order of the diSerent foundations. The

researches of Mr. Penrose seem to show that in certain Greek temples, of
which the date of foundation is known from history, the actual orientation

corresponds with that theoretically deduced from astronomical data,

     Sir J. Norman Lockyer has shown that what holds good for Greek
temples applies to many of far earlier date in Egypt, though up to the
present time hardly a sufficient number of accurate observations have been
made to justify us in foreseeing all the instructive results that may be

expected to ai-ise from Astronomy coming to the aid of Archaeology.
     The intimate connection of Archaeology with other sciences is in no

case so evident as with respect to Geology, for when considering subjects

such as those I shall presently discuss, it is almost impossible to say

where the one science ends and the other begins.

    By the application of geological methods many archaeological questions

relating even to subjects on the borders of the historical period have been

Asatisfactorily solved.  careful examination of the limits of the area over

which its smaller coins are found has led to the position of many an

ancient Greek city being accurately ascertained ; while in England it has
only been by treating the coins of the Ancient Britons, belonging to a

period before the Roman occupation, as if they were actual fossils, that

the territories under the dominion of the various kings and princes who

struck them have been approximately determined. In arranging the
                                   ADDRESS.                                               7

chronological sequence of theae coins, the evolution of their types--a pro-
cess almost as remarkable, and certainly as well-defined, as any to be

--found in nature has served as an efficient guide. I may venture to add

that the results obtained from the study of the morphology of this series
of coins were published ten years before the appearance of Darwin's great

work on the 'Origin of Species.'

    When we come to the consideration of the relics of the Early Iron

and Bronze Ages, the aid of Chemistry has of necessity to be invoked.

By its means we are able to determine whether the iron of a tool or

weapon is of meteoritic or volcanic origin, or has been reduced from iron-
ore, in which case considerable knowledge of metallurgy would be involved
on the part of those who made it. With bronze antiquities the nature

and extent of the alloys combined with the copper may throw light not

only on their chronological position, but on the sources whence the copper,

tin, and other metals of which they consist were originally derived. I am

not aware of there being sufficient differences in the analyses of the native

copper from different localities in the region in which we are assembled,
for Canadian Archaeologists to fix the sources from which the metal was
obtained which was used in the manufacture of the ancient tools and

weapons of copper that are occasionally discovered in this part of the

globe.

Like Chemistry, Mineralogy and Petrology may be called to the

assistance of Archseology in determining the nature and source of the

rocks   of  which  ancient  stone  implements  are  made                    and,  thanks  to
                                                                         ;

researches of the followers of those sciences, the old view that all such

implements formed of jade and found in Europe must of necessity have

been fashioned from material imported from Asia can no longer be main-

tained. In one respect the Archaeologist differs in opinion from the

Mineralogist--namely, as to the propriety of chipping off fragments from

perfect and highly finished specimens for the purpose of submitting them

to microscopic examination.
     I have hitherto been speaking of the aid that other sciences can afford

to Archaeology when dealing with questions that come almost, if not quite,
within the fringe of history, and belong to times when the surface of our

earth presented much the same configuration as regards the distribution of
land and water, and hill and valley, as it does at present, and when, in all
probability, the climate was much the same as it now is. When, how-
ever, we come to discuss that remote age in which we find the earUest
traces that are at present known of Man's appearance upon earth, the aid

of Geology and Palaeontology becomes absolutely imperative.
     The changes in the surface configuration and in the extent of the

land, especially in a country like Britain, as well as the modifications of

the fauna and flora since those days, have been such that the Archaeologist
pure and simple is incompetent to deal with them, and he must either
himself undertake the study of these other sciences or call experts in them
--8 REPORT 1897.

to his assistance. The evidence that Man had already appeared upon the

earth is afforded by stone implements wrought by his hands, and it falls
strictly within the province of the Archaeologist to judge whether given
specimens were so wrought or not ; it rests with the Geologist to deter-
mine their stratigraphical or chronological position, while the Palaeonto-
logist can pronounce upon the age and character of the associated fauna

and flora.
      If left to himself the Archseologist seems too prone to build up theories

founded upon form alone, irrespective of geological conditions. The Geo-

logist, unaccustomed to archteological details, may readily fail to see the

difference between the results of the operations of Nature and those of

Art, and may be liable to trace the effects of man's handiwork in the

chipping, bruising, and wearing which in all ages result from natural
forces ; but the united labours of the two, checked by those of the Palae-
ontologist, cannot do otherwise than lead towards sound conclusions.

     It will perhaps be expected of me that I should on the present occa-

sion bring under review the state of our present knowledge with regard

to the Antiquity of Man ; and probably no fitter place could be found
for the discussion of such a topic than the adopted home of my venerated

friend, the late Sir Daniel Wilson, who first introduced the word ' pre-

historic ' into the English language.

     Some among us may be able to call to mind the excitement, not only
among men of science but among the general public, when, in 1859, the
discoveries of M. Boucher de Perthes and Dr. Rigollot in the gravels of
 the valley of the Somme, at Abbeville and Amiens, were confirmed by

 the investigations of the late Sir Joseph Prestwich, myself, and others,

and the co-existence of Man with the extinct animals of the Quaternary
fauna, such as the mammoth and woolly-haired rhinoceros, was first

 vartually established. It was at the same time pointed out that these
 relics belonged to a far earlier date than the ordinary stone weapons
 found upon the surface, which usually showed signs of grinding or polish-
 ing, and that in fact there were two Stone Ages in Britain. To these
 the terms Neolithic and Palaeolithic were subsequently applied by Sir
 John Lubbock.

      The excitement was not less, when, at the meeting of this Association
 at Aberdeen in the autumn of that year. Sir Charles Lyell, in the presence

 of the Prince Consort, called attention to the discoveries in the valley of

 the Somme, the site of which he had himself visited, and to the vast lapse
 of time indicated by the position of the implements in drift-deposits a
 hundred feet above the existing river.

      The conclusions forced upon those who examined the facts on the spot
 did not receive immediate acceptance by all who were interested in Geo-
 logy and Archaeology, and fierce were the controversies on the subject

 that were carried on both in the newspapers and before various learned

  societies.
--

    ADDRESS.  9

     It is at the same time instructive and amusing to look back on the
discussions of those days. While one class of objectors accounted for the
configuration of the flint implements from the gravels by some unknown
chemical agency, by the violent and continued gyratory action of water,
by fracture resulting from pressure, by rapid cooling when hot or by rapid
heating when cold, or even regarded them as aberrant forms of fossil
fishes, there were others who, when compelled to acknowledge that the
implements were the work of men's hands, attempted to impugn and set
aside the evidence as to the circumstances under which they had been
discovered. In doing this they adopted the view that the worked flints
had eLther been introduced into the containing beds at a comparatively
recent date, or if they actually formed constituent parts of the gravel then
that this was a mere modern alluvium resulting from floods at no very

remote period.
     In the course of a few years the main stream of scientific thought left

this controversy behind, though a tendency to cut down the lapse of time

necessary for all the changes that have taken place in the configuration of
the surface of the earth and in the character of its occupants since the
time of the Palaeolithic gravels, still survives in the inmost recesses of the

hearts of not a few observers.
     In his Address to this Association at the Bath meeting of 1864, Sir

Charles Lyell struck so true a note that I am tempted to reproduce the

paragraph to which I refer :

    ' When speculations on the long series of events which occurred in the

glacial and post-glacial periods are indulged in, the imagination is apt to
take alarm at the immensity of the time required to interpret the monu-
ments of these ages, all referable to the era of existing species. In order
to abridge the number of centuries which would otherwise be indispensable,

a disposition is shown by many to magnify the rate of change in pre-

historic times by investing the causes which have modified the animate

and inanimate world with extraordinary and excessive energy. It is
related of a great Irish orator of our day that when he was about to
contribute somewhat parsimoniously towards a piiblic charity, he was
persuaded by a friend to make a more libei-al donation. In doing so he
apologized for his first apparent want of generosity by saying that his
early life had been a constant struggle with scanty means, and that "they

who are born to affluence cannot easily imagine how long a time it takes
to get the chill of poverty out of one's bones." In like manner we of the
living generation, when called upon to make grants of thousands of

centuries in order to explain the events of what is called the modem

period, shrink naturally at first from making wliat seems so lavish an
expenditure of past time. Throughout our early education we have been
accustomed to such strict economy in all that relates to the chronology of
the earth and its inhabitants in remote ages, so fettered have we been by
 old traditional beliefs, that even when our reason is convinced, and we

are persuaded that we ought to make more liberal grants of time to the
Geologist, we feel how hard it is to get the chill of poverty out of our

bones.'

     Many, however, have at the present day got over this feeling, and of
late years the general tendency of those engaged upon the question of the
antiquity of the human race has been in the direction of seeking for

evidence by which the existence of Man upon the earth could be carried

back to a date earlier than that of the Quaternary gravels.
     There is little doubt that such evidence will eventually be forthcoming,

but, judging from all probability, it is not in Northern Europe that the

cradle of the human race will eventually be discovered, but in some part

of the world more favoured by a tropical climate, where abundant means

of subsistence could be procured, and where the necessity for warm

clothing did not exist.
     Before entering into speculations on this subject, or attempting to lay

down the limits within which we may safely accept recent discoveries as

firmly established, it will be well to glance at some of the cases in which
implements are stated to have been found under circumstances which

raise a presumption of the existence of man in pre-Glacial, Pliocene, or

even Miocene times.
      Flint implements of ordinary Palaeolithic type have, for instance, been

recorded as found in the Eastern Counties of England, in beds beneath
the Chalky Boulder Clay ; but on careful examination the geological

evidence has not to my mind proved satisfactory, nor has it, I believe,

been generally accepted. Moreover, the archaeological difficulty that Man,
at two such I'emote epochs as the pre-Glacial and the post-Glacial, even if
the term Glacial be limited to the Chalky Boulder Clay, should have
manufactured implements so identical in character that they cannot be
distinguished apart, seems to have been entirely ignored.

     Within the last few months we have had the report of worked flints
having been discovered in the late Pliocene Forest Bed of Norfolk, but in
that instance the signs of human workmanship upon the flints are by no
means apparent to all observers.

     But such an antiquity as that of the Forest Bed is as nothing when
compared with that which would be implied by the discoveries of the
work of men's hands in the Pliocene and Miocene beds of England,
France, Italy, and Portugal, which have been accepted by some

Geologists. There is one feature in these cases which has hardly received
due attention, and that is the isolated character of the reputed discoveries.

Had man, for instance, been present in Britain during the Crag Period,

it would be strange indeed if the sole traces of bis existence that he left
were a perforated tooth of a large shark, the sawn rib of a manatee, and
a beaming full face, carved on the shell of a pectunculus !

      In an address to the Anthropological Section at the Leeds meeting of
this Association in 1890 I dealt somewhat fully with these supposed
                                                                       1

discoveries of the remains of human art in beds of Tertiary date ; and I

need not here go further into the question. Suffice it to say that I see no

reason why the verdict of ' not proven ' at which I then arrived should be

reversed.

    In the case of a more recent discovery in Upper Burma in beds at
first pronounced to be Upper Miocene, but subsequently ' definitely

ascertained to be Pliocene,' some of the flints are of purely natural and

not artificial origin, so that two questions arise : first, Were the fossil

remains associated with the worked flints or with those of natural forms ?

And second, Were they actually found in the bed to which they have

been assigned, or did they merely lie together on the surface 1
     Even the Pithecanthropus erectus of Dr. Eugene Dubois from Java

meets with some incredulous objectors from both the physiological and the

geological sides. From the point of view of the latter the difficulty lies
in determining the exact age of what are apparently alluvial beds in the

bottom of a river valley.

    When we return to Paleolithic man, it is satisfactory to feel that we

are treading on comparatively secure ground, and that the discoveries of

the last forty years in Britain alone enable us to a great extent to recon-

Westitute his history.    may not know the exact geological period when

first he settled in the British area, but we have good evidence that he

occupied it at a time when the configuration of the surface was entirely

difierent from what it is at present : when the river valleys had not been
cut down to anything like their existing depth, when the fauna of the

country was of a totally difierent character from that of the present day,
when the extension of the southern part of the island seaward was in

places such that the land was continuous with that of the continent, and

Wewhen in all probability a far more rainy climate prevailed.       have

proofs of the occupation of the country by man during the long lapse of

found the old fioors on which his habitations were fixed, we have been
able to trace him at work on the manufacture of fiint instruments, and by
building up the one upon the other the fiakes struck off by the primaeval
workman in those remote times we have been able to reconstruct the

blocks of flint which served as his material.

     That the duration of the Palfeolithic Period must have extended over
an almost incredible length of time is sufficiently proved by the fact that
valleys, some miles in width and of a depth of from 100 to 150 feet, have
been eroded since the deposit of the earliest implement-bearing beds. Nor

is the apparent duration of this period diminished by the consideration
that the floods which hollowed out the valleys were not in all probability

of such frequent occurrence as to teach Palaeolithic man by experience

the danger of settling too near to the streams, for had he kept to the

higher slopes of the valley there would have been but little chance of his

implements having so constantly formed constituent parts of the gravels

deposited by the floods.
12 EEPORT-- 1897.

Tl\e examination of British cave-deposits affords corroborative evi-

dence of this extended duration of the Palaeolithic Period. In Kent's

Cavern at Torquay, for instance, we find in the lowest deposit, the breccia

below the red cave-earth, implements of flint and chert corresponding in

all respects with those of the high level and most ancient river gravels.

In the cave-earth these are scarcer, though implements occur which also

have their analogues in the river deposits ; but, what is more remarkable,
harpoons of reindeer's horn and needles of bone are present, identical in

form and character with those of the caverns of the Reindeer Period in

the South of France, and suggestive of some bond of union or identity of

descent between the early troglodytes, whose habitations were geographi-

cally so widely separated the one from tlie other.

In a cavern at Creswell Crags, on the confines of Derbyshire and

Nottinghamshire, a bone has moreover been found engraved with a repre-

sentation of parts of a horse in precisely the same style as the engraved

bones of the French caves.

It is uncertain whether any of the River-drift specimens belong to so

late a date as these artistic              cavern-remains                                                     but the greatly superior
                                                                                                           ;

antiquity of even these to any Neolithic relics is testified by the thick

layer of stalagmite, which had been deposited in Kent's Cavern before its

occupation by men of the Neolithic and Bronze Periods.

Towards the close of the period covered by the human occupation of

the French caves, there seems to have been a dwindling in the number of

the larger animals constituting the Quaternary fauna, whereas their re-

mains are present in abundance in the lower and therefore more recent of

the valley gravels. This circumstance may afibrd an argument in favour

of regarding the period represented by the later French caves as a con-

tinuation of that during which the old river gravels were deposited, and

yet the great change in the fauna that has taken place since the latest of

the cave-deposits included in the Paleolithic Period is indicative of an

immense lapse of time.

    How much greater must have been the time required for the more

conspicuous change between the old Quaternary fauna of the river gravels
and that characteristic of the Neolithic Period !

    As has been pointed out by Pi-of. Boyd Dawkins, only thirty-one out

of the forty-eight well- ascertained species living in the post-Glacial or

WeRiver-drift Period survived into pre-historic or Neolithic times.

have not, indeed, any means at command for estimating the number of

centuries which such an important change indicates ; but when we
remember that the date of the commencement of the Neolithic or Surface

Stone Period is still shrouded in the mist of a dim antiquity, and that

prior to that commencement the River-drift Period had long come to an

end                 and  when we  further  take into  account                                                 the  almost  inconceivable
                 ;

ages that even under the most favourable conditions the excavation of

wide and deep valleys by river action implies, the remoteness of the date
ADDRESS.  13

at which the Palaeolithic Period had its beginning almost transcends our

powers of imagination.

   We find distinct traces of river action from 100 to 200 feet above the

level of existing streams and rivers, and sometimes at a great distance
from them ; we observe old fresh-water deposits on the slopes of valleys
several miles in width ; we find that long and lofty escarpments of rock
have receded unknown distances since their summits were first occupied

by Paleolithic man ; we see that the whole side of a wide river valley has

been carried away by an invasion of the sea, which attacked and removed
a barrier of chalk cliffs from 400 to 600 feet in height ; we find that what
was formerly an inland river has been widened out into an arm of the
sea, now the highway of our fleets, and that gravels which were originally
deposited in the bed of some ancient river now cap isolated and lofty

hills.

    And yet, remote as the date of the first known occupation of Britain
by man may be, it belongs to what, geologically speaking, must be
regarded as a quite recent period, for we are now in a position to fix with

some degree of accuracy its place on the geological scale. Thanks to
investigations ably carried out at Hoxne in Suffolk, and at Hitchin in

Hertfordshire, by Mr. Clement Reid, under the auspices of this Associa-
tion and of the Royal Society, we know that the implement-bearing beds
at those places undoubtedly belong to a time subsequent to the deposit of
the Great Chalky Boulder Clay of the Eastern Counties of England. It
is, of course, self-evident that this vast deposit, in whatever manner it

may have been formed, could not, for centuries after its deposition was

complete, have presented a surface inhabitable by man. Moreover, at a
distance but little farther north, beds exist which also, though at a some-

what later date, were apparently formed under Glacial conditions. At
Hoxne the interval between the deposit of the Boulder Clay and of the

implement-bearing beds is distinctly proved to have witnessed at least
two noteworthy changes in climate. The beds immediately reposing on
the Clay are characterised by the presence of alder in abundance, of hazel,
and yew, as well as by that of numerous flowering plants indicative of a
temperate climate very different from that under which the Boulder Clay

itself was formed. Above these beds characterised by temperate plants,
comes a thick and more recent series of strata, in which leaves of the
dwarf Arctic willow and birch abound, and which were in all probability
deposited under conditions like those of the cold regions of Siberia and

North America.

   --At a higher level and of more recent date than these from which
--they are entirely distinct are the beds containing Palaeolithic imple-

ments, formed in all probability under conditions not essentially different

from those of the present day. However this may be, we have now con-

clusive evidence that the Palaeolithic implements are, in the Eastern
Counties of England, of a date long posterior to that of the Great Chalky

Boulder Clay.
14 REPORT-- 1897.

    It may be said, and said truly, that the implements at Hoxne cannot

be shown to belong to the beginning rather than to some later stage of
the Palffiolithic Period. The changes, however, that have taken place at
Hoxne in the surface configuration of the country prove that the beds

containing the implements cannot belong to the close of that period.
     It must, moreover, be remembered that in what are probably the

earliest of the Palaeolithic deposits of the Eastern Counties, those at the

highest level, near Brandon in Norfolk, where the gravels contain the

largest proportion of pebbles derived from Glacial beds, some of the
implements themselves have been manufactured from materials not
native to the spot but brought from a distance, and derived in all pro-
bability either from the Boulder Clay or from some of the beds associated

with it.

   We must, however, take a wider view of the whole question, for it

must not for a moment be supposed that there are the slightest grounds

for believing that the civilisation, such as it was, of the Palaeolithic Period

Weoriginated in the British Isles.  find in other countries implements

so identical in form and character with British specimens that they

might have been manufactured by the same hands. These occur over

large areas in France under similar conditions to those that prevail in

England. The same forms have been discovered in the ancient river

gravels of Italy, Spain, and Poi'tugal. Some few have been recorded

from the north of Africa, and analogous types occur in considerable

numbers in the south of that continent. On the banks of the Nile, many

hundreds of feet above its present level, implements of the European

types have been discovered ; while in Somaliland, in an ancient river

valley at a great elevation above the sea, Mr. Seton-Karr has collected

a large number of implements formed of flint and quartzite, which,

judging from their form and character, might have been dug out of the

drift deposits of the Somme or the Seine, the Thames or the ancient

Solent.

In the valley of the Euphrates implements of the same kind have

also been found, and again farther east in the lateritic deposits of

Southern India they have been obtained in considerable numbers. It is

not a little remarkable, and is at the same time highly suggestive, that

a form of implement almost peculiar to Madras reappears among imple-

ments from the very ancient gravels of the Manzanares at Madrid. In
the case of the African discoveries we have as yet no definite Palseonto-

logical evidence by which to fix their antiquity, but in the Narbada

Valley of Western India Palaeolithic implements of quartzite seem to be

associated with a local fauna of Pleistocene age, comprising, like that of

Europe, the elephant, hippopotamus, ox, and other mammals of species

Anow extinct.  correlation of the two faunas with a view of ascertaining

their chronological relations is beset with many difficulties, but there

seems reason for accepting this Indian Pleistocene fauna as in some

degree more ancient than the European.

    Is this not a case in which the imagination may be fairly invoked in
aid of science ? May we not from these data attempt in some degree to
build up and reconstruct the early history of the human family ? There,

in Eastern Asia, in a tropical climate, with the means of subsistence

readily at hand, may we not picture to ourselves our earliest ancestors

gradually developing from a lowly origin, acquiring a taste for hunting,

if not indeed being driven to protect themselves from the beasts around

them, and evolving the more complicated forms of tools or weapons from

the simpler iiakes which had previously served them as knives ? May we

not imagine that, when once the stage of civilisation denoted by these

Palaeolithic implements had been reached, the game for the hunter became
scarcer, and that his life in consequence assumed a more nomad character ?
Then, and possibly not till then, may a series of migrations to 'fresh

woods and pastures new' not unnaturally have ensued, and these follow-

ing the usual course of 'westward towards the setting sun' might
eventually lead to a Palieolithic population finding its way to the extreme

borders of Western Europe, where we find such numerous traces of its

presence.

    How long a term of years may be involved in such a migration it is

impossible to say, but that such a migration took place the phenomena

seem to justify us in believing. It can hardly be supposed that the pro-

cess that I have shadowed forth was reversed, and that Man, having

originated in North-Western Europe, in a cold climate where clothing

was necessary and food scarce, subsequently migrated eastward to India

and southward to the Cape of Good Hope ! As yet, our records of dis-

coveries in India and Eastern Asia are but scanty ; but it is there that

the traces of the cradle of the human race are, in my opinion, to be

sought, and possibly future discoveries may place upon a more solid

foundation the visionary structure that I have ventured to erect.

    It may be thought that my hypothesis does not do justice to what

Sir Thomas Browne has so happily termed ' that great antiquity,

America.' I am, however, not here immediately concerned with the

important Neolithic  remains of  all  kinds  with  which                                                                         this  great  continent

abounds. I am now confining myself to the question of Palaeolithic man

and his origin, and in considering it I am not unmindful of the Trenton

implements, though I must content myself by saying that the ' turtle-

back ' form is essentially different from the majority of those on the wide

dissemination of which I have been speculating, and, moreover, as many

here present are aware, the circumstances of the finding of these American

implements are still under careful discussion.

Leaving them out of the question for the present, it may be thought

worth while to carry our speculations rather further, and to consider the

Werelations in time becween the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic Periods.

have seen that the stage in human civilisation denoted by the use of the

ordinary forms of Paleolithic implements must have extended over a vast

period of time if we have to allow for the migration of the primseval

hunters from their original home, wherever it may have been in Asia or

WeAfrica, to the west of Europe, including Britain.    have seen that,

during this migration, the forms of the weapons and tools made from

silicious stones had become, as it were, stereotyped, and further, that,

during the subsequent extended period implied by the erosion of the

A^Ueys, the modifications in the form of the implements and the changes

in the fauna associated with the men who used them were but slight.

At the close of the period during which the valleys were being eroded

comes that represented by the latest occupation of the caves by Paleolithic

man, when both in Britain and in the south of France the reindeer was

abundant ; but among the stone weapons and implements of that long

troglodytic phase of man's history not a single example with the edge

sharpened by grinding has as yet been found. All that can safely be said

is that the larger implements as well as the larger mammals had become
scarcer, that greater power in chipping flint had been attained, that the

arts of the engraver and the sculptor had considerably developed, and

that the use of the bow had probably been discovered.

Directly we encounter the relics of the Neolithic Period, often, in the

case of the caves lately mentioned, separated from the eailier remains by
a thick layer of underlying stalagmite, we find flint hatchets polished at

the edge and on the surface, cutting at the broad and not at the narrow

end, and other forms of implements associated with a fauna in all essential

respects identical with that of the present day.

Were the makers of these polished weapons the direct descendants of

Palpeolithic ancestors whose occupation of the country was continuous

from the days of the old river gravels ? or had these long since died out,

so that after Western Europe had for ages remained uninhabited, it was
re-peopled in Neolithic times by the immigration of some new race of

men ? Was there, in fact, a ' great gulf fixed ' between the two occupa-

tions ? or w^as there in Europe a gradual transition from the one stage of

culture to the other ?

     It has been said that 'what song the Syrens sang, or what name

Achilles assumed when he hid himself among women, though puzzling

questions, are not beyond all conjecture ; and though the questions now
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   '

covery of many more essential facts before they receive definite and satis-
factory answers, we may, I think, throw some light upon them if we

venture to take a few steps upon the seductive if insecure paths of con-

jecture. So far as I know we have as yet no trustworthy evidence of any

transition from the one age to the other, and the gulf between them

of the relics of their industry have been assigned to a date some 3,500 to

4,000 years before our era. The men of that time had attained to the

liighest degree of skill in working flint that has ever been reached.

Their beautifully made knives and spear-heads seem indicative of a culmi-

nating point reached after long ages of experience ; but whence these
artists in flint came or who they were is at present absolutely unknown,

and their handiworks afford no clue to help us in tracing their origin.

Taking a wider survey, we may say that, generally speaking, not only

the fauna but the surface configuration of the country were, in Western

Europe at all events, much the same at the commencement of the Neolithic

WePeriod as they are at the present day.  have, too, no geological indi-

cations to aid us in forming any chronological scale.

The occupation of some of the caves in the south of France seems to

have been cari'ied on after the erosion of the neighbouring river valleys

had ceased, and so far as our knowledge goes these caves offer evidence of

being the latest in time of those occupied by Man during the Palaeolithic

Period. It seems barely possible that, though in the north of Europe

there are no distinct signs of such late occupation, yet that, in the south,

Man may have lived on, though in diminished numbers ; and that in some

of the caves, such, for instance, as those in the neighbourhood of Mentone,

there may be traces of his existence during the transitional period that

connects the Paleolithic and Neolithic Ages. If this were really the case,

we might expect to find some traces of a dissemination of Neolithic culture

from a North Italian centre, but I much doubt whether any such traces

actually exist.

     If it had been in that part of the world that the transition took
place, how are we to account for the abundance of polished stone hatchets

found in Central India ? Did Neolithic man return eastward by the

same route as that by which in remote ages his Palseolithic predecessor

had migrated westward ? Would it not be in defiance of all probability

Weto answer such a question in the aflarmative 1       have, it must be

confessed, nothing of a substantial character to guide us in these specula-

tions ; but, pending the advent of evidence to the contrary, we may, I

think, provisionally adopt the view that owing to failure of food, climatal

changes, or other causes, the occupation of Western Europe by Palseolithic

man absolutely ceased, and that it was not until after an interval of long

duration that Europe was re-peopled by a race of men immigrating from

some other part of the globe where the human race had survived, and in

course of ages had developed a higher stage of culture than that of

Palseolithic man.

I have been carried away by the liberty allowed for conjecture into

the regions of pure imagination, and must now return to the realms of

fact, and one fact on which I desire for a short time to insist is that

of the existence at the present day, in close juxtaposition with our own
civilisation, of races of men who, at all events but a few generations ago,

lived under much the same conditions as did our own Neolithic predecessors

in Europe.

     The manners and customs of these primitive tribes and peoples are
changing day by day, their languages are becoming obsolete, their myths
and traditions are dying out, their ancient processes of manufacture are
falling into oblivion, and their numbers are rapidly diminishing, so that it
seems inevitable that ere long many of these interesting populations will
become absolutely extinct. The admirable Bureau of Ethnology instituted
by our neighbours in the United States of America has done much
towards preserving a knowledge of the various native races in this vast
continent ; and here in Canada the annual Archseological Reports pre-
sented to the Minister of Education are cndering good service in the
same cause.

     Moreover the Committee of this Assoj.ation appointed to investigate
the physical characters, languages, and industrial and social conditions of
the North- Western tribes of the Dominion of Canada is about to present
its twelfth and final report, which in conjunction with those already pre-

sented will do much towards preserving a knowledge of the habits and

languages of those tribes. It is sad to think that Mr. Horatio Hale,
whose comprehensive gi'asp of the bearings of ethnological questions, and
whose unremitting labours have so materially conduced to the success of

the Committee, should be no longer among us. Although this report is
said to be final, it is to be hoped that the Committee may be able to
indicate lines upon which future work in the direction of ethnological and
archaeological research may be profitably carried on in this part of Her

Majesty's dominions.

     It is, however, lamentable to notice how little is being or has been

officially done towards preserving a full record of the habits, beliefs, arts,
myths, languages, and jihysical characteristics of the countless other tribes
and nations more or less uncivilised which are comprised within the

limits of the British Empire. At the meeting of this Association held last

year at Liverpool it was resolved by the General Committee ' that it is of
urgent importance to press upon the Government the necessity of
establishing a Bureau of Ethnology for Greater Britain, which by collect-
ing information with regard to the native races within and on the borders
of the Empire will prove of immense value to science and to the Govern-
ment itself.' It has been suggested that such a bureau might with the
^greatest advantage and with the least outlay and permanent expense be

connected either with the British Museum or with the Imperial Institute,

and the project has already been submitted for the consideration of the
Trustees of the former establishment.

     The existence of an almost unrivalled ethnological collection in the
Museum, and the presence there of officers already well versed in
ethnological research, seem to affiard an argument in favour of the proposed

bureau being connected with it. On the other hand, the Imperial Insti-
ADDRESS.  19

 tute was founded with an especial view to its being a centre around which
 every interest connected with the dependencies of the Empire might
 gather for information and support. The establishment within the last
 twelve months of a Scientific Department within the Institute, with well-
 appointed laboratories and a highly trained staff, shows how ready are

 those concerned in its management to undertake any duties that may

 conduce to the welfare of the outlying parts of the British Empire ; a fact
 of which I believe that Canada is fully aware. The Institute is therefore
 likely to develop, so far as its scientific department is concerned, into a
Bureau of advice in all matters scientific and technical, and certainly a
Bureau of Ethnology such as that suggested would not be out of place

 within its walls.

      Wherever such an institution is to be established, the question of its
existence must of necessity rest with Her Majesty's Government and
Treasury, inasmuch as without funds, however moderate, the undertaking
cannot be carried on. I trust that in considering the question it will
always be borne in mind that in the relations between civilised and
uncivilised nations and races it is of the first importance that the pre-
judices and especially the religious or semi-religious and caste prejudices
of the latter should be thoroughly well known to the former. If but a
single ' little war ' could be avoided in consequence of the knowledge
acquired and stored up by the Bui'eau of Ethnology preventing such a
misunderstanding as might culminate in warfare, the cost of such an
institution would quickly be saved.

      I fear that it will be thought that I have dwelt too long on primaeval

man and his modern representatives, and that I should have taken this

opportunity to discuss some more general subject, such as the advances
made in the various departments of science since last this Association met
in Canada. Such a subject would no doubt have afforded an infinity of
interesting topics on which to dilate. Spectrum analysis, the origin
and nature of celestial bodies, photography, the connection between heat,
light, and electricity, the practical applications of the latter, terrestrial
magnetism, the liquefaction and solidification of gases, the behaviour of
elements and compounds under the influence of extreme cold, the nature
and uses of the Bontgen rays, the advances in bacteriology and in pro-

phylactic medicine, might all have been passed under review, and to many

of my audience would have seemed to possess greater claims to attention

than the subject that I have chosen.
     It must, however, be borne in mind that most, if not indeed all, of

these topics will be discussed by more competent authorities in the various
Sections of the Association by means of the Presidential addresses or
otherwise. Nor must it be forgotten that I occupy this position as a

representative of Archceology, and am therefore justified in bringing before
you a subject in which every member of every race of mankind ought to

--be interested the antiquity of the human family and the scenes of its

infancy.

proceed the more clearly shall we realise the connection and inter-
dependence of all departments of science. Year after year, as meetings
of this Association take place, we may also foresee that ' many shall run

will be made in science, and in reading that Book of Nature that lies ever

     The first meeting of the Conference was held in the University of
Toronto on Thursday, August 19. The Corresponding Societies Com-
mittee were represented by Professor Meldola, F.R.S., Chairman, and Mr.
John Hopkinson, Secretary of the Conference.

     The Chairman suggested that, in view of the smallness of the gathering
(only eleven delegates being present), a paper on the Museums of Canada,
by Dr. Henry M. Ami, of Ottawa, be deferred to the next meeting. A.t
the Liverpool Conference the question of federation amongst the local
Natural History Societies of Great Britain had been referred to the
Corresponding Societies Committee, and the action of the Committee had
been embodied in the Report, which the Secretary would now read.

     Mr. Hopkinson then read the following Report of the Corresponding
Societies Committee :

     The Corresponding Societies Committee of the British Association beg
leave to submit to the General Committee the following Report of the
results of an attempt made, since the Liverpool Meeting, to obtain the
opinions of tlie local scientitic Societies on the question of the desirability
of a much greater amount of federation among them than at present

prevails.

     In accordance with the decision of the Committee at a meeting held
October 29, 1896, copies of Mr. Abbott's scheme for the formation of
District LTnions of Natural History Societies (which was discussed at the
Liverpool Conference of Delegates of the Corresponding Societies) were
forwarded to the sixty-six Corresponding Societies and to fifty-eight others,
together with the following letter :

      BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE.

                                 Burlington House, London, W.

                                                              Noveviber 1896.

--WeSir,  are requested by the Corresponding Societies Committee to call your

attention to a scheme drawn up by Mr. George Abbott (General Secretary of the

South-Eastern Union of Scientific Societies) for promoting District Unions of Natu-

ral History Societies, a copy of which is inclosed. This scheme was discussed at

the Conference of Delegates of the Corresponding Societies of the British Association

held at the Liverpool Meeting of the Association last September, when the great ad-

vantages of federation were generally admitted, and some examples of it were
explained. At a meeting of the Corresponding Societies Committee on October 2!»

the Report of the Conference of Delegates was considered, and it vpas decided that,

as the circumstances in which the local Societies are placed are extremely varied, it

is desirable that each Society shall be asked its opinion on Mr. Abbott's scheme, and

Weas to what kind of federation it considers to be the best.  have therefore to state

that the Corresponding Societies Committee will be greatlj' obliged if your Society

will be good enough to favour them with its views on the subject at any date not
later than December 20, 1896.

                                   We are, Sir, yours faithfully,

                                          R. Meldola, Chairman,

                                          T. V. Holmes, Secretary,

                Corresponding Societies Committee, British Association.

    When the Committee met on March 19, 1897, only twenty-six answers

had been received. The Secretary was accordingly directed to write to
eleven of the Corresponding Societies which had not replied asking for
some expression of their views on the subject of federation before the end
of April. This second application produced eight additional replies,

making the total received thirty-four, which may be thus classed :

Answers from Corresponding Societies          20
                 ,, other local Societies     14

                                              34

As regards the nature of the replies the Societies may be thus

arranged :                                    9
                                              1

   .......In close touch with a Union

                                           .

Undecided                                     4

Generally favourable to Unions                9

Unfavourable in their own cases               9

                                              34

     The answers received from Societies which already belong to a Union,
or are in close touch with one, call for no remark. The two Societies
prevented by circumstances from joining Unions are the Cambridge Philo-
sophical Society and the Marlborough College Natural History Society.
In the replies from the four Societies classed as ' undecided,' perhaps the
most significant remark is to the effect that the Club in question is doubt-
ful whether economy of energy might not be dearly purchased by loss of
'enthusiasm, and whether ' a deadening uniformity ' might not result from
Unions. Of the nine Societies generally favourable to Unions, two only,
the Hertfordshire Natural History Society and the Leicester Literary
and Philosophical Society, sent definite, detailed plans of what they pro-

posed to accomplish in their own localities. And a thii'd, the Essex Field

Club, stated that it was in communication with the Norfolk and Norwich
Natural History Society with the view of establishing some degree of co-
operation between the two Societies in the future. The others contented
themselves with the remark that union was a step in the right direction,
or with some other phrase expressing vague approval.

     The replies received from the Societies classed as ' unfavourable in
their own cases ' vary very much as to their apjjroval of federation in the
abstract. All these Societies are Corresponding Societies, and have

counties or other large areas as their spheres of work.

     It is noticeable that while most of the replies received before March 19
were, more or less, favourable to federation, those sent in answer to the
second application are all, more or less, unfavourable. This difference
between the character of the earlier and the later replies seems to point
 to the conclusion that the local Societies addressed which have sent no
26 REPORT-- 1897.

-- --answer 90 out of 124 have abstained either because they are wholly

uninterested in schemes of federation, or are more or less unfavourable to
them. Judging from answers received, it would appear that Societies
having a whole county or some district of similar size as their sphere of
operations are usually indifferent, or averse, to union with adjacent counties
or districts. Members of such Societies do not generally feel a strong
local interest in larger areas, and at the same time they do not need the

help of other Societies in the publication of their transactions. On the

other hand, experience shows that a large number of tlie smaller local
Societies are associations rather for lectures and excursions than for local

scientific work. And the brief annual reports they issue are of little
interest, except to their own members. Consequently they also are unin-

terested in questions about federation.

   A feeling unfavourable to federation may result fi-om the existence in

a district of two large towns of nearly equal importance within a few miles
of each other. Thus both the Bath Natural History and Antiquarian
Field Club and the Bristol Naturalists' Society report that some years ago

an unsuccessful attempt was made to promote some kind of union among

the local Societies there.

   A glance at the Federations of the past may be of use. Three or four

years ago the Midland Naturalists' Union and tlie Cumberland and West-
morland Association both came to an end, after the former had existed
sixteen years, and the latter a few months longer. The ultimate failure
of the Midland Union was, in all probability, largely due to the want of
any common feeling among its members of being ' Midlanders.' But
Cumberland and Westmorland are two counties which have a strona
affinity for each other, and have been much associated together in many

ways. Possibly the ultimate failure of their Association may have been

mainly the result of the absence of any town in those counties so pre-emi-
nent in size and importance as to be able to form a recognised standard
and central Society.

    Two Societies, which once belonged to the Midland Union, express a

preference for Unions like the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union. The great
advantage possessed by that federation lies, however, in the fact that all

its members, though they may live as far apart as any members of the
Midland Union once did, have the common feeling of being Yorkshire-
men. But Warwickshire, for example, may feel no special affinity for

Nottinghamshire, or the county of Leicester for that of Staflfbrd.
      In short, while no one can doubt the great desirability on all grounds

of increased federation among the various local Societies, it is obvious that
success must depend, not on the abstract merits of any given scheme, but

on its suitability to the local conditions in which it is expected to work.

     Some disappointment may be felt at the slightness of the interest
manifested in federation. But it may be hoped that many Societies which

are more or less averse to any close federation with neighbouring Associa-
tions have, nevertheless, had their thoughts profitably directed towards
--

    CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  27

the attainment of a much greater amount of mutual co-operation and

assistance than at present prevails.

     The following Societies have been added to the list of the Correspond-

ing Societies :

     1. The Halifax Scientific Society and Geologists' Field Club.
     2. The Brighton and Susses Natural History and Philosoijhical Society.
     3. The Andersonian Naturalists' Society.

     The Chairman, in inviting discussion, said that there were great
differences of opinion with regard to federation, but he thought that
much good might result from some such scheme as the grouping of
counties for occasional meetings of their Local Societies, if for no other

purpose than to avoid duplication of work. By the proceedings of Local

Societies being collected into one publication, diffuseness would be avoided,

and the money spent by individual Societies upon printing might profitably

be diverted into other channels.

    Professor Herdman said that many scientific men in provincial towns

like Liverpool had thought a great deal about this question in recent

years, but there were many difficulties in the way, some of which he dis-
cussed. As a matter of history, for one or other of these reasons, every
 attempt made by the Liverpool Geological and Biological Societies to

decide upon a line of action with other Local Societies had ended in

failure. Office-bearers in active Societies of good standing were, as a rule,
opposed to federation, and if there were one subscription to federated
Societies the income of each individual Society would be reduced.

     Dr. H. R. Mill stated that the East of Scotland Union of Naturalists'
Societies was very successful, all the members of the federated Societies
having the same feeling of local patriotism, and that the Perthshire
Society of Natural Science was one of the best of these Local Societies,
its museum being one of the sights of Perth. The Kirkcaldy Natural
History Society was also one of the best in the Union. These Societies
meet in different towns each year, have joint excursions, and are so satis-
factorily related as to give him great faith in the importance of union.

He thought there should be a better result from the action of the Corre-

sponding Societies Committee than from any other agency, and wished
that some stronger action had been taken than was indicated in its

Report.

     Mr. G. P. Hughes said that the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club was
doing first-class work in archieology and natural history, but he did not
think that federation could be accomplished in the counties of England
north of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the area being so large.

     The Rev. J. 0. Bevan spoke in favour of joint meetings of the Wool-
hope Naturalists' Field Club, the Cardiff Natural History Society, and
the Caradoo and Severn Valley Field Club. It seemed to him that the
British Association possessed the best means of leading provincial Societies

into union.

     Professor Weiss said that the Manchester Microscopical Society was
                                                              --

28 REPORT-- 1897.

willing to federate with some of the other Local Societies, and found a desire

for affiliation, but a difficulty in carrying it out, many Societies thinking
that they would lose more or less of their identity in union. He thought

that economy might be effected by original papers being published in
journals specially devoted to the branch of science of which they treat,
the Local Societies only publishing accounts of their meetings and
excursions which would be of interest to all their members.

    Mr. W. D. Spanton, while deprecating actual federation, was in favour

--of joint meetings of the Societies in his district North Staffordshire.

     Mr. R. E. Dodge (New York) mentioned the Scientific Alliance of

New York as having accomplished something by union, the announce-

ment of meetings being satisfactorily made in the Bulletin of the Alliance,
and the libraries of the different Societies being kept together in one
building. At Washington the Joint Commission, on which all the Govern-
ment scientists are represented, was formed on similar lines.

    Dr. Henry M. Ami (Ottawa) said that this question had also arisen in

Canada. For two years they had been attempting to bring about the
union of the Ottawa Literary Society and the Ottawa Field Naturalists'
Club. This club was wasting energy by the publication in the ' Ottawa
Naturalist ' of non-scientific matter which crowded out scientific papers.
There was a movement on foot in Canada to form a Canadian Academy
of Science, in which geology, botany, zoology, and microscopy would be

 represented.

      Mr. Hopkinson said that there were various ways in which federation
could be carried out, which he might roughly group under three heads

amalgamation, union, and co-operation with representation. He instanced

the Caradoc and Severn Valley Field Club as a good example of the
benefit of amalgamation, a strong field club doing good local work, and
publishing the results, having been formed by the coalition of two Societies
 which were struggling for existence. The advantages of union without
 amalgamation were well illustrated by the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union,
 each Society composing it being quite independent, but meeting together

 at an annual congress in different Yorkshire towns. Amongst its mem-
 bers were several Yorkshiremen, like himself not now residing in the
 county nor being members of any of the affiliated Societies. The publi-
 cations of the Union were devoted to the meteorology, geology, botany,
 and zoology of Yorkshire. Under the third heading might be cited the

 present Conference, or such Societies represented as were co-operating
 with Committees of Research of the British Association ; while there were
 several intermediate links between the three grades of union. Federa-
  tion, therefore, did not imply sacrifice of individuality.

                                                    Section C.

      Mr. G. W. Lamplugh called attention to the appointment of a Com-

  mittee of this Section for obtaining a collection of Canadian Geological
 Photographs, on the same lines as the British Committee.

                  Section D.

Professor Herdman requested the delegates of Societies located on the

coast to give attention to the investigation of green oysters and to the

causes which may account for the colour. If oysters were observed to be

at all tinged with green, it was desirable to ascertain whether any local

conditions, such as the presence of copper mines near the sea, or some

other pollution of the water, explained the fact. Professor Herdman said

he would be grateful for full details as to any observed cases.

    Mr. W. E. Hoyle urged the importance of the accurate use of generic

and specific names in the publications of Local Societies. In particular,
when naming new species, full and accurate descriptions should always be

given.

     The second meeting of the Conference was held in the University of
Toronto on Monday, August 23. The Corresponding Societies Com-
mittee were represented by Sir John Evans, K.C.B., F.R.S., President of
the Association, and by Professor Meldola, F.R.S., Chairman, and Mr.
John Hopkinson, Secretary of the Conference.

The Chairman said that it was usual, at this second meeting of the

delegates, to take the various Sections in alphabetical order, and hear from

representatives appointed by the sectional Committees any suggestions

they might have to make with regard to the Committees of Research to

which the Corresponding Societies could    render  assistance                                         but  he  sug-
                                                                                                   ;

gested that they should take advantage of the presence of Professor

Miall, President of Section D, who would make some remarks upon a

possible line of work in which the representatives of the Local Societies

were interested.
-- MyProfessor Miall then made the following remarks : '
                                                                                                      appearance

here this afternoon is due to the fact that Professor Meldola and myself,

who visited Niagara on Saturday, fell into conversation upon the work of
the Local Societies. Your chairman thought it might be of some use to

bring before this meeting, in the form of suggestions, as practical as

possible, some portions of our talk at Niagara Falls. The Local Societies

carry on a great variety of work, but upon that and upon the special

influence of those Societies with regard to scientific investigation I do not

intend to offer any remarks. I desire only to bring before you one par-

ticular line of inquiry which may be of interest to you, and from which

we may perceive how one side of natural history is, as it seems to me

Weunjustly neglected. I refer to the study of life-histories.                                                  study

animals and plants in a great variety of forms ; we compile statistics of
them, and we collect specimens ; but the central point of interest, the

life-history of the animal, is neglected.

    ' It may be thought that this study of life-histories is not specially
suited for the amateurs who compose a large part of the Local Societies.

It cannot be denied that the work is hard and has special difficulties con-

nected with it, for to prosecute it in an adequate manner involves some
30 REPORT-- 1897.

knowledge of anatomj and physiology, and also some acquaintance with

the problems of development as well as a considerable power of obser-

vation and much enthusiasm. These certainly appear to be large demands,

but we cannot expect to get any scientific results of real importance

which are not procured at the cost of much labour. The things which

lie upon the surface and are easily got at are, as a rule, in the present

development of science, not of very great value. If we aim at achieving

real scientific results we must expect to have to pay for them both with

our time and with our labour.

' If there be anyone here who may think of devoting himself to the

study of life- histories, I need hardly say that he has an abundant choice of

subjects, even in so narrow and so well worked a country as England.

I will ask your permission to take a run over that department of natural

history with which I have of late years occupied myself. I refer to the

study of insects. Anyone who has occupied himself with promoting the

scientific study of insects will, I think, agree with me when I say that almost

everything still remains to be done. The insects have been collected and

classified, but with rare exceptions their life-histories are still unknown.

Let me instance the Le^iidoptera and Coleoptera, for the simple reason

that they are better known than the rest. "VVe know well their external

forms or shapes ; the stages of many have been recorded and drawn ; and
along with these external features we know something about their food-

plants, mode of life, and so on ; but how their mode of life and peculiarities
of structure are interrelated we know not. I think it is a reproach to

the naturalists of our generation that they are content to leave the higher

knowledge of insects and devote tlieir whole attention to mechanical details.

' As a type of M'hat I am dealing with, let me refer you to the common

Diptera. I do not think that more than a dozen out of the vast number of

these insects have been thoroughly investigated. It seems that 200 or 300

have been studied, at least superficially, and of these we know more or less;

but they are among many thousands of which it seems that we are practi-
cally in complete ignorance. "What, then, can we expect to learn about such

a subject as this unless we are prepared to meet difficulties and incur the

cost of time and labour ? Here is a vast and important field inviting the
attention of naturalists ; and when we consider the number of enthusiastic

naturalists scattered, not only over our own, but also over every other

country, we might surely expect most important results if this business

were taken seriously in hand.

    ' As to the methods of inquiry, let me suppose that any one of you

intends to take up li\ e natural history. I should recommend him to study

the things which are commonly found round about  him                    to procure those
                                                                     ;

animals which he is accustomed to see again and again every day, and

which he will not have to go a mile or two to procure, say from the nearest

stream if not too far away. Then as to the helps which exist, there is a

literature of this subject ; but one difficulty is that most, if not all, of this

literature is written in a foreign language. Malpighi wrote in Latin, and
   CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.                                           31

   Swammerdani in Dutch, Reaumur in French, while Boerhaave translated
   Swammerdam's work into Latin.

         ' It is singular that so great a lapse of time has taken place with little

   addition to the literature of this subject, since these writers are of the

   seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The work which they carried
   forward with so much promise of high achievements was allowed to fall
   into neglect. There are a few exceptions, but, generally speaking, from the
   commencement of the century up to the present time the subject seems to

   have fallen into almost complete abeyance.

        ' To incite beginners to undertake this special work of the study of life-

   histories, I think that something might be done if we were to put before
   them a single example of a common insect worked out with some degree of
   detail. If that were done in England it would get over the difficulty felt
   by naturalists who have not made acquaintance with a foreign language.

   We have hardly any examples of life-histories worked out and presented

   to us in a thoroughly acceptable form. This difficulty seems to me so
   considerable that I am now trying to draw up such a life- history of the

   Chii-onomus, or blood-worm, which is everywhere accessible. It is one

   of the most instructive insects known to naturalists, and in twelve months

   I hope to have its life-history ready for the use of the student.

   ' But it is not enough merely to have a book put into the hands of

   students ; they must know how the actual work of observation is done.

   It might be possible to pick up from among the members of the Corre-

   sponding Societies in various parts of England an enthusiastic party of

   young men and show them how particular things are done. For instance

   how to capture certain kinds of insects, how to study them anatomically,

   how to disclose the embryonic development and the inner changes which

   accompany metamorphosis. Let me suppose that out of the members of

   the Local Societies situated within convenient distance of the city of Leeds

   where I have my laboratory, twelve should agree to assemble some time

   next summer, say in July, and take up the work which I have proposed,

   each to bring his own microscope, if he has one. I will then undertake to

   go through a quite elementary course of training on the Chironomus, its

   life-history and its development. I think I can undertake to initiate

   such a party of investigators into a useful method of carrying on the study

   of life-histories, and I think they will carry home with them, from a short

   Wecourse of study, a detei'mination to pursue the work.  could then try

   the experiment in another district, London for instance ; and I should also
   be glad to do anything by way of correspondence to further this study.

   ' If we should succeed in carrying out this plan it might lead to a

   revival of the study of natural history in our country. Each student

   might turn into a centre of infection when he went home, and spread the

   virus through his brother naturalists. Let us look forward to such a

   revival, and if the suggestions which I have made should command for

   this subject the sympathy it deserves, we may realise a bright future for

   this important branch of knowledge.'

--32 REPORT 1897.

     Sir John Evans expressed the indebtedness of the meeting for the

practical suggestions of Professor Miall. He hoped that those present

would realise the desirability of extending the work of the Local Societies

in the direction indicated. Listening to Professor Miall's plea for the
study of the life-histories of insects, he recalled the observation of a great

ancient authority, Pliny, who said that the nature of things is nowhere
more complete than in the least (Cum natura rerum nusquam magis

qicam in minimis tota sit), a remark which he thought foreshadowed the
results discovered by naturalists by means of the mici'oscope in modern

times.

     The Chairman said that he would like to express the hope that when
Professor Miall's suggestions had been circulated among the members of
the Corresponding Societies, and his ideas had borne fruit, they would

have the pleasure of hearing, at another Conference, of his students having
achieved valuable work under his tutorship.

    Dr. Ami then read his ' Report on the State of some of the Principal

Museums in Canada and Newfoundland,' which was ordered by the

General Committee to be printed in extenso, see p. 62.
     The Chairman said that he could not help being struck with the great

wealth of material existing in Canada. Englishmen must feel a certain
amount of regret that the museum question is not taken up with more
earnestness in their own country. Their provincial museums only existed
with much difficulty, and were altogether dependent upon private bounty
in carrying on their existence. Anyone who visits many of the local
museums in England must see that the museum question has not taken

that prominent part in public opinion which it ought to do. Dr. Ami

had collected a vast amount of information of great value. There must
be in the museums of Canada much valuable material in the way of types,
and students in all parts of the world would be the gainers if it were
widely known where those types were to be found.

     Professor Prince explained that the Fisheries Collection at Ottawa
under his charge was made for the Fisheries Exhibition in London in
1883, and was brought back to Canada and given a permanent home. It
was scarcely representative of the various fisheries of the Dominion, but
it was an interesting collection to anyone coming from the old country, as
it represents the waters of a country abounding in ganoids and other

remarkable creatures of scientific interest. He considered the Victoria
Museum to be a perfect model of its kind.

     Professor Meldola then proposed a vote of thanks to Dr. Ami, and
     Mr. Hopkinson seconded it, remarking that he was specially interested
in the museum question at the present time, for, with other members of
the Hertfordshire Natural History Society, including Sir John Evans, he
was now endeavouring to raise sufficient money to build and endow a
museum for Hertfordshire, for which Earl Spencer had granted an ample
site at St. Albans. They had already been promised about 1,500/., but
had decided not to commence building until 2,000/. had been raised.
      CORRESPONDING SOCIETIES.  33

A temporary museum had been opened at St. Albans, and he felt sure,

from their success in obtaining objects of local interest for it, that if the
money required could be raised an interesting and valuable collection

would be got together. He feared that Dr. Ami's paper was too long to

be published in the Report of the Conference of Delegates, but as the
Conference stands upon the same footing as any Section of the Association,
it was empowered to suggest to the Committee of Recommendations that
this paper was considered of sufficient importance to be published in

extenso in the Report of the Association, and he moved that this request

be made.
     The vote of thanks and recommendation were carried unanimously.

                                                Section H.

     Professor Haddon, speaking on behalf of the Ethnographic Survey
Committee, said that it seemed to him that, while the Local Societies
properly spend a great deal of time on natural history, they neglect the
study of man, who is an animal, and deserves to be studied as thoroughly
as the lower animals. Local Societies might well undertake a survey of

the ethnography of their own districts. He would be sorry to draw

students away from the study of other branches of natural history, but he
thought that there must be many members of the Local Societies who did
not study the fauna, the flora, or the geology of their locality, but would
be interested in ethnographical work of some kind. There are several
anthropological investigations which could be attempted almost anywhere.
Besides observations on the colour of the hair and eyes, the stature, the
shape of the head, and other physical characters, the customs and beliefs
of the people and their folk-lore should be studied. As examples, mention
need only be made of local customs on particular days, or the numerous
and very interesting singing games of children, such as 'Jenny Jo,'
' Dukes-a-riding,' ' Green Gravel,' and the like. These might seem to be
trifling matters, but many such customs and games are the only records
we have left to us of the religious rites and social customs of our
ancestors, and therefore they are by no means to be despised. It would
also be advisable for the local scientific and photographic Societies to
interest their members in depicting the geology, natural history, and

ethnology of their district, the latter especially. Many opportunities for

the study of British anthropology are vanishing or becoming modified,

just as surely as are corresponding details in the islands of the Pacific.

Meport on the State of the Principal Museums in Canada and Neiv-

    foundland. By Henry M. Ami, M.A., D.Sc,, F.G.S., of the

      Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa.

                  [Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in extenso.']

The following report on the state of the principal museums in Canada

and Newfoundland is based upon information contained in a correspond-
ence between the Director of the Geological Survey Department at
Ottawa (Dr. Dawson) and the curators or officers in charge of the several
museums, who very kindly supplied the information desired.

     The four following points in connection with museums received

particular attention :

     1. The approximate number of specimens classified and displayed in
each museum.

     2. The relative importance of collections in geological, mineralogical,

botanical, zoological, ethnological, or other classes of material.

    3. Any special collections acquired from individuals included in the

museum.
     4. Types of species (if any) preserved in the museum, with the name

of the describers.

     The order in which the several museums are presented is r/eographi-
cal. Beginning with the most easterly one, the Museum of the Geo-
logical Survey of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, and closing
with the Provincial Museum of British Columbia, Victoria, British

Columbia.

     The principal object in view in preparing this report was to gather
definite information regarding the amount of material at present housed
in the various museums of the country, and thus enable the Director of

the National Lluseum at Ottawa and others, to whom applications for

information are constantly coming in, to give satisfactory replies.
     The report consists of a consecutive list of museums in Canada and

Newfoundland, including only the principal ones known to the Depart-

ment, with brief descriptions or abstracts of the contents of the different

museums enumerated.
     Brief descriptions and notes on fifty-one private collections in Canada

are also added.

     This report does not profess to be complete in every respect. The in-
formation presented, however, has been obtained from the most reliable

--sources available from official letters sent by the curators or officers in

charge of the several museums addressed, or from published papers and
reports on the contents of museums in the different provinces.

     The thanks of the writer are due to Dr. G. M. Dawson, Director of the

Geological Survey Department at Ottawa, for many valuable suggestions

--and kind ofiices in preparing this report.

--TJie Ai^plication of PJiotography to the Elucidation of Meteorological
     Phenomena. Seventh Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr.
     G. J. Symons (Ghaii-man), Professor E. Meldola, Mr. J.
    HoPKiNSON, Mr. H. N. Dickson and Mr. A. W. Clayden {Secre-

     tary). (Brawn up by the Secretary.)

The work of the Committee has been continued during the past year,

especially with regard to the measurements of cloud altitudes by means of

Aphotography.      considerable number of the results given in the report

for 1896 have been verified by repeating the reduction of the plates.

In order to afford an efficient check upon the accuracy of last year's

results, the altitude and azimuth of the sun were calculated by a different

method and the altitude of the cloud deduced from a fresh set of co-

ordinates measured on the plate.

In no case did the new determination differ more than about 3 per

cent, from the old one, and in the majority of cases the agreement was

very much closer. Particular attention was given to the instances in

which the clouds had been determined to be floating at unusually great

altitudes, and there is no doubt that those determinations are substantially

correct.

     During the last nine months it has not been possible to keep up a
continuous series of photographs. The excessive rainfall of the early part
of the year transformed the level ground between the camera stands and

around one of them into a series of muddy pools, so that work was impractic-
able. But with this exception exposures have been made whenever

opportunity offered, and the stock of negatives has been largely increased.
     None of these additions have yet been reduced. The time available

for the observations is limited, and it has been thought better to accumu-
late negatives during the finer part of the year and reserve them to be
reduced in the winter, when opportunities for making observations are

rare.

     The warping of the ebonite shutters of the cameras has again proved
troublesome, and steps have been taken to get them replaced by similar
pieces of aluminium, a change which will probably be effected before this
report is presented. Some delay was also caused by the mischievous
behaviour of some unknown persons, who, on .Tune 22, amused themselves
by breaking the connecting wires and endeavouring to upset one of the
camera stands.

      Leclanche cells of the ordinary pattern have been substituted for the
faulty dry cells formerly used, and have given complete satisfaction.

     There is a good stock of plates in hand, and the photographs will be
continued during the summer.

    No fresh departure having been made, and the current expenses not

being heavy, the grant made at Liverpool has not been drawn.
     The work of the Committee being now limited to the investigation in

the hands of the Secretary, who will continue it at his own expense, no

grant in aid is asked, but the Committee would wish to be reappointed

for another year.

Cmiclusions and Suggestions for a Seismic Survey of the World .             . 204

I. Report of Work donefor the establishment ofa Seismic Survey of the World.
Professor Milne has reported to the Committee that on January 31,
1895, he had issued a circular calling attention to the desirability of
observing earthquake waves which had travelled great distances, with
working drawings of the necessary installations.

     Some months later Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz drew up suggestions

for the establishment of an international system of earthquake stations.
To this scheme Professor Milne and other members of the Committee lent
their names.

     After the death of von Rebeur these suggestions were translated into

French and issued by Dr. G. Gerland of Strassburg, on his own respon-

sibility.

     For this reason, but more especially because individual efforts have not
led to any definite results, the Committee have issued a letter to a number

of observatories requesting co-operation in the observation of earthquakes
which are propagated round and possibly through the earth.

     Dr. Michie Smith has informed Professor Milne of the co-operation

which might be expected from the Government of Madras. The Kew

Committee have decided to establish an instrument.
     Mr. Oldham, Director of the Geological Survey of India, has evinced a

desire to assist in making observations. It is likely that Professor Turner
of Oxford will purchase a seismograph, whilst others have made inquiries

respecting the necessary installation. Sir Clement Markham has already

offered his hearty support in carrying out a seismic survey of the world,

1897.                                                                    K

and there were strong reasons for believing that we might expect assist-
ance from both the Royal Geographical and Eoyal Astronomical Societies.

  --giB^ It has been established that the movements resulting from a

large earthquake originating in any one portion of our globe can, with
the aid of suitable instruments, be recorded at any other portion of the
same ; therefore the Seismological Investigation Committee of the
British Association are desirous of your co-operation in an endeavour

to extend and systematise the observation of such disturbances.
     Similar instruments should be used at all stations ; and the one

recommended by this Committee as being simple to work, and one that
furnishes results sufficiently accurate for the main objects in view, is

Mindicated in the accompanying report (see pp. 2-4) by the letter ; a

sketch of the same is shown on p. 7, whilst there is an example of one of

its records on p. 49.

    We desire to know whether you are disposed to purchase, and make

observations with, one of these instruments, the cost of which, including

photographic material to last one year, packed for shipment, is about 50Z.

Should you reply in the affirmative, we shall be pleased to arrange with
a competent maker for the construction of an instrument for you, and to

furnish instructions respecting installation and working. In case an

instrument be established at your observatory, we should ask that notes

of disturbances having an earthquake character be sent to us for analysis

and comparison with the records from other stations. From time to time

the results of these examinations would be forwarded to your observatory.

     The first object we have in view is to determine the velocity with
which motion is propagated round or possibly through our earth. To
attain this, all that we require from a given station are the times at

which various phases of motion are recorded ; for which purpose, for the

present at least, we consider an instrument recording a single component
of horizontal motion to be sufficient. Other results which may be ob-

tained from the proposed observations are numerous.

     The foci of submarine disturbances, such, for example, as those which

from time to time have interfered with telegraph-cables, may possibly be
determined, and new light thrown upon changes taking place in ocean beds.

     The records throw light upon certain classes of disturbances now and

then noted in magnetometers and other instruments susceptible to slight

movements ; whilst local changes of level, some of which may have a

diurnal character, may, under certain conditions, become apparent.

     Trusting that you will find it possible to co-operate in this endeavour

to extend our knowledge of the earth on which we live,

       We remain, Sir (on behalf of the Committee),

                                                  Your obedient servants,

       To the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Aifairs, Whitehall, London.

   --Sir, I am directed by the Seismological Committee of the British

 Association for the Advancement of Science to state that they are anxious
 to obtain the assistance of the Marquess of Salisbury with a view to
 ascertaining, through Her Majesty's representatives in the countries
 mentioned, whether the Governments of the same would be disposed to

 co-operate in carrying out the observations indicated in the inclosed
 circular, which are considered of great scientific importance.

      The countries with which the Committee desire to communicate are

 Chili, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, U.S. of Columbia, Mexico, Brazil, the
 Netherlands for Java, Greece, Spain, Portugal for the Azores, Russia for
 Russia and Siberia, and Japan.

     Should his Lordship be pleased to grant the assistance of Her
Majesty's Government in this matter, I shall have the honour to forward

further copies of the circulars and pamphlets of which specimens are

 inclosed.

     The Committee have learned that the Government of Madras are
desirous to establish a station ; whilst Admiral Wharton, Hydrographer
to the Admiralty, considers the attainment of the objects in view of great

practical value to his department.
                         I have the honour to remain. Sir,

                                 Your most obedient and humble servant,

                                  Communication with the Colonial Ofice.

   A letter identical with that sent to the Foreign OfiSce, and in which

--thefoUowing colonies were mentioned Newfoundland, Bermuda, Barbados,
--Trinidad, Jamaica, Honduras, Guiana, St. Helena, the Falklands, Cyprus,

and Malta was forwarded on February 25, 1897, to the Colonial Office.

     Communication with the Under-Secretari/ of State for India, April 10, 1897.

   A letter in terms similar to the two preceding letters was addressed

to the Under-Secretary of State for India asking for co-operation in
establishing one station at Aden, three in India, and one in Further

India.

     The results of these three communications have been that the Marquess
of Salisbury has granted the co-operation which was asked, a reply is
promised from the Colonial Office, whilst the Under-Secretary of State
for India has asked for and received more copies of our circulars and

reports.

     The first of the above seismographs constructed in 1883, partly at the

expense of the British Association, still continues to be used as the
standard instrument at the Central Observatory in Tokio.

    I am indebted to the Director of that institution for the following

--numerous. The foci of submarine disturbances such, for example, as

those which from time to time have interfered with telegraph cables

may possibly be determined, and new light thrown upon changes taking

place in ocean beds. The records throw light upon certain classes of dis-
turbances now and then noted in magnetometers and other instruments
susceptible to slight movements, whilst local changes in level, some of

which may have a diurnal character, may, under certain conditions, become

apparent.

  --The Instrument. The general features of a type of instrument which

the Committee have selected as being sufficient for the attainment of
the objects in view are shown in the accompanying sketch.

     The instrument consists of an iron bed-plate and stand carried on

                                                                     Fig. ].

three levelling screws. Resting against a needle-point or pivot projecting
from the base of the stand, and held in a nearly horizontal position by a

tie, is a light aluminium boom. Attached to the outer end of this boom
there is a small rectangular plate in which there are two slits, one of which
is large and the other is small. Partly for the purpose of balancing the
weight of the outer end of the boom, and partly for obtaining the ' steady

point ' of a seismograph between the attachment of the tie to the pivot, a
weighted cross-bar is pivoted.

    When the boom swings to the right or left, the rectangular plate with

its slits passes to the right and left across a fixed slit in the lid of a box,
inside which a 2-inch (50 mm.) strip of bromide paper is being driven by
clockwork. Light from a lamp is reflected downwards by a mirror to
cover the whole of the latter slit. It however only enters the box to

                                                 J
                   ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.        139

the right and left of the floating-plate and through the slits in the same.

When the boom is steady, the resulting photogram on the moving bromide

paper will be, when developed, that of a white band equal in width to

that of the moving- plate, down the centre of which band are two very

clearly defined lines, one of which is thick and the other thin (tigs. 2, 3,
and 5). To the right and left of this white band the paper will have
been blackened by the light which entered at the two ends of the fixed

slit. On one edge of one of these black bands, at intervals of about

50 mm., there will be seen a series of white marks which have been

produced by the minute-hand of a watch, the broadened extremity of

which has hourly at the half -hour passed over the efid of the fixed slit,

and for a period of about one minute eclipsed the light.

Should the clock at any time have failed to drive the bromide strip

with regularity this will at once be seen by differences in the distances

--between successive time marks.
    Installation. The instrument may be placed on any solid pier in an

observatory, on a specially constructed pier in the ground-floor of an ordi-

nary dwelling, or in a hut or shed in the open. The room should be dry,

which will generally be the case if means are provided for ample ventila-

tion. In order that the photographic paper may be examined or removed

at any time, the windows of the room should be provided with shutters,

Athrough one of which red light can be admitted.          column or pier of

convenient size may be two bricks, or 18 inches (45 cm.) square, which
rises 2 feet 8 inches (80 cm.) above the floor. The base of this may rest

on a 6-inch (15 cm.) layer of concrete, which in turn rests on a bed of

gravel rammed in the natural earth. The top of such a column may be

made smooth by a thin facing of cement, whilst its sides should be oriented

N.-S. and E.-W. It is convenient to have space to pass round the pier on

three sides. The table, which projects from the column in a N.-S. direction

and carries the clock-box should be strong, 3 feet 8 inches (1*12 m.) long,

3 feet 7 inches (1'09 m.) broad, and rise 1 foot 8 inches (50 cm.) above

the floor of the room. The upper surface of this table is therefore exactly

1 foot (30 cm.) below the top of the column. If an existing pier is used

the height of the table must be increased or decreased to maintain the last

dimension. The table is made wide to gi%'e space for the clock-box, which

is run out upon it from its covering-case when removing a film.
    The installation may be on an alluvium plain or on solid rock.

  --Adjustment of the Pendulitm. The instrument is to be so placed that

the boom is in the meridian, or points N.-S. The balance weight is to be

placed at a distance of 3| inches (87 mm.) from the pivot, and the attach-
ment of the tie at a distance of about 5 inches (125 mm.). At the latter

point, but not shown in the sketch, there is a small upright, from the top

of which a thread is carried to within about 9 inches (22 cm.) from the

outer end of the boom. This is to prevent the boom from sagging. After

the bed-plate of the stand has been made approximately level, the boom

is suspended, as shown in the sketch, with its outer end about ^ inch
(3 mm.) above the top of the clock-box. To increase or decrease this
distance the tie, the last inch or so of which at its upper end is made of

unspun silk, may be shortened or lengthened by means of a screw at the

top of the stand.

The next point is to give the boom a certain sensibility, which

increases as the period of its swing increases. Tlie sensibility which

must be arrived at is that which corresponds to an adjustment that
140 REPORT--1897.

--results in the pendulum having a period of 15 seconds that is to say,

it is reached when the pendulum makes one complete swing or one back

and forward motion in 15 seconds. To make this adjustment the pivot

against which the boom abuts may be moved in and out until the desired

period is approximately obtained, after which the front screw of the stand

may be raised or lowered until the adjustment is completed. To observe

the period the observer presses with his hand against the side of the

column. This sets the boom in motion. He then goes to the end of the

instrument, and, looking downwards through a plate of glass beneath the

lamp, watches the rectangular plate on the end of the boom and notes

with a watch how many seconds it takes for the boom, as it slowly moves

across the scale of millimetres fixed in the top of the clock-box parallel to

the slit in the same, to complete a back and forward motion. For various

reasons it seems that in all forms of horizontal pendulums this quantity

will not remain constant for any great length of time. It therefore must

be noted, say, once a week, and if any marked change has taken place the

instrument should be readjusted. For stations founded on rock the pendu-

lum may be adjusted to have a period of 18 seconds ; but with a pendulum
having this sensibility in a station on alluvium, the diurnal motion may

exceed the width of the slit in the clock-box, and with changes of weather

and the seasons the wandering of the pendulum to one side or the other

will be so great that readjustments will be continually required.

The boom is to be brought into a central position by turning one or

other of the two back screws in the bed-plate.

  --The Sensibility of the Instrument. The distance between the two

back screws of the instrument is 150 mm. The front one of these has

0-5 mm. pitch, so that one complete turn of this would tilt the

stand through an angle the tangent of which would be measured by

=X3 -r5~o a^o- -^y nieans of a lever fitting the head of the screw, rather

than giving it a complete turn, it may be turned 1°, 2°, or any other

fraction of a complete turn that may be desired, this quantity being

indicated by a pointer attached to the screw which moves over an arc

gi-aduated in degrees. For example, assuming that the boom has a period

of 18 seconds, and we find by several trials that a 1° turn of the

test-screw corresponds to a deflection of the outer end of the boom of

5 mm., as shown on the scale opposite the slit in the clock-box, and
assuming, further, that we can read displacements on the photogram of

1 mm., under these circumstances we can measure tiltings the angular

values of which would be

                          X X X,,--r^ -  -

2 150 360 5 540000'

and because 1 sec. of arc=l/206265, it follows that 1 mm. deflection of
the outer end of the boom corresponds to a tilt of 0"-38.

     If we read deflections to within half a millimetre, to do which there is

no difficulty, the sensibility of the instrument is doubled. For the object

in view this is not required, and if a deflection of 1 mm. is obtained for a

--tilt of 1" to 0''-5, this will he. sufficient.
     Clock-box. This, which can be run on rails in and out of the instru-
ment-case, has a cover which is removed to wind the clock and put new

paper in the roll. Once a day, when the lamp is filled and trimmed, and

the watch is wound, this cover is removed, and the 3 or 4 feet of paper

which has accumulated is roughly rolled up. At this time the date may

be written in pencil on the bromide film on the top of the upper roll.
The small top roll shown in the sketch should barely touch its neighbour,
whilst a corresponding roll in contact with the driving-roll should press
somewhat tightly on the latter. These two latter rolls are not shown in

the sketch. Should the papers at any time refuse to move freely, it may

be necessary to alter the adjustment between these rolls to see that they
have not become sticky by contact with the bromide surface, or even to
cover the driving-roll with a piece of thin but roughish paper. If
moisture is suspected as being the cause of a stickiness of the bromide a

saucer of calcium chloride may be placed in the clock-box. The most

convenient form in which to use this substance is as cake mixed with
asbestos. Every week this can be dried over a strong fire.

     Calcium chloride, or other desiccating agents, must not be introduced in
the instrument-case, for if they are a circulation of air is set up, and the
boom swings to and fro, giving records which have often been called earth-
tremors. For earthquake work the driving-roll must be adjusted in its
outermost position, when it will turn once per hour. In its inner position

it turns once in twelve hours, when it may be used, for example, for studying

the diurnal wave.

   --The Watch. This must be compared fairly often with a standard

timekeeper, and its rate noted. It is particularly important that the
time at which its hour-hand commences and ends its eclipse over the slit
in the clock-box be noted, as it is from these markings that the times of
earth disturbances are measured. This can be done either by watching

the hour-hand of the watch by looking down the tube down which the
mirror reflects light, or by watching the same when the clock-box is taken

out of the instrument-case.

   --Developing,fixing, and copying the Film. The films, which are 25 feet

in length, are developed once a week. The developer employed has been

chosen, because the same solutions may be used for several successive
developments. The stock is kept as two separate solutions, made up as

follows :

               ' Sulphate of soda,                                                     I oz.   or 1 part by weight.

     For use one ounce of each of these solutions is to be taken and mixed
with about 24 ounces of water, and the whole is then poured into the

developing- tray.

     The film is doubled backwards and forwards in this solution, and the
tray kept agitated until the development takes place, when the solution
is poured off into a bottle to be kept until the following week. After the
second time of use it may be strengthened with half an ounce of each of
the above two solutions, when it will last two weeks longer. It is then
thrown away. The next operation is to pour water once or twice into the
developing-tray, and to rinse the film, after which it is dragged bodily over
the end of the tray into a second tray containing a strong solution of
hyposulphite of soda (1 hypo and about 4 water). Whilst in this solu-
tion the folds of the film are one by one gently opened to allow the hypo
--142 REPORT 1897.

to penetrate. After 10 or 15 minutes, when, by examination of the back
of the film, all trace of yellow colour in the film is seen to have dis-
appeared, the hypo is poured back to its bottle and the film is thoroughly
washed for at least 15 minutes in several changes of clean water. The

those shown over a distance of about a quarter of an inch on the left-hand
side of fig. 2 (' British Association Report,' 1896, fig. 19, p. 229,') which is
the diagram of an earthquake recorded at Carisbrooke Castle, in the Isle
of Wight, but which had its origin in Japan. The reason that two spots
of light are used is that for slow movements the fine line gives the best
definition, but for rapid movements the light passing through the fine slit
is not sufficient to produce an impression on the photographic surface,
and therefore, as in the middle of the figure, we have to rely on the image
from the large spot.

     Because the watch makes its eclipses at the half-hour the intervals
marked as 20 hours, 21 hours, and 22 hours are read as 20-5 hours, 21 "5
hours, and 22'5 hours, and then corrected from the known rate of the

watch and the observed time of the eclipses. What is chiefly required

144 REPORT^189/

from such a diagram is the Greenwich mean time of the commence-
ment of the preliminary tremors which is near the small arrow, the
commencement of decided motion, and the duration of the disturb-
ance. After this, notes may be made of the number of maxima dis-

placements.

     Such notes, together with a tracing or photographic reproduction of
the diagram, should be sent to the Seismological Committee, British Asso-

ciation, Burlington House, London, W.

     In many instances the preliminary tremors, which in the illustration
continue over an interval of 34 minutes, may only continue over 5 or 10

minutes, and their duration appears, to be connected with the distance at
which the disturbance originated. The cause of sudden displacements
without preliminary tremors like those shown in fig. 3 ('British Association
Report,' 1896, fig. 2, p. 190) is at present unknown. They are rare, and

may be due to subsidence beneath the supporting pier. In a dark room,
and especially in a warm climate, when removing the clock-box, it is
quite possible that now and then a minute spider may find its way

into the case. If when moving this box the boom is not set in
motion, the existence of the work of such an intruder may be suspected,
and it and its web must be removed. Such troubles are, however,

very rare.

   A photogram commencing with intermittent long-period movements,

like those shown in the upper part of fig. 4 (' British Association Report,'
1896, p. 200), and increasing until they resemble its lower portion, indicates
that the boom has been swinging from side to side under the influence of
air currents established inside the case. Such movements, which have
been called earth-tremors and microseismic storms, are at times extremely
regular in their character. These latter, with periods of 2 or 3 minutes,

are called pulsations (fig. 5. See ' British Association Report,' 1896, fig. 6,

p. 201). These movements are frequent during the winter months, and

especially at night.

    Although they form an interesting study, because they may often

eclipse the record of an earthquake, it is necessary that they should be

destroyed or avoided. Often they nitay be destroyed by giving the room
in which they are situated a copious and even draughty ventilation. If
this does not succeed, the instrument must have a new installation. They
are seldom met with in a badly constructed hut or beneath a tent.

        IV. Observations at Carisbrooke Castle and Shide.

                   By John Milne, F.R.S., F.G.S.

     In the report for last year it was stated that at about the end of June,
through the kindness of Mr. A. Harbottle Estcourt, Deputy-Governor
of the Isle of Wight, I had been enabled to establish a second horizontal
pendulum at Carisbrooke Castle, and a description of this installation,
together with that at Shide, was given in some detail. The object of the
second installation was to see how far the records of two similar instru-
ments at some distance apart coincided in character. The Shide records,
as already reported upon, consist of movements due to earthquakes which
have originated at some distance disjdacements, which show that the boom
of the instrument has suddenly been caused to swing or change its zero
points ; tremors, which are irregular swingings of the boom extending over

many hours or several days pulsations, which are regular back and forth
                                                                                                                               ;

movements of a pendulum, which movements have periods of two or three

minutes ; diicrnal waves and seasonal waiiderhigs.
     In the following report these movements will be discussed in the order

in which they are here mentioned, the Carisbrooke records being taken

first.

                   The Carisbrooke Records.

     The Carisbrooke records were obtained between June 16 and August 31,

1896. Because the journey to Carisbrooke and back entailed a walk of

four miles, it was only visited once every twenty-four hours. For this

reason, together with the fact that the clockwork arrangement often

--failed to drive the photographic paper an imperfection which has since
--been remedied there were very many interruptions in the continuity of

the records. Notwithstanding this, a sufficient number were obtained to

compare with corresponding records at Shide, and to indicate the character

of Carisbrooke as an observing station.
     The earthquakes recorded were as follows :

  --July 5. Four exceedingly small, elastic switchings of the boom, the first

--at 3 hrs. 6 mins. 47 sees., and the last at 3 hrs. 44 mins. 7 sees.
    July 21. At 7 hrs. 3 mins. 53 sees, there was a small elastic disturbance

time, points of maxima, and other detail with the Shide record, No. 36.

This earthquake had its origin in Japan.

The first two records, which have amplitudes of "5 to 1 mm., do not

·correspond with records at Shide, whilst there are similar nSnute dis-

turbances recorded at Shide which are not visible on the Carisbrooke

photograms. The conclusion, for the present, at least, is that these small
tremors, which suggest an elastic switching of the end of the boom, are
very often of local origin, whilst earthquake movements of a pronounced
character are recorded in a similar manner at both stations. The reason
that no record was obtained at Carisbrooke on August 26 (No. 35 in the
Shide list) was because on that day the recording apparatus was not in

operation. The days of such interruptions are indicated on the general

list of disturbances, pp. 147, 148.

                                                                                                                                  i
          ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  147

     The sudden displacements or disturbances noted at Carisbrooke are

given on the list just mentioned. As compared with Shide they are very

few in number, and at the two stations there was no agreement in the
times at which they took place.

     Tremors and pulsations, which I am inclined to regard as being due to

slow and fairly regular air currents within the covering cases of instru-

ment, were practically absent at Carisbrooke.
     Because the observation of the diurnal wave and longer-period move-

ments require an adjustment of the clockwork, so that it runs at a;
Slow speed, these were not observed. Inasmuch as readings taken of the
position of the end of the boom showed but little change, it is probable

that they are small.
     Because the latter three classes of inovement were frequent at Shide,

 one list. The following list only includes movements which have an
 earthquake-like character ; but as it is possible that certain small displace-
ments may have been mistaken for earthquakes when examining the list,
the following explanatory notes will make it easy to identify records which

are doubtful.

    The sign > , or a series of such signs, indicates a small movement, or

a series of small movements, with an amplitude of about 1 mm., which
commenced suddenly and ended gradually. It is quite possible that some

--of them, at least, may be due to some local cause as, for example, a slight
--settlement beneath the pier on which the instrument is rested and there-

fore are not earthquakes. The sign --^, or a series of such signs, indicates
a very small movement, or series of movements, which commenced
gradically and ended gradually. Such movements have a true earthquake
character ; but because I have no record where they were nearly simul-
taneously recorded at Carisbrooke, they must, in many instances, at least,

be of local origin.
     Disturbances which are ' moderate,' or disturbances which have

amplitudes exceeding 2 mm., if these commence gently it may be as-

sumed that they are of earthquake origin.
     All large disturbances commencing with decided preliminary tremors

are certainly earthquake effects. Those to which an asterisk is attached
are described at the end of the list in more or less detail. The materials

for their description have been derived from my own observations, obser-

vations made in Japan, communications from various observers in Europe
and Great Britain, the ' Bolletino della Societa Sismologica Italiana,' thte
columns of ' Nature,' and other sources.

               V. Earthquake Records from Japan and other places.

                           By John Milne, F.R.S., F.G.S.

      Earthquake No. 1. On the Sea-waves and Earthquakes of June 15, 1896,

                                                     in North Japan.

    (Unless otherwise stated, Japan mean time, or Gr.M.T. + 9 hours, is here used.)

     The sea-waves which at about 8 p.m. on June 15, 1896, invaded the
north-eastern coast of Nippon were as destructive to life as those which
accompanied the well-known eruption on August 26, 1883, of Krakatoa,
whilst one of the shocks by which they were preceded was of such severity
that it was clearly recorded in Europe, and in every probability caused a

disturbance over the entire surface of the globe.

     The magnitude of this disturbance, and the sub- oceanic changes by
which it was probably accompanied, make it well worthy of record. The
sources from which the following notes bearing upon this catastrophe have
been derived are various. Amongst the more important are translations
from the writings of Professor Kochibe and other officers of the Geological
Survey of Japan ; extracts from Japanese newspapers ; the records of the
Central Observatory in Tokio, and those from a large number of other
observatories at which disturbances were recorded ; and, lastly, the writer's
personal knowledge of the devastated districts, and experiences connected
with sea-waves and earthquakes which have previously occurred in the
same locality.

   A full discussion of the phenomena which accompanied this great

catastrophe might be divided under two heads, one containing an account
of the earthquakes which were recorded, and the other an account of the

sea-waves.

     Although one or two houses were destroyed by earthquake movement
in Yamada, the greatest destruction was that caused by sea-waves, of
which the first three were the greatest. The places which suffered most
were Kamaishi, Yoshiyama, and neighbouring towns and villages lying in
the inlets of the cliff-bound coasts of Rikuzen and Rikuchu, on the
N.E. coast of Nippon. Fishermen twenty or twenty-five miles off shore

did not observe anything unusual.

    Time (M.J.T.)
--154 REPORT 1897.

     The first list is that of thirteen shocks noted on June 15 at the Ob-
servatory in Miyako, a place lying to the north of Kamaishi and Yamada,
where the sea-waves were felt with great force.

     The following is a list of shocks noted at observatories in various parts
of Japan. The Tokio shocks will also be found in the list of records from

the Meteorological Obsei-vatory in that city (pp. 13.5-6, Nos. 1,710 to 1,740).

Of these latter, it will be noted that there were only three of marked in-
tensity, and it does not seem that these were connected with the occur-

rence o£ the first sea -waves.

Nearly all these disturbances were only felt in the northern part of

Nippon. Thirty-three were noted in Awomori, 26 were recorded in

Tokio, 15 in Fukushima, 10 in Kofu, 7 in Yamagata, and 2 in Sakai.

The two shocks recorded at Hikone, which is 450 miles distant from

Miyako, were probably of local origin. The fact that the Miyako earth-

quakes were only sufficient to disturb seismographs in North Japan, whilst

the effect of one at least of the series was recorded in Europe, indicates

that the origin of these movements was far from land. Had it been a few

hundred miles still farther off shore it seems likely that ordinary seismo-

graphs, recording on smoked-glass surfaces, would have failed to have

Wegiven any indications that submarine disturbances had taken place.

have, therefore, here an illustration of the necessity of using horizontal

pendulums with photographic recording apparatus, or the equivalent of

such instruments, if we desire to study sub-oceanic movements or the

effects produced by earthquakes which have originated at great distances.

Unusual Set of Ocean Currents. Sweeping up the eastern coast of

Japan is the great Black Stream, or Kuro Siwo, the strength of which,

as indicated by the distance to which it is felt and its position with

regard to the coast, is subject to seasonal variation. Along the inundated

coast a warm current is felt from spring to autumn, whilst during the

winter months the same shores experience a current that is cold. In

1896, spring passed, and yet the cold water hugged the shore, and the

fishermen seeking bonito had to go farther than usual from land until

they reached warmer waters.

  --Origin of the Disturbance. Because the village of Taoi was destroyed

by two great waves, one coming from the south and the other from the

north, it has been assumed that at a distance of from five to eight miles

off the village a submarine landslip had taken place, and the waters rushed

inwards towards the scene of dislocation. Because places along 150 or

200 miles of the coast on which Taoi is situated were inundated at about

the same time, as Professor Kochibe points out, it is clear that the origin

of the convulsion was at a very much greater distance from the land than

that just indicated.

Because the sea-waves were preceded by earthquakes it is evident
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  157

that at least one of the latter must have been accompanied by enormous
dislocations in order to have produced the former.

      These earthquakes, as recorded on land, were comparatively small,

which, from what we know of the dissipation of earthquake energy as it
radiates from its origins, indicates that the earth vibrations must have

travelled at least 100 miles.

     The least interval of time that we can give between the arrival of the
vibratory wave and the sea-waves is that observed at Miyako, which is

21 minutes.

     If we assume a mean depth for the ocean off the north-east coast of
Nippon, along an easterly line, to the origin of the disturbance at 2,000
fathoms, then the distance from the land to the origin may be expressed

                             V 12000x^x21 x60,

or about 130 geogi-aphical miles.

    Again, if we assume y., to be the velocity of the sea-wave, which may

be taken at 500 feet per second, this being a somewhat low observed
velocity for earthquake sea- waves approaching this coast; d, the velocity
of the vibratory waves, which over a short range has often been observed

at 7,000 or 8,000 feet per second ; and T the observed interval of time

between the arrival of the two waves, then the distance of their origin
from the coast is

or in this case about 113 geographical miles.

    If we make i;2=600 feet per second, the distance of the origin becomes

about 140 geographical miles.

     Because we have taken the least interval that can be assigned to the
difference in the times of the arrival of the land and sea- waves, it may
be concluded that the origin of the Japan disturbance of June 15 was

along a submarine line at a distance of 1 20 to 1 40 geographical miles off
the coast of Noi-th-east Nippon.

     Such a locus is at a depth of 4,000 fathoms, and, so far as we know
the sub-oceanic contours, exactly at the bottom of the Nippon slope,

forming the western boundary of the Tuscarora Deep, a well-known

origin for many large earthquakes (see map, fig. 14).
    Although much evidence may be adduced to show that early in June

1896 the ocean currents were deranged in direction and intensity, the
cause of the submarine dislocation was probably seismic.

   --Velocity of Propagation of Earth-waves. Assuming the origin to lie

120 geographical miles east of Miyako, to which place it travelled at a
rate of 8,000 feet per second, which fairly well accords with the velocity
it travelled from the Miyako isoseist to Tokio, and velocities of propaga-
tion of similar earthquakes over short ranges, the time, within a few
seconds, at which the earthquake occurred was, in G.M.T., June 14
22h. 31m. Os.

The last observation evidently refers to a phase of movement different

from that of the first two, and therefore will not be further considered.

We should expect to have found these two velocities to have been nearly

equal. Their mean value, or the probable rate at which motion was
transmitted from Japan to Italy, was

                               9'2 kms. per sec. on an arc.

     The observations 2 to 7 clearly indicate a large error in the obser-
vation made near the origin in Cyprus. The only calculations of velocity
which can therefore be made are on paths between the Nicolaiew isoseist
and the first six places.

     The following table of distances from Hekla, in Iceland, to places
whei'e movements were observed, together with the times at which the
latter commenced, shows that it is impossible to make any reliable calcu-
lations respecting the velocity with which motion was propagated. The
causes of the discrepancies are probably to be found in the diflerences in
the form of the instruments employed, and the want of a sufficiently open

time scale on many of the record- receiving surfaces :

      This shock created considerable destruction in the north-west part of

Nippon. It was recorded in Tokio as a slow horizontal movement with a
slightly vertical component, but the records from ordinary seismographs
v/ere too small for accurate measurement. The time of its commencement

in Tokio was, in local time, 5h. 9m. 33s. P.M., or in G.M.T., 20h. 9m. 33s.

    When this motion was recorded the disturbance would have advanced

4° on its path towards Europe.
     The time taken for three of the various phases of motion to reach

Shide and the Isle of Wight, and the velocities of propagation, were as

follows :
--162 REPORT 1897.

than that at Strassburg, or else that between the Strassburg isoseist and

the Isle of Wight, motion was propagated at only a little over 1 km. per

second, which, it may be noted, is a rate of transmission often observed

Anover short ranges near to an epicentre.       inference to be derived from

this is, that for purposes of comparison it is desirable that all stations

should be furnished with instruments of equal sensibility.

    If we accept the Strassburg record of the arrival of the first tremors as

correct, then the average velocity of propagation from Japan to that place

exceeded on the arc 18 kms. per second, whereas the average of very many

other observations on the same path have yielded apparent velocities of

half this quantity.

     The origin of this disturbance was along two almost north and south

lines in the middle of North Nippon. It may be taken as lying to the

north and south of a point in 140° 50' E. long, and 39° 40' N. lat.
     The times at which the shock was automatically noted at various towns

were in local time as follows :

The distance between Tokio and Yamagata is about 150 g.m., and

Tokio and the origin 240 g.m. Between the first two places the time

taken for the vibration to travel was 90 seconds, indicating a velocity of

about 10,000 feet per second. Assuming this to be correct, then the time

taken from the origin to Tokio would be 2m. 44s., from which it may be

concluded that the shock originated at 5h. 7m. 9s., or, in G.M.T., August .30,

20h. 7m. 9s.

       Earthquake of February 19, 1897. Oiigin, Japan (8h. 49m. Os. G.M.T.).

     This earthquake was not recorded at Shide, the clock of the recording

    The greatest disturbance appears to have taken place at Sendai and

in N.E. Nippon, from which it is not unlikely that the origin of the
shock was near to that of June 15, 1896 (see Shock No. 1). This being
the case, the rate of travel on paths 9,749, 8,760, and 8,241 kms. to Ischia,
Potsdam, and Nicolaiew would respectively be 24, 9*7, and 45 kms. per

second ! The first and last of these computations we hope to be in a

position to correct in some future report.
      Examples of earthquakes which have sensibly shaken the whole of

North Japan caii be found the effects of which do not appear to have

reached Europe.

     With the exception of groups of observations made within a few

hundreds of kilometres of an epifocal area, all records which refer to
maxima phases of motion, as, for example, those which appareiitly disturb
magnetographs, have been neglected, and therefore, taken as a whole, the
velocities given in the following list are based upon the times at which
preliminary tremors have commenced to show themselves at various

stations.

--174 REPORT 1897.

   A glance at the above table, or the diagrammatic representation of the

same (tig. 15), shows that either thei-e have been great differences in the
velocities with which movements have been propagated to points equally
distant from given origins, which is unlikely, or that there have been
laraer errors in the determination of the time at which motion commenced

at different stations.
      Possible causes for these errors are easily found.

     1. Different instruments; some being horizontal pendulums recording
photographically, others being pendulums varying in length and in the

frictional resistance of pointers recording on smoked surfaces, may have

unequal degrees of sensibility.

    2. Similar instruments may be differently adjusted.

    3. When a record is received on a sui-face moving at a rate of about

20mm. per hour, the error in determining the time at which a disturbance
commenced may be 1 minute.

Examination of Cases where the Velocity has been Abnormally High.

  --Shock No. 1. This was recorded at three stations in Japan Ijy hori-

zontal pendulums recording on photographic surfaces. From the fact that

ordinary seismographs did not record an earthquake on that day, and
because each photogram began with gentle tremors, it is safe to assume

that they represented an earthquake originating at a great distance.
Unfortunately, the note-books containing the clock corrections were burned,

but taking the time determinations direct from the photograms, they lead
to the conclusion that motion was propagated to Japan from a place
almost at its antipodes at a rate varying between 16 and 19 kms. per

second.

    The greatest merit in this record is that it falls in line with what we

should expect from records taken over shorter ranges.

  --Shock 17. Like other Strassburg records, this was obtained on paper

moving at a rate of about 1 mm. in three minutes. Independently of this,

however, we see that for the same shock at four other observatories
velocities of 9-7, 11"1, 11'2, and ITS kms. per second have been calculated

(Nos. 15, 6, 8, and 12), and it is therefore highly probable that the

--Wedetermination for Strassburg of 14-2 kms. is too high.
Shock 28.  have here another case of a record from a surface

moving at a rate of 1 mm. in about three minutes, whilst the epicentre

--may have been distant from Tokio.
     Shock 37 . Because a delicate seismograph at Catania was disturbed
2 minutes 40 seconds before the one at Padua suggests the idea that
these Italian records possibly refer to a local disturbance, and not to the
one in Asia Minor. This point has been discussed by Professor M. G.

Agamennone (see ' Bollet. A. Soc. Sis. Italiana,' vol. ii.. No. 8).

  --Shock 35. This estimate is based upon a most careful and elaborate

analysis of records, none of which, however, were obtained fi'om the

automatic indications of seismographs.

           Abnormally Low Velocities.

--WeShocks 9 and 23.  have here two observations for the same shock,

and we find that the photograms obtained at Strassburg and Nicolaiew

were ' schwach und wenig scharf,' and for the former there was an

' unbestimmter anfang,' from which it may be concluded that the com-

mencement of movement at these places was not determined.

  --Shock 21. From the Nicolaiew record it appears that the commence-

ment of this disturbance is thus noted : ' 5-02 h. (?) Anfang der Storung.'

The uncertainty here expressed possibly explains the low velocity

--recorded.
     Shock 16. Here again there appears to have been difficulty in
determining the commencement of movement, owing to the undefined

character of the photogram.

  --Shock 25.^ This was observed not onh* at Nicolaiew, but also at

Strassburg, the velocities being 3-72 and 4-2 kms. per second respectively.

Although von Rebeur in his ' Horizontalpendel-Beobachtungen,' p. 492,
tells us that these velocities are based upon tlie observation of the time at
which the first weak movement is visible, from a table on p. 443 they
appear to have been determined from the observation of the instant at
which there was a sudden increase in motion, and are used with other
176 REPORT 1897.

observations to determine the mean velocity of propagation, which is that

of the greatest movements.

   --Shock 3. Movement in Europe was extremely small, and no record

was obtained at Nicolaiew. Possibly the smallness of the diagram, which

began 'little by little,' may have rendered it difficult to make accurate

measurements on the time scale.
     The general result of the examination of data which have led to the

determination of velocities which appear to be either too high or too
low, is to find that such data are either imperfect or capable of another

interpretation.

     The doubtful cases are placed in circles, and to these, based upon a
long experience in observing earthquake velocities over ranges up to about
1,000 kms., I should be inclined to add Nos. 33, 39, 40, 43, and 42.

    If, therefore, we exclude the computations the accuracy of which is doubt-

ful, the general results towards which the continuation of the observations on
the propagation of earth-waves over ranges of varying length point is
approximately indicated in the following table :

ing had any effect on the character of the diurnal wave.

   --1st tveek (Sept. S-T-J). From the 8th to the 14th daily waves were

marked, but there was such a marked steady displacement towards the

valley on the west that adjustments were required almost daily.

    On the 8th and 1-ith it was fairly tine, but on all the other days there
was much rain and the weather was dull. The westei'ly motion, or down-

ward tilting towards the saturated valley, was also marked in the records

of T.

  --2nd iveek (Sfpf. 14:-21). Because the westerly motion had been so

great the sensibility of the instrument was reduced, with the result that
the daily wave was hardly visible. There was still, however, a westerly
tendency. The weather was dull or fine, but there was no heavy i-ain.

after adjustment on the 25th the movement was barely visible.

small. The shock shown by T on the 21st is not shown.

     The diurnal wave is evidently pronounced on fine days, and small or

                                                The Diurnal Wave.

     Figure 1 6 shows half-size tracings of daily waves taken from the origi-

nal photograms. Angular values for these waves may be approximately
obtained by assuming that 1 mm. deflection corresponds to a change

in inclination of 0'5 sec. of arc. Should accurate measurements of these

quantities be required, they can be obtained from my note-books.

     Days on which the diurnal wave was very small have been omitted.
The curves which are given clearly show that the daily deflection is
variable in amount ; but whether the ground around the tent was open, or

covered by a tarpaulin on the west side or on the east side, the times at
which the pendulum commenced, completed, and ended its sharper

movements are practically the same. If we commence in the morning,
the direction of movement of the pendulum from a north-south line,

or its normal position, was such that it tended to approach a position that
would place its boom in a line with the sun and the shadow of the tent.

That is to say, it swung towards the east, but it continued this motion

                                    which it may be concluded that the-

                                    effect is connected with solar radiation.
                                          In previous reports I have suggested

                                    that it might be produced by the differ-
                                    ence in load removed by evaporation on
                                    two sides of an installation, such loads
                                    from a surface of grass being represented
                                    by the removal of 4 or 5 lb. per square
                                    yard per day.

                                         The experiment with the tarpaulin-
                                    cover placed first on one side of the
                                    tent and then on the other, which failed
                                    to produce any marked effect on the

                                    character of the diurnal motion, indi-
                                    cates not only that this is practically

                                    uninfluenced by differential evaporation
                                    effects, but also by the heat received
                                    by the ground on two sides of an in-

                                    stallation, these effects being local.

                                    We therefore have to look to the in-

                                    strument, the pier on which it stands',
                                    or external effects on a widespread
                                    area. The fact that the diurnal wave is
                                    marked on a brick pier rising from a
                                    solid foundation in the middle of a
                                    brick building shaded by trees,' and
                                    also in cellars, in both of which places
                                    the changes in temperature have been
                                    small, indicates that the movements
                                    are not to be accounted for by warp-
                                    ings on the pier or portions of the in-

                                    strument.

                                         The fact that strong and steady

                                    westerly deflections corresponding to

                                    an increase on the slope of the hill on

                                    follow fine weather, indicates that a
                                    load in the valley apparently causes

                                    this to sink, whilst during the removal
                                    of such a load it apparently rises. It
                                    seems natural to conclude that the
                                    diurnal waves are movements with a

                                    similar origin. On hot days the valley

                                    loses moisture, and therefore it rises.

and the pendulum travels eastwards, whilst at night moisture is accumu-
lated, and it sinks.'

   VIII. The Perry Tromometer. By John Milne, F.R.S., F.G.S.

   A Perry Tromometer, similar to that described in the Report of this

Committee for 1896, with photographic recording apparatus, has been
constructed, and for some days installed at Shide. Its sensitiveness to
elastic tremors was such tiiat it recorded trains moving at a distance of
over half a mile, carriages at a distance of a quarter of a mile, and all
v-ehicles passing along a road near to the building in which it was placed.

For these reasons it was dismantled, but it may be again used when a site
free from the above-mentioned artificial disturbances, to which may be

added the sound-waves from heavy guns fired at a distance of five or six

miles, can be found.

     In conclusion to the preceding sections of the Report the fact that the
records of earthquakes and other movements have been continuous has

been in consequence of the great interest taken in the observations by my

assistant, Shinobu Hirota, who not only understands the working of the
instruments in all their details, but has from time to time shown con-
siderable ingenuity in devising and constructing new pieces of apparatus.

      IX. fSuh-oceanic Changes. By JoiiN Milne, F.R.S., F.G.S.

     The object of the following notes, which are an epitome of a paper to
be communicated to the Royal Geographical Society of London, is to show
that beneath seas and oceans there are a certain class of geological changes
in operation Avhich are more frequent, and often more intense, than
corresponding changes on land.

     The sites of these changes are to be found below low-water mark at
comparatively shallow depths on submerged plateaus surrounding conti-
nents and islands, and on the face, and especially near to the base of the
steeper slopes of continental domes, and around submarine banks at
depths which may even reach 4,000 fathoms. On the level floor of
oceans, where sediments accumulate with immeasurable slov/ness, and
whei-e for years and years ocean cables lie undisturbed, geological changes

are, so far as a lifetime is concerned, not recognisable.

     The submarine operations to which it is particularly desired to draw
attention are those which are seismic and volcanic, the former at least
often being accompanied by the displacement as a landslide of such
enormous volumes of material that the whole surface of an ocean may be
agitated. Evidences that such displacements have had a reality is to be
found in the conditions under which cables have been buried, and in the
marked change in soundings near to spots where seismic efforts have been

exerted.

     Other causes leading to displacement of materials on the face and
near to the base of submerged slopes are overloading by sedimentation,
erosion, the escape of water from submarine springs, and the effects of

currents.

     The various sub-oceanic phenomena to which it is particularly desired

to call attention will be treated in the following order :

  --1. Bradyseismic action. Because earthquakes originating beneath

                                 ' British Association Beport, 1895, pp. 133-139,
182 REPORT-- 1897.

the sea are more numerous and more intense than those originating on
land, the inference is that bradyseismic activity and phenomena which
accompany earthquakes, like landslides, are also more pronounced beneath
the sea than they are on land.

     Bradyseismical movements include movements of upheaval or depres-
sion, by which rocks are bent, folded, faulted, ordisplaced, by thrust, together

with those which are the result of overloading, and may be exhibited as basal
crush. One set of movements involve the idea of elastic and seismic

strain, whilst the others a gravitational effect.

   --2. Sedimentation and erosion. Submarine landslides which in part

are due to earthquakes.
     The effects of overloading, submarine springs and currents.
     .3. Changes evidenced by cable interriqjtions and soundings.

      4. Conclusions.

                            1. Bradyseismic Action,

  --Earthquakes the Origin of ivhich are Submarine. The earthquakes

which have a submarine origin may be divided into three groups :

1. Those which have been felt and recorded on land, and which,

therefore, may be assumed, in the generality of cases, to have originated

on a coast-line or within a few hundred miles off in the ocean.

2. Those which have been recorded on shipboard out at sea, either as

tremors or as severe movements. Many of these disturbances are

probably volcanic.

3. Those which have not been felt on land, but have been distinctly

recorded there. In this group we find many of the earthquakes which

shake the world.

As illustrative of the frequency of the first group, I will quote from

observations made in Japan. · Between 1881 and 1883 in North Japan

the writer found that, out of 419 shocks, no less than 218 of them had

originated beneath the ocean. There had been 137 which had originated

on or near the seaboard, and therefore some of these had been of sub-

Aoceanic origin, whilst only 64 had originated inland.  large number of

these earthquakes came from the deep water off the mouth of the Tonegawa,

the largest river in Japan, which, as it approaches the sea, crosses the

alluvial plain of Musashi.

     Between 1885 and 1892 no less than 8,331 earthquakes were recorded

--in Japan that is, on the average during this period of eight years there

Awere about one thousand shocks per year.'^  glance at the map showing

the distribution of origins of these disturbances shows that nearly all of
them have originated along the eastern seaboard, and have been frequent

near the alluvial plains. Between January 1885 and December 1888,

--when seismic activity was in a normal state that is to say, when there
--were no long series of after-shocks 2,018 earthquakes were recorded, of

which at least 1,034, or 50 per cent., originated beneath the sea. In

Japan, therefore, along a coast-line of 1,140 miles, there has recently

been at least about 250 submarine shocks per year. In some years there

have been 500.

From a seismic map of the world, I should estimate that round the

    ' ' On 387 Earthquakes observed during Two Years in North Japan,' by John

Milne, Trans. Seis. Sec, vol. vii. pt. ii.

      * Trans. Seis. Soc, vol. xx.
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.              183

Pacific there are at least ten sub-littoral districts where earthquake

frequency may be about half that of Japan. If this is accepted as

probable, the sub-littoral seismic activity of the Pacific is represented

by 2,500 shocks per year, some of which have been accompanied by
submarine landslips and consequent changes in the configuration of the

ocean bed. When these latter are gi'eat, it is assumed that ocean-waves

are created. If we consider the seismic activity round the coasts of the
other oceans and seas which cover our globe as being, when taken

together, equal to that of the Pacific, then for the world, out of a possible

10,000 shocks per year, 5,000 of them have their origin on the sub-oceanic

continental slopes.

     To get information about the second group, or earthquakes which
have originated far from land, we have to turn to the voluminous
catalogues of Perrey, Mallet, Kluge, di Ballore, Fuchs, and other statis-
ticians. Such extracts have been made by Dr. Emil Rudolph in his
papers, ' Ueber Submarine Erdbeben und Eruptionen,' ' who gives us an
account of 333 sub-oceanic earthquakes and eruptions. Because the
greater number of these shocks are of volcanic origin, they will be more
specifically referred to in the next section. The distribution of these is
various, but here and there they herd together, indicating localities where
changes are comparatively rapid. One favourite locality for submarine

disturbances is in the Equatorial Atlantic, about 20° W. long., and again
at 30° W. long., near to St. Paul's. For each of these regions Dr.

Rudolph gives about thirty-seven shocks, in depths of water exceeding

1,000 and 2,000 fathoms.
     The chief source of information for our last group is, however, derived

from the records of horizontal pendulums. Taking a list of them published
in the ' Transactions of the Seismological Society,' vol. xx., by the late
Dr. E. von Rebeur-Paschwitz, out of 301 records obtained in twenty-
seven months, there are only 25 which can with certainty be traced to
their origin. Out of the 176 which remain, 105 were almost simul-
taneously recorded at places so widely separated as Potsdam, Wilhelms-

haven, Strassburg, Nicolaiew, and Tokio, and therefore cannot be disposed
of as being due to some accidental disturbance of an instrument or to
small shocks of local origin. Each of them was a disturbance affecting a
very large area, and indicates an initial impulse of great magnitude.

What is true for the observations in Europe has also been true for my

own observations in Japan, and also in the Isle of Wight, the only

difference being that in Europe the stations were from 300 to 600 iniles
apart, whilst in Japan and the Isle of Wight the stations were usually
near to each other, and never more than 30 miles apart. In some
instances, however, earthquakes of unknown origins were recorded in

Japan and Europe, and it is fair to assume that in these instances the

whole world had been shaken.
     One disturbance noted by the author in Japan on June 3, 1893, had a

duration of five and a half hours. It was also recorded in Birmingham,
Strassburg, and Nicolaiew, at which latter place the duration of motion
extended over eleven hours. Amongst unfelt earthquakes, both for magni-

 tude and duration, it exceeded all that have yet been recorded.
      Because the character of the unfelt movements, the origin of which

 cannot be traced, is identical with the character of those which have been

' Beitrage zur Geo2>hysiJi, Band I. and II.
--184 REPORT 1897.

traced to earthquakes originating at great distances, it is, for the present

at least, assumed that the cause of the former is similar to the cause of

the latter. If this is the case, the only place towards which we can turn

to find the origin of the former appears to be beneath our oceans, and

when they are of a magnitude approaching that of June .3 their origins

must have been very far from land, otherwise a sensible shaking would

have beeii observed upon the nearest shores.

     If we take the three classes of records to which we have referred in

conjunction, the conclusion to which they point is not simply that the

submarine evidences of seismicity are more nvmierous than those on land,

but also that they are very much more intense.

  --The Character of Submarine Seismic Districts. If we compare

together the characters of the districts where earthquakes of submarine

origin are frequent with those where they are practically unknown, the

differences are striking. In the former the land, as shown on the seaboard,

usually consists of strata which are geologically new                                                                                                                                                                                                                              it exhibits evidences
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

of recent elevation, some of which can be traced to historical times, whilst

its average slope from the mountains in the interior down beneath the

ocean is, over a considerable distance, relatively very steep.' The unit of

distance over which such slopes have been measured is taken at 2°, or

120 geographical miles. The following are a few examples of such slopes :

     The conclusion derived from this is, that if we find slopes of con-

siderable length extending downwards beneath the ocean steeper than 1 in

35, at such places submarine earthquakes, with their accompanying land-

slips, may be expected. On the summit of these slopes, whether they

terminate in a plateau or as a range of mountains, volcanic action is

frequent, whilst the earthquakes originate on the lower portions of the

face and base of these declivities.

  --The Cause of Seismic Strain, Deformation, Thrust, and Crush. "We

assume that the contours referred to in the last section are mainly the

result of rock-movement, and that seismic strain, due to a tendency to

further adjustment, is greatest where earthquake origins are most frequent.
The home of the volcano is evidently the place where the rocks have been

most deformed, whilst that of the earthquake is at the base of steep sub-

oceanic slopes where most deformation is in progress. The nature of the

forces in operation producing this deformation is twofold. First, there

is the horizontal thrust, so strongly emphasised by Lapworth, which may
or may laot tend to increase the height of the mountain ranges bounding

its  line  of  action                                and, secondly,  a  factor dependent                                                                                                                                                                                           on  gravity, which,
                                                  ;

acting on the side of subaerial and marine denudations, tends to lower

them. Earthquakes are for the most part spasmodic accelerations in

processes with these characters.

     The distortions observed in fossils and pebbles, the difference in
thickness of contorted strata, and the ' creep ' in coal-mines, all indicate

that great pressures may set up movements in stratified materials corre-

sponding to a flow. Mr. AVilliam Barlow, in a paper on the ' Horizontal
Movements in Rocks,' ' as evidence of this, calls attention to the contor-
tions and foldings observed in glacial drift produced by a load above, the
dip seen on the face of the Grand Canon of Colorado, and the slight eleva-

tion observed in the area surrounded by cliffs known as the ' San Rafael
Swell.' These and other appearances may be regarded as instances of
'creep' upon a large scale, when materials have been squeezed out from

beneath superincumbent strata.

     In studying bradyseismical movement we usually take cognisance of

that which is most apparent. This is the vertical component of a dis-

placement, whilst the horizontal movement may be entirely overlooked.
The geotectonic structure of many countries, however, shows us that dis-

placements by horizontal thrust have taken place on an enormous scale,
and it is not unlikely that these forces, accelerated by the effects of crush,
are yet in operation round the basal contours of continental areas. Sub-
oceanic earthquakes are therefore announcements that sub-oceanic brady-
seismic action is in progress, and because these disturbances are more
numerous round the submerged frontiers of continental domes and in mid-

ocean than they are on land, it may be concluded that the distortions and

displacements due to bending, thrust, and crush are greater beneath the

--sea than they are upon continents and islands.
     Eartltquakes and Landslides. In addition to these bradyseismical
effects, which only produce appreciable changes in sub-oceanic contour
after the lapse of long intervals of time, there are the effects which accom-
pany the actual shaking, which we may assume are not far different from
those effects which we see produced by earthquakes originating on land.

Many earthquakes which we feel, although they may create alarm and

shatter chimneys, do not produce any effect upon rocks and cliffs. This,
however, does not preclude the idea that shakings of equal intensity would
not produce effects upon submarine slopes, where, as compared with similar

slopes on land, critical conditions may more nearly approach in character

to the mechanism of the hair trigger. Severe earthquakes on land are

almost always accompanied by great landslides, and mountains which may
for ages have been green with forest growth l)y the sliding away of

materials en their sides suddenly present the appearance of having been
whitewashed. The probable effect of similar shakings originating beneath

the ocean in the vicinity of steep slopes needs no explanation.
     Another effect which sometimes accompanies these disturbances, and

which may have been their cause, is the creation of a fault 50 or 150

miles in length, by which the country on one side of this, relatively to
that on the other, has been suddenly raised or lowered 20 to 30 feet.
Earthquakes of this nature, if of submarine origin, would naturally
produce similar effects over large areas, and, if the magnitude of the
displaced materials, whether by landslides or faulting, were large, as com-
pared witli the depth of the superincumbent waters, would also give rise

to sea-waves.

     One of the most recent examples of effects of this description was that

which occurred on June 15, 1896, off the north-east coast of Japan. On

' Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc, November 1888.
186 REPOKT--1897.

the evening of that day a submarine earthquake occurred in this locality

which was recorded in the Isle of Wight ; and, from the magnitude of the
diagrams, it may be assumed that the world was shaken from pole to pole.

Following this shaking, great sea-waves spread over the Noi'th Pacific

Ocean. The explanation of these phenomena is that the earthquake was

produced by fracture of the rocks, not at a point, but over a considerable
length, which movement, being accompanied by the displacement of huge
masses of material, gave rise to the sea-waves. The sub-oceanic contour of
this locality, where the depth of the water increases at the rate of 1,00(}
fathoms in 25 miles until the 4,000-fathom line of the Tuscarora Deep is

reached, lends itself to this supposition. The only difficulty we experience
is to estimate the volume of the matei'ial which must have been more or

less suddenly displaced at these great depths to have produced so great a
disturbance on the surface of the ocean. It is not likely that it was less

than that of the greatest landslide of which we have historical record as
having occurred upon the surface of the earth.

     The data we have for calculating the position of the origin of these
great disturbances are numerous and exact. Our knowledge of the dissi-

pation of earthquake energy, as represented by its destructivity as it
radiates, indicates that an earthquake which dislodged sufficient material
to disturb the whole of the North Pacific Ocean must, at the very least,
have originated 100 miles away from Miyako, on the north-east coast of
Nippon, at which places a few houses were shattered.

     The calculations to be found on p. 1.57, strangely enough, bring us
exactly to the base of the western boundary of the Tuscarora Deep, above

which there are 4,000 fathoms of water. This is a place from which many

earthquakes have originated, affording evidences, particularly in this
instance, of sudden sub-oceanic changes along the basal frontier of a
continent the magnitude of which it is difficult to estimate.

   --Submarine Volcanic Action. If highly heated rocks saturated with

water were the only condition necessary for a display of volcanic action,
such activities might be as marked in ocean basins as round their margins.
The geological distribution of volcanoes, however, shows that before a

volcanic magma can expend and find exit on the surface, the pressure due

to superincumbent strata must be relieved, which is apparently obtained
when they are sufficiently crumpled upwards to form mountain ridges.

If, therefore, we seek for volcanic action beneath the sea, we may expect
to find the same along submarine ridges, and if we discover the same, as
we do along the central ridge of the Atlantic, the conclusion is that along
such a ridge an upward bradyseism ical movement is in progress, and not

far from the region of eruptions there should be a region of earthquakes.
     In certain instances, apparently, as is the case with the Aleutians and

the Kurils, so many eruptions have taken place along a submarine ridge

that a continuous and almost connected chain of islands has been formed.

On the flanks of the most southei'n of the latter group recent marine

strata have been raised, which, taken in conjunction with the fact that

hardly a year passes without some new eruption being noted, whilst sub-
marine shocks of earthquakes are frequent, indicates that Japan may in
time become connected with Kamschatka.

     Any attempt to enumerate the various submarine ridges of volcanic

 activity at present evidenced by these outcrops would be beyond the scope
 of the present paper. One curious form of evidence, indicating the exist-
 ence of volcanic activity entirely hidden in ocean depths, is referred to by
28 disturbances.
188 REPORT-- 1897.

result in contours which have reached limits of stability ready to yield as

more materials accumulate, by facial slidings, by overloading, by changes

in currents, by seismic action, and in other ways.
--Forms of Stability. On land we have many illustrations of natural
Acurves of stability.
                       volcano mainly consisting of lapilli which have

accumulated round a central orifice has a form dependent upon the

density and strength as represented by resistance to crushing of its com-

ponent materials. To increase the height of such a mountain, it would be

necessary to increase the area of its base. The upper portion of Mount
Fuji has a slope of 30°, but as we proceed downwards the slope becomes

less and less until at last it is asymptotic to the plain from which it rises.

'The average slope of this volcano is 15°.

If, therefore, on the face of a bank formed by the accumulation of

.sediments, soundings, taken at points separated by one or more miles,

indicate a certain inclination, it may be inferred that the steepest slope
may possibly greatly exceed the quantity thus determined.

The only experiments bearing upon slopes of stability formed beneath

water with which the writer is acquainted are a few made by himself.

These experiments, which were made with sand and carried out in various

--manners, pointed to the following general results :

1. Sediments deposited under the influence of currents accumulate in

slightly flatter forms than those of similar materials built up on land.

2. Peaks, edges and corners of loose materials which may be fairly

stable on land are beneath water, even when it is still, quite unstable, and

quickly become rounded.

   A3. mound or bank when thus rounded is very stable even under the

influence of strong currents, but the unstable form may be quickly repro-

duced by the accumulation of new sediments.

The conclusions then are, first, if we find beneath water very short

slopes of detrital materials, if they are 2° or 3° less than the angle at

which similar materials ai^e self-supporting on land, they have reached a

limit of stability ; and, secondly, average slopes over distances of one or

more miles indicate the existence of much steeper slopes over shorter

lengths.

  --Causes resulting in the Yielding of Submarine Banks. Because it is

not likely that submarine earthquakes the movements of which are felt

round the world are the result of volcanic action whenever these are

accompanied by sea-waves, it may be inferred that the latter have been

produced by the di.sloclgment of vast masses of material from the faces of

steep slopes. Illustrations of such changes will be given in the next

section.

     That intermittent facial sliding takes place on steep slopes during the
accumulation of new materials is rendered likely by what we observe

taking place on the faces of a mound of sand, submerged beneath water, as

it grows upwards as an accumulation from a fine stream of sand descending

from above.

Basal crush with horizontal displacement would only be expected to

occur around the lower edges of slopes of great height ; and as it is hardly

reasonable to suppose that such slopes owe their form simply to the

accumulation of sedimentary deposits, then the frequent origin of

earthquakes in such localities indicates that the pi'imary cause of crush or

thrust is the result of yielding in rocky masses rather than that of

detritus. When speaking of cable-interruptions it will be seen that some
       ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.  189

of these have been attributed to the displacement of materials which have
been loosened by the submarine escape of fresh water. Examples of
springs of fresh water in bays and along coast-lines are numerous, whilst
there is abundant evidence of the absorption of rainfall and even of rivers
on continental areas, which in some instances it is suspected find an exit

in the sea bottom. Granted the existence of sub-oceanic springs, we see in
them at and near their exits a possible cause by which deposits may
be loosened and landslips take place. Under certain conditions such

dislocations might be expected to be periodical, following, for example,
the rainy seasons. Ocean currents which fluctuate in direction and
intensity, together with those of temporary character produced by the

backing up of water during gales in bays, estuaries, and coasts, may also

disturb the isostasy of submarine materials.
     For details of these and other operations producing sub-oceanic change

reference must be made to the writer's original paper.

       3. Cable Fracture.

     The fact that, on the level plains of ocean beds, cables lie for years.

and years without disturbance is another testimony to the facts brought
together by geologists to show that the flat plains of ocean beds are regions

where there is but little change. Directly, however, we approach sub-

oceanic banks or the margins of continental slopes, although the

depths may be abysmal, the fact that cables after interruption
have to be broken away from beneath materials which hold them

fast, indicates that regions of dislocation have been reached, and
what is true for these great depths is also true for localities nearer
land. Sometimes cables are bent and twisted, sometimes they are crushed.

Now and again sections are recovered which, from the growth of shells

and coral on all sides, show that they have been suspended. Others show

that fracture has apparently been the result of abrasions, whilst the ends
of wires, one of which is concave and the other convex, slightly drawn

out, indicate that yielding has been the result of tension. Needle-pointed

ends suggest electrolytic action ; ' but, although cable-interruption may

occur in these and other ways, the explanation which best accords with
the observations made during cable-recovery generally are those which
attribute their dislocation to sudden displacement of the bed in which

they are laid, or to their burial by the sliding down of materials from

some neighbouring slope.

     Sometimes it will be seen that earthquake movement and cable
fracture have been simultaneous, whilst many instances will be given
where an interruption has occurred at about the same time that an unfelt
movement has been recorded on land. These latter records, which in the
lists are marked with an asterisk, are unfortunately not numerous, and
only refer to days between the following dates :

   --North Atlantic. Through the kindness of an engineer, whose experi-

ence in the laying and repairing of cables has extended over many years,
I am enabled to give the dates at which various cables have become
ruptured, or been restored to working order. The only case of alteration
in depth which he noticed was during the repairs of November 1884, but

this was not great. It seemed as if the picked-up cable had to be pulled
from under a bank of earth which had slipped down from the eastern
slope of the Newfoundland Bank.

     The following is a table of North Atlantic cable-interruptions :

October 4, 4 and 8 a.m., 1884 ; September 1889.

An unfelt eairthquake was recorded, June 11, 7h. 22m., 1894, very strong at

Charkow.

A striking feature connected with these Atlantic troubles is that

nearly all have occurred in deep water near to the base of the eastern

slope of the Flemish Cap, 330 miles from St. John's, Newfoundland, or

the south-eastern slope of the Newfoundland Bank. Off the Flemish Cap

in lat. 49° N. and long. 43° E. there is a .slope, in a distance of 60 miles,

from a depth of 708 fathoms to 2,400 fathoms, or 1 in 35. Another

slope, over a distance of 30 miles, is fi'om 275 to 1,946 fathoms, or 1 in 17.

Off the eastern side of the Newfoundland Bank, in a distance of 25 miles,

the depth changes from 27 to 1,300 fathoms, indicating a slope of 1 in 19.

These slopes are all well within the limits at which from time to time

yielding, due to bradyseismical thrust or secular crush, should be expected
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and the further a cable can be kept away from the scene of such action, if

we may judge from experience, the longer will be its life.

In one case only has the cause of failure been attributed to a land-

slide, which it is just possible was caused by, or accompanied with, seismic
Aphenomena.
             very significant fact is the case when three cables running

in parallel lines about 10 miles apart broke, at points nearly opposite to

«ach other, on the same straight lines. This was on October 4, 1884.

At first the accidents were attributed to the grapnel of a cable vessel, but

as no grappling was done then this hypothesis had to be abandoned.

Because three cables broke apparently at the same time in the same

locality, one inference is, that the cause resulting in rupture was common

to all, and this may have been a sudden cliange in the configuration of the

ocean bed. Such a change does not necessitate any alteration in depth,

such as could be detected by sounding, but either a landslip along a line

of considerable length or simply a line of fracture like that which was

suddenly formed along the Neo valley in Japan in 1891.

When, on the American and English coasts, types of seismometers

which will record the unfelt movements of the earth's crust have been

established, it seems likely that the cause of cable interruptions may be

better understood. Because the fifteen repairs indicated in the previous

table possibly cost half a million sterling, the advisability of localising

areas that should be avoided, and that we should be able to attribute

effects to their real cause, are evidently desiderata of great importance.

   -- --St. Louis Fernando Noronlia. From a paper read at the Institution of Electrical

Engineers by Mr. H. Benest, A.M.Inst.C.E., ' On some repairs to the South American

Company's cables off Cape Verde in 1893 and 1895,' it seems that the St. Louis
Fernando Noronha cable has been twice broken. The first break occurred on
December 26, 1892, about 130 miles from St. Louis du Senegal, in a depth of 1,220
fathoms, at the time of a heavy gale. The tape covering for 140 fathoms was rubbed
bare to the sheathing wires, but on one side only. The sheathing wires at the break
were drawn out as if they had been broken in a testing-machine. The Fernando side
of the break also showed the e.fect^ of rubbing, and the character of the fracture
was similar to the other end. In picking up these two ends there was at first a strain
in one case not exceeding 26 tons, and the other of 4 tons ; but as the ends were
approached this rose to about 6 tons, when the cable evidently cleared itself from
some obstruction, and came easily on board.

    Although we have here evidence of what may possibly have been a
submarine landslip, I am not aware that at that time any disturbance was

noted in Europe.

     The second date is March 10, 1895. Here, again, great difficulty was
experienced in breaking out the cable from beneath the mud, detritus, or
whatever the materials were that had covered it. The position of this
break was about 20 miles south-west from that of 1893.

     On March 5, at 22 hours G.M.T., a very large unfelt disturbance was

recorded in Europe, and one of moderate intensity at several places in

Italy on May 10, at 10.4 p.m.

      Mr. Benest holds the opinion that these fractures are connected with
submarine river outlets and gully formations in the ocean beds. The
gradients in the vicinity of the fractures vary from 1 in 34 (1° 30') to

1 in 7 (8°).

taneously in a depth of 1,675 fathoms, indicating that the rupture was due to a

which may exist round many parts of tlie west coast of South America,

where there have been sudden and gradual upliftings of the land within

historical time, a portion of a chart showing contours near to the mouth

of the river Esmeralda is reproduced. The soundings are in fathoms.

Those in ordinary figures are from information received prior to June

1895, whilst those in larger type are from soundings taken in March 1896.

Changes from 13 or 20 fathoms to upwards of 200 fathoms in this short

interval of time are certainly remarkable                                                                                                                                                                                 and as the position of the cable-

are probably no longer correct. Off the shore, in a distance of 3 miles,

there is a depth of 200 fathoms, indicating a slope of 1 in 15, whilst at

distances of 10 miles from shore, over a length of 1 mile, slopes of 1 in 3

may be found.

   We have evidently here many instances of recent change in sub-oceanic

form, and at the same time illustrations of conditions where considerable

instability might be expected, and cable interruptions might therefore

frequently occur. It will be noted, by reference to the map, that the

position of fractures which have taken place are grouped near to the base

of these steep slopes, and in this respect follow the rule of similar occur-

rences in the North Atlantic.

     The unfelt earthquakes which were noted in or near Europe were as

follows :

    .Tanuary 25, 1891, 5-Olh. A small disturbance was recorded at Teneriffe.

     March 26, 1891, 13-6h. to 14-8h. There was an earthquake of moderate
intensity noted in Teneriffe.

    May 15, 1892. At 2-9h. at Strassburg, and at 3-7h. at Nicolaiew, there was a
feeble shock. It is, however, possible that this earthquake may have had its origin

at Stavanger, in Norway.
     October 13, 1892. At 1707h., and October 17, at ll-88h, at Stra.ssburg.
     December 16, 1893. At Charkow at 13h. 13m. there was a strong disturbance.
     June 4, 1895. At Padova at i8h. 23m., large disturbance.
     July 5, 1895, 5h. 32m. At Padova, origin evidently at a great distance.

     Whether these seven unfelt movements recorded on the eastern side
of the Atlantic were connected with seismic disturbances on the western
side of South America leading to cable interruptions, it is impossible to
speak with confidence until we know the hours at which these interrup-
tions took place. In the meanwhile, all that we can say is, that it is
worthy of note that out of fourteen cable interruptions, seven of them
took place about the times when delicately suspended instruments in or
near Europe were set in motion. Six interruptions took place when
       ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.     193

earthquakes were felt, whilst others were caused by landslips, which in

turn may have been the result of mechanical shaking. On certain

sections, as for example that connecting Arica and Mollendo, fractures
have only taken place in certain months, which in this instance are June,
July, and August. Restrictions like this suggest that the cause of

fracture has been due to landslips brought about by the escape of fresh
water beneath sea-level, the action of currents, or other sub-oceanic
phenomena having seasonal maxima.

     The interruptions off Pescadores Point (16° S. lat.), although, when

recovering cables, branches of almost petritied trees have been brought

to the surface, Mr. R. Kaye Gray attributes to the great unevenness of
the bottom, there being in that neighbourhood submarine hills 3,000 and

4,000 feet in height.

     The following notes liearing upon the above sections were kindly

drawn up by Mr. W. E. Parsone, who has been engaged in cable work on

the west coast of South America :

--Arica--Mollendo Section. This section was laid in 1875. On the night of May 9,

1877, while the cables between Arica and Lima were being used for direct working,

a very distinct shock of earthquake was felt by the operator in the Lima office at

about 10.30 P.M., during receipt of a message from Arica, and communication

ceased a few seconds later. The intermediate station of Mollendo afterwards

reported that the shock was also felt there, and at about the same time,. and that

they were unable to communicate with Arica. Mr. Parson6 located the rupture of

the Arica-- Mollendo section as close to the shore at Arica, and proceeded by first

opportunity to that place, where it was found that a violent earthquake shock on

May 9, 1877, had been accompanied by a tidal wave of unusual severity, which had

completely wrecked the greater portion of the town. The sea-front and harbour

had suffered enormous damage, the iron pier having been washed away, and prac-

tically all the craft in the port having parted their moorings or foundered. In

undertaking the repair, tons of anchor-moorings and material were picked up with

the cable, which had been considerably dragged out of position and twisted for a

considerable distance from the shore. Communication on this section was restored

on May 2i, 1877, and worked without interruption until it was permanently

repaired by renewing a portion of the shore-end and intermediate cable on

-- --November 17, 1878.
    Iquique Arica Section. This section was laid in 1875. On May 7, 1878, a severe

shock of earthquake was experienced in the neighbourhood of Iquique, after which

the cable connecting that place with Arica was found to be interrupted. Mr.

Parson6 located the rupture at 6 knots from Iquique on the intermediate cable in

60 fathoms of water, and, after considerable difficulties working with barges, there

being no repairing-ship obtainable, succeeded in lifting the cable on the spot. Both

ends were recovered, and it was found that the cable (intermediate) had snapped

clean through, the compound on either side of the break being undisturbed, except

at, say, a distance of 18 inches on either, where the sheathing wires had made one

complete turn. There the compound had sprung, and some of the strands parted,
and the sheathing wires compressed out of position. But for these comparatively

slight indications of the enormous force which must have been exerted to make so

clean a break in heavy intermediate type, the cable was in no way damaged, the

rest of the cable being in as good condition as the day it left the factory. The

earthquake, which was undoubtedly the direct cause of the rupture, was said to

have a direction from south-west to north-east, and it was noticed with much surprise

that the base of the high cliffs on the fore-shore bore marks of recent disturbance

at a spot bearing due north-east from the position of the break. The disturbance

--referred to had the appearance of a recently formed cavern or tunnel a few feet
--above the beach where the base of the hard rock was met as if some enormous

piece of artillery had been fired point-blank into the rock, and this bad also caused
a falling away of the surface rock above the opening, which peels ofE in layers like

decomposed slate. We could not land at the place to examine it more closely on

account of the surf and rocks, but attempted to do so by clambering and crawling

over the headland of rock ; but large thin sections of decomposed surface slipped

away with us continually, and ^e had to give up the attempt. Communication was
restored with a piece of deep-sea cable and permanently repaired with the s.s.

-- --'Ketriever' on November 21, 1878.
    La Serena Valparaiso Section. This cable was laid in 1876, and interrupted off

the Limaree River on July 26, 1877, as was thought, by floods from the river, although
in its normal condition it is practically a dry bed before it reaches the sea.

     This section was again interrupted on August 15, 1880, by an earthquake ; and
the same section was again interrupted by a landslip on July 4, 1885, presumably due

-- --to an earthquake.
     Mollendo CJiorillos Section. This cable was laid in 1875, and was frequently

interrupted off Pescadores Point to the north of Mollendo, where considerable
inequality of depth is experienced, due presumably to the channels of an extinct or

subterranean river, whose estuary may now be some miles at sea, and create

periodical submarine convulsions at great depth and at, say, 40 or 50 knots from
the coast. In any case, all difficulty has ceased in this locality, since the cable has,
for a considerable length, been diverted to close inland and laid as close to the shore
as it was safe for a ship to get.

     This section was also broken in two different places by an earthquake which
occurred on December 10, 1887.

   --Sast Coast of South America. The geological and topographical

conditions on the east coast of South America are strikingly different

from those met with on the west coast. On this latter coast the land

plunges rapidly downwards beneath the sea, as a slope produced by
bradyseisraic thrust and folding, whilst on the former, when measured
over long distances, the slope is gentle, indicating an absence of orogenic
activities. Although the land is generally continued seawards at a low
angle by the deposition of sediments and the scouring action of currents,

here and there declivities may have been produced by such epigenic

actions.

    On the following sections interruptions have been rare or have not

occurred :

     In the above li.st the thirty-one interruptions marked with an asterisk
took place whilst horizontal pendulums were in operation in or near

Europe.

     The European observations were as follows :

     September 18, 1889. At Potsdam, 6-92h. to 9-3h., there was a large disturbance,
which suddenly became great at 7-87h. At Wilhelmshaven the disturbance lasted
from 7h. to 9-5h. The origin is unknown.

     September 5, 1889. At Potsdam there was a heavy disturbance at 22-67h., with
a sudden increase at 2308h. At Wilhelmshaven similar phases are at 22-5h. and
2308h. Large disturbances also with unknown origin were noted on August 29 at

18-48h.

     October 9, 1892. At Strassburg and Nicolaiew, at about 2-45h. and 2 70h.
     March 3, 1891. At Tenerifife, earthquake at l-79h. Origin unknown.

    May 2], 1889. At Potsdam, a heavy disturbance at 10-55h. to U-lh. Origin

unknown.
     March 20, 1893. At Strassburg and Nicolaiew, at 5-18h. and 5'27h. At this

time there was an earthquake in Catania.

     October 13, 1892. In Strassburg 1707h. to ]7-78h. An earthquake on the

Donau.
     September 1, 1893. At Charkow at 9.35 A.M.
     February 12, 1894. At Charkow, a strong disturbance at 1.35.
     March 24, 1894. At Charkow, about this time, exceedingly heavy disturbances

were recorded. From 17h. 35m. on the 21st to 2h. 48m. on the 22nd ; from 9-35h. on
the 22nd to 3-35h. on the 2.3rd ; and on the 24th, from Oh. 26m. to Ih. 2m.

      July 22, 1894. At Charkow, from ll-35h. to 17-35h.

      October 9, 1895, at 13h. 26m. Slight.
     July 8, 1896, at 14h. 54m. and 17-46. At Shide.
     October 6, 1896, at 21-51b. At Shide.

    May 5, 1897, at 10-44h. At Shide.

     December 2, 1896, at 10 to 11 a.m. At Shide.

    Inasmuch as two of the interruptions took place on May 22, 1889,

find two on September 1, 1893, which closely correspond with the unfelt

but heavy earthquake in that year, we may say that out of twenty-nine

interruptions sixteen of these have approximately coincided with the times

at which earthquakes with unknown origins have been recorded in Europe.

   --Because on the Para Maranham ^ section interruptions have been
--frequent in October, November, and December, and on the Maranham

Ceara section in November and in March, in searching for the cause of
these interruptions we should look to variations in ocean currents or
phenomena with a seasonal change.

shallow muddy bottom, the mud being so fluid that it is .said that a schooner with
a fair wind can make a good passage when half in mud and half in water.' If this
is so, then the Amazon floods may have much to answer for in connection with

cable-interruption.

heavy movement. The epicentre possibly near Samotrace. Two other earthquakes

were noted on this day.
     August 25, 1889. At Potsdam at 7-62h. and at Wilhelmshaven from 7-53h. to Oh.,

a large disturbance. Epicentre near Patras.

   --The Lipari Milazzo fractures took place in depths of from 400 to 650

fathoms 2 or 3 miles distant from Vulcano, about north-east from

Solfatore.

   --The Zante Canea interruption occurred about 5 miles west by south

off Sapienza Island, in a depth of 1,500 fathoms with a clay bottom.

Soundings varied as much as 250 fathoms in the length of the ship, and

from 1,350 to 1,834 fathoms in half a mile.

   --The first of the Patras Corinth breaks occurred about 2 miles north

of Akraia, in mud at a depth of 197 fathoms, whilst one of the second

interruptions took place in the same locality, in depths varying between
408 and 270 fathoms within a mile, and the other, in cable No. 2, within
half a mile south of Morno point.

    Mr. W. G. Forster, writing in the ' Transactions of the Seismological

Society,' vol. xv., respecting these districts, tells us that after the Filiatra

shock in 1886 it was found, by the broken cable 30 miles away, that
some four knots of the same had been covered by a landslip, whilst the
depth of the water had increased from 700 to 900 fathoms. In 1867,
after the destruction of Cephalonia, the soundings taken after the shock
were different from those taken before. Again, on September 9, 1888, at.
5.4 P.M., the town of Vostizza, in the Gulf of Corinth, was destroyed, and
simultaneously the cable between Zante, Patras and Corinth was inter-
rupted. The cause of this, as deduced from soundings and the appear-
ance of the fractured cable, appears to have been either a sudden tautening

caused by the sweeping down of a mass of clay from a 100-fathom bank

to a 300-fathom bank, or the actual yielding of the bed on which the

cable lay.

     In 1889 a second cable was laid down in the Gulf of Corinth, but this,
when it had been down about three months, was, together with the 1884
cable, fractured at the time of an earthquake on August 25 at 8.51 p.m.
The 1889 cable seemed to have been smashed by the movement of a mass
of material about a mile in length, whilst the 1884 cable was broken at
two points by a slip on a 10 to 450 fathom bottom.

      In the districts considered by Mr. Forster, there are, as he points out,
great irregularities in submarine contours, the depths within short

distances changing from 50 to 300 and then to 1,000 fathoms. By the

deposition of silt, and the undermining of steep slopes by bottom currents,
the exit of underground springs and even rivers, overhanging shelves,

tottering and precipitous rocks, and other unstable arrangements, may
suddenly give way and cables suffer rupture.

      The facts are that the sub- oceanic contours are such that they might
be expected to be unstable, and that these contours, at the time of earth-
quakes, have suddenly been changed. In one instance there has been an
                      ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.                             197

increase in depth of over 2,400 feet, and in another of 1,200 feet ; whilst
in the case of the 1889 disturbance, eleven and a half minutes later,
unfelt earth-waves of considerable magnitude were recorded at Wilhelms-
haven, 1,732 kilometres distant. Similar unfelt movements have also

been recorded at distant places at about the time when cable-interruptions
took place, in every instance where we have been able to make comparisons.
The conclusion, then, is that in this region earthquakes occur, producing
beneath the ocean what is equivalent to the landslips which similar move-

ments produce on land.

  --Bay of Biscay. About 1875 the Direct Spanish cable was broken

about 150 miles north of Bilbao by what seemed to be a submarine

landslip, which may have been produced by an undercurrent produced by

the piling up of the surface waters under the influence of a westerly gale.
The soundings showing the neighbourhood of the interruption indicate
slopes of 1 in 7 and even 1 in 3, and it is therefore a district in which

landslides and dislocations might be expected to occur. From Mr. R.
Kaye Gray I learn that the 1872 Bilbao cable broke down periodically
usually in the month of March, with or after a heavy north-west gale.
This took place about 30 miles to the north of Bilbao, and, when repairing,
it was invariably found that 4 or 5 miles had been buried. The cause of

these interruptions was attributed to a heavy submarine current caused

by the piling-up of surface water, cutting the prolongation of a river-bed
with steep walls which, when undercut, fell in masses to bury the cable.

noted on this section wei*e as follows :

January 22, 1892; September 13, 1892*; November 24, 1892*; February 17,

1893*; April 11, 1893*; May 30, 1893*; February 5, 1894*; January 22, 1895*

     The dates on which unfelt earthquakes were recorded were as

follows :

     September 13, 1892. At Strassburg a very large disturbance from 9'54h. to
13*31h. Origin unknown.

     February 16, 1893. At Strassburg at 008h. Origin possibly in Japan.

    April 11, 1893. At Strassburg and Nicolaiew, 18-58h. to 19h. Moderate. On
April 8 at these stations there was a heavy movement from l-871i. to i'lTh. Origin

unknown.

    May 30, 1893. At the above stations from 4 33h. to 5-32h. ; a great movement.

     February 5, 1894. At Charkow from 4h. 54m. to lOh. 34m. there was a strong
movement.

    January 18, 1895, 2h. 37m. At many places in Italy.
    January 15, 1896, 7h. 10m. At many places in Italy.
    May 2, 1896, lb. 20m. Strong through Europe.

     June 13, 1896, 14h. 54m. Strong through Italy.
     June 14, 1896, 22h. 46m. Strong through Italy and at Shide. Origin, Pacific
Ocean.

   We have therefore ten cases of interruptions on or near to the dates

of nine of which large earthquakes were recorded. It is difiicult to
imagine that this particular district should be characterised by any
seismic activity, but it seems possible that, if it is a district where
sediments rapidly accumulate to attain an unstable form, these might

from time to time give way under the influence of earth-waves originating

at a great distance.

    On this particular section Mr. R. Kaye Gray points out that, from

the mouth of the Congo, extending seawards, there is a difficult gully

to cross, the walls of which are 2,000 feet in height ! Although the gully-

widens towards the west, this height is maintained for a considerable

distance. The shallowest water is found along the edges of this gully,

which therefore has a transverse section not unlike that of a river bounded

by a naturally formed levee.

     With the nineteen interruptions marked with an asterisk, there are
eleven instances where these may have corresponded with the records of
unfelt earthquakes. Approximate coincidences with earth- movements

are as follows :

   January 22, 1893, at 19'87h. A weak disturbance was noted at Nicolaiew and

Strassburg.

     September 1, 1894, from Ih. 43m. to 4h. 21m. Moderate at Charkow.

     February 20, 1893, from 19-23h. to 19-78h. At Strassburg small, origin in Japan.
     August 9, 1893, from 17h. 11m. to 191i. 4m. At Strassburg moderate.
     March 3, 1896, at 16h. 33m. Recorded through Europe.
     August 21, 1896, at lOh. Om. Recorded at Padua.

     March 15, 1896, at 19h. 36m. At Shide.
     September 21, 1896, at 16h. 63m. Recorded through Europe.
     March 23, 1897. At Sliide at 4-29h., slight.

     Sir James Anderson, in 1887, speaking about the interruptions off

the river Rovuma (11° S. lat.), remarks that, so far as soundings showed,

there was an even bottom and all that could be desired as a bed on which
to place a cable, yet every year the cable broke. The broken ends
suggested that the cable had been suspended until it snapped. Although
the cable was shifted further out, and then closer in, it still broke. This
happened eight times, and it was noticed that the interruptions occurred
at about the same time of the year. Seven of these breaks are fairly on
the same line, and Sir James's suggested explanation of this cause was
that the time when the interruptions occur is at the termination of
the rainy season in the African mountains, at Avhich time fresh-water
springs take away the bottom on which the cable lies, and leave it

suspended.

     Mr. John Y. Buchanan suggests that sometimes a cable may be

broken in consequence of its slowly subsiding through ooze, until the

-- --catenary strain becomes so great that it eventually snaps.
     Aden Bombay. Interruptions noted on this section were the

following :

July 11, 1881 ; June 3, 1885 ; July 27, 1885 ; July 11 1888 August 11, 1888.

    On the second and last of the above dates the two cables connecting
Aden with India were simultaneously broken, and the traffic between

India, Australia, and the East had to pass over the land lines of Russia,
Persia, and Turkey. The fractures took place on an even bottom a few

hundreds of miles from Aden. At the time of the 1885 interruption, a

fearful cyclone was raging at Aden, and it is therefore possible that the

ruptures may be attributed to causes similar to those which seem to have
operated on the Bilbao cables (p. 191). The place of fracture was 119

nautical miles from Aden, 20 to 25 miles south of the Arabian coast, at a

--depth of 870 to 990 fathoms, on an even bottom of mud.
     Penang and Madras. Interruptions noted on this section have been

as follows :

ber 2, 1886 ; November 2, 1886 ; November 14, 1886 ; September 22, 1888 (?) ; May 13,

1890.

    On the above dates horizontal pendulums or the equivalent instru-

ments were not in operation, but that these interruptions were partly

due to sub-oceanic change may be inferred from the fact pointed out by
Sir John Pender in the 'Electrical Review ' of May 23, 1890, who says

that nearly all the interruptions on this line have taken place on very bad

ground near the Nicobar Islands.

     The two fractures of June 29, 1888, took place 20 and 25 miles south
by west of Mount Dodo, Sambawa, where depths vary from 734 to 1,130
fathoms. Sir John Pender, at the ordinary general meeting of the
Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company,^ says that it
was found that these breaks resulted from ' volcanic ' action ; and, curiously

enough, when the cables were recovered, all sorts of things, even the roots
of trees, were found attached to them. The whole thing seemed to be a
great upheaval of nature. From the same paper, August 20, 1888, we
learn that these two interruptions took place at points widely separated.
In Port Darwin time, the fractures took place on June 29, at 10.40 p.m.
The three interruptions of July 11, 1890, took place, in Banjoewanji time,
at 1.35 A.M., on a rough, uneven bottom, between Tafel Hoek (Bali) and
Balambangan Point, Java, where the depths vary from 155 to 927 fathoms.
The duplicate cable was broken in three places, and overlaid about 65 miles
from Banjoewanji. The three cables run along two sides and near the
bottom of a gully separating Baly from Java, and are about 7 miles
apart. They practically broke on one line, and the cause was ' volcanic '
action.' In this instance, as in that of June 30, 1888, the submarine
displacements extended over an unusually wide area ; and, when we refer

to a chart, it is seen that at a distance of 9 miles in a south-west

direction from Tafel Hoek there is a depth of 1,180 fathoms, indicating a

slope of 1 in 7.

     The only interruptions which can be compared with the records of
horizontal pendulums are the last five, whilst the time of the inter-
ruption of March 22, 1893, is not known. The mean Greenwich times
and dates at which the remaining four took place in 1893 are as follows :

     1. February 22, between 4h. 20m. and 161i. 20m.
     2. September 12, 12h. 20m.
     3. October 24, 17h. 5m.
     4. October 26, 3h. Om.

     The conclusion is that only the first of these four interruptions took
place when an unfelt earthquake was recorded in Europe, but similar dis-
turbances were noted on September 11 and October 22.

     The following table is a comparison of the days and hours when
earthquakes were felt in Java, with the times at which cables were

interrupted :

     For the interruptions of cables on June 29, 1888, and July 10, 1890,

we have the assurance of those connected with their management that

blished, the number of interruptions Avhich have occurred have been at
least 245. For certain lines it would appear that fractures were more
frequent at one season than at others, and that therefore a proper analysis

--of the table or its parts such, for example, as those to which earthquake
--statistics have been subjected might lead to the discovery of periodicities

in cable-interruptions. Unfortunately, because the material in our
possession is yet so meagre, such discussions must for the present be

reserved.

     Out of the 245 breaks, 87 of them, each marked with an asterisk,
occurred at the times when instruments were in operation which would

record unfelt earthquake effects. Fifty-eight of the 87 cable-interrup-

tions occurred at or about the times when Europe was agitated by these

--unfelt movements. The fractures accompanying earthquake, or, as it is

sometimes called, volcanic movement which could be felt, and which

--in two instances caused destruction on neighbouring shores were at

least 10 in number, which may be raised to 24 by including the Java

records. In three of these instances, two or three cables were broken
simultaneously. With the latter the submarine dislocations extended
over a wide area ; in the Gulf of Corinth great changes in ocean
depth were brought about, and from this latter place we know the motion
to have radiated so that a few minutes after the interruption well-defined
diagrams of earth- waves were obtained at localities 1,000 miles distant,
at places where no movement could be felt.

      Instances like the latter clearly establish a connection between cable-
interruptions, earthquake-motion which has been felt, submarine disloca-
tion, and the records of horizontal pendulums in distant localities. This
being the case, and because earthquake-motion cannot be felt at great
distances from its origin, it is reasonable to conclude that the records of
unfelt earthquakes which approximately coincide in time to those at which

cables have been interrupted may sometimes indicate that submarine

geological changes have accompanied seismic efforts.
      Although certain conclusions arrived at in this paper are definite,

until the materials necessary for analysis can be obtained, others remain
matters of inference. The records of interruptions for the lines men-

tioned are, we have reason to believe, incomplete. The horizontal
pendulum records with which to make comparisons have not only been

few in number, but, because they are confined to Europe, could only be
expected to throw light upon disturbances originating at a great distance,
which were exceptionally large. The records of earthquakes which have
been felt ai-e confined to an imperfect list for Java, a few from the Medi-
terranean, and a few reported from the west coast of South America.
 Lastly, the hours, and in some cases even the days, on which cable-
 interruptions have taken place, together with the probable cause of these
 interruptions, are unknown. These latter facts are no doubt to be found

in the archives of many cable companies, and it would be to the interest
of all who desire to increase our knowledge of sub-oceanic change if com-
 parisons could be made between the records of unfelt earthquakes now

 published, and the times and circumstances at and under which corre-
 sponding cable-ruptures have taken place.'

 be glad to receive any information respecting the day, hour, and probable causes of
 failure, connected with cable-interruption.
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.         203

     All that it is expected to find is that a certain, and probably a

small, proportion of these interruptions may correspond in time with
seismic disturbances ; and, because we know that certain cables have

been lost by landslips and dislocations accompanying earthquake-move-

ment, it is to be hoped that the expectation may be regarded as a

reasonable conjecture.

  --An Attempt to estimate the Frequency of Submarine Dislocations.

If it can be assumed that the majority of cable-interruptions are due to
submarine displacements, and not to faults inherent in themselves (which
are comparatively of rare occurrence), the swaying of suspended sections
under the influence of waves and currents, the movements of marine
creatures, the boring of a teredo, and other exceptional causes, tlien the
tables which have been given of cable fractures will give some idea of the
frequency of such displacements. Because the list of interruptions for
a number of the lines mentioned are imperfect, and because each cable
follows a path carefully chosen as not being likely to suffer from sub-
marine disturbance, the frequency of dislocation derived from such an

assumption is more likely to be a minimum than a maximum. From the
known number of interruptions which have occurred on sections of given

length in a given number of years, the following table of dislocation

frequency per mile of coast per year has been computed.

Cable IHs location jjer Mile per Tear.
204 REPORT-- 1897.

     The coasts taken are the east and west sides of South America and
Africa. The total length considered representing shores which are
steep and those which are gently inclined is about 11,000 miles. The
general result which is reached is that the dislocations per mile per year,
on the coast-lines considered, which may be taken as having on the

average a character similar to that of the coast-lines of the world, are

represented by the number 0"0023, that is to say, there is on the average
one dislocation for every 434 miles per year. If we increase this number
to 500 miles, and remember the character of the records and that of the
paths to which they refer, although we have attributed all the interrup-
tions to submarine change, we are inclined to the opinion that the

estimate is not too great. This being granted, then, as there are about
156,000 miles of coast-line in the world, if the same were surrounded by
loops of cal)les, although each section might be laid in the most favour-
able position, more than three hundred interruptions resulting from sub-
marine disturbance might be expected to occur every year. In deep

water on a level soft bottom experience shows that a cable may remain
undisturbed and unchanged for long periods of time, indicating, as we

have already pointed out, that geological change is proceeding with
extreme slowness.

     4. Conclusions and Suggestions for a Seismic Survey of the World.

     Because earthquake origins are more numerous beneath the sea than
upon the land, it is fair to assume that the bradyseismical operations
resulting in the folding, bending, crushing, faulting, and thrusting of rock
masses are more active in the recesses of the ocean than they are upon
our continents. Sub-oceanic volcanic activity, as, for example, that which
is met with in the mid- Atlantic, probably indicates the existence of
bradyseismic movement and a relief of strain. The concentration of de-
tritus derived from continental surfaces along coast-lines on tracts which
are comparatively small, indicates that beneath the sea the growth by
sedimentation is greater per unit area than the similarly estimated loss is
by denudation on the land. This rapid submarine growth, largely under
the influence of gravity, but modified by hydrodynamic action, leads to

the building up of steep contours, the stability of which may be destroyed

·by the shaking of an earthquake, the escape of water from submarine
springs, the change in direction or intensity of an ocean current, or by
other causes which have been enumerated. That submarine landslides of
great magnitude have had a real existence is proved for certain localities
fcy the fact that after an interval of a few years very great diSerences in
depth of water have been found at the same place, whilst sudden changes in
depth have taken place at the time of and near to the origin of submarine
·earthquakes (see pp. 193 and 197). Large ocean-waves unaccompanied by
volcanic action indicate that there have been very great and sudden dis-
placements of materials beneath the ocean. The most important evidence
of sub- oceanic change is, however, to be found amongst the archives of
the cable engineer. The routes chosen for cables are carefully selected as
being those where interruptions are least likely to occur ; and yet, as it
ihas been shown, something which is often of the nature of a submarine

landslip takes place and some miles of cable may be buried. Here we

seem to have proof positive, especially along the submerged continental
plateaus, of sudden sub- oceanic dislocation. Because these changes are
ON SEISMOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION.         205

frequent, it is reasonable to suppose that sedimentation and erosion and
other causes which lead up to the critical conditions are geologically

rapid.

     Briefly, the foregoing notes and facts indicate that beneath the oceans
certain important geological changes are more rapid than they are upon
land, whilst new sources from which information respecting these changes

may be obtained are pointed out to the student of dynamical geology.

     The more important of these sources are the experiences of the cable
engineer and the records of seismographs, which are sensitive to unfeli

movements. When a number of these instruments have been established

round the world, on the borders of great oceans, and on oceanic islandsy
it is diificult to overestimate the practical and scientific results which will

follow.

     The greater number of records, as it has been shown, would refer to-
disturbances which originated beneath the sea. From the times at which
earth-waves arrived at different stations, as, for example, on the two sides
of the Atlantic, it would be possible to localise their origins, and in time
districts would be indicated which it would be well for those who lay

cables to avoid. Work of this nature has, by means of ordinary seismo-

 graphs, been partially accomplished for Japan, and the seismic maps of
 that country ' show that sub-oceanic disturbances originating near to the

 coast are herded in groups. Should a trans-Pacific cable be landed in.
 that country, to effect this through the middle of one of these groups-

 would be inviting its destruction.
      If we had the means of knowing that when an interruption occurred

 in a cable at the same time an unfelt earthquake had been recorded, we-
 should then be in a position to attribute the fault to its proper cause..
 The practically simultaneous failure of three Atlantic cables in 1884 led
 to the hypothesis that they had been broken by the grapnels of a
 repairing vessel ; fortunately for the owners of this vessel, it could not be-

  substantiated.

      From the 'Electrician ' of August 20 and October 12, 1888, we learn
 that the simultaneous interruption of the two cables connecting Java and

  Australia in 1888 cut off the latter from the outside world for nineteen
  days, and gave a pretext for calling out the military and naval reserves to-
  meet the contingency of war having broken out. In 1890 three cables
  Avere simultaneously broken, and telegraphic communication with Australia,

 was cut off for nine days. On these occasions, had there been established

  in Australia a proper instrument for recording unfelt movements of the'
  ground, it is extremely likely that the cause of the interruption would
  have been recognised as due to seismic action, and the fear of war and the-
  probable accompanying commercial paralysis would have been averted.
  Other direct benefits, which have already been derived from the records;
  of instruments such as it is here proposed to establish round the world,
  are that they enable us to extend, correct, and even to cast doubt upon

   certain classes of telegraphic information published in our newspapers.

       Late in June last year we learned from our newspapers that a great

  disaster had taken place in North Japan, and that nearly 30,000 peoplfr
  had lost their lives. Seismograms taken in the Isle of Wight not only

  indicated how many maxima of motion had taken place, but showed that

  there had been an error in transmission of two days, the catastrophe;

' See Seismological Jortrnal, vol. ir.
206  ·  REPORT-- 1897.

having taken place on the evening of June 1 5, so that all who were to

reach the stricken district after that date were in safety.

     On August 31 of the same year, the Isle of Wight records showed that a

disturbance similar to that which had occurred in Japan had taken place.

On account of this similarity, it was stated that we should probably hear

of a great earthquake having taken place in or near that country on the
above date at 5.7 p.m. Four weeks later this was verified by mail.
Another instance occurred some weeks latei-, when our newspapers an-
nounced that a great earthquake had taken place and sevei'al thousand

lives had been lost in Kobe. No doubt those who had friends and pro-
perty in that city were filled with anxiety. On this occasion the Isle of

Wight instruments were still indicating that nothing of the magnitude
described could have occurred. Later it was discovered that the telegram

was devoid of all foundation.
     If we next turn to the scientific aspect of the proposed investigations,

we at once recognise the importance of the results which it is hoped may

be obtained for the hydrographer and the student of physical geography
and geology.

     The greatest result which it is hoped may be achieved is to accurately

determine the rate at which earthquake motion is propagated over long
distances. In some instances the rates which have already been deter-
mined are so high, reaching 12 and more kilometres per second, that
the supposition is, that motion does not simply go round our earth, but
that it goes throuffh the same ; and if this is so, then a determination of

these rates of transit will throw new light upon the eSective rigidity of

our planet.

At the Liverpool meeting the Committee agreed that the ' calorie,'

defined as the heat equivalent of 4-2 x 10'' ergs, should be adopted as the
unit for the measurement of quantities of heat, but the question as to the
exact part of the absolute thermodynamic scale of temperature at which
   PRACTICAL STANDARDS FOR ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 207

this quantity of heat could be taken as equal to one water-gramme-degree
was for the time being left open.

     This resolution has made it incumbent on the Committee to consider

carefully

     1. The relation between the results of measurements of intervals of
temperature by accepted methods and the absolute scale

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

     2. The specific heat of water in terms of the erg and its variation with

temperature.

   With regard to the first point there appears to be no reason to doubt

that the scale of a constant-volume hydrogen-thermometer is very nearly

identical with the absolute scale. ' The Committee have therefore decided

to recognise the standard hydrogen-thermometer of the Bureau Inter-

national des Poids et Mesures as representing, nearly enough for present

purposes, the absolute scale. This convention has at least the advantage

of giving a definite meaning to statements of the numerical value of

intervals of temperature within any range for which comparison with the

hydrogen-thermometer is practicable. If future investigation should show

that it is inaccurate to any appreciable extent, corresponding corrections

can be applied when necessary.

   Experience of the use of the platinum resistance-thermometer in various

hands encourages the hope that it will afford a convenient and trust-

worthy working method of referring the indications of mercury- or other

thermometers to those of the standard hydrogen-thermometer. The Com-

mittee have consequently much satisfaction in learning that Dr. C. A.
Harker, formerly of Owens College, is at this moment carrying out at

Sevres, on behalf of the Committee of the Kew Observatory, and with the

concurrence of the Director of the Laboratories of the Bureau Inter-

national, a direct comparison of platinum thermometers belonging to the

Kew Observatory with the standard hydrogen-thermometer of the

Bimreau.

   --As to the dynamical value of the specific heat of water in other words
--the mechanical equivalent of heat it was pointed out by Professor

SSchuster and Mr. Gannon in 1894 ^ that the results of the best determi-

nations by direct mechanical methods agree among themselves much more

·closely than they do with those that are founded upon electrical measure-

ments of the energy expended, although these in turn are in good agree-

ment among themselves. Additional significance is given to this remark

by the comparison of those determinations which, by extending over an

appreciable range of temperature, indicate the rate of variation of the

specific heat of water. Of such determinations there is one of each kind,

that of Professor Rowland by the mechanical method, and that of Mr.

E. H. Griffiths by the electrical method. The results of the former of these

liave recently undergone an elaborate revision at the hands of one of

Professor Rowland's pupils, Mr. W. S. Day,^ who has compared the

three principal thermometers employed in the experiments with the

Sevres hydrogen-standard by means of three Tonnelot thermometers

which had been compared at the Bureau with the hydrogen-standard.

Rowland's thermometers with a platinum thermometer made by Mr.
Griffiths. The result of this discussion is to leave Rowland's original
value unchanged at 15°, and to raise it by four parts in 4,000 at 25°,
making the rate of variation of the specific heat of water almost exactly
the same as that given by Griffiths's experiments throughout the same

range.

     The following table gives the numerical values :

            PRACTICAL STANDARDS FOR ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 209

     The agreement between the separate determinations by the mechauical
and by the electrical methods respectively, and the regularity of the
differences between Rowland's values and those of Griffiths, is such as to
raise a strong presumption that, in the experiments by both methods,

errors of observation have been reduced to a very small amount. At the

same time the difference between the two sets of results points to some
constant source of error in the measurement of energy affecting one or
both. The mechanical method is, in principle, so direct and simple that

it is difficult to suppose its results affected by a constant error. On the

other hand, the electrical method being less direct and more complicated,
there is here more room for uncertainty in the data.

     The electrical determinations depend upon the well-known relation
between thermal and electrical energy, which is expressible in the three

forms

     Schuster and Gannon's experiments are based upon the second form
-of the equation, those of Griffiths on the third. In both of them electro-
motive force was measured by comparison with a Latimer Clark's cell.
Schuster and Gannon measured, in addition, the strength of their current
by means of a silver-voltameter, and Griffiths measured a resistance in
terms of the ohm.

     The accepted value of the electromotive force of the Clark's cell depends
in its turn on the electrochemical equivalent of silver as determined by
Lord Rayleigh and Professor F. Kohlrausch, and consequently it appears

that the electrical determinations of the mechanical equivalent involve a
double reference to the electrochemical equivalent of silver, so that any
inaccuracy in the adopted value of this quantity would involve a duplicate
error in the value of the mechanical equivalent deduced therefrom.

     In this connection it may be mentioned that, in a recent letter to

^Nature,' vol. Ivi. p. 292, Lord Rayleigh has stated that he does not
consider that a possible error of one part in 1,000 is excluded from his
determination of the electrochemical equivalent of silver. If it be
assumed that his value is one part in 1,000 too small, this would almost
exactly account for the difference between the electrical determinations
into which this quantity enters as a factor and . the direct mechanical

'detei minations.
      It thus appears to be a matter of urgent importance that a redeter-

mination of the electrochemical equivalent of silver should be made, and
that the general question of the absolute measurement of electric currents
should be investigated. In order to enable them to carry out this investi-
gation, the Committee have decided to ask for reappointment and to apply
for a grant of 100^. towards the expense of the necessary apparatus and

·experiments.

APPENDIX I.

Note on the Constant-volume Gas-thermometer.

          By G. Carey Foster, F.B.S.

     The absolute thermodynamic scale of temperature introduced by Lord
Kelvin is connected with the properties of real fluids by the equation '

TrfT_ dv                                      ^^>

     T^

where dv is the infinitesimal increment which unit mass of a fluid occupying-      I

the volume v undergoes when it is heated, under constant pressure, from

the absolute temperature T to the infinitesimally higher absolute tempera-

ture T-f c^T, and ho is the amount of work required to restore the original
temperature of unit mass of the fluid when it has undergone a fall of
pressure, Sp, by passing through a porous plug, as in Joule and Thomson's

experiments, without loss or gain of heat.

     It follows that, if there is any fluid which does not undei'go a change
of temperature when forced through a porous plug, an infinitesimal change
of temperature is to the total temperature on the absolute scale as tlie
resulting change of volume of this fluid is to the total volume. Such a fluid
would be called a perfect gas.

     The following discussion of the bearing of the results of *\\q porous-
plug experiments on the indications of a constant-volume gas-thermometer
is taken from a copy which the writer made in January 1894 of a fuller
discussion of these experimen ' s communicated to him by his friend and
former pupil, Mr. John Rose-Tnnes. Mi-. Rose-Innes will shortly read a
paper on this question beforn the Physical Society of London. In the
meantime the writer has his permission to make the present use of his

hitherto'unpublished results.

      It will be remembered that Joule and Lord Kelvin found that all the
gases they experimented on were, with the exception of hydrogen, slightly
cooled by being forced through the plug. With hydrogen the eflect was

smaller than with other gases and was a rise of temperature. At a given

temperature the cooling eflect was, up to five or six atmospheres, propor-
 tional to the diflerence of pressure on opposite sides of the plug. For a
given change of pressure the eflect decreased with rise of temperature,
and Joule and Lord Kelvin concluded that it was approximately propor-

--tional to the inverse square of the temperature reckoned from 273° C.

With hydrogen the variation with temperature was too small for them to

 consider it as clearly established ; if anything the efiect became greater as
 the temperature rose.

      Mr. Rose-Innes's discussion of these results is founded upon his
 remark that an empirical formula with two constants, a and /3, namely

^^^k+t + i''

    ' Compare equation (16) of Lord Kelvin's article ' Heat ' in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, vol. si. p. 571 ; Mathematical and Physical Papers, vol, iii.
PRACTICAL STANDARDS FOR ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 211

where () is the cooling eflfect and t temperature on the ordinary centigrade
scale, represents the experimental values rather more accurately than the
inverse-square formula. The values of a and yS calculated by him for air,
carbonic acid gas, and liydrogen, the change of pressure being represented
by 100 inches of mercury, are as follows :

                  a

Carbonic Acid

    To apply equation (1) to the discussion of the gas-thermometer, we
may begin (like Joule and Kelvin) by expressing the work civ, required

to restore the gas to its initial condition, in terms of the observed cooling

effect, and may write

whence we may conclude that, to the degree of approximation attained in

this calculation, the scale of the constant volume gas-thermometer is
identical with the absolute thermodynamic scale.

-On a Determination of the Ohm made in Testing the Lorenz Apparatus
     of the McGill University, Montreal, hy Professor W. E. Ayrton,

      i^.R.S., and Professor J. Viriamu Jones, F.B.S.

     This apparatus, made by Messrs. Nakler Brothers, is in general arrange-
 ment and dimensions similar to the Cardiff apparatus described in the
 'Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,' 1891, A, pp. 1-42, and
 in the 'Electrician,' June 1895, vol. xxxv. pp. 231 and 253.

      The field coil, in pursuance of a suggestion contained in the Royal
 Society paper, consists of a single layer of wire wound in a helical groove
 of semicircular section, cut in the cylindrical surface of a massive marble
 ring of about 21 inches outside diameter, 15 inches inside diameter, and

  6 inches thick. This helical groove has 201 complete turns with a pitch

 of 0-025 inch. Bare wire, of mean thickness 0-02136 inch, was first used.
           PRACTICAL STANDARDS FOR ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS. 213

and the outside diameter of the coil so wound was measured in the
Whitworth machine with the foUov.'ing results :

            Diameter
214 KEPOET-- 1897.

     During the time that the ring was unwound the linear coefficient of
expansion of the marble was measured by Messrs. Spiers, Twyman, and
Waters, three of the students of the City and Guilds Central Technical
College. The experiment was attended with difficulty, for it was far from

easy to bring so large a mass of a badly conducting substance to the
same temperature, but ultimately the result 0*000004 per 1° C. was

obtained.

    At the conclusion of the resistance observations recorded further on,
the silk ribbons and the protecting layer of paraffin wax were carefully

removed until the silk covering of the wire appeared, and the diameter of
the coil was measured along two directions at right angles to one another.

The maximum difference between four measurements was only five

hundred-thousandths of an inch, and after the introduction of the proper
temperature corrections, the mean value of the outside diameter of the
coil was found to be

                                        21-04687 inches at 20°-4 C.

     This result is about one part in ten thousand larger than the calcu-
lated value given above, and the difference is probably due to the silk

covering of the wire having swollen slightly when the wound coil was
brushed over with melted paraffin wax. In the calculation, therefore, of
the coefficient of mutual induction we have considered it more accurate
to use the value obtained by direct experiment. Subtracting from that

-- -- --value 21 ·04687 the thickness of the double silk-covered wire 0-01914

--we have for the mean diameter of the coil from axis to axis of the loire

                                       21-02773 inches at 20°-4 C.

     Shortly before the last set of resistance measurements was carried out,
the edge of the phosphor bronze disc was ground in position so as to be
made quite true with the axis of rotation, and immediately after the com-
pletion of the investigation the diameter of the disc was measured and
found to be 13-01435 inches at 19°-5 C. Messrs. Spiers, Twyman, and
Waters had previously determined its linear coefficient of expansion to
be 00000125 per 1° C, so that its diameter was

                                       13-01451 inches at 20°-4 C.

    During 1896 Mr. W. G. Rhodes, when he was an Assistant at the

Central Technical College, carried out the long calculation of the co-

efficient of mutual induction between the coil, as wound with bare wire,
and the disc by using the method given in the paper in the ' Philosophical

--Transactions ' above referred to, and with the following values :

          ADiameter of coil or 2      =21*02673 inches.

          Diameter of disc or 2 «     =13-01997 inches.

          Axial length of helix or 2 x =5-025 inches,

          ix'umber of convolutions or w=201

He found  M= 18056-36 inches.
            = 45862-33 centimetres.

     This calculation was checked by Mr, Mather and independently by

one of the authors,

    Now it can be shown that for the above values of A, a, x, and n

          -- ^M$^=1-246
          A + 2-343                a  + 0-0997--,

M Aand so the value of
         for the particular values of 2 and 2 a given

above, viz. 21-02772 and 13-01451 can be calculated. When this is done

we find

         M= 18037-51 inches.

            =45814-45 centimetres.

Mand this was the value of which we employed in our final determina-

tion, after allowance had been made for the effect of the central brush, as

will be described further on.

     The accuracy of the preceding calculations was tested in the fol-

Alowing way. Values of 2 and 2a, differing slightly from those em-

ployed by Mr. Rhodes, were selected, and by means of the formula for

M M--- the proportional change in was determined by Mr. Twyman. Then
M Athe value of for these changed values of 2 and 2 a, was calculated by

the authors from a new formula involving an elliptic integral of the third

kind.i

     The centre brush consists of a tube, 0-135 inch outside diameter,
which projects into an axial hole in the disc of 0-144 inch diameter.
Oontact with the edge of the disc is made by three small tangential
phosphor bronze tubes lightly pressed on it, at points separated by
angular distances of 120\ Through all four tubes a small stream of
mercury is kept flowing, as this is found to greatly diminish the disturbances
caused by variations in the thermo-electric effects ; and the employment
of three brushes at the circumference, as suggested by Rowland, eliminates
small errors due to imperfect centering of the coil and disc.

     To prevent the mercury which drops out of the central tube-brush
touching the disc at a larger radius than that of the hole in its centre an
ebonite boss is cemented to the disc, and this causes the mercury to drop
away quite clear of the metal of the disc.

     If we take as the effective outside diameter of the central tube 0-139
inch, that is the mean of 0-135 and 0-144 inch, calculation shows that tho

coefficient of mutual induction is reduced by 4-50 centimetres, so that

finally we have

                    M= 45809 -95 centimetres..

   MAs the allowance for the central brush only diminishes by one part

in ten thousand it is clear that, for that degree of accuracy, an error of a
few per cent, in estimating the diameter of the central brush is of no

consequence.

      The method of making the observations was the same as that described

Ain the papers on the Cardiff apparatus read before Section of the British

Association at Nottingham and Oxford (vide Report of the Committee
on Electrical Standards, Appendices 1893 and 1894). The use of an
extremely sensitive Ayrton-Mather galvanometer of the d'Arsonval type

materially facilitated the readings being taken. Two such narrow coil

galvanometers were specially constructed by Mr. Mather himself for use

used the August 1897 Board of Trade values for these coils as transmit-

ting the Board of Trade ohm to the laboratory in Exhibition Road.

Kew and their en-ors were determined at the time by the kindness of

Dr. Chree ; also, thanks to Sir J. Norman Lockyer, the clock in the

Mechanical Department of the Central Technical College, which trans-
mitted seconds to the fast running Bain Chronograph, was frequently
timed by reference to the current sent hourly to his room from the

General Post OfEce, and at 10 A.M. from Greenwich.

     The results of successive measurements of the absolute resistances
became very concordant after, little by little, various possible causes of
small errors had been eliminated. Nine sets taken on July 30, 1897,,

     As regards 4 and 7, special induction balances were constructed and

used by Mr. Mather to test the permeability of both the marble ring and

the phosphor  bronze  disc                but,  although  a  deviation  from                                                                   unity of  one
                                       ;

part in fifteen thousand could have been detected in the permeability of

either, no such deviation was observed.

     As regards 5 and 8, careful tests were made every day of the

insulation resistance of the apparatus, and it was always found to be

greater than one thousand megohms.

     6. The insulation between the adjacent convolutions of wire could not

be measured when they were silk covered and buried in paraffin wax,

since a small leak between a pair of turns would not change the apparent

resistance of the copper coil by as much as the variation in temperature

Weof a fraction of one degree.                  had, therefore, to content ourselves with

the precautions, previously described, which were taken to secure high

insulation in the winding of the coil.

    When the ring was wound with bare wire it was possible to roughly

compare the insulation resistance between pairs of convolutions by

sending a constant current through the coil and measuring, very

accurately, the P.D. between every adjacent pair of the 201 turns. This

we did several times, but it was a long and laborious task.

    When constructing a new Lorenz apparatus it will be well to consider

whether two separate helices should not be cut in the cylindrical surface

of the marble ring in which two independent bare wires would be bound,

a turn of the one being everywhere (except at the extreme ends) between

two turns of the other. The insulation resistance, therefore, between

the two windings would measure the insulation between the adjacent

turns, while in the ordinary use of the apparatus the two windings would

be joined in series so as to constitute a single coil. In this way it may

be possible to be more sure of the absence of 6 than by using paraffined

double silk covered wire, and at the same time, to entirely remove 1.

     The direction of our experimental result, which shows that the Board

of Trade ohm is between two and three parts in ten thousand larger than
the true ohm could not, however, arise from 1. Nor could it arise from

either 2 or 3, still many experiments were made to detect any evidence

of the effective diameter of the disc being larger than its true diameter,

as measured in the Whitworth machine. But no change in the pressure

of the circumferential brush-tubes, nor alteration in the shape of their

ends, &c., indicated that, with the brushes as we employed them, the

effective diameter of the disc differed from its true diameter.

     Our thanks are due to the three students whose names are given above
for much assistance in carrying out the long series of observations ; to Mr.
Harrison for bringing to bear, from time to time, the experience that he

had  previously gained  in  the           use   of  the   Lorenz apparatus                                                                     and  we   are

especially indebted to Mr. Mather for the suggestive aid which he rendered

us throughout the whole of the present investigation.

--Mcteorolor/ical Observations on Ben Nevis. Report of the Committee,

    consisting of Lord McLaren, Professor A. Crum Brown (Secre-

     tarij). Dr. John Murray, Dr. Alexander Buchan, and Professor

      K. OorELAND. (Draicn up by Dr. Bl'CHAn.)

     The Committee was appointed, as in former years, for the purpose of
co-operating with the Scottish Meteorological Society in making meteoro-
logical observations at the two Ben Nevis Observatories.

     The hourly eye observations by night as well as by day have been made
with the utmost regularity by Mr. Angus Rankin, the Acting Superin-
tendent, and the assistants during the year. The continuous registrations
and other observations have been carried on at the Low Level Observatory

at Fort "William with the same accuracy and fulness of detail as heretofore.
     The Directors of the Observatories tender their best thanks to Messrs.

A. J. Herbertson, T. S. Muir, A. Drysdale, M.A., B.Sc, P. S. Hardie,
George Ednie, and John S. Begg, for the invaluable assistance rendered
by them as volunteer observers during the summer and autumn months,

thus giving much needed relief to the members of the regular observing

staff.

     Table I. shows for the year 1896 the mean monthly and extreme
pressures and temperatures ; amounts of rainfall, with the days of rain,
and the number of days when the amount exceeded one inch ; the hours of
sunshine ; the mean percentage of cloud ; the mean velocity of the wind in
miles per hour at the top of the mountain ; and the mean rainband at both
observatories. The mean barometric pressures at Fort William Observa-
tory are reduced to 32° and sea level, but those at the Ben Nevis

Observatory are reduced to 32° only.

barometric observation hitherto made occurred, that observation being
27-333 inches, thus giving the range of 3"775 inches, a range which future
observation is not likely to increase. The weather at the time was strongly
anticyclonic, as the subjoined extracts from the Observatories show :

    The differences from the mean monthly pressures greatly exceeded the
average in January, February, May, July, August, and November, those

for January and May being greater than any that had occurred for the

previous forty years, and in these months accordingly relatively high
temperatures ruled on the top of Ben Nevis.

     The following Table shows the deviations from the mean temperatures

of the months from the respective averages :

     Thus it is seen the temperature at the top of Ben Nevis was relatively
much higher than at Fort William in January, May, and November, when
well developed anticyclones were of most frequent occurrence.

     During the first half of the year temperature was above the average
at both Observatories, the mean excess at Fort William being 2°"4 and at

the top of Ben Nevis 3° -3. On the other hand, during the second half of

the year the mean temperature was 1°'0 under the normal at Fort
William, and 0°-8 at the top of Ben Nevis. The two extreme months
were February, when mean temperature was fully 4°'0 above the normal,
and October, when it was fully 4°0 under it at the two Observatories.

     The absolutely highest temperature recorded during the year was 79°-9,
on June 14 at Fort William, and 61 °3, also on June 14, at the top of Ben
Nevis. The absolutely lowest temperature was 22°*0 on December 18 at
Fort William, and at the top 14°'2 on January 23. The minimum

temperatures are exceptionally high for both places. At the top of the
--222

mountain 14°-2 is the highest minimum temperature of any year since the

Observatory was established.

As regards extremes of temperature the difference between the two

maxima was greatest in May, when it was 22° -0, and least in December,

when it was     12°'6                     and the  difference between  the  two minima was
                                       ;

greatest in Februai-y, when it was 16°-8, and least in December, when it

was only 7°'8.

The registrations of the sunshine recorder at the top show 756 hours

out of a possible 4,470 hours, being 61 hours more than in 1895. This

equals 17 per cent of the possible sunshine. The maximum was 222 hours

in May, being the highest hitherto recorded in any month except in June
1888, when the number of hours of clear sunshine was 250. The
minimum was 23 hours in December, no higher monthly minimum having
yet been recorded in any year. At Fort William the number of hours for

the year was 1,036, being 96 hours fewer than in 1895. This great

difference in favour of the top was due to a greater prevalence of anti-

cyclones during 1896, when clearer weather prevails at the top than at the

foot of the mountain. The maximum was 231 hours in May and the
minimum 17 in January and again in December. As the number of

hours of possible sunshine at Fort William is 3,497, the sunshine of 1896
was 30 per cent, under the possible.

In the subjoined Table are given for each month the lowest hygro-

metric readings :

METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEN NEVIS.                                            223

The mean hourly velocity of the wind at the top of Ben Nevis was

12 miles for the year, being the lowest velocity of any year since the

observations began . The maximum mean monthly velocity was 18 miles

an hour in December, and the minimum only 6 miles in June. For the
three summer months, June, July, and August, the mean was at the rate

of 9 miles per hour, but for the three winter months, December, January,

and February, it was 15 miles per hour. These are respectively the

lowest mean summer and the lowest mean winter velocities of the wind

hitherto recorded at this Observatory.

The rainfall for the year at the top of Ben Nevis was 133'56 inches,

being 15'56 inclies greater than the rainfall of 1895. It was, however,

11-95 inches under the average of the past observations. The highest

monthly amount was 19-54 inches in March, and the lowest 2-91 inches in

May, being the smallest rainfall of any previous May. The heaviest fall

on any single day was 2-94 inches on January 17, which is absolutely the

least daily maximum fall yet recorded for any year.

On the top rain fell on 259 days, and at Fort William on 237 days,

these numbers of days being the average rainy days at the two Observa-

tories. At the top the maximum number of rainy days was 26 in March,

April, and October ; and at Fort William, 24 in January, March, and

December. The minimum number of days of rain at the top was 12 days

in May, and at Fort William 7 days, also in May.

During the year the number of days on which an inch of rain, or more,

was precipitated was 44 at the top and 16 at Fort William ; at the latter
place an inch of rain was not reached on any day of April, May, June,

July and November, but at the top, on the other hand, this amount was

exceeded on 7 days of March, while May had only one such day.

Auroras are reported to have been observed on the following dates :

January 3, 4, 5,  6, 7,  9, 22, 29,  30,  31 ;  February 2,  3,  12,  13,  17,  18,  19

It was intimated in last year's Report that an intermediate station

had been established on Ben Nevis, at a height of 2,322 feet, or neai-ly

midway in height between the two Observatories. This temporary

station was established for the purpose of ascertaining with greater pre-

cision than has hitherto been possible the extent to which anticyclones

descend on the mountain ; but more particularly the relations of pressure,
temperature, humidity, rainfall, cloud, and wind at this intei'mediate

station with the observations at Fort William and on the summit of Ben

Nevis. The three stations are in a line with each other, and the heights

are 4,406, 2,322, and 42 feet. The observations were made by Mr. Muir,

Aof the Royal High School of Edinburgh, during September.                      report on

the observations was prepared by Mr. Muir and read by him at a Meeting

of the Royal Society of Edinburgh last winter. The observations at this

intermediate station have been again resumed this year, and arrangements

have been made for a continuous record of observations from July 19 to

September 30. This year the weather fortunately has hitherto (till
--224 REPORT 1897.

August 9) been mostly anticyclonic, being the type of weather so mucli
desired for the observations needed in carrying out the important inquiries

referred to above.

     During the past year much of the time of the office in Edinburgh,
aided by Mr. Ormond and the staff on Ben Nevis, has been spent in pre-

paring for the press the whole of the observations, hourly and otherwise,

made at the two Observatories from January 1888 to 1896. These obser-
Avations, now ready for press, will fill two large quarto volumes.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            dis-

cussion of the observations from December 1883, when they commenced,

to December 1896, is in progress, which, it is expected, will be finished in

the spring of next year.

    Among the separate parts of this large discussion, already completed, are

the mean hourly variation of the barometer, and the temperature, for the

months and the year, at each of the two Observatories for the same terms

of years, from August 1890 to December 1896, or six years and five months.

The two sets of curves are therefore strictly comparable, being calculated

for the same time. The results are given in the four Tables, V., VI.,

VII., and VIII., at the end of this Report.

The hourly observations made by the Swedish expedition at Jan

JVIayen in 1882-83, particularly the hourly barometric obsei'vations in

clear and clouded weather respectively, together with the observations

made on the open sea of the Arctic Ocean by the same expedition. The

results, in clear and in clouded weather, are of the greatest possible interest
in their relation to similar inquiries made with the observations of the two

Ben Nevis Observatories, and of other observatories in different parts of

the world, and reported on by your Committee in their Annual Reports

for several years past.

" But an equally great interest attaches to the discussion of these

barometric observations made on the open sea of the Arctic regions in

1882-83, together with similar observations made by Professor Molin
in the Arctic Ocean in the summer months of 1876-77-78. From the

observations made on this ocean at a season when the sun is constantly
above the horizon, it is shown that there is only one daily maximum and

one minimum of pressure closely agreeing with the diurnal curve of
temperature. At the same season the small island of Jan Mayen presents
in its diurnal curves of pressure the usual double maxima and minima.

The same discussion opens up important inquiries as to the different

effects on the diurnal curves of pressure according as the terrestrial

radiation from the earth's surface towards space, proceeds from extended

fields of snow, bare rock or soil, grass, or sheets of water.

The hourly observations of the rainfall and snowfall at the two

·Observatories have been discussed, from which it is shown that the diurnal

curves have two maxima and two minima, and that the summer and

winter curves present striking differences.

The work of preparing maps, showing for each day the amount of the

rainfall at 120 stations well distributed over Scotland, is steadily progress-

ing. As the work proceeds it becomes more and more apparent that as

The experiments upon the electrical properties of solutions, in relation to

their thermal properties, towards the expenses of which a grant of 50?.
was made, are in progress. The apparatus for the measurement of the
resistance of solutions has been designed, constructed, and tested. It has
been proved to work satisfactorily by test experiments with pure water
and with solutions of potassium chloride.

     The cost of the apparatus, the essential parts of which had to be madfr
of platinum, has exceeded the amount of the grant.

     The expenses incidental to the completion of the experiments are
estimated by the Secretary at 35?., and the Committee desire that that,
sum be placed at their disposal in the ensuing year.

(f) The Theory of the Migration of Ions and of Specific Ionic Velocities^..

                       By W, C. Dampier Whetham, M.A.

     The liberation of the products of electrolysis at the electrodes, and at
the electrodes only, shows that a continuous passage of the opposite ions in
opposite directions through the liquid must be going on. Whether the
ions are free from each other during their passage, or accomplish their
journey by means of continual decomposition and recombination of mole-
cules, does not matter for our present purpose. The numbers of the ions
in the middle portion of the liquid do not change, but, while the current
passes, a constant excess of anions is delivered at the anode, and of

kations at the kathode.

     If the opposite ions move with equal velocities, the result of the

passage of the current will be that, while the composition of the middle
portion of the solution remains unaltered, the products of the decomposi-
tion, which appear at the electrodes, are taken in equal proportions from
the solution surrounding the anode, and from that round the kathode.

      If, however, one of the ions travels faster than the other, it will get

away from the portion of the solution whence it comes more quickly than
the other ion enters. The concentration of this region will therefore fall
faster than that of the liquid round the other electrode, and the ratio

                                                                                           Q2

 between the rates at which salt is taken from the neighbourhoods of the
 anode and kathode gives also the ratio between the velocities of the
 kation and anion.

      Thus, by measuring the contents of vessels containing the electrodes

 before and after the passage of the current, we can determine the ratio
 between the velocities of the two ions in any given case of electrolysis.
 Many such investigations have been made by Hittorf,' Lenz,^ Loeb and

Nemst,^ and Kistiakowsky.* An account of their methods and results

 will be found in Professor Ostwald's ' Lehrbuch der AUgemeinen Chemie,'
 2nd edition, vol. ii., p. 598, and most of the numerical results obtained
 are included in a table compiled by T. C. Fitzpatrick and published in the
 previous portion of this report, which appeared in 1893.

    A further step was taken by Professor F. Kohlrausch in the year 1879.^

 Kohlrausch introduced a satisfactory method of measuring the conduc-
 tivity of electrolytes by means of alternating currents, and showed that,
from a knowledge of the conductivity, the sum of the opposite ionic
 velocities (i.e. the velocity with which the opposite streams of ions travel

 past each other) could be calculated.
      Faraday's work showed that the passage of a definite quantity of elec-

tricity through the solution involves the decomposition of a definite mass
of electrolyte, which varies as its chemically equivalent weight and as
the quantity of electricity. Thus the quantity of electricity which must
pass in order to decompose the equivalent weight of an electrolyte in
grams is independent of the nature of the electrolyte.

    We may therefore represent the facts by considering the process of

electrolysis to be a kind of convection, the ions moving through the

solution and carrying their charges with them. Each univalent ion may
be supposed to carry a certain definite charge, which we may take to be

the true natural unit of electricity ; each divalent ion carries twice as
much, and so on.

      Let us take, as an example, the case of an aqueous solution of hydro-

wchloric acid whose concentration is gram-equivalents per cubic centi-

metre.

    mThere will then be gram-equivalents of hydrogen ions and the same

number of chlorine ions in this volume. Let us suppose that on each
gram-equivalent of hydrogen there reside -f q units of electricity, and on

each gram-equivalent of chlorine ions --q units. If u denote the average

velocity of the hydrogen ions, the positive charge carried per second across

munit area normal to the flow is q u. Similarly, if v be the average

velocity of the chlorine ions, the negative charge carried in the opposite

mdirection is q v. But positive electricity moving in one direction is

equivalent to negative electricity moving in the other, so that the total

+·*eurrent, C, is to 5- (u v).
    Now let us consider the amounts of hydrogen and chlorine liberated at

the electrodes by this current.^ At the kathode, if the chlorine ions were

at rest, the excess of hydrogen ions would be simply those arriving in one

msecond, viz.    u. But, since the chlorine ions move also, a further

mseparation occurs, and v hydrogen ions are left without partners. The

total number of gram -equivalents liberated is therefore m{u4-v). This

must, by Faraday's law, be equal to r]C, where rj denotes the electro-chemical

equivalent of hydrogen. Thus we get

                          mm{u + v)=rjC=ri q(u-\-v),

and it follows that the charge, q, on one gram-equivalent of each kind of

ion is equal to 1 /r].

   We know that Ohm's law holds good for electrolytes, so that the

current C is also given by k. dF/dx, where k denotes the conductivity of

the solution, and d'Pjdx the potential gradient, i.e. the fall in potential

per unit length along the lines of current flow.

       Thus               -(u + v)=k. dP/dx

expressed in terms of the number, «, of gram-equivalents per litre instead

of per cubic centimetre.

    When the potential gradient is one volt (10* C.G.S. units) per centi-

metre, this becomes

                                                        n

Thus, by measuring in C.G.S. units the conductivity of a solution of known

concentration, the relative velocity of its ions can a1» once be deduced. It

is true that, in this investigation, we have assumed that all the contents

--of the solution are actively concerned in the electrolysis an idea which

seems to be disproved by the diminution in the molecular conductivity
with increasing concentration. But although, at any instant, only a part

of the electrolyte is active, we must imagine that each portion will become

active in turn, two given ions of opposite kinds being sometimes free
{i.e. active) and sometimes paired (i.e. inactive). The immediate effect,
therefore, of the decrease in ionisation, with increasing concentration, is
to diminish the relative velocity of the ions, and this diminution will
reduce the molecular conductivity in accordance with the equation.

     Since Hittorf's numbers give us the ratio of the ionic velocities, we
can deduce the absolute values of u and v from this theory. Thus, for

instance, the molecular conductivity of a solution of potassium chloride
containing one-tenth of a gram-equivalent per litre is 1113 x lO"'"* C.G.S.

hydrogen ion through a jelly solution under a known potential gradient
could be observed. The results of three experiments gave 0-0029, 0'0026,
and 0*0024 cm. per sec. as the velocity of the hydrogen ion for a poten-
tial gradient of one volt per centimetre. Kohlrausch's number is 0*0032
for the dilution corresponding to maximum conductivity. Lodge does
not mentioQ the concentration of his solution, but it was probably large

enough to appreciably reduce the velocity.

    When the current density at the kathode of a solution of copper sul-

phate exceeds a certain limit, the copper is deposited as a brown or black

hydride. C. L. "Weber ' explained this as due to the inability of the copper
ions to migrate fast enough to keep up the supply for carrying the
current, part of which will consequently be conveyed by sulphuric acid

formed by the action of SO4 ions on the water. By measuring the limiting

current density and the conductivity of the solution, he estimated the
speed of the copper ions when they could travel just fast enough to carry
all the current, and hence he deduced their specific velocity. Similar
methods were used for solutions of cadmium sulphate and zinc nitrate.
The copper sulphate measurements were repeated with an improved appa-

ratus by Sheldon and Downing.^ This method does not appear to be a
very good one, for the dilution of the liquid round the kathode makes

it impossible to accurately determine the conductivity of the solution

concerned. This source of error will make the deduced velocities too

great.

     Direct determinations of the velocities of a few other ions have been

made in another way by the present writer.^ Two solutions, having one

ion in common, of equivalent concentrations, different densities, different
colours, and nearly equal specific resistances, were placed one over the other

in a vertical glass tube. In one case, for example, decinormal solutions of
potassium carbonate and potassium bichromate were used. The colour of

the latter is due to the presence of the bichromate group, CrjOy. When a

current was passed across the junction, the anions CI and Cr207 travelled
in the direction opposite to that of the current, and their velocity could
be determined by measuring the rate at which the colour boundary moved.
Similar experiments were made with alcoholic solutions of cobalt salts, in
which the velocities of the ions were found to be much less than in water.
The behaviour of agar jelly was then investigated, and the velocity of an ion
was shown to be very little less through a solid jelly than in an ordinary
liquid solution. The velocities could therefore be measured by tracing

the change in colour of an indicator or the formation of a precipitate.
Thus decinormal jelly solutions of barium chloride and sodium chloride,

the latter containing a trace of sodium sulphate, were placed in contact.

Under the influence of an electromotive force, the barium ions moved up
the tube, and their presence was shown by the trace of insoluble barium

sulphate formed.

The following table shows the velocities of all ions which have been

Aexperimentally determined.  comparison is given with their values as

calculated, for the same concentration, on Kohlrausch's theory.

     The coefficient a is thus given by the ratio between the actual mole-
cular conductivity of the solution and its value at infinite dilution, and

can therefore be readily determined.

     The velocities of the ions may be reduced by an increase in frictional

resistance, by a diminution in the fraction of the dissolved substance
which is, at any moment, active, or by a combination of both these causes.
In dilute solutions the resistance offered by the liquid to the passage of
the ions through it is probably sensibly the same as in pure water ; but

when the proportion of non-ionised molecules becomes considerable, we

cannot assume that this is the case. Arrhenius' experiments on the con-
ductivity of jelly solutions,' while they certainly show that the ionic
friction does not depend on the molar viscosity of the medium, do not prove,
as usually seems to be assumed, that it is not affected by the addition of
more of the electrolyte, which would cause a molecular change.

     While the solution is dilute enough for the friction to be taken as

constant, however, the coefficient n can be given a very simple physical

meaning. The fraction which expresses the ratio of the actual to the
limiting velocity of the ions must then also express the fraction of
its time during which, on the average, any ion remains active ; that is, it
must express the fractional number of molecules which are, at any

moment, in a state of activity. This fractional number may be called the

coefficient of ionisation.

     Thus, although we can, if we like, always put Kohlrausch's theory iri
the form shown in our last equation, the constant « will only have a
definite physical meaning when the solution is so dilute that the ionic

viscosity keeps constant. This caution is necessary, for it seems to be
universally assumed that o, as deduced from the ratio of the actual to

the limiting conductivity, always expresses the ionisation of the solution,

whatever its concentration may be, although for fairly strong solutions no

convincing evidence has been adduced in favour of the assumption made.
It is possible that some of the discrepancies between the ionisation as

--found from the conductivity and as deduced in other ways as, for example,
--from the depression of the freezing point may be due to this cause.

     On the other hand, the equation given on p. 229, in which u and v

denote the actual velocities of the ions under the conditions of the experi-
ment, probably holds good whatever be the concentration of the solution,
and this gives the simplest and most certain form of Kohlrausch's theory.

     The fact that the molecular conductivity of aqueous solutions becomes,
in general, constant as the dilution gets very great shows that the veloci-
ties of the ions must then become independent of the concentration of the
solution. This seems to offer strong evidence in favour of the view that
the ions are free from each other, which is also indicated by the fact that
the specific velocity of an ion at great dilution comes out the same
whatever be the nature of the other ion present.

      If the ions are not free, the alternative is to suppose that they move-
forward by taking advantage of a collision between two solute molecules by-

means of which an interchange of ions may occur, and each makes a step

in advance. Now the frequency with which such collisions would happen,

must vary as the square of the concentration ; and, since the quantity of
electricity conveyed must also depend on the number of ions present, the
conductivity would vary as the cube of the concentration. The motion of
the ions cannot, therefore, depend on collisions between the molecules o£

234 REPORT--1897.

dissolved matter. It must be an independent motion, and the ions must

be dissociated from each other. It will be noticed that there is nothing

to show that the ions are not combined with solvent molecules, and there

seems reason to suppose that such may be the case.

   We may conclude, from the experimental confirmation described

above, that the velocity of an ion, as calculated by Kohlrausch's theory

from the conductivity, really does represent the actual speed with which,

Weon the average, the ion makes its way through the solution.                       can

therefore apply the theory with confidence to cases in which the experi-

mental confirmation would be difficult or impossible.

If we know the specific velocity of any one ion, we can, from the con-

ductivity of very dilute solutions, at once deduce the velocity of any other

ion with which it may be combined, without having to determine the

migration constant of the compound, which is a matter involving consider-

able trouble. Thus, taking the specific ionic velocity of hydrogen as

0'0032 cm. per second, we can, by determining the conductivity of dilute

solutions of any acid, at once find the specific velocity of the acid radicle

involved. Or, again, since we know the specific velocity of the silver ion,

we can find the velocities of a series of acid radicles at great dilution by

measuring the conductivity of their silver salts.

By such methods Ostwald, Bredig, and other observers have found the

specific velocities of many ions both of inorganic and organic compounds,

Aand examined the relation between constitution and ionic velocity.

full account of such data will be found in a paper by Bredig in vol. xiii. of

the ' Zeitschrift fiir physikalische Chemie,' p. 191. The velocities are

calculated from the conductivities measured in terms of mercury units,

and so must be multiplied by 110 x 10~' if they are wanted in centimetres

per second.

The velocity of elementary ions is found to be a periodic function of the

atomic weight, similar elements lying on similar portions of the curve.

The curve much resembles that giving the relation between atomic weight

and viscosity in solution. For complex ions the velocity is largely an

additive property ; to a continuous additive change in the composition of

the ion corresponds a continuous but decreasing change in the velocity.

Thus Ostwald's results for the anions of the formic acid series give

Bredig finds similar relations for every such series of compounds which

he examined. Isomeric ions of analogous constitution have equal

Avelocities.  retarding effect is, in general, produced by the replacement
Hof by CI, Br, I, Me, NH2 or NO2 : of any element by an analogous one

of higher atomic weight (except O and S) ; of NH3 by H2O ; of (CN)6 by

(0204)3 ; by the change of amines into acids ; of sulphonic acids into

carboxylic acids ; acids into cyanamides, dicarboxylic into monocarboxylic

acids ; and by monamines into diamines. The additive effect is, however,

largely influenced by constitution. Thus in metamerides the velocity

increases with the symmetry of the ion, especially as the number of

C-- N unions gets greater.

due to Nernst' and Planck - enables us to calculate the diffusion constant

of dissolved electrolytes. According to the molecular theory, diffusion is
due to the motion of the molecules of the dissolved substance through the

liquid. When the dissolved molecules are uniformly distributed, the

osmotic pressure will be the same everywhere throughout the solution,
but if the concentration varies from point to point, the pressure will vary

also. There must, then, be a relation between the rate of change of the

concentration and the osmotic pressure gradient, and thus we may consider

the osmotic pressure gradient to be analogous to a force driving a body

through a viscous medium.

In the cases of non-electrolytes and of all non-ionised molecules this

analogy completely represents the facts, and the phenomena of diffusion

can be deduced from it alone. But the ions of an electrolytic solution can

move independently through the liquid, even when no current flows, as the

truth of Ohm's law for electrolytes indicates. They will therefore diffuse

independently, and the faster ion will travel quicker into pure water in

contact with a solution. The ions carry their charges with them, and, as a

matter of fact, it is found that, in general, water in contact with a solu-

tion takes with respect to it a positive or negative potential, according

as the positive or negative ion travels the faster.

This process will go on until the simultaneous separation of electric

charges produces an electrostatic force strong enough to prevent further

Weseparation of ions.  can therefore calculate the rate at which the

salt as a whole wiU diffuse by examining the conditions for a steady state,

in which the ions diffuse at an equal rate, the faster one being restrained

and the slower one urged forward by the electric forces.

Let us imagine that we have an aqueous solution of some electrolyte

at the bottom of a tall glass cylinder with pure water lying above it. In a
layer of liquid at a height x let the concentration {i.e. the number of

gram-molecules per cubic centimetre) be c, and the osmotic pressure p.

At a +height x dx these become c--dc and p--dj) respectively. The

volume of the layer cut off by horizontal planes at these heights is qdx,

where q is the area of cross-section, and this volume contains cqdx
gram -molecules of electrolyte. The difference of osmotic pressure between

the planes is dp, so that, on our analogy, we must imagine that the

force acting on the layer is --qdp (the negative sign being taken

because the force is in the direction in which x> decreases) and the

--force on one gram-molecule is   Now1-. from the velocities of the
                                  c dx

two ions under unit potential gradient, as found by Kohlrausch's theory,

it is easy to deduce the velocity with which they will travel when unit

U Vforce acts on them. Let us call these velocities and for the kation

and anion respectively. The actual velocities in our case will therefore

     Under the influence of both the osmotic and the electric forces the
number of gram-equivalents which diffuse in a given time must be equal,

so that we get

For dilute solutions we may assume that the gaseous laws hold good, so

that

                                                jp=cRT,

c, the concentration, being the reciprocal of the volume in which one
gram-molecule is dissolved.

   We shall need the intermediate steps of this investigation when we

consider Nernst's account of contact diflerences of potential ; but it has

been pointed out to the writer by Professor Fitzgerald that, when the
electrostatic forces make the opposite ions diffuse at equal rates, this last

equation merely expresses the fact that the resistance offered by the liquid
to the passage of an electrolyte is the sum of the resistances offered to the
passage of its ions--a result which we should naturally have expected from

the general properties of electrolytic solutions.

     Thus, on the osmotic pressure analogy, the force acting on one gram-

molecule of hydrochloric acid is                      c d/x ; so that, if we call k the resistance

offered when the velocity is unity, the average velocity will be             ^

                                                                         ck dx*

and the number of gram-molecules crossing a section of the cylinder in one

second will be

                dN=-14P.cqdt=.-lqf-dL
                                            ck dx             k dx

Now the osmotic pressure of an electrolyte with two ions is double the

normal value, so that

                                            ^=2cIlT,

and we get

    The resistances to hydrogen and chlorine moving with unit velocity are

1/U and 1/V respectively, so that the resistance to hydrochloric acid is

and we get the same equation as Nernst

                                  ^ dx

    From the general theory of diffusion we may take the quantity of sub-

stance diffusing through unit area in one second to be proportional to the
gradient of concentration, so that the quantity crossing an area 5' in a time

dt is

       m= -V)q dfx- dt

Dwhere is a constant.

    By comparing this with our last equation, we see that, for electrolytes,

the diffusion constant is given by the expression

                        D=  2UV         RT.

                            U+V

T Ris the absolute temperature, the gas constant corresponding to one

gram-equivalent of substance (viz. 1-974 calories per degree or 8-29 x 10'^
Uergs per degree), so that it only remains to calculate
                                                          and V, the

velocities with which the ions move under the action of unit force.

   We have already seen that the charge of electricity carried by one

gram-equivalent of a kation is +I/17, and the charge on one gram-

--equivalent of an anion is 1 /ri, where r) represents the electro-chemical

equivalent of hydrogen. The quantity of electricity associated with one

gram-equivalent of any ion is therefore 1/ -00010352 =9653 electro-

magnetic units. If the potential gradient is one volt (10® C.G.S. units)

per centimetre, the force acting on this gram-equivalent will be 9,653 x 10®

dynes. This, in dilute solution, gives the ion its specific velocity, say u.

Thus the force required to give the ion unit velocity is

     If the ion have an equivalent weight A, the force producing unit

                                                                                               10^

velocity when acting on one gram is P,=9-84x-j-- kilograms weight.

Thus, in order to drive one gram of potassium ions <vith a velocity of one
centimetre per second through a very dilute water solution, we must exert
a force equal to the weight of 38,000,000 kilograms. The table gives

other examples.'
--238 EEPORT 1897.

Since the ions move with uniform velocity, the frictional forces

brought into play must be equal and opposite to the driving forces acting,

and therefore these numbers also represent the ionic friction coeflScients

in very dilute solution at 18° C.

WeLet us now return to the consideration of the velocity.  have seen

that the force acting on one gram-equivalent of an ion, when the poten-

tial gradient is one volt per centimetre, is 9,653 x 10* dynes, and that, in

dilute solution, this gives to the ion its specific velocity u. The velocity

it would attain under unit force will therefore be

U = u xlO ^cms. per second.
        9653

In the case of hydrochloric acid, for example, the specific velocity of the
hydrogen is 00032, and that of the chlorine 0'00069 cm. per second.

    By experiments on diffusion this constant T> can be found experi-

mentally,' and the agreement between theory and Scheffer's observations
is shown by the table.

negative potential with regard to the solution, according as the kation or
the anion has the greater specific velocity and, therefore, the greater initial
rate of diflfusion. This idea can be developed to explain the difference of
potential at the surface of contact of two solutions or of a solution and a
metal.

     Taking the equation which expresses the relation that, when a steady

state is reached, the ions migrate at equal rates, viz.

        \ax ax J                       \dx  ax J

which gives on integration

    If we have absolutely pure water in contact with a solution, py is zero,,
and the difference of potential apparently becomes infinite. Absolutely

pure water cannot be obtained, and the table of Nernst's experimental

results, given on p. 242, shows too small a range of concentrations to fairly

test this equation. Nevertheless, cases will be described later in which

high potential-differences were observed when the concentration of the

ions on one side was made very small.

When the solutions of two different electrolytes are placed in contact,

similar things occur. Thus (Nernst) let us suppose that we have a

solution of hydrochloric acid in contact with one of lithium bromide. On

the one hand more hydrogen ions than chlorine ions will diffuse from the

acid solution into the other, and therefore the salt solution will receive a

positive charge. On the other hand, more bromine ions than lithium ions

will diffuse from the salt solution into the acid, and thus the potential

difference will be increased.

When a metal dissolves in a solution, Nernst traces an analogy with

Hethe evaporation of a liquid.     ascribes to each metal a ' solution -pres-

sure ' with regard to water, depending only on the temperature, which

tends to drive the metal into solution in the form of positively charged

ions. But this process will electrify the solution positively, and leave

the metal negatively charged. Electric forces will therefore be set up,

which oppose the further solution of the metal, and seek to drive back

to it the ions already in solution. The electrostatic capacities of the ions

are very great, and hence equilibrium may be reached long before a weigh-

able quantity has been dissolved.

As the quantity of ions in solution increases, we may get equilibrium

set up, the solution pressure being balanced by the osmotic pressure of

the dissolved ions and the electrostatic forces of their charges. This

happens, for example, when silver is dipped into a solution of sodium

chloride. If, however, the solution pressure is very great, the electric

forces may reach such an amount that positive ions must be driven out of

the solution. Such cases occur when hydrogen is evolved from acids or
--240 REPORT 1897.

one metal precipitated from its solution by another. In each case an
electrically equivalent amount of the metal is dissolved.

    When hydrogen is evolved, it is first dissolved by the metal, from

which it separates in an electrically neutral form as soon as its concentra-
tion is high enough to give it a vapour pressure exceeding one atmosphere.
The process can be arrested by the application of an atmospheric pressure
sufficiently great, and this gives a measure of the solution pressure of the
metal used. Experiments are difficult, but Beketoff ' and Brunner - have
shown that hydrogen at a high pressure can precipitate silver, platinum,
and palladium ; Cailletet ^ arrested its evolution from zinc and sulphuric

acid, while Nernst and Tammann * have examined the action of other

metals.

     The electromotive force developed at the contact of a metal and a
solution of one of its salts has been deduced by Nernst by considering the
work done when one unit of electricity passes,^ but it seems that the same
result can be obtained from the equation giving the potential difference
between the solutions of an electrolyte of different concentration, which

we have already developed in the form

                                               O, since no negative ions

enter or leave the metal, and the equation becomes

where  f.^  denotes something corresponding to the osmotic pressure of

pressure P. Thus, neglecting the negative sign, we get

p denoting the osmotic pressure of the ions of the metal in the solution.

     In a simple galvanic cell of any ordinary form there are two metals,
say zinc and copper, in contact with the same solution of electrolyte. The

equation then becomes

            = RT -E (log, ?.'  log, ??)

where P, and^, refer to the zinc, and Pj and p^, to the copper. In two-

fluid cells, such as the Daniell, since the electromotive forces at the

electrodes are much greater than at the contact of the liquids, the same
equation may still be applied.

     Galvanic cells can be constructed with two electrodes of the same metal
placed in solutions of different substances, or even of the same substance
at different concentrations. In this case, since the unknown solution

pressure of the metal is the same at the opposite electrodes, we can calcu-

late the total electromotive force of the cell.

tion of potassium chloride is very small to begin with, and is still further
reduced because the solubility of the silver chloride is lowered by the
presence of chlorine ions. The pressure can be calculated, and an appli-

cation of Nernst's formula leads to a theoretical value for the electro-

--motive force of 0'52 volt a remarkable agreement with the observed

value.

     The number of silver ions can also be reduced by adding some sub-
stance which, by combining with them, removes them from solution.
This is shown by the fact that cells Nos. 2, 4, and 6 in the above list have,

like the others, high electromotive forces.

    Other metals have been used as electrodes by Zengelis,** who showed
that, in many cases, the electromotive forces of cells whose electrodes

were copper, lead, nickel, or cobalt were greater the more the concentra-
tion of the ions round one electrode was depressed by the addition of a

salt.

     Hittorf "· has even shown that the effect of a cyanide round a copper
electrode is so great that copper becomes electropositive towards zinc.

furnishes a current which carries copper into solution and deposits zinc.
In a similar way, silver could be made positive towards cadmium.

     If we know the concentration of the ions round one electrode, it is
possible to calculate them round the other from observations on the

electromotive force, and this has been done by Behrend.'

vanic polarisation. He finds that, at the decomposition point in a

solution from which a metal is deposited at the kathode, the electro-

motive force of polarisation at this electrode is equal to the electrolytic
solution pressure of the metal in the solution, and is independent of the

nature of the electrode, provided it is not attacked. The numerous

apparent exceptions to this rule are referred to secondary effects, such as
the development of gases at the electrodes, which cause the electromotive
force necessary for their liberation to depend on the nature and condition

of the electrode. This, for example, makes the decomposition limit of
water rise to about 1-6 volt ; but when these effects are eliminated, it is

found that the true value comes out as 1"03 volt. Now 1"03 volt is the

maximum electromotive force of the oxy-hydrogen gas battery ; and thus

the decomposition of water is a reversible process at 1*03 volt.

     Freudenberg ' has applied the theory to the electrolytic separation of
metals, and finds that metals are separated from a solution, through which
a constantly increasing current flows, in the revei'se order of their ' decom-
position pressures.' They can often be thus separated for quantitative
chemical analysis. The influence of the solvent on the solution pressure

of metals has been investigated by H. C. Jones,^ who examined cells

whose electrodes were silver in solutions of silver nitrate of equal strength,

the solvent round one electrode being water, and round the other ethyl
alcohol, methyl alcohol, or acetone. In all cases the water solution was
negative to the other. The ionisation of the salt in ethyl alchohol being
known, the ratio of the solution pressures can, in this case, be calculated,
and comes out 0'024.

    Much discussion has taken place about the exact significance of the

--' solution pressure ' of a metal the property represented by P in Nernst's

equations. Following Nernst, Ostwald considers that P is a function

of the metal and temperature only, and consequently independent of the
nature of the negative iron. Measurements of the potential differences

at single reversible junctions i.e. when the kation is of the same metal as

--th§ electrode have been made by Le Blanc ^ and Neumann.'' The latter

measured the electromotive forces of cells made up with the junction in
question at one electrode, and mercury in a normal potassium chloride
solution with an excess of calomel at the other. The normal mercury
calomel electrode has a potential difference of 0"560 volt, and thus the

value of the other contact could be found, the potential difference between

the liquids being assumed to be small. Neumann found that at great

dilution the potential difference was in general independent of the anion

solutions not of their own salts, which there is reason to suppose form

limiting cases of the reversible electrodes and are subject to the same laws,
have found that the potential difference does, when the metal is copper,

platinum or mercury, depend on the anion. Many experiments on cells
containing non-reversible electrodes have been made to determine the
influence of the nature of the ions and of concentration. Among these
experiments we may mention those of Paschen,* Ostwald,*^ Oberbeck and

Edler,^ Bancroft,^ and A. E. Taylor.^ Taylor finds reason to suggest that

the difierences found by some of the observers on changing the anion

may be due to large potential differences at the surface of contact of the

Hetwo liquids in the cells.  finds that such differences arise in cases

where there is a tendency to form complex salts. Moreover, it has been

found by Gouy,* Rothmund/ and Luggin'' that the maximum surface

tension of mercury is not the same in all solutions, as Lippmann's law-

supposes, but varies in cases where complex salts might be formed. Now

the values taken for the potential difference at a contact between mercury

and solution depend on this result, and so an error is introduced into

many of the observations which depend on the subtraction of this

potential difference from the total electromotive force of a cell. Such con-

siderations may possibly explain exceptions to the rule that the potential

difference between a metal and an electrolyte is independent of the nature

of the anion. More experiments on the subject, particularly with rever-

sible electrodes, would be of great value.

In a general review of the results of this theory of the migration of

the ions, the agreement between calculation and observation is most re-

markable. The experimental measurements of the absolute velocities of

various ions, which have been described, fully confirm the general truth

of the theory, and leave no doubt that the values calculated from the con-

ductivities and migration constants give the real average speeds Avith

which the ions travel.

The ability of Kohlrausch's theory to represent the facts being thus

established, it must follow that, in dilute solutions, the motion of one ion

is independent of the nature of the other ion present. This suggests that

the ions are free from each other for, at any rate, the greater part of their

time, and this idea is, as we have seen, confirmed by the fact that the con-

ductivity of a dilute solution is proportional to the concentration, whereas,

if the ion were free only at the instants of collision between dissolved

molecules, it would vary as some higher power of the concentration.

Further evidence, pointing in the same direction, is furnished by the

general success of Nernst and Planck's theory of the diffusion of electro-

lytes, and of the contact difference of potential between solutions. The

numerical deductions from this theory, which agree in general with the

results of experiment, involve (i.) the specific ionic velocities, as determined

by Kohlrausch, and (ii.) the freedom of the opposite ions to migrate inde-

pendently of each other until the electrostatic forces prevent further

separation. Thus we seem obliged to accept the idea, originally suggested

and strongly supported by other phenomena outside the scope of this

section of the Report, that the ions not only enjoy perfect freedom of

interchange, as Ohm's law demands, but are actually dissociated from

each other for, at any rate, the greater part of their existence. It must

be particularly noticed that this freedom from each other does not at all

prevent the ions from forming chemical combinations with the solvent

molecules. Neither does it throw any light on the fundamental nature
of solution. It has been very generally assumed that the dissociation
theory of electrolytes was necessarily bound up with a view of solution
which considers the dissolved matter to be in a state dynamically similar
to that of a gas, and to produce osmotic pressure by the impacts of its
molecules, just as a gas produces pressure on the walls of its containing

vessel.

    Now Poynting ' has shown that the phenomena of osmotic pressure

can, on certain not improbable assumptions, be completely represented by
the hypothesis that chemical union occurs between the solvent and the
dissolved matter. In the present state of our knowledge the dissociation
ttheory of electrolytes seems perfectly compatible with such an explanation.'^
All that follows from the facts is the essential freedom of the ions from
each other. "Whatever be the cause of osmotic pressure, it certainly de-
pends, to a first approximation, at all events, on the number of dissolved
anolecules, and not on their nature, and thus, whether it be due to impact
or to chemical union, it will have an abnormally great value when, as in
the case of electrolytes, the number of effective molecules is increased by

·dissociation.

      Again, the theory does not forbid the assumption that complex mole-

ocular aggregates, formed of two or more solute molecules, may exist,

especially in concentrated solutions, as well as dissociated ions. Such
molecules would be electrolytically inactive, unless an odd ion was linked,
to them. They would also, as has been suggested by Wildermann and
others, explain a lowering of the freezing point less than that calculated

ii'om the conductivity.

     It has been found that the specific resistance of many liquids, including
water (i.e. a dilute solution of electrolytes), increases when the electrodes

are brought within a certain critical distance of each other.^ Similar

phenomena have been observed in the case of gases, through which an
electric discharge was passing, by Lord Kelvin, Bailie, and Peace,^ and
this has been explained by J. J. Thomson on the hypothesis that a com-
 plete chain-like structure is necessary for electrolytic conduction, which
 cannot occur unless there is room for such a chain to form. It is possible
that the same explanation may hold good for liquids, the necessary
electrolytic unit being a complex structure formed of a dissociated ion
and several solvent molecules. From what has been said, it will be seen

that there is nothing inconsistent with this idea in the dissociation

theory.

     To sum up the results of this section, we may say that, whatever may

 be the ultimate nature of solution, it seems certain that the electrolytic
ions migrate in accordance with Kohlrausch's theory, and, in a homo-
 geneous solution, are free to travel independently of each other through
the liquid.

The Historical Developme^it of Ahelian Functions up to tJie time of

                   Riemann. By Harris Hancock,

[Ordered by the General Committee to be printed in externa among the Reports]

(1) In 1846, R. Leslie Ellis ' presented to the British Association a
* Report on the Recent Progress of Analysis (Theory of the Comparison of
Transcendents).' At the beginning of this memoir he says : 'The province

of analysis, to which the theory of elliptic functions belongs, has within the

last twenty years assumed a new aspect ; in no subject, I think, has our

knowledge advanced so far beyond the limits to which it was not long

since confined.' ' This circumstance,' he continues, ' would give a particular

interest to a history of the recent progress of the subject, even did it now

appear to have reached its full development. But on the contrary, there

is now more hope of further progress than at the commencement of the

period of which I have been speaking.'

These statements appear more emphatic when we consider that after

the lapse of fifty years, since the publication of Ellis's report to the present

time, the same remarks are literally true, and when at the end of this
period we find that there is more hope for the future progress of analysis,

the theory of functions, than there has ever been before.

So great has been the growth of this science, extending on the one hand,

and with a broadening influence, far into the realms of almost every

branch of mathematical study, and on the other hand so comprehensive

and varied in character is its application to physical problems, that the

development of Ellis's work must be divided into many parts.

(2) The present report which the author has the honour of submitting

to the Association is intended as a brief account of that part of the work

already begun by Ellis which treats of the developments of the Abelian

(including the hyperelliptic) functions. It is also found that the develop-

ment of these functions has been so rapid and so extended that an ade-

quate account of it would require much more space than can be given here.

The author has consequently decided to make this statement for the period

up to the time of Riemann. With Riemann, Weierstrass, Clebsch and

Gordan, Cayley and others, the subjecttakesdirections so essentially different

that separate accounts along these different lines seem very desirable.

consideration ; other sources of information will be cited in their proper

places.

   A(3) good account (especially from the German standpoint) is given

of the early development of the theory of functions by Brill and Nother
(loc. cit.). I shall here consider very briefly only such parts of the theory
of elliptic functions that have a direct bearing upon this report, omitting
as far as possible what has already been given by Ellis.

     (4) The contributions towards the advancement of the elliptic
functions by Tschirnhaus (1683-1700), the Bernoullis (1690-1730),
Fagnano ('Produzioni Matematiche,' Pesaro, 1750) are discussed by
Enneper (' EUiptische Functionen ').

    Two works which must have exercised great influence upon subsequent
writers are Maclaurin, 'A Treatise on Fluxions,' Edinb. 1742, and

d'Alembert, ' Recherches sur le calcul integral ' (' Histoire de I'Acad. de
Berlin,' 1746, pp. 182-224).

     (5) Euler extended and systematised the work that Fagnano had

--begun. It was known that the expressions for sin (a+/?), sin (a ^), etc.,

gave a means of adding or subtracting the arcs of circles, and that between
the limits of two integrals that express lengths of arc of a lemniscate an

algebraical relation exists, so that the arc of a lemniscate, although a

transcendent of higher order, may be doubled or halved just as the arc of

a circle by means of geometric construction.
     It was natural to inquire if the ellipse, hyperbola, etc., did not have

similar properties ; investigating such questions, Euler made the remark-

able discovery of the addition-theorem of elliptic integrals {cf, ' Nov.
Comm.' Petrop. vi. pp. 58-84, 1761 ; vii. p. 3 ; vii. p. 83).

     Euler showed that if

·where <f>{i) is a rational integral function of the fourth degree in i, there

exists between the upper limits x, y, and a of the integrals an algebraic
relation which is the addition-theorem of the arcs of an ellipse and is the

algebraic solution of the differential equation ^

                                   ^^ + ^'^ =0

                           V^Wn/</'(^)

     Euler stated that the above results were obtained, not by any regular
method, but pothis tentando, vel divinando, and suggested that mathe-
maticians seek a direct proof. The numerous discoveries of Euler are

systematised in his work, ' Institutiones calculi integralis.'

     The fourth volume (p. 446) contains an extension of the addition-
theorem to integrals of the second and third kinds, as they were sub-
sequently classified and named by Legendre,

     In each case geometrical application of the formulae are made for the

comparison of elliptic arcs.

     (6) The addition-theorem for elliptic integrals gave a similar meaning in
higher analysis to the elliptic functions as the cyclometric and logarithmic
functions had had for a long time. See Enneper (' EUipt. Funct.,' p. 541
et seq.) regarding the position occupied by Euler in the development of
the elliptic functions, and for a statement regarding Legendre's work in

                                     ' Euler, Nov. Comm, vol. x. pp. 3-50.

this branch of mathematica confer Dirichlet's ' Gedachtnissrede auf Jacobi

(Jacobi's ' Werke,' vol. i. p. 9).

     (7) The suggestion made by Euler that one should find a direct method
of integrating the diflferential equation proposed by him (art. 5) was
carried out by Lagrange, who by direct methods integrated this equation,

and in a manner which elicited the great admiration of Euler. (See

' Miscell. Taurin.,' iv. 1768 ; or Serret's ' CEuvres de Lagrange,' vol. ii.

p. 533.)

     (8) The consideration of relations between integrals that have different
moduli gave rise to a theorem due to Landen (and proved somewhat

differently by Lagrange), in accordance with which an elliptic integral

may be transformed into another integral of the same kind by means of

algebraic transformations. Landen (' Phil. Trans.,' 1775, p. 285 ; or

'Mathematical Memoirs,' by John Landen, London, vol. i. 1780, p. 33)

proves that in general the hyperbola may be rectified by means of two

ellipses, with the addition of an algebraic quantity.'

The germ of the general theory of transformation is contained in this

theorem, as has been observed by Legendre.'-^

    By means of algebraic tranformations Landen was able to reduce

elliptic integrals of the first kind into forms that had the same modulus,

and showed that an elliptic integral of the first kind could be transformed

into an elliptic integral of the first kind with smaller modulus, or into an

integral of the first kind with smaller amplitude and greater modulus.

Lagrange^ showed that the integration of any irrational function

which contains the square root of a function <^ may be made to depend

                    P
--upon the integration of a function of the form                                (·«)  where  P

                                                                                 -^

and that if <^ is not higher than the fourth degree in x, the integration

may be reduced to that of

Ncfcc

                                                  V(l±;j2x2)(l-!-92a;2)'

N denoting a rational function in cc^, and ^; and q constants. If the

elliptic integral be reduced to this form, Lagrange showed by the intro-

duction of a new variable that this integral may be transformed into
another of similar form, but in which v and q become two new quantities
jp' and q' , and that if ^^ is greater than q, p' becomes greater than f and
^' less than q. By the repetition of this process the factor corresponding
to \A2_(fx^ maybe made as near unity as we desire, and consequently the
integral may be expressed by a circular arc or logarithm ; if, however,
the transformations are made in the other direction, the functions corre-
sponding to l+^j^a;^ and l+^'-a;- become as near equal as we wish, and

thus the elliptical integral reduces to a lower transcendent.''

      Legendre investigated the general integral given above,

and showed that it was always possible to reduce it to one or the other of

three forms essentially different.

   We may mention, in passing, as being among the early English con-

tributions to the subject memoirs by Brinkley ('Dublin Trans.' ix. p. 145,
A1803) and Wallace ('Edinb. Trans.' v. p. 253).
                                                            criticism of Talbot's

* Researches on the Integral Calculus '(' Phil. Trans.' 1836, p. 177, and

1838, p. 1) is given by Ellis, p. 41.

     (9) The theory of the elliptic functions, as Abel and Jacobi ^ found it

in 1827, offered many highly enigmatical phenomena, which could not be

explained by the principles that were at that time in vogue. For example,

the degree of the equation which is found by means of Euler's theorem,

and upon whose solution depends the division of the elliptic integral,

was not, as in the analogous question of the division of the circle, equal
to the number of the parts, but to the square of this number. It was easy
to see the meaning of the real roots, whose number agrees with the
number we have in the division of the circle ; however, the number of
imaginary roots must have seemed without explanation (Dirichlet,

* Gedachtnissrede,' p. 9).

   We shall next consider the inverse functions of the integrals which we

have been treating. With Jacobi ^ we begin with the simple algebraic

integral

          M= Pp  dx                    =sm. _i
                                                       ^x.

                Jon/1-c

In this expression we may either consider %<, as a function of the upper

limit X, or inversely, the upper limit a; as a function of u. In the first

case, when tt ^sin~^a;, it is not possible to express u in the form of a
power series which is convergent for every value of x ; and for a given
value of X, u is not determinate, but has an infinite number of values,
differing by multiples of 27r. But when we regard the upper limit a; as a
function of u, and write cc^sin u, then x may be expressed as a series
which is convergent for all values, real and imaginary, of u; and when u is
given a definite value, then x also has a definite value, and x considered

as a function of tt enjoys all the properties of a rational function.

     The next more general algebraic integral is the elliptic integral

          M= r   ^"^                   =T\{x).

    As above, tt=n(a;) cannot be expressed by a series that is always
-convergent ; and for a given value of x the variable u has not a definite

value, but a double infinity of values, differing by multiples of the periods
of elliptic functions (see next article).

     The innate property of this integral could not be recognised if we
considered the transcendent x alone ; but we have to regard the upper

   We consider as a function of m, and write 0:=amplitude of M^am(M),

so that x= sin am (M)=sn u.

    The function x^snu enjoys all the properties of a rational fractional

function, and, as is shown later in connection with the ^-function, the

numerator and denominator of this fraction may be developed in rapidly

convergent series for all real or imaginary values of m. Hence the elliptic

function x=snu has one, and only one, definite value, corresponding to a

given value of u.

  --(10) Periods of the inverse /unctions. Abel and Jacobi recognised

that the elliptic functions have at the same time the nature of circular

functions and of exponential functions in that they are periodic for both

real and imaginary values of the arguments. They saw that the function

x=snu, for example, remained unaltered when u is changed into m4-4K

Jacobi often repeated that the introduction of the imaginary was a

complete solution of all the enigmas that had previously beset this

subject.*

The introduction of the imaginary and the necessity of treating the

limit as a function of the integral were two great advances made by

Jacobi and Abel.

     (11) Abel's investigations took different directions from those of Jacobi.
Abel devoted himself to problems that have to do with the multiplication

and division of elliptic integrals, their double periodicity, and their defini-

tion by infinite products. By the help of the principle of double periodi-

city he penetrated deeply into the nature of the roots of the equation

upon which the division depends, and made the unexpected discovery that

the general division of the elliptic integral with arbitrary limit may be

performed algebraically (i.e. through the extraction of roots) as soon as

the special division of the so-called complete integrals is presupposed

performed.

The simplest case of this special division is for the modulus to which

the lemniscate corresponds ; and Abel shows that the division of the

entire lemniscate is completely analogous to that of the circle, and may

be performed by geometric construction in the same cases as the circle
admits. The solution of the circle had been solved some twenty-five years

before by Gauss. The admirers of Gauss with Dirichlet, from whom the

above extracts have been made (loc. cit. p. 11), contend, from certain
remarks (among others) made by Gauss in connection with the division of

the circle and the lemniscate, that the principle of double periodicity was
also known to Gauss. Some persons might, however, insist that Gauss
too was beset by some of the enigmas above referred to, and that it was
more likely that Gauss omitted to mention these dilemmas than to keep

silent about the remarkable doubly periodic property of the functions

that are connected with the lemniscate. In this connection Enneper

(· Elliptische Functionen,' p. 7) says that it is to be regretted that Gauss
did not communicate his remarkable discoveries to his contemporaries and

invite their co-operation.

           See Dirichlet, Qeddchtnissrede auf Jacobi (Jacobi's Werke, i. 10).
ON THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ABELIAN FUNCTIONS. 251

    Another important discovery is due to Abel's investigations : when

the multiplier became infinitely large in the formulse through which he
represented the elliptic functions of a multiple argument by means of

functions of the simple argument, he obtained remarkable expressions for

the elliptic functions in form of infinite series that are expressed as

quotients of infinite products.'

     Jacobi, contemporaneously with Abel, was occupied in another part of

Athe theory of elliptic functions, and with equally as great success.

fortunate induction of considering the transformation and the multiplica-

tion from a common point of view, and the last as a special case of the
first, led him to the conjecture that rational functions of any degree may

be used to transform an elliptic integral into an integral of the same form.
This conjecture was at once confirmed, since the number of constants,

which may be arbitrarily disposed of for any degree is sufiicient to satisfy
all conditions in order that the form of the transformed integral may

agree with the original {cf. Dirichlet, he. cit. p. 12).

    Jacobi also showed how the elliptic functions may be expressed in the
form of infinite products, which may be represented by trigonometric

series, and he further used the infinite series to express the square and
product of these functions. These results, with the general theory of
transformation, are systematised in the ' Fundamenta Nova,' Konigsberg,

1827; Jacobi's 'Werke,' bd. i. p. 49; further developments in this

Adirection are mentioned by Enneper ('EUip. Funct.' p. 74 et seq.).

Poisson (Crelle, bd. x. p. 342).         write, as above,

From these two examples it is seen that, although in general we cannot

vided the variables that occur in these integrals are connected by algebraic

relations.

be expressed by one such integral, where the upper limit of this integral
is a rational function of the upper limits of the other integrals. Similar
results are found for the elliptic integrals of the second and of the third
kinds. For those of the second kind there enters, in addition, an algebraic
function, and for those of the third kind a logarithmic algebraic function.

     Abel considered the integrals of any algebraic functions, and established
a theorem for the transcendents that arise from the integrals of these
functions, which has for them the same meaning as Euler's theorem has

for the elliptic transcendents.

     The question proposed by Abel is : Suppose X in formula (I.) above is

any algebraic function of x, then is it possible, taking different variables,
to establish algebraic (or logarithmic) relations between integrals of the
form

                                             F dx

when the variables are connected by requisite algebraic equations ; that is,
can algebraic (or logarithmic) relations be found among

                         U(xi), n(a;2), , . . n(a;,,),

when x^, X2, . . . x^ are connected by algebraic equations 1 If such is

Howthe case, the question next arises :  many algebraic equations are

necessary, and do these equations depend upon the nature of the

function X ?

Abel, in his celebrated paper, 'Memoire sur une Propri^t^ Gt^nt^rale d'une

Classe Tres-Etendue de Fonctions Transcendantes,' 'CEuvres Completes,'

t. i. p. 145 (Sylow and Lie), considered the question in a still more

general form, and found that all those functions whose derivatives may be

expressed through algebraic equations, in which the coefficients are

rational functions of one and the same variable possess properties that

are analogous to those of the elliptic functions stated above.

The results of these investigations are expressed in the following

theorem, known as Abel's theorem : If we have several /unctions whose
derivatives may he (expj'essed as) the roots of one and the same algebraic
equation, and all the coefficients in this algebraic equation are rational

/unctions of one and the same variable, then it is always possible to express

the sum, of any number of functions which are like the first functions by

ineans of an algebraic {and logarithmic) function, provided a certain

number of algebraic relations can be established between the variables of the

ficnction in question.^

The number of these relations does not depend upon the number of the

functions, but only upon the nature of the particular functions that ar©

considered.

The same theorem is still true when we suppose the functions multi-

plied by any rational number positive or negative.

We Wcmay therefore deduce the following theorem :          are always able

to express the sum of a given number of functions, wliich are multiplied

each by a rational number, and in which the variables are arbitrary, by a

similar sum of functions, Avhose number is determinate, and in which the

variables are algebraic functions of the given functions.

    As a further consequence is the theorem that the sum of any number
of integrals of the form considered may be expressed by the sum of a

definite number of such integrals with (perhaps) the addition of a deter-

minate algebraic (and logarithmic) expression, in which the variables are

algebraic functions of the variables of the first integrals.

   We therefore have the following result : Although in general we cannot

integrate an algebraic function by means of algebraic or logarithmic
functions, we may, however, obtain for the sum of a certain number of

such transcendental integrals an expression which is composed of algebraic

(and logarithmic) functions.

     Abel considered further the smallest number p of integrals through
which the sum of any number of other integrals may be expressed. This

is the well-known number which denotes the class (Classen- zahl) of the

connectivity of Riemann's surface xi^t 2/)> upon which y is an one- valued
=function of x, and Clebsch's deficiency of the algebraic cui've x(^"j y)
                                                                           0.

(See Cayley's ' Addition to Mr. Rowe's Memoir,' loc. cit. p. 752.)

Jacobi (' Werke,' bd. i. p. 379) writes : ' To this theorem we prefer to

give as the most beautiful monument of [Abel's] extraordinary intellect,

the name Abel's theorem, since it bears the entire stamp of his depth of
Wethought.
             consider it the greatest mathematical discovery of our time,

as it in a simple form, and without the apparatus of the calculus, gives

utterance to the deepest mathematical thought.'

    Legendre calls the theorem a monumentum cere perennius (letter to

Jacobi, Jacobi's ' Werke,' bd. i. p. 376).

     The theorem is contained in a paper written in the year 1825, but not

published until after Abel's death : ' Sur la comparaison des fonctions tran-
scendantes ' (' CEuvres,' t. ii. p. 55). The theorem so stated in this paper is :

The sum of any number of functions which have an. algebraic differential
may be expressed through a definite number of such functions. It is de-
veloped in the large memoir above mentioned, ' Memoire sur une propridte,
etc.,' which was presented to the French Academy, October 1826, and not

published until 1841 in the 'Memoires des Savants Etrangers,' t. vii.

     Legendre in the third supplement of the ' Traits des fonctions ellip-

tiques,' p. 191, gives to the transcendent

and e(x, y) = 0, this one-valued function being by Abel's theorem an algebraic (and

logarithmic) function.

    The =points {Xi,yi') (i 1, 2, . . . ?^) are not independent of each other, but as
soon as a certain number of them is given, the remaining jy (say) are of themselves
determined, being the roots of an algebraic equation of the ^th degree, whose

coefficients are rational functions of those points that are given, so that between

these coefficients there exist p algebraic relations.

Xsixth degree in x, it is said to be of the first order ; ^ when                      is of the

seventh or eight degree in x, of the second order, etc. In each order three

different kinds of integrals are to be distinguished, which are entirely

analogous to those ' which the nature of things has introduced into the

theory of elliptic functions.'

Jacobi (' Werke,' bd. i. 1832, p. 376) wished to call these the Abelian

transcendents, on account of the following works of Abel that had at that

time appeared :

' Remarques sur quelques propri^t^s g^nerales d'une certaine sorte de

fonctions transcendantes ' (Crelle, bd. iii. 1828, p. 313).

' Demonstration d'une propriety gen^rale d'une certaine classe de fonc-

tions transcendantes ' (Crelle, bd. iv. p. 200).

     These papers treat of the more special functions in which y is con-

nected with X by the relation 2/^=X, where X has the same meaning as

above ; the term hyperelliptic is usually applied to such functions, Abelian

being used in general to designate transcendents in which y is defined as

statements of the preceding article is given here. The mode of procedure

is nearer that of Riemann, Fuchs, and later writers than that of the

original memoir. Some of the results as derived by Abel are given later.

where the ^''s are likewise integral functions of x, when considered geo-
metrically, represent two curves, which intersect in a certain number of
points. In the coefficients of these two equations may appear quantities,

w,-?/, V,  .  .  .    quantities quite indeterminate, upon which the                  coefficients

                    ,

depend.

     The co-ordinates of the intersection of the two curves are functions of

ti, V, w, . . , , so that we may write the two curves in the form

                                      X{x,y ; u,v,w, . . .)=0,

Let the points of intersection of the two curves be

We note that the number fi does not depend upon the function R(a;,y).

We(14)       thus have the sum of fi integrals expressed as the integral of

a rational function of the parameter u. This integral depends upon the

nature of the function 'R{x,y) being, first, a constant ; secondly, the differ-

ential of a logarithmic function which is equivalent to a determinate

algebraic function ; thirdly, a logarithmic expression which likewise is deter-

minate, when the integral ^{x,y)dx are special integrals of the first,

second, and third kinds respectively.

The discussion of these special integrals, the normal integrals of the

first, second and third kinds, is found in Forsyth, ' Theory of Functions,'

birational transformations be transformed into another curve in which

Wethe highest singularities are double points with distinct tangents.

may therefore assume that the curve ·^{x,y)=^Q has no higher singularities

than these. Upon this hypothesis the most intricate integral that arises

may be expressed linearly in tei'ms of the normal integi'als of the first,

second and third kinds, with the addition, perhaps, of an algebraic

expression.

plicated. By making use of the methods mentioned above, this complexity

disappeared, Abel found that the function f\{x,y) contained a certain

From these relations it is seen that as soon as a of the x's are given,

the remaining --fi a may be determined in terms of the known ones. Abel
-- =showed how to effect this determination, and in general that
                                                                   f^  a y.

In two special cases considered by Abel this number is less than y.

(See also Rowe, Memoir on Abel's Theorem, 'Phil. Trans.' 1881, p. 731.)

Professor Cayley, in the ' Addition to Mr. Rowe's Memoir,' proved that y

singularities.

of graphic methods in the ' Cambr. Trans.' xv. Part IV. ; see also

(19) Mathematicians were much interested in the new functions which

must be introduced in connection with the Abelian integrals. The

Academy at Copenhagen wished to see these functions extended to all

integrals of algebraic functions, which are  included  in  Abel's      theorem '
                                                                                                               ;

and in regard to this wish Jiirgensen, Broch, Minding, Rosenhain wrote

some very important memoirs. The value of these memoirs, however, on
account of their less generality was much diminished when Abel's great

paper was finally published in 1841.

     Minding, in two short papers (Crelle, bd. ix. p. 295, 1833, and bd. xi.
p. 233, 1834), showed how to represent the algebraic and logarithmic

functions of Abel's theorem for the special cases in which the algebraic

functions satisfy an equation of the third degree.

Jiirgensen (' Sur la Sommation des Transcendantea a difierentielles

algebriques,' Crelle, bd. xix. p. 113), took, as the subject of integration,

Pthe quotient of two functions T(x, Sj) and Q{x, s,), where        and Q are

integral functions, and where z^ is a root of an equation that is similar to
=Abel's x(^>2/)

legral functions (see Liouville, ' Note sur la Determination des integrals

dont la valeur est algebrique,' Crelle, bd. x. p. 347),^ he considered a

--sum of integrals of the form     ^ ' t ' where the summation is taken over

the fi roots of the resultant of two algebraic equations. This sum he
expressed in the form of an algebraic and logarithmic function.

     In a second paper (Crelle, bd. xxiii. p. 126) Jiirgensen denoted by X(x, yj

    ' Cf. Jacobi, Gesam. Werke, bd. ii. p. 517. He does not mention Jiirgensen.

tioned above) may be given one or the other of the forms

    Two leading questions are considered : (1) To find the cases in which

one can express X.dx by a finite number of algebraic and logarithmic

operations (see art. 34) ; (2) To find the relations among the integrals

                           \f{^i)fX^\)d^u \f{^2)l'h{^2)dx.2, . . .

which correspond to variables Xi, x^, . , . that depend upon one another,
and upon the different roots y^, y^, . . .

     Broch, ' Memoire sur les fonctions de la forme,'

                       ix'-y^-'fix^) {R{x'-)Y'Pdx,'

(Crelle, bd. xxiii. p. 148, 1841), developed rules for the summation of the

ytranscendents mentioned in the title, where (a;'') is a rational function of

x", y an integer which is dirisible by     , r and p are integers, and s an in-

                                        y

teger less than r. p.

These are analagous to the investigations of Abel on the hypei'elliptic

functions which had already been published.

In a previous memoir (Crelle, bd. xx. p. 178), Broch had discussed the

special case where ^?=1 and s=--l. The basis of this paper is Abel's

memoir, ' Demonstration d'une propriete gdn^rale,' (fee. Broch also sought

the minimal number of integrals (Abel's y), through which a sum of inte-

grals could be represented.

Minding divided his paper, ' Propositiones quaedam de integralibus

functionum algebraicarum,' &c. (Crelle, bd. xxiii. p., 255), into three heads.

He first gives an expression for a sum of integrals of the form

                       F<Po (a^i)  (a;^, y< jpJ dXj

                       {

                   -- -- -- --(J){x) {X Ci){x (xC<^) . . . c^),

the c's denoting constants, x^ and yi are the common intersections of two

curves

which correspond to Abel's )^(x,y)=:0 and 6{x,y)=^0.
     Minding further allowed arbitrary variable parameters in his functions

q, so that his results, as Brill and Nother · remark, are only less general than
those of Abel in that fixed points of intersection of the two curves are not

considered.

     The variables a;,(-i=l, 2, . . . ^) are the points of intersection of this
curve with a second algebraic curve.

     Rosenhain (Crelle, bd. xxviii. p. 249, 1844) employed as fundamental
equation

       <l>{x,y)=Poy''+2hr~^+                        +Pn=0.

in the place of Abel's ;:^(a;,y)=0.

     Proceeding in a manner very similar to that of Abel, he adopts in his
summation-formula integrands of the form

                         Q-2r-^+Q3r-'+             + Q"

                                               .

where the Q's are the rational functions of x.

=In discussing the hyperelliptic case (n        2)  he gives     {x,y)  the form

                                                              <t>

/'oy2+7^iZ/+7'2> 3.nd not the form usually adopted, y"=^{x), p^, 2)1, 2^-2t

Rand denoting rational functions of x.

He then seeks to prove in the general case that the number of arbit-

rary constants in an integral of the first kind is equal to the smallest
number of integrals through which the sum of any number of such integrals

is expressible. The article is continued (Crelle, bd. xxix. p. 1).

    (20) Boole, in a paper, ' On the Comparison of Transcendents, with cer-

tain Applications to the Theory of Definite Integrals ' (' Phil. Trans.' 1857,

p. 745), contemplates the following objects :

     First, the demonstration of a fundamental theorem for the summation

of integrals, whose limits are determined by the roots of an algebraic

equation. Secondly, the application of that theorem to the comparison of

algebraic transcendents. Thirdly, the application of the same theorem in

a new, and, as it is conceived, more remarkable line of investigation to the

comparison of functional transcendents. In the introduction to this paper,

Boole states : ' As presented in the writings of Abel and of those who

immediately followed in his steps, the doctrine of the comparison of

transcendents is repulsive from the complexity of the formulae in which

the general conclusions are embodied.' With the intention of simplifying

these formulae, Boole introduced a symbol difiering in interpretation only

by the addition of one element from the symbol used by Cauchy in the

' Calculus of Residues.'

This symbol, (m^, he defines as follows : ' If (j){x)/(x) be any function of x

composed of two factors (p{x) and /(x), whereof <p(x) is rational, let

6[<l>{x)}/ (x) denote the result obtained by successively developing the
       ON THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ABELIAN FUNCTIONS. 261

function in ascending powers of each distinct simple factor (of the form)

x--a in the denominator of </'(<), taking in each development the coefficient

--of , adding together the coefficients thus obtained from the several

   xa
developments, and subtracting from the result the coefficient of l/x in the
development of the same function in descending powers of .x.'

     The simplifications made by Boole are more than offset by the loss of
generality which characterise his formulae.

    Rowe (Memoir on Abel's Theorem, 'Phil. Trans.' 1881, p. 713)

endeavoured to simplify Abel's results, and at the same time to retain
their generality. Using the same notation as in art. 18, and employing
Boole's symbol, he derives Abel's theorem in the form :

=0[.                      I  "sM^yl1 F,, (x)                                     +log B(y) C,

where C is a constant.

     Professor A. R. Forsyth, in a paper, 'Abel's Theorem and Abelian
Functions' ('Phil. Trans.' 1883, p. 323) has obtained an expression for an
integral that is more general than that occurring in Abel's theorem.

    mProfessor Forsyth takes tM'o given equations of degrees and n

between three variables, of which y and z are dependent, x being
independent

                      =F,,.(.T, y, c) 0, F,,(,r, y, z)=Q.

The Jacobian (functional-determinant) of these two functions                                                 is

         -- A/F F \          quantity T is defined by the relation

                             *(·«, y, 2)'

where ^' and * are rational algebraic functions of x, y, z. This quotient

Umay in turn be expressed in the --form rr--, , where                                       is an integral

function of x, y, and z, and./(.x') a function of x alone.
     The generalised Abel's theorem, as derived by Professor Forsyth, is

             Vdx             ^V I 1^{                                             U         looff*Fi'  + C,

where the upper limits of the integrals on the left-hand side are the m.n.p

roots of the equation obtained by eliminating y and z between F,,, and F,,,

and an arbitrary rational algebraic function Fj,(a:,i/,s)=0. On the right-

mhand side tlie summation extends over the . ti roots y and z in terms of
=X of the equations F,,,
                             and F,,=^0. C is a constant.

The more general theorem Professor Forsyth enunciates as follows :

     The first chapter treats of Abel's theorem ; the second, a proof of

Abel's theorem. The connection between the lines of thought presented

in this paper and those of Professor Forsyth are particularly interesting.

In the further developments of Professor Cayley's paper, which is founded

upon Clebsch and Gordan's ' Treatise,' some geometrical results are brought

into prominence. The theory is illustrated by examples in regard to the

cubic, the nodal quartic and the general quartic respectively.

The general case where the fixed curve is any curve whatever has been

solved with great generality by Nother, ' ' Zur Reduction Algebraischer

for the hyperelliptic functions, are given in art. 32.

  --(21) Periodic Functions of Several Variables. In art. 10 the periodic

properties of functions of one variable were considered, and it has been

seen that Abel's theorem embraces the integrals of all algebraic functions.

Considering the inverse of these transcendental integrals, Jacobi dis-

covered the existence of the 2^s'>^'iodic functions of several variables, and
thus revealed the real significance and hitherto hidden properties of such

functions.

    Some of Jacobi's investigations ^ relative to hyperelliptic transcen-

ON THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ABELIAN FUNCTIONS. 263

Abel's theorem, analogous properties exist for all such transcendents, in

which the function X is any rational integral function of x. For, taking
the next simplest case, let X be of the fifth or sixth degree in o-, and write :

                             JoVA                    xdx

                                                 JoVA

and further write

                                                 IX

                                      Jo n/^

or

                              +n(a;)=A'I)(a;) Ai*i(a;),

Awhere and A, denote constants.

     Then from Abel's theorem it follows that of the innumerable solutions

of the equation

      (1) n{x^) + U(x2) + U{x:,)=U{a) + U{b),

there is one algebraic solution ; that is, a and b may be algebraically

determined in terms of x^, x.2, x^ from the two equations that are derived

from (1) :

+ + +(b{x^) <t>(x.,) ^x.i)=(i>(a) <i{b),

--where X=/(x) is a rational integral function of the 2ntth or 2m 1th degree

mvariable x be given, through these quantities it is possible to determine
m--(art. 18) in an algebraic manner

satisfy the transcendental relation :

and Abel further showed that the quantities a,, «2, . . . cr,,,_i are the roots

m --of an algebraic equation of the              lth degree, and that each of the

coefficients in this algebraic equation may be rationally expressed in terms

of the quantities : andx,, x^, . . . a;,,,,

        V v^.X7) n/ >^. · · ·         where X;^=/(a;,) ,x=i, 2 . . . m)-

It also follows from Abel's theorem that, when any number whatever

of values of x are given, tlie sum of the transcendents Tl(x) which
m--lbelong to given values of x maybe expressed through
                                                             transcendents

mn(x') when the - 1 values of x in these transcendents are algebraically

determined from the given values.

We(23)  consider next the case where the sum of four transcendents

are expressed as the sum of two, and where the arguments of these two

transcendents depend algebraically upon the arguments of the first four.

As above, we write :

                   r_^ = ${.)andr4^=$,(4
--264 REPORT 1897.

    By Abel's theorem, when the two equations

are simultaneously given, a and b are algebraically determined in terms of

the given quantities Xi,X2,X2,x^.

    Now write

         ^^f{^,(x^) + ^,{x,)=v;     ^^n^x{x3) + ^,{x,)=v'.

Then from (1) it follows that

                            ^^ l^i{a} + ^,{b)=v + v'.

     If now in (2) we consider a;, and x^ as functions of it and v and write

Xi=X{u,v),X2=\i{u,v),a.nd similarly in (2') write Xj=X(u',v'), x^=\i{u',v'),

+ + + +then it follows from (3) that a=\{u u',v v'), b^=\iiu u',v v').

     Since a and 6 are algebraically expressible in x^,X2,x^,x^, it follows-

+ + + +that \{u u',v v') and X.y{u 2i',y v') are algebraically expressible in

terms of \(u,v,) X^(u,v), \(^ii',v') and Xi(u',v').

variables are separated.

     Taking the next simplest case, let \=/(x) denote a rational integral
function of the fifth or sixth degree. Then the two transcendental

equations (see the preceding article)

                       <I>(.r 1 ) + ^x^) + ^X3)=^a) + ^b),

owing to Abel's theorem, take the place of two algebraic equations
between the five qualities ,t,, Xo, .T;^, a and b. Consider a and b as

constants. Then, when we differentiate the two equations just written,

the terms involving a and b drop out, so that these quantities appear as

arbitrary constants in the transcendental equations, or in the algebraic
equations which take the place of the transcendental.

     Hence we have the following theorem : Lety(a;) be a rational integral
function of the fifth or sixth degree in x, and write y(.r,)=X(, (i=l, 2, 3),

where X,, Xj, . . . X,,, denote the same integral functions in x,,a:.2,

Weremarks : '  know that Lagrange, starting with the differential equa-

tion between two variables [art. 7] came to its complete algebraic integral
through direct methods of integration, and so by a new and singular

method demonstrated Euler's theorem ; and so we think it worth the
while to investigate through direct methods of. integration the two

complete algebraic integrals of the system (rr.) above, or more generally

m--the 1 complete algebraic integrals of the system (2.), and thus adorn

Abel's theorem with a new and no less singular demonstration.'

At the end of the ' Note von der geodatischen Linie auf einem

Ellipsoid,' &.C. ('Werke,'bd. ii. p. 59), Jacobi finds that by making use of a

certain substitution he was able to extend the remarkable relation dis-

covered by Legendre between the complete integrals of the first and

second kind of two elliptic integrals whose moduli are complements to

each other to all hyperelliptic integrals ; and this same substitution, he
says, led him to the Abelian theorem itself in a way and through con-

siderations which are absolutely different from that of Abel. These

considerations originate from a mechanical problem.

Wealgebraic form.                                                     thus derive a new method of finding the fundamental

theorem for the addition of elliptic integrals. Jacobi says that by

generalising this method through the introduction of any number of

variables he obtained the general addition-theorem in a new and ready

manner ; and at the same time there was opened a simpler way, through
the application of suitable multiplications, of coming directly to the

algebraic integrals of the systems of differential equations (rr.) and (S.)

above. See also a paper by Haedenkamp (Crelle, bd. xxii. p. 184).

     (25) Following Jacobi's suggestion of the preceding article, Richelot
(Crelle, bd. xxiii. p. 354) extended Lagrange's methods (art. 7) and in a

direct manner integrated the differential equations (a.) and (2.)' above.

By his methods two algebraic integrals ai'e found for Euler's differen-

tial equation, of which it is easy to prove that the one is a function of

the other ; while the two algebraic solutions of (cr.) are independent. He

found two similar solutions for the system (2'.) The general solution of

algebraically compared among one another. Lagrange tried in vain to extend this

theorem. This paradoxical thought is easily explained : for two algebraic equations

between the arguments of the integrals always satisfy the two transcendental relations

between these integrals when the function under the radical sign is of the fifth or

sixth degree (art. 21). These algebraic equations exist owing to the fact that the

numerator of the integral which is of the first degree has coefficients which are

always of such a nature that two of the arguments become roots of a quadratic

equation, whose roots involve the other arguments algebraically. As often, therefore,

as the transcendents unite within themselves a logarithmic and a trigonometric

part, it happens through the algebraic equations that both the trigonometric and the

logarithmic parts vanish independently in the two transcendental equations, so

that one relation is given among the logarithms and another among the arcs. Of.

corresponding to (I.) may be reduced to a form similar to that just

written.'

    He further divides these integrals into the three principal kinds, and

by means of Abel's theorem considers the peculiar properties of the

respective kinds. By making use of irrational substitutions which depend

upon a quadratic equation, he finds that integrals of the form

repetition of this procedure the moduli rapidly approach zero or unity

hyperelliptic integrals of the first order may be reduced into canonical
forms by means of certain substitutions, even when the factors of the

function under the square-root sign in the denominator of the integrand are
not all real. Jacobi also avoids the imaginary arguments introduced by

++Richelot through the application of the substitution 2y=:\/ a hz cz'^-jr

means of Abel's theorem. When the degree of the function under the

root sign is greater than the sixth, and when this function contains

imaginary factors, Jacobi asserts that no one has found the substitutions

by which the reduction may be performed. At the close of this article

Jacobi discusses Euler's addition-theorem from a more general standpoint
than that taken by Lagrange (art. 7).

tliat the general problem of integrating an algebraic difi'erential by means

of logarithms, in so far as this is possible, was first proposed by Abel,

who had arrived at very important results, as is seen from a letter written

to Legendre (' ffiuvres,' t. ii. p. 271), and it is very probable that just these

investigations led him to his celebrated theorem.

Abel (' CEuvres,' t. i. p. 549) derived the more general theorem relative

to the form which one must give to the integral of any algebraic function

   Abel remarks (p. 550) that this theorem is not only fundamental in

all that concerns the application of algebraic and logarithmic functions and

elliptic integrals to the theory of the integration of algebraic differentials,

but it includes all the possible reductions of the integrals of algebraic

formulce by the aid of algebraic and logarithmic functions.

   --As a corollary is the following theorem : If                                                                                            ^                           , whei'e p is any

where £ is a constant, and whence also the general transformation of

elliptic integrals of the first kind.

     (35) Similar problems were discussed by Liouville- (' Memoires des
Savants Etrangers,' t. v. pp. 76 and 103) before he had seen the methods
used by Abel. Liouville says that the problems proposed by him do not
differ in their origin from those enunciated by Lagrange in the ' Th^orie

tions cannot contain other radical quantities than those that enter these

functions, theorems which were known to the first inventors of analysis

(see Leibnitz, ' Act. erud. Lips.'). In the first of the memoirs mentioned
above Liouville proposes the problem of finding the form of the integral

\ydx, when this integral may be expressed algebraically, where y and x

are connected by an algebraic equation

                     y-Ly-i-- . . , -My-- ]Sr=0,

L, M, . . . designating rational functions of a: ; he shows that the value
of such an integral is equal to a certain rational function of x and y. In
the discussion of this theorem he classifies functions of one or more

variables according to the irrationalities that enter them.'

     In the second memoir the general theorem which he proposes to
demonstrate is : if any algebraic explicit or implicit function y is given,
it is always possible to decide if it has or has not for an integral an
explicit or implicit algebraic function ; and if the question is decided in

the affirmative, the same process will gis'o the value lydx.

    He shows that if the integral jydx may be expressed algebraically, it

has a value of the form :

\ydx=a+l3y + y,f-+ . . . +X>/''-\

in which a, ft, y, . . . X are rational functions of x.
     In the twenty-third volume of the ' Journ. de I'Ecole Poly.' p. 37,

Liouville finds that if the integral I ydx is expressible as an explicit finite

function of x, it must be of the form :

A +Cyydx=t + logM + B log v+ . . .            log IV,

where A, B, . . . are constants, and t, «, v, . . . are algebraic functions of x.

This theorem is of course contained in the one of Abel in the precedino-

-- Rarticle. Liouville further shows that if
^, P and denoting integral

polynomials, cannot be expressed by an algebraic function of x, it cannot
be expressed as a finite explicit function of x ; from this follows that an

elliptic integral of either the first or second kind cannot be expressed as

an explicit function of its variable. (See also Liouville, ' Liouv. Journ.'
t. V. pp. 34 and 441, where it is proved that the same integrals, considered

as functions of their modulus, cannot be expressed in finite form.'-*)

      (36) Jacobi ('De functionibus duarura variabilium quadrupliciter

periodicis,' Crelle, bd. xiii. p. 55 ; ' Werke,' bd. ii. p. 25) proved that any
one-valued function of one variable cannot have more than two inde-
pendent periods, and that the ratio of these two periods cannot be a real
quantity and is irrational.

     Making use of Richelot's transformation, Jacobi wrote the general

integral under consideration in the form :

(A  r  ia + Px)dx

^   J Va;(l-a;)(l-K-2a;)(l-\2x)(l-^2jc)"

He distinguished the values of this integral within the six intervals :

    (1) -co ... 0, (2)  ... I,  (3) 1 . . .

W^r--^. (=)l^----->. (6)^.-..~.

When the upper limit rein formula (A.) is considered as a function of u and

written x=:\(u), this function behaves like a periodic function within
each of these intervals, and therefore seems to have six periods, of which

four are independent. Further, this function remains unchanged when u

assumes any real or imaginary value, or better expressed, of the values

which u may take, there are always those which differ from any real or

imaginary quantity by less than any assignable quantity, however small.
     Jacobi found in this a troublesome paradox, which, however, he had

already in a measure overcome by means of Abels theorem (see following

article).

     Jacobi next proved that if a given function of two variables is an

one- valued function of these variables, it is impossible for this function to

have more than four independent periods.'

there is no analogy between this function and the elliptic function a;=sn ?*,
since such a function, as seen above, has for every value of u not only

many values, but is wholly indeterminate,- if for the definition of the
integral we consider only the limits and not the paths which the variable
describes from one limit to the other. Hence, when we consider the

integral (I.) by itself, its inversion does not give useful results.

      Jacobi conceived the very fortunate idea of inverting these integrals

following equations :

                            J \/ X J s/ X

     In these two equations, when ii is given, the upper limits x^ and X2
are not yet determined, there being two of them ; so that we may regard
71 and V as independent of each other. This we cannot do when we
consider the integrals (I.) and (II.) separately ; for if x was determinate
for a given value of « in (I.), then it would be determined in (II.), and

therefore (II.) would be determined.

    When u and v are given, the totality of the upper limits (that is, of

Xi and x.2) is known ; but these quantities may be permuted, so that
x^+X2 and a;,..r2 are definitely determined when n and v are given, and

maybe expressed as the roots of a quadratic equation Aa;^ + B.r + C=0,

where a;i+a;2=-- T^=^(",i'),anda;i.a;2=-x-=4'('*>^)-  -A-, B, and C are

functions of u and v, which have definite finite values for all finite values,
real or imaginary, of the two arguments u and v ; and the functions
^{ii,v) and yp{u,v) have with reference to the arguments 20 and v four

simultaneous independent periods.

Let the values of x^ and X2, determined from the quadratic equation

above, be Xl=A(?^,^·), a'2^/\i(it,'y).

     In these functions it is seen that when one of the arguments goes to
infinity, the other becomes indeterminate, and when one of the arguments

changes by a constant quantity the other argument is also changed, so
that both arguments undergo an alteration at the same time, and the

period of  one  argument is determined  by the  period of  the      other                      this is
                                                                                            ;

      Eisenstein (Crelle, bd. xxvii. p. 185) writes as follows regarding the
inverse functions : ' Great difficulties are found with the Abelian integrals

whose inverse functions have a triple or multiple periodicity. Under the
assumption that an integral with definite lower limit may take all possible
real and imaginary values for any given value of the variable, the Abelian

integral ceases to be a function of its variable. In order to meet these
difficulties, for example in the Abelian integrals of the first order, Jacobi
considered two such integrals connected by the relations (1) and (2) of

the preceding article. But if we grant that the function 11 (a;,) can have
all possible values for any given value of x^, the function n(a;.,^ may have
the same property for every given value of a;,, and so the sum u may for
a greater reason take all possible values for given values of x^ and x,^. The
same is true of ij ; so that it is not clear how we may speak in this wise

of a dependency between u, v, x^, and x.,.' Eisenstein then proposes,
in order to set forth the real nature of these functions after the analogue
of the elliptic functions (art. 11), to form the quotients of the quotients

of infinite triple products.

     Jacobi (' Werke,' bd. ii. p. 86) corrects Eisenstein's objections with the
remarks that Eisenstein did not understand the nature of the functions
}^(u,v), Xy{u,v), his mistake being that he did not sufficiently comprehend
the fundamental principle of the co-existence of the periods relative to the

two arguments m and v. He then asks if the quotients of quotients are
not simply quotients, and points out how Eisenstein has made some

fundamental mistakes in the theory of elliptic functions (Crelle, bd. xxvii.
pp. 185 and 285).

     (39) Hermite (Extrait d'une Lettre a M. Liouville, ' Comp. Rendus,'

t. xviii. ; 'Liouville's Journ.' t. ix. p. 353) introduces into the analysis of

the transcendents of any algebraic diSerentials the inverse functions of
several variables, after the example of that which had been done by Jacobi

for the hyperelliptic integrals of the first order.

     Using the notation of Abel and of Minding, he takes

an irreducible algebraic equation, whose coefficients are rational and in-

tegral functions of x. The roots of this equation he denotes by y^, 1/2*

He. . . y,,.  further writes :

              f(^,y)=to+t\y+ · · · +t,,-2y'"^

any rational integral function in x and y, in which the degrees of the

x's are subjected to certain restrictions.

     Finally, let y denote the number of arbitrary constants that are con-
tained in the function f{x,y) ; this function may then take y different
forms, which are represented by

    Then by Abel's theorem we have in algebraic form the complete in-

tegrals of the system of equations.

                                                          (i=l,2,. . .y).
     (40) Hermite then takes for the inverse functions the quantities
a;,, X2, . . . Xj defined by the y equations

                                   {i=l, 2, . . . y),

                                     (i=l, 2, . . .y).

It follows ' without difficulty that the y functions

                                                              {i=l, 2, . . . y),

are the roots of an algebraic equation of the degree y, whose coefficients

are rational functions of the different functions

            \i (Ui, M2,  \. . «,),   {Vi, V2, . . . v^),

                                     {i=l, 2, . . . y).

In the third section of this memoir, Hermite discusses the periodic

properties of these functions, and determines their periods.

The theorem relative to the addition of the arguments leads to the

expression of the inverse functions in all their generality in terms of the

simplest particular functions, in which we may suppose successively that

only one argument varies, the others being constant, zero for example {cf.

art. 38).

    As an illustration, we saw in art. 24 that functions connected with

the hyperelliptic integrals of the second order arise, in which appear three

narguments, (u, v, lu), say ; and from Abel's theorem it follows that

formation, multiplication, and division that are found in Jacobi's 'Fund.

Nova.' Among others we may mention a direct method of the trans-

formation of elliptic functions of the third kind, without presupposing, as

is done by Jacobi, the formula of the transformation of functions of the

second kind.

    (41) Jacobi, in the eleventh section of his memoir ' De functionibus
duarum variabilium quadriipliciter periodicis,' states without demonstra-

tion that if we have

                      = =X \{n, v), y \{u,v\

then the functions

are by Abel's theorem obtained as the roots of a quadratic equation

                      =+ + U"Ua;,.2 U'a;,,                                 0,

U"in which U, U',     are rational functions of .r, y, \/X,\/Y (see art. 37) ;

and from this it is seen, vice versA, that x and y may be obtained from

a;,, and y,, by the solution of algebraic equations.

     Hermite (Crelle, bd. xxxii. pp. 176 and 277) finds that the coefficients

U, XT', and U" are of the form P + Q ^(a;)Ay, where P and Q are rational

functions of x and y, and where

Dwhere A, B, C, are rational functions of \(7iu, nv) and K^(nu, nv).

    The first member of this equation may be denoted by f {u, v), and
may be expressed rationally in terms of A (u, v) and Xj (u, v), since, owing

to the fundamental properties of the functions X and Xj, this is true of

each of the terms constituting ^ (->(, r).

     The «th power of <!> is a rational function in X (;/,, i'), X, (;/, v), which

does not change when for these quantities are substituted any two other

of the simultaneous roots of the proposed equations. It follows, there-

fore, from the theory of the symmetric functions of the roots of a system

of equations in several unknown quantities, that this function may be

rationally determined in the coefficients of the equation (A.) ; and since

any  rational  function   of  two    A A mayroots (X («?/, nv)), (Xj (iiii, nv'))                                be

the theorem is proved.

     (42) Hermite says, in continuance of the above discussion, it seems,

that the preceding considerations may be extended to the hyperelliptic

integrals in general.

nare the functions a^o, Xi, . . . a!,,.
282 REPORT-- 1897.

     In a letter to Liouville (loc. cit. p. 361), Hermite states that the
representation of these functions is attended with great difBculties.

    By supposing successively /(a;, 2/)=a^+y and /(x, y)=x. y, the pre-

ceding theorem will give, expressed by a sum of nth roots, in number

--n* l, the coefficients of an equation of the second degree, whose roots

will determine those of the proposed equations. These n^--l roots will

be expressed rationally in terms of four of them.
     Hermite next discusses the division of the periods.
     In the second paper mentioned above, Hermite derives Jirst certain

theorems, from which he deduces, among others, Jacobi's formula for the

algebraic expression of sin am (x) by sin am i:^], and Abel's fundamental

properties of elliptic functions which relate to the addition of the argu-
Hments ; other formulae, which involve Jacobi's
                                                 and 6 functions are

given.

Applications are then made to functions of two arguments and four

periods. Hermite writes the integrals of the third kind in the form

        (I-) \\x -- a X -- bj Ax \y -- a y--b/Ayj'

the integral being subjected to vanish, when x=^0 and y=^0. Ax repre-

+ +sents the square root of the Tpo\jnomial 2h^ +3h^'^ 2h^^ 2h'^'^ +2^&^-

     After

        x=\(u,v) 2/=Xi(m,u)

        a=X(a,/3) b=X,{a,(5)

Whenare substituted in (I.), this integral is denoted by IT (n,t\u,(i).      the

variables u and v are introduced into the integrals of the second kind

        (a?dx yHy\   , Ux'dx tfdy\
                      ][A{xyA{y))'
        {A{x)^A{yjJ

they are first denoted by {u,v\ and (ujv).^ respectively.

    Two new integrals are defined by the relations :

             +^i{u,v)=2pi{u,v\ 3p^{u,v)i and E^ {u,v)=2Ji,{u,v)^.

     The following theorem is then derived

                -- -- +U{u,v,a,l3) 'n.{a,l3,u,v)=pg(uv (3u) uEJ^ii,,v)

a formula in which is seen the law of interchange of parameter               and
argument (art. 33).

     Hermite further defines a function $ by the relation

         =*(w,'y,a,/3) n(M,T,a,/3)-t-MZi(o,/3)-l-tiZa(a,/3)-- c(ai;-- /3m),

where Zj and Z^ are certain functions of E^ and Ej respectively, and

c is a constant.

     Interesting addition-formulae are derived for the two functions 11 and

$ {cf. report made by Lame and Liouville, ' Comp. Rend.' xvii. and

' Liouv. Journ.' t. viii. p. 502).

   --(43) Tlte introduction of the theta-function. The new functions of four

simultaneous periods which Jacobi had discovered were received with

great enthusiasm by mathematicians. The Academy of Sciences at

Copenhagen wished to see presented the analogous functions that are
connected with the integrals of all algebraic functions, to which Abel's
         ON THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ABELIAN FUNCTIONS. 283

theorem maybe applied.' The representation of these functions, however,
·was not forthcoming, and later the solution of this problem was set as a
prize question by the Berlin Academy of Sciences.

      Abel had shown that the elliptic function a;=sn ^^, could be represented
as the quotient of infinite products. Jacobi, with the thought of repre-
senting an infinite product by means of a transcendental function, intro-
duced into analysis the so-called ti-function, which represents such a
product in the foi-m of a power series. Investigating further this tran-
scendent, he discovered its marvellous properties, and made use of it in his
further researches in the elliptic functions. Jacobi ^ founded the whole
theory of elliptic functions upon this new transcendent, which made these
functions remarkably clear and simple, as well as their applications, for
example, to rotatory motion, the swing of the pendulum, and innumerable
problems of physics and mechanics ; also by it the realms of geometry
were essentially widened, and many abstract properties of the theory of
numbers were revealed in a new light.

     Hence it appears that the ^-function showed itself of paramount
importance for the study of mathematics during the Jacobian epoch, and

as a prototype it served for the future development of the function-theory
and of all mathematics.

     (44) The elliptic function x=sn.u, as shown by Jacobi, maybe expressed
as the quotient of two 6-functions, where the ^-function may be written

in the form

                                       6 (u)^ :s

m --in which takes all integral values fi'om co to -f cx3, m is the variable,

and the constant t is determined from the two pei'iods of the integral

                                            u

where X is of the fourth degree in x ; or, as Jacobi says, t determines the

modulus of the elliptic integral.

where X is a rational integral function of the fifth or sixth degree ' in x.

By means of the quotients of two such ^-functions Goepel and Rosenhain

showed how to represent the functions (p{'n,v) and yl{ii,i-) (art. 37), and

thus completely solved the problem of representing the inverse functions

of the hyperelliptic integrals of the first order.

The zeros and periodic properties of these two ^-functions, the relations

between the squares of such functions and of the constants that enter

these relations, the number of independent relations, Goepel's biquadratic

relation, the connection between these functions and Rummer's sixteen-

nodal quartic surface, and similar questions, are found in Harkness and

AMorley's ' Treatise on the Theory of Functions,' p. .341 et seq.

     (46) Goepel remarked that his investigations could be extended to any
number of variables ; but in this connection Jacobi showed that there is

a troublesome paradox ( Werke,' bd. ii. p. 521 ; and Weierstrass, 'Werke,'
bd. i. p. 142) ; since, when there are more than two variables, tlie

generalised 6- function contains more essential constants than the hyper-

elliptic functions with like number of variables.

We(47)  must mention next papers by Hermite, ' Sur la theorie de la

transformation des fonctions Abeliennes ' ('Compt. Rend.' xl. pp. 249,
303, 365, 427, 485, 536, 704, and 784).

     Besides the sum and the quotient of x and y (of art. 37), which we
saw could be expressed througli fractions whose numerator and denomi-

nator are functions of the argument u and v, and have unique and finite

values for all finite real and imaginary values of these arguments, Goepel

and Rosenhain gave in an analogous form the analytical expression of

thirteen other functions of m and v, which depend algebraically but in an

irrational manner upon the first two.

In this paper special attention is paid to the relations among the squares of the
functions and to the derivation of the biquadratic relation among four of the
functions, which is the same as Kummer's sixteen-nodal quartic surface. See also

where o, p, y, and are constants, and ^ {x) a polynomial of the fifth or

sixth degree in x.

Hermite proposes as follows the problem of transformation : The poly-

nomial 4- (a;) in (I.) being given, determine the coefficients of i// (a;), and

the constants o, /3, y, and I in such a manner that the fifteen functions

F (it, v) be rationally expressed in terms of the fifteen functionsy(?/,r).

    By comparison of the linear relations that must exist among the periods

of the/(M, v) functions and the F (m, v) functions, and of the relations

that exist among the periods that belong to these respective functions,

many remarkable consequences are deduced. In this connection see a

letter of Eisenstein to Hermite ('Liouv. Journ.' xvii.) and also Eisen-

stein, 'Ueber dieVergleichung von solchen ternaren quadratischen Formen,

welche verschiedene Determinanten haben ' (' Sitzungsber. der Berlin.

Akad.' June 1852), and Hermite (Crelle, bd. xlvii. p. 343). From these

papers is seen the intimate relation that exists between the analytic theory

of transformation and the arithmetical theory of quadratic forms.

     In the execution of the transformation a system of sixteen ^-functions

is introduced, sixteen functions which may be algebraically expressed in

terms of any two of them.

    Four new functions, FTo, n,, rij, and II3, are introduced, which may be

expressed by an integral homogeneous function of degree k in four of the

                                                2, 1

0-functions. The IT-functions contain linearly             - constants. There

are just enough conditions of the problem to determine these constants.

Further, the fl-functions are defined in terms of other 9-functions. From
this follow immediately relations among the quadruply-periodic quotients

which arise from the division of two 0-functions and those which arise

from the division of two fJ-functions. These last functions may be ret^arde

as representing the more general periodic functions which orginate from
the hyperelliptic integrals of the first order, when the arguments x and y
have been replaced by others which depend linearly upon them in any
manner.

    Thus the proposed problem of transformation is solved.' On p. 704

of the ' Compt. Rendus,' t. xl., Hermite gives a method of division of the
H-functions, and compares them with Weierstrass' Al-functions of the fol-
lowing article.

     Liouville and Hermite made use of the periodic properties of the single
0-functions, and derived for the elliptic functions the results of addition,
multiplication, transformation, and division ; and Hermite by direct trans-

1-11 laid the foundation for the investigations of Jacobi and Abel, so

may we also regard the works that have been reviewed up to the present

time as introductory to the works of Weierstrass and Riemann.
     The theory of Abelian functions has been so generalised, so widened,

by these mathematicians and their followers that we may make the same

remark concerning it as Jacobi (in a letter to Crelle, ' Crelle's Journ.'
bd. iii. p. 310) made regarding the elliptic functions : 'You see that the
theory is a vast subject of research, which in the course of its development
embraces almost all algebra, the theory of definite integrals and the
science of numbers.'

     As suggested in the introduction, an account of the works of Weier-

strass, Riemann, Clebsch, and later writers cannot be given in this report
owing to the lack of space required for such a statement. To leave the

woi'k thus unfinished would cause tlie author much regret ; however, there
has just appeared the admirable treatise of Mr. H. F. Baker on ' Abel's
Theorem and the Allied Theory,' in which the discoveries of the mathe-

maticians just mentioned and the development of the theory of Abelian
functions are treated in a very comprehensive and elegant manner.

     In conclusion, the author takes much pleasure in referring to this book,
at the beginning of which we are taught that no better guide can be found

to the analytical developments of pure mathematics than a study of the
theory of Abelian functions.

--The Action of Light vpon Dyed Colours. Rejjort of the Committee,

     consisting of Professor T. E. Thorpe (Chairman), Professor J. J.

    Hummel (Secretary), Dr. W. N. Perkin, Professor W. J. Russell,
    Captain Abney, Professor W, Stroud, and Professor R. Meldola.

During the past year (1896-97) the work of this Committee has beca
continued as usual, and a large number of wool and silk patterns, dyed
with various natural and artificial brown and black colouring matters, have
been examined with respect to their power of resisting the fading action

·of light.

     The Committee regret to state, however, that at this meeting of the
Association they are unable to give an account of the results obtained,
since at the earlier date this year at which Reports of Committees had to
be sent to the Organising Committees the dyed patterns were still under
exposure to light, so that the Report could not be prepared. It will be
presented, however, at the next meeting of the Association. The Com-
mittee ask for reappointment, and for a grant of 81. to carry on the
work.

--The Teaching of Science in Elementary Schools. Report of the Com-

     mittee, consisting of Dr. J. H. Gladstone (Chairman), Professor

    H. E. Armstrong (Secretary), Professor W. R. Dunstan, Mr.

     George Gladstone, Sir John Lubbock, Sir Philip Magnus, Sir
     H. E. RoscoE, and Professor S. P. Thompson.

YouE Committee have much pleasure in being able to report that during

the past year the teaching of science subjects in Elementary Schools has

made considerable progress. They think it unnecessary to repeat the
table showing the dearth of any such instruction, other than that of
Geography before the year 1890, but give the figures for the principal

class subjects for the succeeding years, showing that while ' English ' (i.e.
grammar, not literature) is gradually losing favour, the scientific subjects
are all receiving more attention. It will be seen that there is a very
rapid advance in regard to Elementary Science, although 'Object Lessons,'
as such, appear in the return this year for the first time, and have at once
taken a good place in the schools. The figures up to 1895-96, which is
the latest return issued by the Education Department, are as follows :

    --Class Subjects Departments
--288 REPORT 1897.

     The increased teaching of scientific specific subjects in the higher

standards is the natural consequence of the greater attention paid to

natural science in the lower part of the schools. The number of scholars
examined in the above subjects is shown in the table at the bottom of
previous page. This shows a fair increase in the total ; the greatest
proportional increase will be fountl to be in Mensuration, Botany, and
Chemistry. In the case of the Principles of Agriculture, and in Mag-
netism and Electricity, there is an absolute falling off.

     Estimating the number of scholai-s in Standards V., VI., and VII. at
605,000, the percentage of the number examined in these specific subjects
as compared with the number of children qualified to take them is 24-2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

but it should be remembered that many of the children take more than
one subject for examination. The following table gives the percentage for

each year since 1882, and shows that science is gradually recovering from
the great depression of about eight years ago :

wliole of England and Wales, and are for the school years ending with
August 31. The statistics of the London School Board are brought up to
the year ending with Lady Day, 1897. They also illustrate the great
advance that has been made in tlie teaching of Elementary Science as a
class subject, and they give the number of children as -well as the number

         ox THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 289

     The work under the Evening Continuation Schools Code continues to
progress, as will be seen from the following
--290 REPORT 1897.

has been on the result of the examination of the individual scholars, for

which, of  course, inspection  with  notice  was  necessary                                        henceforth  the
                                                                                                ;

payment will be by time, and the scale of payment will be determined by

the report of the Inspector on his visits without notice.

In Course H, in the Supplement to Schedule II., called ' Experimental

Arithmetic, Physics, and Chemistry,' there are some alterations in the

order of the work in the upper standards, with the addition of ' Floating

bodies' and 'The heat unit, heat capacity, and latent heat.'

In the schedule of studies for pupil teachers there is a new column of

Elementary Science (details of which are given in the Appendix), but it

is only an optional subject. This has an advantage over the working

under the Science and Art Department, as the matter for study is not so

specialised, and it extends through the whole of the Pupil-teacher course.

But there is no requirement that it should be carried out e.x;perimentally.

In the Elementary Science supplement to Schedule II., the subject

matter of Standard III. in all the different Courses is unaltered ; but it

is made clear that it is to be taught by means of illustrative object

lessons.

     Teaching of Practical Housewifery, etc., must depend, not on empirical

rules, but on the scientific principles underlying the actual work.
     The Code of regulations for the Evening Continuation Schools is

increased in bulk. The new subjects in Science are Domestic Science
and Commercial Geography. The scheme for Elementary Physics and

Chemistry is enlarged by the introduction of the measurement of heat,

and heat capacity. An alternative scheme of instruction in Hygiene is

provided, which is described as the scheme of the St. John's Ambulance
Association. The detailed scheme for Commercial Geography includes a
considerable amount of matter touching the Physical Geography and
Climatology, and the raw -productions of the countries studied. The
scope of the syllabus for Domestic Science is much the same as that in the
Day School Code, with the proviso that ' the applications to the home
should be the results of the discoveries made in the course of the experi-

ments, which should be undertaken in a spirit of inquiry or research.'
The directions are exceedingly minute, detailing the practical work to be

done at every stage of the study.
     It is evident that if this kind of Science Teaching is to be given in the

Elementary Schools a body of teachers must be raised up who are well
indoctrinated in the new methods. This fact is being recognised now by
many of the large School Boards, and under that for London in particular
the classes in Practical Science for teachers, which have been conducted
by Mr. Heller for some time past, are already bearing fruit ; while the
same may be expected of the classes in Domestic Science for women
teachers, now under the management of Miss Edna Walter. The

Departmental Committee on Training Colleges, of which the Rev. T. W.
Sharpe (Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools) is Chairman, may also

be expected to do something to simplify and improve the teaching of
Science by providing a more appropriate course of study than the
specialised subjects of the Science and Art Department for the students

at those institutions.

     There has lately been held in London an important Conference of the
International Congress on Technical Education, at which five members of
your Committee read papers or joined in the discussion. Although it was
not directly concerned with Elementary Education, there was much that
ON THE TEACHIXG OF SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 291

bore upon the importance and the methods of teaching Science in the

primary and continuation schools as a preparation for technical studies

Aproperly so called.  full account of what took place at this Conference

is being printed in the ' Journal of the Society of Arts.' It includes also

a strong letter from Professor Fitzgerald in advocacy of the system which

he saw carried out by Mr. Heller during the Professor's recent visit to

London as a member of the Commission on Manual and Practical Instruc-

tion in Primary Schools in Ireland.

The question of improved methods of Science teaching in Elementary

Schools has also been advanced by the action of the Joint Scholarships

Board. Early in February Sir Philip Magnus, Chairman of the Board,

wrote to the ' Times ' inclosing a copy of a memorandum which had been

prepared by a Committee of the Board, and had been forwarded to the

Vice-President of the Council. The memorandum may be found in

--extenso in 'Education ' of February 27. Its principal recommendation is as

follows : ' In the opinion of this Board, in order to place " Science " on a

sounder footing in Elementary Schools, and, above all, in order that the

teaching of the subject may be of real value educationally, it is desirable

that only one Science subject should be taught up to and within the Sixth

Standard, and that the course should be a progressive one. It seems that

this might be accomplished by adopting exclusively Course H, given in

the Supplement to Schedule II. of the Day School Code.' It is hoped

that the Education Department will be able before long to adopt the

suggestion of the Board, whose object is to adapt the method of Science

teaching in its earliest stages to more advanced work, so that there may

be continuity in method from the Elementary Schools to the University.

    of Professor W. A. Tilden (Chairman) and Dr. H. E. Arm-

     strong (Secretary).

During the past year further important evidence has been obtained bear

ing on the constitution of the tri-derivatives of naphthalene confirmatory
of the conclusions previously arrived at, and also affording proof that the
interaction of phosphorus pentachloride and sulphonic chlorides is in all
cases a trustM^orthy method of determining constitution by reference to

xjhloronaphthalenes (cf. Armstrong and Wynne, 'Proc. Chem. Soc' 1897,

152).

      It has been found that the chloronaphthalene-disulphonic chlorides
«,fford a relatively small amount of trichloronaphthalene, and that a con-

--siderable portion of the product is an intermediate compound the di-

chloronaphthalene-wiono-sulphonic chloride. From the results obtained

in the case of several u-/3-disulphonic acids, it appears that of the two, as

was to be expected, the a-sulphonic group is the more readily displaced.

   A series of remarkable observations have been made of the occurrence

of isomeric change in the case of 1 : I'-dichloronaphthalene and its deri-

vatives.

     The a-sulphonic acid of 1 : I'-dichloronaphthalene is hydrolysed at
about 230°, and gives only 1 : I'-dichloronaphthalene whatever be the
hydrolytic agent used. The /3-sulphonic acid represented by the formula.

                                                                    CI CI

                                              S

however, which cannot be hydrolysed below 285°, gives one or other of no
--fewer than three isomeric dichloronaphthalenes
                                                      the 1  : 1', 1  : 2', or 1     4'

                                                                                  :

--modifications according to the agent used.

When hydrolysed at 290° by means of a solution containing 1 per cent,

of sulphuric acid or one containing about 50 per cent, of phosphoric acid,

it behaves normally, yielding 1 : I'-dichloronaphthalene. But if stronger
solutions of either acid be used, much of the salt is carbonised, and in this

case a small amount of 1 : 4'-dichloronaphthalene is obtained as the sole

volatile product. When concentrated muriatic acid is used as the hydro-

lytic agent, as much as 20 percent, of the theoretical amount of the 1:4'-

conipound is formed.

Lastly, if the potassium salt be mixed with sulphuric and phosphoric

acids, and superheated steam be passed through the mixture, 1 : 2'-di-

chloronaphthalene is the sole product of hydrolysis. In this last case it

is not improbable that further sulphonation precedes hydrolysis, and that

this has the eflTect of preventing the transference of chlorine to the para-

position,  so  that  the 1  : 2' is  formed  instead  of  the 1:4'    modification
                                                                                                                ;

thus :

CI CI                 CI CI                           CI              CI

                                             CI CI

     The tricliloronaphthalenes derived from 1 : 4'-dichloronaphthalene are

also, it appears, susceptible of ' isomeric ' change.
      Considerable attention has been paid during the year to the study of

the derivatives of a-methoxy- and «-ethoxy-naphthalene in comparison

with those of a-naphthol. It appears to be a much less ' active ' compound

 than the latter, for example, readily yielding a monobromo-derivative,
 whereas it is almost impossible to prevent the exclusive formation of
 dibromonaphthol from <i-naphthol.

    A series of sulphonic acids have been prepared from a-ethoxynaphtha-

 lene and its bromo-derivatives.

--The Carbohydrates of the Cereal Straivs. Report of the Committee^

     consisting of Professor E. Warington {Chairman), 0. F. Cross
      (Secretary), and Manning Prentice. (Draivn up by the Secre-

       tary.)

The work upon the barley crop of 1896, which was reported in outline to

the Chemical Section in a paper read by Mr. Cross, has been more fully
dealt with in a paper read subsequently, and published in the ' Journal of
the Chemical Society,' 1896, pp. 804-818. The subject was also dealt with
from the more special point of view of the relation of the furfuroid con-
stituents of these straws to the important problems of animal digestion andl
alcoholic fermentation in a paper published in the ' Journal of the Fed.

Inst, of Brewing,' 1897, Pt. 1.

   WeThe investigations have been continued without intei'ruption.

have further and more closely studied the products of acid hydrolysis of
the cereal straws and of the celluloses isolated from them, and the main
results of these researches are embodied in a paper read at the Meeting of
the Chemical Society, London, on June 17.

      Generally the results of the preceding paper (loc. cit.) are amplified

and confirmed. As it had been previously shown that the furfural-yield-
ing constituents of fodder plants are in large measure hydrolysed and

assimilated by the animal organism, so the evidence is accumulating that
certain of these compounds when fully hydrolysed (to monoses) by artificial

processes are susceptible of alcoholic fermentation.
      It having been finally established that the pentoses themselves are

entirely resistant to the attack of the yeast cell, it follows that we are
dealing with a class of furfural-yielding carbohydrates, not pentoses.

    At the same time the reactions of these compounds clearly indicates

that they are pentose-derivatives, and most probably methylene ethers of

the C5 sugars of the general formula CgHgOa C /CHg.

     It is difficult to devise reactions of decomposition or synthesis by which
such a constitutional formula could be finally verified. The literature of

                                                /^\

the analogous compound diperonal H0C.C(;H3<' /CH.,, but with an

aromatic in place of a pentose residue, may be cited in evidence of the

exceptional difficulty of the pn blem presented.
     The authors are glad to report that through the kindness of friends,

they have now access to a vessel enabling them to operate upon a large
weight (7 kilos.) of the raw materials.

     Working upon this extendfd scale, and upon the basis of the results
established by long investigation and previously reported to the Associa-
tion, we may confidently expect more positive and, we hope, final results.

TJie Electrolytic Methods of Quantitative Analysis.-- Fourth Report of the

     and Professor W. Carleton Williams.

Since the last report, which included an examination of the electrolytic
methods for the determination of bismuth, antimony, and tin, and for the
separation of the two latter, the experimental work of the Committee has
been continued. The investigations on the determination of cobalt, nickel,
and zinc are practically finished ; also further work on the determination
of bismuth and its separation from other metals ; but the Committee prefer
to delay the publication of these results until the next report in order to

make them as complete as possible.

--The Frodiiction of Haloids from Pure Materials. Report of the

      Committee, consisting of Professor H. E. Armstrong, Professor

    W. R. Dunstan, Mr. C. H. Bothamley, Mr. J. T. Cundall, and
    Mr. W. A. Shenstone (Secretary), appointed to investigate the

     Production of Haloids from Highly-purified Materials.

The investigation undertaken by this Committee, as has been previously

reported, has been greatly delayed by the difficulty experienced in their
attempts to obtain a supply of chlorine satisfactory, both as regards origin
and quality, for the work to be done.

     During the past year, however, the Secretary has succeeded in pre-
paring (by the electrolysis of silver chloride) a suitable supply of the
element in question.

   A full account of the method of obtaining chlorine from this

source, and of the experiments that have been made with it, has already
been pubHshed in the ' Journal of the Chemical Society of London.'
It is therefore only necessary to state that novel and stringent means

were taken to secure the dryness of all the materials employed in the
various experiments, and that advantage has been taken of the oppor-
tunity which has arisen to examine once more the behaviour of chlorine
in sunlight, and also its behaviour under the influence of the silent

discharge of electricity.

     The following is a summary of the chief results obtained :

     1. The introduction of a new source of highly-purified chlorine.
     2. The observation that highly-purified chlorine, after it had been
dried by new and very stringent methods, still interacted rapidly and
completely with specimens of highly-purified and carefully dried mercury
made by several diSerent methods.
     3. That highly-purified and carefully dried bromine reacts readily
and completely with purified mercury.

     ' 'Observations on the Properties of some Highly -purified Substances,' Trans.
Chem. Sic, 1897, by W. A. Shenstone.
296 REPORT-- 1897.

     4. That iodine purified by the ' Stas Method,* and carefully dried,
reacts readily and completely with purified mercury.

     It may be pointed out that these particular elements were selected
for examination because they are among those whose interactions have

not hitherto been found to be influenced by the presence or absence of
traces of water- vapour among the acting substances ; and because it was

thought that we are now at a stage at which it is more important to

re-examine actions belonging to this class, than to seek for fresh instances

of substances which cease to interact when highly dried.
      5. That highly -purified chlorine does not, like oxygen, undergo conden-

sation when submitted to silent discharge of electricity.
      6. That highly-purified chlorine is very little affected by exposure to

direct sunlight, but that it becomes more sensitive if rendered impure by
the adding of traces of moist air.

     7. It has been noticed incidentally that lead glass may be heated to

its softening point in well-dried chlorine, without showing any signs that

it has been attacked, although in the damp state this kind of glass is

readily attacked by chlorine.

   A8. new form of vacuum trap is described in the paper referred to.

     It is recommended that the Committee be not reappointed, as no
further pecuniary assistance is likely to be needed, and the work can now
be carried on by those who are engaged upon it without further corporate

action.

     A. Strahan, Dr. H. Woodward, and Dr. Traquair, appointed
     to stud;/ the Life Zones in the British Carbonifero%is Eoclcs. (Drawn
      up by Mr, Garwood.)

In consequence of the early date on which it is necessary to submit
reports, little work has been done this year up to the present time, bub it

is hoped that during the summer months progress may be made with the
work of the Committee, and collections may be obtained from localities of

special importance.

     At present a collector is engaged upon the fauna of the Millstone

Grit at Eccup, five miles north of Leeds, where a fossiliferous black shell
has been met with during the excavation of a puddle-trench for a reser-
voir. The bed occurs about the centre of the ' Middle Grits ' of the
Yorkshire Millstone Grits.

      The bed, which was discovered by Mr. Percy Kendall, some three
years ago, contains a rich Marine fauna, which has not yet, however, been
properly worked out. The fauna includes species of Nucula and Leda in
great abundance and in excellent preservation, also numerous individual
specimens of Lingula and Discina. Gasteropods occur, and a few speci-
mens of Goniatites, together with well-preserved specimens of Conularia.
      ON THE LIFE ZONES IN THE BRITISH CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS. 297

      Several specimens of Dithyrocaris have been found, and a single speci-

men of a minute Trilobite, cf. Brachymetopus Ouralicus. Fish remains

referable to two genera have been identified.
      The fauna appears to bear little resemblance to that of the Cayton

Gill beds of Nidderdale, which lie at approximately the same horizon in

the Millstone Grit.

     On the whole, the fauna appears to resemble in many points that of

the Ridsdale Ironstone shell of the Bernician beds of South Northumber-

land.

     The Committee hope that the information obtained from this deposit
will be of value, in consideration of the comparative neglect with which
the fauna of the Millstone Grit has hitherto been treated.

     Owing to the temporary nature of the e.xposure the Committee con-
(sidered it advisable to expend a considerable portion of the grant in
obtaining the services of a competent collector, who has spent a fortnight
in making as exhaustive a collection as possible from the locality, under
the superintendence of Mr. Percy Kendall. The accounts have not yet
however, come in, and the Committee cannot therefore at present draw
upon the grant generously placed at their disposal by the Association, but
ask that the sum granted may be carried over to next year. They also
ask that a similar sum may be granted for that year.

     The Secretary has been in correspondence with the various members of
the Committee as to the best methods of forwarding the objects of the
Committee. From many of these he has received valuable suggestions,
and it is hoped that reports will be furnished at an early date from each
of the members for special districts, giving detailed sections of the rocks
in their individual areas, and stating what reliable information has
already been collected regarding their fossil contents, and what yet

remains to be done in this connection.

As the expenses of the expedition were covered by the grants from funds
administered by the Royal Society, the sum of 40^., granted by the

Association at Liverpool, has not been drawn. But another expedition
has been already sent out from Sydney under the auspices of Professors
Anderson Stuart and Edgev/orth David and others, with machinery to
overcome the difficulties which wei'e fatal to the first attempt, and the
Committee ask that they may be reappointed, and that the grant made
last year, and not drawn, be renewed as a contribution to the expenses of
the new undertaking.

--Photographs of Geological interest in the United Kingdom. Eighth

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor James Geikie
     {Chairman), Professor T. G. Bonney, Dr. Tempest Anderson,
     Mr. J. E. Bedford, Mr. E. J. Garwood, Mr. J. G. Goodchild,
     Mr. William Gray, Mr. Robert Kidston, Mr. A. S. Reid,

    Mr. J. J. H. Teall, Mr. R. H. Tiddeman, Mr. H. B. Wood-
    ward Mr. F. WooLNOUGH, and Professor W. W. Watts {Secre-

     tary). {Brawn up by the Secretary.)

The Committee have the honour to report that during the past year 364 new

photographs have been received, bringing the total number in the collection

up to 1,751. The early date of this year's meeting has made it necessary

to close the lists earlier than usual, but in spite of this the number of new-

photographs considerably exceeds the number received in any previous

year, although there have only been nine months to collect in, and the

harvest of some of the best months will not be reaped till next year.

Adding to this large number 219 prints and 81 slides given to the

loan collection, the increment is more than double that of any former

year. As well as this, 27 prints have been sent to renew old ones, lost,

faded, or withdrawn. The total number thus reaches 691. Fifty-three

photographs and several duplicates have been received since this Report

was sent in, and will be acknowledged next year.

From the detailed list it will be seen that eight new counties are now

partially represented, and progress has been made in eleven others,

hitherto poorly represented. Amongst the more notable donations may

be mentioned a large series of views in Wealden strata by Dr. Abbott,

some very beautiful Nottingham photographs by Messrs. Burton, of

Leicester, a very instructive series from North Staffordshire by Mr.

Armstrong, a set from the Sgurr of Eigg by Dr. R. D. Roberts, a series

of Yorkshire caves by Mr. Cuttriss, sets from County Dublin, Yorkshire,

and the Isle of Man by Mr. Reynolds, and several interesting pictures

from North Devon and the Isle of Wight by Mr. F. Mason Good.

Professor Allen contributes a good series of Charnwood and Nottingham

views, Mr. Bingley sets from the Yorkshire Dales and North Wales,

Mr. St. J. Phillips a most useful group from North Ireland, and

Mr. Whitaker several valuable prints. Last, but not least, the Com-

mittee wish to give especial mention to the munificent gift by Mr. R.

Welch, of Belfast, of 100 new platinotypes, which are not only perfect in

the technical skill and the process employed, but artistic and pictorial as

well, while, from a strictly geological point of view, they are so good that

not one could be spared from the collection. In addition to this he has given

50 prints in previous years, and 25 duplicate prints and 7 slides this year.

For other valuable new additions to the collection, the Committee

have the pleasure of expressing their gratitude to those donors, too

numerous to mention here, whose names are given in list 1.

The usual summary follows. It is carefully corrected by reference to

the actual contents of the collection so as to show its exact state, and it

will be useful in indicating the places in which it is advisable to start new

Awork.  glance will show that there are many areas of great geological

interest in England, as well as in Scotland and Ireland, of which we have

at present no photographic survey. The Committee desire especially to

--draw attention to the following districts : Areas of large and typical

physical features, such as the Pennine and Pendle Ranges, the South Wales
coalfield and its borders, the district of the Arans, Arenigs, and Cader
Idris, the Harlech Mountains, the Yorkshire Dales, the Cotteswolds and
South Downs, the Malverns, and the Silurian ground of the Welsh border ;
the Yorkshire Moors, Lincolnshire, the area of the Northampton Oolites,
the Oxford district, Seaton and Blackdown, Central Wales, and Anglesey :

     In Scotland, the North-west and Central Highlands, the Outer
Hebrides, Mull, the Sidlaws and Ochil Hills, and the Southern Uplands :

     In Ireland, the Carlingford and SHeve Gallion areas, Kerry Cork, the

Limerick Basin, Waterford, and Wicklow.

302 REPORT-- 1897.

may be called the more sensational geological phenomena. What is now

rather more required is the steady surveying of ordinary, and especially

temporary, features and phenomena. Picked points on retreating and

advancing shore lines should be photographed at regular intervals

sections in variable deposits should be taken as the excavation of them

proceeds, and out-of-the-way districts sliould also be registered, even if

they only yield ordinary phenomena. Important as it is that fossils

should be accurately and faithfully figured, it is equally essential that

phenomena in the tield should be figured in a way that is not only

accurate, but includes, without accentuation, the interpretation of the in-

vestigator, while it registers facts which may have escaped his observation.

In order to glean copies of the original photographs used as the bases

for illustrations in papers and books, a circular has been furnished to

Editors of Geological publications, and by the kindness of the Societies

and their Editors these have been sent out to the contributors of papers

so illustrated. The plates and other illustrations published are, when

possible, mounted by the side of the original photographs, and yearly lists

are published in the Report (list 5). The Committee are indebted to the

Editors of the publications of the Geological Societies and Associations of

London, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cornwall, Yorkshire, Dublin, and

Belfast, and to the Editor of the ' Geological Magazine ' for help in this

connection.

Friendly notices of the work of the Committee have been published in

'Nature,' 'Science Gossip,' several photographic journals, the 'Standard,'

the 'Irish Naturalist,' the 'Transactions of the Woolhope Club,' and

elsewhere                                         while an illustrated paper on the subject was published in the
                                               ;

'Practical Photographer' for April 1897; and another, illustrated by

reproductions of photographs kindly lent for the purpose by Miss Andrews,

Mr. Bingley, and Mr. Garwood, was published by the Secretary in the

Afirst three numbers of the 'Geological Magazine' for 1897.  short

paper on the subject was also read by the Secretary to the South-Eastern

Union of Natural History Societies in 1896. Prizes have been offered by

the publishers of the ' Practical Photographer ' for specimen local surveys,

including the geological phenomena of a particular district. Albums

containing recent additions to the Collection have been exhibited at the

Royal Institution, the Geological Society, and the Geologists' Association.

The results of these efforts have been gratifying in several directions.

Photographic surveys have been started in Bolton and Devon ; each

of these includes geological work. The following Clubs and Societies have

--definitely undertaken to photograph in their own districts The North

Staffordshire Naturalists' Field Club, the University of Durham Philo-

sophical Society, the Woolhope Field Club, the Dublin Field Club, and the

Burton Natural History Society. From these sources valuable results

have already accrued, and further work may be confidently looked forward

to next year.

Much labour has been expended in getting the collection into thorough

order, and it is hoped that the greater part of this work is now satis-

factorily accomplished. All mounted photographs, to the number of

about 1,700, are accessible for reference in the Library of the Museum of

Practical Geology at 28 Jermyn Street, S.W., where they can be inspected

on application to the Librarian. They are classified geographically and

so arranged that their contents can be expanded as new photographs are

received. In addition to the mounting of most of the photographs

received during the last thi'ee years it has been necessary to unmount and

remount on standard, interchangeable, guarded mounts over 500 of the

older photographs. Considering the risk involved in this work, but little

real damage has been done to the prints, and the majority have come

through the ordeal unscathed, while not one has been irretrievably

damaged. Many of the descriptive forms have been rewritten and

expanded, and a large number which had been lost or never sent in have

been written up. The localities of all but two of the photographs in

the collection have been accurately ascertained, though there was in some

cases no written clue to them. Many photographs have been critically

examined, and additional points of interest in them have been discovered

and explained on the mounts or forms. The Committee express their thanks

to Mr. Strahan, Mi*. Lamplugh, Mr. Gibson, Mr. Leighton, Mr. Nichols,

Mr. Watson, Mr. Welch, Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Shipman, Mr. De Ranee,

Mr. Woodward, Mr. Goodchild, Mr. Brook, Mr. Hunt, and several others

for services in this direction. References to published descriptions and

plates are being filled up wherever possible. In many cases it has been dis-

covered that the photographs are beginning to possess a special interest

from the change or disappearance of the objects photographed. Thus the

pump at Marino, Co. Down, has been washed away, and there are photo-

graphs of Shakespeare Cliff before the landslip, to compare with those

taken since, and a print of Eccles Tower, free from sand dunes, before it

fell. On the other hand, the Carboniferous Forest shown in Photographs

33, 34, 35, and 939 has now been carefully protected by a building. The

beautiful section (972) showing a chalk cliff and screes buried under

Tertiary Basalt has been quarried away.

Concurrently with the rearrangement a card catalogue of the whole

collection has been made, and this is so arranged as to minimise the future

labour of registering new photographs, while at the same time it secures a

ready means of recording localities and particulars with accui'acy. The

cards are used for acknowledgment to donors, who can thus correct

Athe particulars to be finally entered in the published lists.  county list

and an abbreviated numerical list have also been written, and for the first

time it has been possible to check the whole contents of the collection.

This has shown that, in spite of the difficulties of keeping a large set of

unmounted and miscellaneously mounted prints, only 3 per cent, of those

registered in the published list were not to be found, a i-esult which

reflects much credit on the care exercised by the former Secretary,

Mr. Jeffs. Quite 1, and perhaps 2, per cent, of this apparent loss is due

to clerical errors in entering contributions in the published lists before

they had been actually received ; the other 1 per cent, seems to represent
actual loss, but this is to some extent compensated by the finding of

photographs which had not been registered in the printed lists. The

good nature of the majority of the donors of the best photographs has

·enabled the Committee to make good almost all photographs of real

geological value, and at the present time not more than sixteen of the

photographs registered in the published lists are absent from the collec-
tion. The numbers of the prints which cannot be found or replaced have

been applied to new photographs received within the year, and thus the
numbering represents with fair accuracy the actual state of the whole

collection ; numbers below 1,400 in the list (No. 1) are those which have

been thus transferred, and any photographs which may be attached to
304 KEPORT-- 1897.

such numbers in previous lists must now be finally cancelled, as the

Secretary has failed to recover them, or else they have never actually

been in the collection. With some of these numbers it will be noticed

that no photograph has ever been associated.

     The Committee desire to express their warmest thanks to those donors
who have so kindly enabled them to bring the collection into a perfect

state up to date. The following names should be mentioned with thanks :
Mr. Stewart, Mr. Detieux, Mr. Bingley, Miss Andrews, Dr. Stolterfoth,

Mr. Brook, and Mr. Welch.

List No. 2 comprises lost photographs which have been renewed, and

List No. 3 is necessitated by the slight confusion which has occurred in

connection with the supply of missing photographs and the filling of gaps.

Here, again, many of the original donors have given help ; their names

are mentioned with thanks in this list.

Certain Scientific Societies have been in the habit of issuing specially

taken photographs to their members, and several of them have sent sets

to the Committee in past time. An effort has been made to make these

sets more perfect, and the Societies in question have given ready help.
The Yorkshire Geological and Polytechnic Society and the Liverpool

Geological Society, for example, have overhauled the list and promised to

contribute such of their prints as are still to be got to complete our set.

     The Secretary will be very pleased to receive help from geologists in

annexing fuller and more accurate descriptions of the geological features

to the photographs, in order that they may become of the utmost use as a

work of reference. He will also welcome corrections and additional

information from those who inspect the collection. Several persons

anxious to obtain examples to illustrate both geological and geographical
phenomena have visited the collection, and to more than one it has been

found of much use for the purpose ; as it becomes larger and more repre-

sentative it must become increasingly important and useful in this respect.
The Committee will welcome suggestions as to the best method by which

eventually it may be possible to enable those interested in such things to

obtain reproductions or prints without imposing a strain on the time and

good-nature of willing contributors.

It has long been evident that, while it is essential that the main

collection should be permanently lodged at a central place where it can be

used for reference, it would be a great advantage if some portion of

it could be allowed to circulate amongst geological and photographic

Societies, in order that the kind of work necessary and its utility might
be made obvious to those bodies and persons likely to take it in hand.
For this purpose the best thing appeared to be the formation of a duplicate

loan collection selected from the best and most typical photographs in the

Amain collection and arranged geologically.   few duplicates found in the

collection have been set aside for this purpose, and an appeal has been
made to contributors to give prints or slides of those photographs most

suitable for the purpose. To this appeal there has been a most liberal

response, and a loan collection has been inaugurated. It now numbers

219 prints and 81 slides, of which a separate classified list is annexed
A(No. 4).
           description will be written to serve as an account of the

slides or as labels for the prints, and the two parts of the loan collection

will be ready for circulation amongst such Societies and Clubs as are pre-

pared to pay the expenses of packing and carriage, and to make good any

damage. The Secretary will be glad to receive early application from

Societies wishing to avail themselves of the offer of this loan, that arrange-

ments may be made in good time.

The plaotographs in this selected series are naturally of the kind which

would be most useful to those who wish to obtain typical examples for

teaching purposes or for exhibition in illustration of papers ; and there-

fore, whenever it has been possible to arrange it, an address is given

whence prints or slides mny be purchased. But it must be distinctly

understood that the Committee can undertake no responsibility or corre-

AHspondence in this matter.  information possible will be circulated

with the collection, and there the Committee's work must end ; would-be

purchasers must make their own arrangements with photographers, in
whom exclusively the copyright remains vested.

The Committee, in forming this collection, are much indebted to the

donors whose names are mentioned at the end of List 4, and particularly

to Mr. Bingley (who has given 39 prints and 23 slides) Mr. Welch (25 and
7), Mr. Goodchild (17), Mr. Nichols, Mr. Watson, Mr. DeEeux, Mr.

Armstrong, Miss M. K. Andrews, and Captain McDakin.

The Secretary will be grateful if the donors of photographs will

kindly look through the parts of the lists in which they are interested
and notify to him any slips in the spelling of proper names, in the

geographical or geological descriptions, or mistakes of any other kind
which occur in the Report.

     The Committee recognise that their work is yet far from completion,
and they therefore ask for their reappointment with a small grant to
defray some of the expenses connected with the mounting, storing, and

collection of photographs.

         EIGHTH LIST OF GEOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHS

                            (to June 1897).

  --Note. This list contains the subjects of geological photographs

copies of which have been received by the Secretary of the Committee

since the publication of the last Report. Photographers are asked to
affix the registered numbers, as given below, to their negatives for con-

venience of future reference. Their own numbers, where given, are
added, in the same order, to enable them to do so.

     Copies of photographs desired can, in most instances, be obtained
from the L^h jtographer direct, or from the officers of the Local Society
under whoso auspices the views were taken.

    The price at which copies may be obtained depends on the size of the

print and on local circumstances, over which the Committee have no

control.

     The Committee find it necessary to reiterate the fact that they do not
assume the copyright of any photogra])hs included in this list. Inquiries
respecting photographs, and applications for permission to reproduce
them, should not be addressed to the Committee, but to the photographers

direct.

The very best photographs lose half their utility, and all their value

as documentary evidence, unless accurately described ; and the Secretary

would be grateful if, wherever possible, such explanatory details as can

Ascription would tliereby be saved.

can be recognised should be written on the back of the photograph and on

the top right-hand corner of the form.

Copies of photographs should be sent unmounted to W. W. Watts,

Mason College, Birmingham, and forms may be obtained from him.

The size of photographs is indicated as follows :

       L = Lantern size.                     1/1= Whole plate.

       1/4 - Quarter-plate.                  10/8 = 10 inches by 8.

       1/2 = Half-plate.                     12/10 = 12 inches bj- 10, &c.

                             E signifies Enlargements.

* indicates that photographs and slides may be purchased from the donors.

--Cretaceous Fossils in Aberdeenshire. Report of the Committee, consisting

     oj T. F. Jamieson (Chairman), A. J. Jukes Browne, awl John
     Milne (Secretary), appointed to ascertain the Age and Relation of

      the Rocks in which Secondary Fossils have been found near Moreseat,

       Aberdeenshire.

--Appendix. On the Fossils collected at Moreseat, ly A. J. Jcjkes Browne, page 337

Moreseat is in the parish of Cruden, in the east of Abei'deenshire. It

lies at an elevation of 300 feet above sea-level, and the surface of the

ground slopes to the sea at Cruden Bay, distant five miles to the south.

On the north the ground rises gradually, reaching the height of 4.50 feet

above sea in Torhendry Ridge, which is strewn with chalk-flints in great

abundance.

   --Previous Investigations. Geologists are indebted to Dr. William

Ferguson of Kinmundy for the earliest notices of Greensand at Moreseat.

In 1839 an excavation 9 feet deep was made for the water-wheel of a mill,
and a drain away from it, on the south side of the farm steading, a little below

the 300-feet lerel. The excavation was made in clay, and in it were
found layers of sandstone containing many fossils. The Rev. J. Johnstone,
Belhelvie, who lived at Moreseat at the time, says that the discovery excited

great interest, and that Moreseat was visited by scientific men, amongst

others by Professor Knight of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen,
who communicated with Dr. Thomson of Glasgow University on the

subject, and informed his class of 1839-40 that Greensand had been

discovered at Moreseat. Dr. Ferguson was a student in this class, and

thus had his attention directed to the Moreseat fossils from the first.

Hundreds of loads of clay were removed from the excavation, and many

fossils were collected ; but when the wheel was put in and built up, and

the drain was covered up, there remained no trace of the interesting

discovery.

In 1849, on making a deep ditch alongside a road to the north of the

farm steading, and a little above the 300-feet level, the same clay, sand-

stone, and fossils were met with. Dr. Ferguson sent a notice to the

Philosophical Society of Glasgow.' Next year he visited the newly -made

ditch, and sent an account of the original discovery and a description of
what he saw to the ' Philosophical Magazine.' ^ Dr. Ferguson's description

of what he saw is quoted here, because it exactly coincides with what was

Anseen in subsequent excavations. '  excavation about 7 feet in depth

was made, and the section presented irregular layers of unctuous clay, of

a dark brown colour and soapy feel, and so tough and adhesive as to render

it a work of considerable labour to dig it out. Interstratified with this

clay were thin layers of a compact sandstone. These layers of sandstone

were not continuous ; they graduated into each other, thinned out, dis-

appeared, and reappeared most confusedly. They were very much inclined,

dipping towards the south. The whole mass had much the appearance of

having been drifted ; although from the nature of the matrix, and the
state of preservation in which the shells were found, it did not appear as

if it could have been drifted far. The sandstone was tough and soft when

334 REPORT-- 1897.

newly dug, but hardened on exposure to the air and became light-coloured

in drying. When wet, it presented a mottled appearance, the colour being

greenish ; when dry, this almost disappeared.'
     In 1856 a collection of fossils from Moreseat, made by Dr. Ferguson,

was examined by Mr. J. W. Salter, of the Museum of Practical Geology,

Jermyn Street, London, and Mr. "W. H. Baily ; and a list of twenty
specimens named by them was presented to the Geological Society of
London, and published next year in the Quarterly Journal of the Society,
along with a note by Dr. Ferguson. Types of these fossils ai'e preserved in
the Museum. Mr. Salter regarded the Moreseat fossils as an indication,
in the near neighbourhood, of Upper Greensand in sitti.

     In the memoir descriptive of the sheet of the Geological Survey con-
taining Moreseat, notice is taken of the Greensand fossils found there,

and of the Chalk-flint fossils found at Bogingarrie, a few miles to the south-
west, also described by Mr. Salter ; but the surveyor does not say that he
saw at Moreseat any fossils or fragments of Greensand sandstone.

     In 1894 the Secretary of the Committee was lecturing at Cruden on
Geology and Agriculture for Aberdeen County Council, and was induced
by the mention of Greensand in the memoir to visit Moreseat and make
inquiries ; but he could learn nothing further than that fossils had been
found in the excavation made for the mill-wheel, and as it was enclosed

with masonry nothing could be seen. He visited the place repeatedly and

examined all the ditches and watercourses on the farm, but found no

fossils.

    The reason of this was seen afterwards. When pieces of the sand-

stone were exposed to frost they became a soft paste on thawing, and all

trace of the fossils they contained disappeared. He afterwards met with

Mr. Alexander Insch, Peterhead, who has made a collection of Chalk-flint

fossils found on the ridge running south-west from Buchanness, and who

had heard that fossils had been found north of the farm steading. Ac-

companied by him and Mr. D. J. Mitchell, Blackhills, Peterhead, he again

visited Moreseat. An excavation was made to the north of the ditch seen

by Dr. Ferguson, and after passing through a foot or eighteen inches of

sandy clay, thin layers of sandstone with fossils were found. The appear-

ance of the layers of sandstone was peculiar. They conveyed the idea that

they were cakes of some plastic material spread out in a soft state, yet

not wet enough to bear great lateral extension without cracking. The

layers were full of vertical cracks, which broke them up into small frag-

ments. These might have been caused by shrinking on drying, as the

excavation was made where the ground would be dry in summer. The

method of occurrence was the same as that described by Dr. Ferguson

already quoted. The fossils found were chiefly shells and spines.

Specimens were forwarded to the British Association with an appli-

cation for a grant of money to ascertain by deeper excavation whether

the bed from which the sandstone had come could be found there. Though

the application was unsuccessful, digging was continued by Messrs. Mit-

chell and Insch, who collected a large quantity of fossils in various places,

over an area a quarter of a mile broad, in the neighbourhood of Moreseat.

In 1895 specimens were sent to Dr. H. Woodward, of the Natural

History Museum, London, with another application for a grant from the

ABritish Association.  grant of 10/. was given, and the Committee already

named Avas appointed.

was consulted about the specimens already collected by Messrs. Mitchell
and Insch, and by his advice they were sent to the Geological Survey Office,
where they were examined and compared with Dr. Ferguson's typical
specimens by Mr. G. Sharman and Mr. E. T. Newton. They published a
statement of the result of their examination in the ' Geological Magazine '
in June 1896. They came to the conclusion that the specimens had
' been derived from beds where a large part of the Cretaceous series of
strata occurs ; not only Upper and Lower Chalk, and Upper Greensand
as pointed out by Salter, but also beds of Lower Greensand or Speeton
Clay age.' In making this statement they seem to have referred not only
to the specimens collected by Messrs. Mitchell and Insch, but also to the

Chalk-flint specimens in the Ferguson collection. It may therefore be

noted that though flints are found in great abundance on the ridge above
Moreseat, they become fewer in going down the hill-side, and are compara-

tively scarce at Moreseat, and it may be assumed that none of the flint-

fossils in the Ferguson collection were found in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the Greensand fossils.

   --Work of the Committee. On being made aware of their appointment

the Chairman and the Secretary met on the ground, accompanied by
Messrs. Mitchell and Insch ; Dr. Ferguson unfortunately was unable to
be present. Mr. Johnstone, the proprietor of the farm, kindly consented
to allow an excavation to be made. All the places where fossils had been
found were examined, and it was resolved to sink a shaft at the highest
place where they were certainly known to be, in the belief that the frag-
ments of sandstone had been moved from a higher to a lower level. The
place selected is on a knoll north of Moreseat, about 330 feet above the
sea-level, and about a quarter of a mile from the place where fossils were
found in 1839. The ground to the north is covered with peat-moss over-
grown with heather, and nothing can be seen of its character. Half a
mile to the north-east there is some cultivated land, and a pit had been
sunk by a crofter for a pump in white unstratified siliceous matter, appa-
rently detritus of chalk-flints. To the north-west another pit had been
dug. At first glacial drift clay was met with, then fine stratified sand,
unsuitable for a pump-well, and the excavation was stopped at 14 feet
deep. This hole was 50 feet above the site selected for the shaft. It was
thought best to defer the sinking of the shaft till the following summer
to avoid risk of obstruction from water.

     Mr. J. T. Tocher, the Secretary of the Buchan Field Club, which is

affiliated to the British Association, undertook to contract for the work,
and along with Mr. Mitchell to visit it while in pi'ogress, and to examine

the material excavated.

     The shaft was dug in the summer of 1896, and a depth of 30 feet was
attained. The first foot consisted of ordinary soil. Below it was found
a yellowish-brown sandy clay mixed with small fragments of sandstone
and pebbles of quartzite and flint. The sandstone was afterwards found
to be composed of Quartz, Mica, Glauconite,' and Colloid Silica, and it
may be termed Glauconitic Sandstone. Almost every fragment yielded
fossils, mostly small shells. At 3 feet the clay became finer and the
sandstone fragments more abundant. At 4 feet they were in layers
among the clay, gradually thinning out and disappearing, as described by
Dr. Ferguson. At 5 feet, on the south side of the shaft, a deposit of fine

Round grains                                                                                              light green ;  chemical composition,

white sand was found, in which were pebbles of granite, quartzite, and
flint. In the other part of the shaft the clay continued, with numerous
bits of the grey glauconitic sandstone in a layer, much broken, dipping to
the south, which is the direction of the slope of the surface of the ground
at Moreseat. The mass of sand increased down to 8 feet, where it ended.

At the bottom of the sand there was a block of granite a foot in diameter,
and under it a large flint pebble. At 10 feet there was, on one side, a,
mass of black clay with a soapy feel, in which sandstone fragments, much
worn, were found. This black clay stopped at 11 feet. At 14 feet it

began to appear again, and to take the place of the yellowish-brown clay,

which ended at 16 feet. The lower part of it contained many stones.
From this level the black clay continued all the way down to 30 feet,

where it was succeeded by red laminated clay, without stones of any kind.
The black clay contained large stones of granite and quartzite and small
fragments of the glauconitic sandstone all the way, but the stones grew
fewer in number the deeper the shaft was sunk, and the sandstone frag-
ments had almost ceased at 27 feet. The excavation could not be carried
farther than 30 feet, because, on reaching the red laminated clay, water
began to come in, and the funds were exhausted.

     The Committee regret that they were unable to ascertain the nature
of the solid rock under the shaft. Most likely it would have been found
to be granite, the rock seen at the sea- coast from Cruden Bay to Peterhead.
The shaft was evidently in glacial drift clay all the way, and therefore tlie
sandstone fragments were not in situ, but had been transported, apparently

from the north. By a series of pits a few feet deep made in this direction

it might be possible to follow the sandstone fragments farther up the hill,
and a shaft sunk at the uppermost place Avhere they could be found might
discover the bed from which they came yet the Committee cannot ven-

                                                                                                                                                                   ;

ture to express a confident opinion that another excavation would be more
successful than the last in finding the origin of the Glauconitic Sandstone.

Many appearances indicate that the latest changes on the surface of the

ground in the district in which Moreseat is situated were caused by local
glacial sheets, perhaps not on a great scale, yet capable of moving great
quantities of loose and soft matter. The white sand in the shaft seemed
to have been moved bodily from a bed seen to the north-west at a higher

level. The original seat of the Glauconitic Sandstone may have been to
the north of the shaft, a little farther up the hill, and yet the bed may

have been entirely removed by ice descending the hill. If, however, the
British Association renew the grant, the Committee will be happy to
make another attempt to find the origin of the Moreseat fossils. Some of
the gentlemen who have aided in the work might be added to the Com-

mittee.

     Mr. Tocher, F.I.C., analysed the clays found in the shaft, and ascer-
tained that the reddish colour of the one was due to ferric iron, and the
black colour of the other to ferrous iron. There is at Aldie, about a mile

from Moreseat, a band of very black igneous rock. There may be also

some of it above Moreseat, concealed by superficial drifts, and if so it
would account for the colour of the black clay.

     Mr. Insch collected a large quantity of sandstone fragments containing
fossils. These were examined by Mr. A. J. Jukes Browne, and will

ultimately be deposited in a museum in Aberdeen for preservation.
Mr. Jukes Browne is of opinion that the sandstone was a deposit made in

clear water of a moderate depth, not far from land, and that the fossils in

       APPENDIX.

Rejiort on a Collection of Fossils from Moreseat, Aberdeen,

            By A. J. JuKKs Browne, B.A., F.G.S.

     The existence of Cretaceous fossils, embedded in a kind of ' Green-
sand,' and found at Moreseat, near Aberdeen, has been known to

geologists for nearly fifty years. Mr. W. Ferguson discussed them in a

paper read before the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1849, and
subsequently communicated to the ' Philosophical Magazine.' ' In this

he observes that most of the remains are casts, and he mentions the

occurrence of several species of Ammonites and Belemnites, as also of
Cardium, Terehratula, Trochus, Solarium, Cerithium, and Spatangus.

     Some of Mr. Ferguson's fossils were examined and named oy

Mr. J. W. Salter in 1857,^ who gave a list of fourteen species, two of
them being Ammonites doubtfully referred to Am. Selliguinus, Brong.,
and Am. I'ailletianus, d'Orb. Four of the others he describes as new

species, and from the remaining six he comes to the conclusion that the
fauna is of Upper Greensand age.

     From 1857 to 1896 no further light was thrown on the subject, but in
the latter year some of the fossils collected by Messrs. Mitchell and Insch
M'ere submitted to Messrs. Sharman and Newton, who made a careful
examination of them, and communicated the results to the 'Geological
Magazine.' ^ They compared these fossils with the specimens described by
Salter, which are preserved in the Museum of Practical Geology, and
found the matrix to be the same. They also state that though slight

differences are noticeable in different pieces of the rock, yet all the samples

are ' so similar that one can scarcely question their having been originally
derived from the same bed.'

     They found, however, that many of the fossils could not be identified
with any Upper Greensand species, but were Lower Cretaceous forms,
many of them identical with those occurring in the Speeton Clay. They
admitted, however, a few species which occur in the Upper Cretaceous
series only, and have not been found in any British Lower Cretaceous
deposit. Hence they conclude ' that the faunas which in the south mark
the distinct horizons of Lower Greensand, Gault, and Upper Greensand

are here in Aberdeenshire included in one bed of nearly uniform character

throughout.' This conclusion certainly invested the Moreseat fossils with
still greater interest than they possessed before.

   A collection of the fossils was sent to me by the Rev. John Milne in

September 1896, but it was impossible for me to examine them in time to

report on them before the meeting of the British Association in that year.
I have since, however, given them careful attention, and have received
much assistance from Messrs. Sharman and Newton, whose previous

acquaintance with many of the species has saved me much time and

labour.

     It is not an easy task to identify these Moreseat fossils, for they are

 all in the state of casts and impressions. In no case does any actual shell
 or test remain, but the firmness of the rock has in most cases prevented
 the enveloping matrix from being pressed down on to the internal cast, so
 that the external cover generally retains the shape and impression of the
 original shell, and a mould can, if necessary, be taken from it. The
 fossils had been carefully collected, and as both casts and covers had been

 transmitted, it has been possible to determine many of the species.

       Before discussing the species, however, the rock itself merits descrip-
 tion, for its peculiar characters seem to have escaped previous observers.

 To the eye it presents itself as a very fine-grained siliceous rock, resem-
bling malmstone, dark grey when damp and freshly broken, drying to a
 lighter grey. Fractured surfaces often show spots and patches of darker
material than the rest of the mass. Under the lens it showed a finely-
granular matrix, containing many small grains of glauconite, and numerous

 flakes of mica, with small patches of a yellowish-green mineral which is

 apparently a decomposition product.

     The general aspect and light specific gravity of the rock led me to

 suspect the presence of colloid silica, and accordingly I sent specimens to

Mr. W. Hill, F.G.S., for microscopical examination. Mr. Hill cut slices

--from two of these, and furnishes me with the following account of the

structure exhibited by them : 'The material of both slides is alike, and
compares most nearly with the micaceous sandstone of Devizes (Upper
Greensand). The ground mass consists of amorphous and semi-granular
silica, neutral to polarised light, with little or no calcite. There ai'e

many sponge spicules, the walls of which have mostly disappeared, but

which are outlined in the matrix. The space once occupied by the spicule
is often partly filled with globules of colloid silica, like those described
by Dr. Hinde in malmstone, and similar globules are dispersed through
the mass of the rock. There is much quartz sand in small, angular, even-
sized grains, but not so much as in Devizes sandstone. Glauconite grains
are also abundant, but the quantity varies much in difierent parts of the
rock ; the grains seem to be breaking up, and are often seamed with vein-
like markings. There are also larger patches of dirty-green material,

which has a somewhat indefinite outline, and may be of secondary forma-

tion. Small flakes of mica are scattered through the slides, but it is only

when these are cut transversely that the mineral can be easily identified.'
     From the above description it will be seen that the rock may be

--termed a gaize that is, a fine-grained sandstone, in which colloid silica is

an important ingredient ; this is not a common rock, and in England it is
only known as occurring in the Upper Greensand in association with
malmstone. In France a gaize of Lower Gault age, containing Ammonites

mammillaius and Ajn. interruptus, occurs in the Ardennes (Draize), but I
can find no record of the rock occurring in the Lower Cretaceous series
either in France or Germany.

     The formation of gaize and malmstone probably took place in clear
water of a moderate depth ; it is not a shallow water deposit, and yet it
was deposited within the range of a current which carried fine sand. The
abundance of sponge spicules shows that the conditions were such as to
favour the growth of siliceous sponges.

                               Remarks on some of the Fossils.

    The collection sent to me includes some species which have not

yet been recorded from the Moreseat rock, and as these are all Lower
                             ON THE CRETACEOUS FOSSILS IN ABERDEENSHIRE.      339

--Cretaceous forms, the Vectian element in the fauna is clearly very strong
   so strong indeed that I am led to doubt the existence of some of the Upper

Cretaceous species which have been supposed to occur. I therefore offer
some remarks on certain species, and give a complete revised list of the
Moreseat fauna, so far as it is at present known.

--Micrabacia coronida, Goldf. This identification requires confirmation.

It depends solely on Salter's authority, for tlie specimen he saw is not in
the Jermyn Street Museum, and no other specimen has been detected in

the collections recently made. The species is not known to occur below
the Upper Greensand (zone of Pecten asper), and would be difficult to recog-

nise from a cast only.

   --Echinoconus castanea, Brong. This also requires confirmation, for the

specimen so named by Mr. Salter has not been found at Jermyn Street,
and no other example has been seen. In England its earliest appearance

is near the top of the Upper Greensand, but in Switzerland it ranges down

to the base of the Gault (see de Loriol in Echinologie Helvetique), so

that it may in some localities range even lower. No species of Echino-

conus, however, has yet been recorded from rocks of Lower Cretaceous

age.

   --Discoidea decorata{1), Desor. This specimen was among those sent by

Mr. Milne. It consists of a nearly perfect external mould in two parts.

It differs from D. subucidus in having close-set rows of nearly even-sized

tubercles ; eight rows on the interambulacral areas, four on each set of

plates                       and  four rows on the ambulacral areas,  but the two inner rows do
                          ;

not reach either to the apex or to the peristome. The mouth and vent

are both rather large. In these respects it agrees with D. decorata.

Mr. C. J. A. Meyer having informed me that he possessed specimens

of a Discoidea from the Vectian of Hythe, the Moreseat specimen was

sent to him for comparison. He reports that it agrees with those from

Hythe, but he is doubtful whether they are referable to J), decorata, Desor,

--or D. macropyga, Ag. Both are Lower Cretaceous species.
     Bhyncho7iella comjyressa. The specimen so named by Salter is at
Jermyn Street, and has been examined again by Messrs. Sharman and

Newton, with the result that they think it is only a compressed variety of

Rh. sulcata.

   --Waldheimia faha, d'Orb. (non Sow.). This being only a cast and the

shell being smooth, one cannot be quite sure of the species, but the shape

is well preserved, and I am indebted to Mr. Meyer for pointing out that

it has the squareness toward the front which is characteristic of the species

in question. This is well shown in the example figured by Davidson

('Cret. Brach.' Vol. iv., PI. vi., f. 12-14), which came from the Speeton

Clay of Knapton in Yorkshire.

  --Lima semisulcata, Sow. This species has appeared in previous lists

on the authority of Mr. Salter, but the specimen is in the Jermyn Street

Museum, and Mr. Newton informs me that it is only an internal cast, and

may, with equal probability, be referred to L. Dupiniana. As specimens

of the latter do occur, and none referable to L. semisulcata have since been

found, I think this Upper Cretaceous species may be omitted from

the list.

  --Area securis, d'Orb. I have ventured to enter the common Area of

the Moreseat sandstone under the name of securis instead of under cari-

nata, because the specimens I have examined seem to me to come neai-er

                                                                          z2

to securis, and Mr. Meyer, to whom a specimen was sent, is of the same

opinion. The two species are so closely allied that some palseontologists
regard them as identical ; but there are slight differences, and Messrs.

Sharman and Newton agree with me in considering the Moreseat speci-

mens to be smaller and shallower in the valve than the ordinary A. cari-
nata of the Upper Greensand ; and in these respects they resemble
A. securis. In some of them, moreover, the ribs on the posterior area are

like those in d'Orbigny's hgure of securis ; so that, if the forms are sepa-
rable, I think these should be listed as securis.

     Leda scapha (?), d'Orb.--I have seen two casts which probably belong
to this species, though they equally resemble L. Marice of the Gault, for,
as Mr. Gardner has remarked, there is very little difference between these

--species.
     Pectunculus umbonatus, Sow. This is another of Mr. Salter's identi-
fications, and unfortunately it also is only an internal cast. There are
several species of Pectunculus to which such a cast might belong, but the

probabilities are against its being P. umbonatus. As no other specimen
has occurred among the fossils recently collected, it will be best to leave

--it without a specific name for the present.
      Turbo, like Goupilianus, d'Orb. There is one specimen, a portion of

the external impression of the shell, showing an ornamentation resembling
that of Turbo G'oupiliamis, which is a Cenomanian species. This speci-

men, however, was sent to Mr. Meyer, who informs me that he has an
imperfect specimen from the Vectian of the Isle of Wight which it equally

resembles.
   --AAmmonites jlexisulcatus (?), d'Orb.
                                           small Ammonite was found in

breaking up a lump of the material sent to me, and was forwarded, with

other specimens, to Messrs. Sharman and Newton. They reported that it

most resembles A. Jlexisulcatus, though the portion preserved is smootli

and without sulcations.

   --Nautilus sp.. Sow. Among the fossils sent me by Mr. Milne is the

cast of a Nautilus, badly preserved, but showing strong transverse rugations

or ribs like those of N. radiatus, but its condition is such as to prevent
any certainty of identification. Mr. A. H. Fooi'd has kindly examined the

specimen, but could not venture to name it.

342 EEPORT-- 1897.

     It only remains to indicate the conclusion to which the study of the
Moreseat fossils has led me.

     Of the species enumerated by Mr. Salter in 1857 four have been

omitted from the preceding list, being regarded as doubtful identifications

which have not been confirmed by subsequent discoveries. Of the three
genera of Echinoderms mentioned by him the Discoidea was probably the
species which resembles D. decorata, and the two named respectively

Diadema and Ananchytes may have been Lower Greensand forms for
anything that we know to the contrary.

     The number of named species available for comparison with other
faunas is now 32. Out of this total no fewer than 24 are species of Lower
Cretaceous age, and only 6 of these range into the Gault ; 5 are species
which have not been found elsewhere, 2 are Upper Greensand species, but
1 of these is a doubtful determination, and 1 is an Ammonite, of which the

identification is also doubtful. There is therefore an overwhelming pro-
portion of exclusively Lower Cretaceous species, namely, 18 to 2, while out
of the 6 Cephalopods 5 are exclusively Lower Cretaceous forms, the only
one which is not being the very doubtful Am. selliguinus.

     The occurrence of one Upper Greensand echinoderm {Echinocyjihus
difficilis), and the possible occurrence of another ranging from Lower

Gault to Chalk (Echinoconus castanea (?) ) is hardly sufficient evidence to
warrant the conclusion that a part of the rock-mass was of Upper Green-

sand age. There is nothing except the possible Am. selliguinus that is

--specially characteristic of the Gault, and the question then arises, what is

the evidential value of the occurrence of Echinocyphus difficilis, and possibly

also of Echinoconus castanea ? I think it may be answered in this way :

it is more reasonable to suppose that these two species, or forms very closely
allied to them, date really from Lower Cretaceous times, than it is to
suppose the deposition of exactly the same kind of rock material should

have continued at any one place from the time of the Lower G reensand to
that of the Upper Greensand. In other words, I believe that the rock-

mass from which the Moreseat fossils have been derived was entirely a
Lower Cretaceous rock, but high in that series, and corresponding approxi-
mately to the Aptien stage of France, and to the Lower Greensand or
Vectian of the Isle of Wisht.

--Siyujapore Caves. Interim Reiiort of the Committee, consisting of Sir

    W. H. Flower {Chairman), Mr. H. N. Eidley (Secretary), Dr.

     E. Hanitsch, Mr. Clement Reid, ami Dr. A. Russel Wallace,

     appointed to explore certain caves near Singapore, and to collect their
     living and extinct Fauna.

The Committee has received from Mr. Ridley an account of a preliminary

examination of the caves of Kwala Sum pur, and also notes on the animafc
now inhabiting them. At the time of wi-iting Mr. Ridley expected soon

to be able to pay another visit, and to use gunpowder to break up the

Amassive stalagmite.  first attempt to explore the cave deposits was not

successful, as dynamite was used and proved unsuitable for the purpose.

It will perhaps be better to reserve an account of the living cave fauna

till fuller collections have been made and the specimens have all been

determined. The Committee asks for re-appointment and the renewal of

the unexpended balance of the grant.

--§ I. 1889-1892. Anomalous Silurian Phyllopods (?) from Germany and

America. In the ' Sitz.-Ber. Gesell. naturf. Freunde zu Berlin,' 1890,
p. 28, Dr. A. Krause described a small fossil carapace of doubtful alliance,
but possibly related to the Phyllopods, from the North-German gravel of
Scandinavian Beyrichia-limestone (Upper Silurian). In the 'Zeitsch.
Deutsch. Geol. Gesell.,' vol. xliv, 1892, p. 397, pi. xxii., figs. 19 ct-c. Dr.
A. Krause redescribed and figured this anomalous little fossil.

     Its lateral moieties are not free, separate valves, but united by an
antero-dorsal suture for a third of its length, and by an antero-ventral
suture for half of its length, the posterior region remaining open at the
edges. It also shows in front a round apertui-e, with a sulcus formed by
the somewhat inverted edges below it. The test is nearly oval and com-
pressed ; thickest and subacute in front ; bearing a small, low, subcentral
swelling. The surface has some reticulate ornament along the margins
for the most part, succeeded by linear, radiating, and concentric sculpture

towards the more convex area, which is finely punctate. It is 6 mm.
long, 4 mm. high, and 1*5 mm. thick.

     In S. A. Miller's ' North- American Geology and Palaeontology,' 2nd
edition, 1889, p. 549, fig. 1009, an allied form is described and figured as
Faheria anomala, n. sp. et gen., from the Hudson-River group, Ohio
{Lower Silurian). This has evidently some analogy to the foregoing
Upper Silurian form. It has a compressed, ovoidal, smooth shell, con-
sisting of two moieties, partially sutured above and below, and is rather
smaller than the German specimen.

     § II. 1885-1894. Cambrian Phyllopoda (?).--Dr. G. F. Matthew, of

St. John, New Brunswick, has discovered several very small organisms

in the Cambrian rocks of North-Eastern America, some of which he
regards, with doubt, as having been carapace -valves of Phyllopodous

Crustaceans. He has described and figured them in the ' Transactions of

the Royal Society of Canada.'

     To this group of small subtriangular valve-like bodies, obliquely semi-

Soc. Nat. Hist.,' vol. xix. p. 296, pi. ix., figs. 3, 3a (refen-ed to in our

Report for 1883, p. 216). Dr. A. S. Packard, having received from

M. Gurley some imperfect specimens found in the Middle Coal-measures,

Danville, Illinois, describes them as being parts of a carapace, probably a

little over three inches long, and three caudal spines, also rather obscure

(' Proceed. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist.,' vol. xxiv. 1889, pp. 212, 213).

  --§ IV. 1893. Rhinocaris columbina. Mr. J. M. Clarke has contri-

buted a paper ' On the Structure of the Carapace in the Devonian Crusta-

cean Rhinocaris, and the relation of the Genus to Mesothyra and the

Phyllocarida,' with illustrative cuts, published in the ' American Natural-

ist,' September 1, 1893, pp. 793-801. The carapace-valves of Rhinocaris

Newcolumbina (J. M. C, ' Palieont.                               York,' vol. vii. 1888, pp. Iviii. and

195-197) are described from better specimens, which show it to be a

bivalved (not univalved) form, and as having a narrow, median plate, of

which there is evidence in Mesothyra, making a double dorsal suture.

There is also a long, narrow, leaf-like rostrum inserted between the valves

in front. The relationship of this form with Mesothyra and Tropidocaris

is dwelt upon. The author thinks that Dithyrocaris and Emmelezoe have

some aflfinity with it. Rhinocaris and Mesothyra are regarded as typical

Wemembers of the family Rhinocaridce.                                                may mention that Dr. Matthew

regards his Ceratiocaris pusilla from the Silurian of New Brunswick (see

'Trans. Roy. Soc, Canada,' vol. vi. 1888, sect. 4, p. 56, pi. iv., fig. 2 ; and
our Seventh Report (for 1889), p. 64, as Rhinocaris.

--§ V. 1895. Emmelezoe Lindstroemi. Since our Twelfth Report,

presented to the British Association at Ipswich in 1895, the Swedish

Phyllocarids mentioned in that Report as having been found by Dr.

Gustav Lindstrom in the Upper Silurian beds at Lau, Gothland, have

been duly described and figured in the ' Geological Magazine,' decade 4,

vol. ii.. No. 378 ; December, 1895, pp. 540, 541, pi. xv., figs. 2a-2d, as

Emmelezoe Lindstroemi, J. &, W. The fish remains (Cyathasjns) and other

fossils associated with it are mentioned in detail by G. Lindstrom in the

'Bihang till K. Svensk. Vet.-Akad. Handl.' vol. xxi. part 4, No. 3, 1895,

pp. 11, 12.

     Mr. J. M. Clarke has suggested at p. 801 of his memoir mentioned in
§ IV. that the oculate genus Emmelezoe may have some relationship to

the group to which Rhinocaris belongs.

  --§ VI. 1895. Pinnocaris LajJivorthi. This genus, represented by its

only known species, P. Lajnoorthi, has been carefully examined by

Woodward and Jones, and several specimens described, selected from a

large number in Mrs. Robert Gray's collection at Edinburgh. This

memoir appeared in the ' Geological Magazine,' decade 4, vol. ii. 1895,

pp. 542-545, pi. XV., figs. 5-10. Excepting one specimen from the

Upper Silurian of Kendal, Westmorland, all the known specimens are
ON THE FOSSIL THYLLOPODA OF THE PALEOZOIC ROCKS. 345

from the Lower Silurian of Girvan, Ayrshire, where Mrs. Gray has made

a large collection.

    The peculiar ' corded ' dorsal margin of the valves may have reference

to some longitudinal, narrow, intermediate ligament or plate, as in
Jihinocaris and Mesothyra.

A§ VII. 1895.  new species of Ceratiocaris (C. relicosn, J. it W.),

preserved in the Museum of the Geological Survey, was described in the

'Geological Magazine,' decade 4, 1895, vol. ii. pp. 539, 540, pi. xv.,
figs. 1«, 16. It is from the Silurian beds of Ludlow, Shropshire, and is

allied to C. cassioides, from that locality. Traces of a peculiar reticulate

sculpture constitute its distinguishing feature.

   --§ VIII. 1895. Lingulocaris.- In the same number (378) of the

' Geological Magazine,' 1895, at pp. 541, 542, a specimen of Lingulocaris
linguUtcomes, Salter, belonging to the Rev. G. C. H. Pollen, S.J., F.G.S.,

was figured and described. It came from Capel Arthog, North Wales,

probably from the Ffestiniog or middle division of the Lingula-flags.

Hence we may add ' Lingidocaris ' to ' Ilymenocaris ' for that formation

at p. 425 of our Twelfth Report (fifth line from the bottom).

  --§ IX. 1896. Devonian species of Ceratiocaris (?). In the ' Monograph

of the Devonian Fauna of the South of England,' Palseont. Soc, vol. iii.

part 1, 1896, the Rev. G. F. Whidborne describes and figures three obscure

casts of Ceratiocaris, one, C. (?) subquadrata, sp. nov., p. 7, pi. i., fig. 5,

from East Anstey ; another, Ceratiocaris (?) sp., p. 8, pi. i., fig. 6, from

Sloly ; and the third, somewhat indistinct specimen, namely, Ceratio-

caris (?), sp., p. 8, pi. ii., fig. 12, from Croyde.

--A§ X. 1896. Entomocaris and Ceratiocaris.           collection of Ceratio-

caris-like Crustaceans from the Lower Helderberg Formation (Upper

Silurian), near Waubeka, Wisconsin, has afforded Mr. R. P. Whitfield,

of the American Natural-History Museum, New York, the opportunity

of determining two new species of Ceratiocaris, and a new genus {Ento-

mocaris), allied to Ceratiocaris, but differing from it by the carapace- valves

being ' strongly curved in front and behind on the dorsal margin,' and by

the posterior margin not being truncate, as in Ceratiocaris, but obtusely

rounded. Entomocaris Telleri, Whitfield (p. 300), is figured in pi. xii.,
of full size, but slightly distorted by pressure. Including the four exposed

body-segments and the trifid appendage, it is about 21 centimetres

(about 8 inches) long; and the valves are about 13| centimetres long
by about 6^ high. Some indications of the swimming-feet attached to
the body are visible where one valve has been partially broken away from

the internal cast. Some mandibles, supposed to belong to this species, are

shown in pi. xiv., figs. 1, 2 ; and the caudal appendages in fig. 9.
     Ceratiocaris Monroei, Whitfield (p. 301, pi. xiii., figs. 1-5, and pi. xiv.,

figs. 3-8), is carefully described from one nearly perfect and an imperfect
specimen, together with body-segments, caudal appendages, and some

mandibles. The carapace-valves seem to have been about 7^ centimetres
long and 4 high.

      Ceratiocaris podiiriformis, Whitfield (p. 302, pi. xiv., fig. 10), is

represented by a small specimen of abdominal segments and caudal spines.

    Within the last few months Ananda K. Coomary-Swamy, Esq., of

Warplesdon, has fortunately obtained a very interesting specimen of this

Uchinocaris from the Sloly mudstone, showing, on the two counterparts

of the little split slab, two individuals, each having the same characters as

the specimen first described in the ' Geological Magazine,' decade 3, vol. vi.

1889, p. 385, pi. xi., fig. 1. Though rather narrowed by oblique pressure,

Anthe valves are equal in breadth to those of the first specimen.     addi-

tional feature of interest is seen in some body -segments, five in one

individual and three in the other. In each case, though the series of

segments is not complete either at beginning or- end, they are characteristic-

ally like those of Echinocaris, the distal edges bearing tubercles, the

equivalents of spinules.

--§ XII. 1896. Caryocaris. In the 'Journal of Geology,' Chicago,

vol. iv. 1896, p. 85, Dr. R. R. Gurley has described Caryocaris as the
' lateral appendages ' of the ' polypary ' of a Graptolite ! Caryocaris was
referred to by us in the First and Seventh Reports (for 1883 and 1891),
and was described in detail and figured in the ' Monogr. Brit. Palseoz.

sions of small valves, not more than two millimetres long, occur on the
bed-planes of a dark-red Lower-Carboniferous shale. Former occurrences

of this species were noticed in our Report (Eleventh) for 1894.

--Irish Elk Remains. Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor

     W. Boyd Dawkins (Chairman), his Honour Deemster Gill,

    Mr. G. W. Lamplugh, Rev. E. B. Savage, and Mr. P. M. 0.

     Kermode (Secretary), appointed to examine the Conditions under
     ivhich remains of the Irish Elk are found, in the Isle of Man.

As the elk remains in the Isle of Man have only been met with in

curi'agh lands where it is not possible to excavate for them till the later
part of summer (unless in an unusually dry season), the Committee have
not been able to accomplish much before July 1, by which date the report

is presented.

    An attempt was made in the first jjlace to examine the spot at

Ballaugh where the skeleton, now set up in Edinburgh Museum, was

found in 1819.1
     This was in the Loughan-ruy, on the farm of Ballaterson, eastward of

the Parish Church, Ballaugh. It is one of several shallow depressions in
a drift gravel platform, and measures about 120 yards by 40. It lies
about 50 yards west of the Ballacrye Road, leading from the highway to
the seashore, and has a boundary fence across the pool at its southern
end (Ordnance Sheet, iv. 10 (825)).

     Permission having been obtained from the proprietor and occupier of

the land, some trial excavations were made on May 13 and 14, but the

water prevented our sinking to any depth except at the edge (S.W.) of

the hollow, where we penetrated to over 7 feet with the following

results :

      Examples from these different beds were forwarded to the officers of

the Geological Survey for examination, and we are indebted to Mr. James
Bennie, of Edinburgh, who undertook the laborious washing and sorting
of the material, and to Mr. Clement Reid for his report upon them, which

we append.
     On June 24 further excavations were attempted across the bed of the

pool, but the inflowing water prevented any results ; nor is it expected
that the necessary depth can be attained till the end of July or
the middle of August. It is hoped that further work will have been
possible before the meeting of the Association, although the results cannot

be attained in time to incorporate with this report.'

     The Committee ask for reappointment. They propose to excavate in
the autumn at Loughanruy to the full depth of about 18 feet, at which
the Edinburgh specimen was found. The bones were apparently obtained

from the marl represented by the bed F of our section, this marl
evidently thinning off towards the edge of the hollow. Many skulls,

bones, and antlers are said to have been left. The Committee propose
also to excavate at Kentraugh, in the south of the island, where antlei's
have been met with ; and at Ballalough, near St. John's, and elsewhere,
where remains have been reported, with the hope of discovering such
remains in situ, so that a full examination of the accompanying fauna and

flora may be obtained.

      It will be seen that the results of this examination are of considerable
importance. The little Arctic crustacean Lepidurus glacialis was first

found in the Isle of Man two or three years ago in the peaty material

obtained from a well on the gravel platform at Kirk Michael,''^ and had
not hitherto been discovei-ed so far southward in Great Britain. In that

instance the conditions were unfavourable for the investigation of the
deposit which contained it, so that our discovery of its remains at Loughan-

     » Such further work at Ballalough, near Peel, has proved successful, a fairly
perfect skeleton-- with, however, the skull missing and some of the bones decayed
having been unearthed. Full details will be given in our next year's Eeport.

ruy, associated, as at Kirk Michael, with Salix herbaceci, will afford an
opportunity for a closer study of the conditions under which it occurs.

As Mr. Reid points out, it is especially desirable to investigate the

relations of this Arctic fauna to the beds containing the elk remains.

     The following is Mr. Clement Reid's report :

     " The following species of plants and animals were obtained on wash-

ing samples of the deposits. Beds C, D, and F are all worthy of closer

examination ; for it is important to ascertain whether there is any

evidence in the Isle of Man of a mild period after the melting of the ice,

and before the deposition of the bed with Arctic willows. If the shell-
marl (F) containing the Megaceros remains was formed during a mild
interval, the complete disappearance of the Irish elk, so difficult to under-

stand, may be due to cold or to scarcity of food during a less genial

period. This point has never been cleared up in Ireland, notwithstanding
the numerous remains of the Irish elk that have there been obtained.

ON ERRATIC BLOCKS OF THE BRITISH ISLES                              3i9

--En-atic Bloclcs of the British Isles. Second Report of the Committee,

     consisting of Professor E. Hull {Chairman), Professor T. G.
    BoNNEY, Mr. p. F. Kendall {Secretary), Mr. C. E. De Range,

    Professor W. J. Sollas, Mr. R. H. Tiddeman, Rev. S. N. Har-

     rison, Mr. J. Horne, Mr. Dugald Bell, Mr. F. M. Burton, and

      Mr. J. LoMAS, to investigate the Erratic Bloclis of the British Isles
      and to tahe measures for their iireservation.

The operations of the Committee during the year have been less pro-

ductive of immediate results than was anticipated.

The number of boulders recorded has been small, but several facts of

great interest have been brought to light. The diminution is due princi-

pally to the fact that a large section of the work which is carried out in

Yorkshire, viz., the enumeration of the boulders on the coast of Holderness,

has been carried to virtual completion, but other contributory causes have

been the inability of the Secretary to devote so large an amount of time as

he had hoped to the work of the Committee, and the severe loss sustained

by the Yorkshire Boulder Committee in the death of their most capable

and active Honorary Secretary, Mr. Thomas Tate, F.G.S. The respective

secretaries of the Lincolnshire Boulder Committee and the Geological

Section of the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club have been unable to prepare

their reports in time for publication this year.

The first feature of importance to be noticed is the large number of

additional records of Shap gz'anite boulders ; the occurrence of this rock

in Weai'dale is interesting, as showing the broadening of the area of dis-

persion after the Pennine Chain was crossed.

Dr. Ricketts' observation of many pebbles of Serpentine at Birkenhead

is remarkable, as only one fragment of that petrological type appears to

have been observed previously in the area of Lancashire and Cheshire.

The occurrence of pebbles of chalk and flint in North-Western

Nottinghamshire is a fact of importance, and may perhaps be taken to

indicate an extension of the chalky Boulder-clay.

The Noblethorpe erratic belongs evidently to the same dispersion as

the remarkable group of erratics in the Royston district, reported upon

two years ago, but it is several miles further west than any boulders

previously recorded in the district.

     Some noteworthy additions are made to our knowledge of the distri-
bution of the now well-known Norwegian rocks, the Augite-syenite of

Laui'vik, and the Rhomb-porphyries of the Christiania district. Mr.

Kendall has found the former at Saltburn and the latter at Staithes,

those being the most northerly stations at which they have been found.

Both were beach pebbles, but the travel of beaches on that coast is from

north to south, so there is no fear of their being wrongly ascribed to a

position to northward of their original locus as boulders.

Mr. Stather has found both rocks as boulders in situ in a lower bed of

Boulder- clay at Louth in Lincolnshire.

Far exceeding this in interest, however, is the recognition by an

eminent Swedish geologist, Dr. Munthe, of two rocks in Mr. Stather's

Acollection, whose place of origin is on the shores of the Baltic.  disposi-

tion has been manifested to assume that, because the only Scandinavian
350 REPORT--1897.

rocks that have been definitely identified among the erratics of our East

Coast were from the neighbourhood of Christiania, none from other
localities existed ; this fortunate discovery shows that assumption to
have been unwarranted.

     The investigations of Mr. Stather have brought out the remarkable
fact that tlie chalk Belemnitellm found in the Yorkshire drift are referable
to a species which has never been found in the Chalk of the district. This

fact is cf great significance.

     John Murray, Professor Newton, Mr. A. E. Shipley, and
    Professor W. F. P. Weldon. {Drawn up by the Secretary.)

The Committee are not able to report any practical results from their

appeal of last year, but they hope, by keeping the matter before the
public, to eventually arouse an interest in the important objects which
the Committee have in view.

     Although nothing definite has been accomplished this year, the Secre-
tary, acting in co-operation with a committee in Cambridge, is organising
an expedition, which will start next February, for the purpose of con-
tinuing his researches on the Anthropology of the Torres Straits Islanders.
These peoj^le occupy an area between that held by the Papuans on the
one hand and by the Australians on the other ; and, although it is well

known that they belong essentially to the Melanesian race, it is important
to finally establish their ethnic affinities. The natives are rapidly dis-

appearing, or are becoming modified by mixture with other races, and
thus there is an immediate need that they should be thoroughly studied
before it is too late to make accurate anthropological observations.

     Mr. Sidney H. Ray, the recognised expert on the languages of

Oceania, will accompany the expedition. He has already published

studies on the two languages of Torres Straits and on that of the

neighbouring coast of New Guinea.' The other members of the ex-

pedition will consist of men trained in various branches of biology,

particularly in anthropology and physiology. So far as opportunity
offers, various branches of the anthropology of the natives will be studied
iind numerous photographs taken. All the collections of objects illustrat-
ing the anthropography and ethnography of the Torres Straits Islanders
will be presented to appropriate museums.

     The zoology and botany of the islands will not be neglected, but the

services of a naturalist have net yet been secured.

The table in the Naples Zoological Station hired by the British Associa-

tion has been granted during the past year to Mr. H. M. Vernon, Miss

A. Vickers, and Professor W. F. R. "Weldon.

     Mr. Vernon has occupied the table during the months of April, May,

and June, and continued his investigations on the effects of environment

upon the development of Echinoderm larvae. He has furnished a prelimi-

nary report upon his work, which will be found appended.

     Miss Vickers, who was engaged in studying tlie Alg£e of the Gulf of

Naples, has, through the kindness of Professor Dohrn, occupied the table

for nearly two months concurrently with Mr. Vernon. Your Committee-

desire to express their appreciation of this generous act of consideration

on the part of Professor Dohrn. Owing to the early date of the meeting;

this year Miss Vickers's report has not yet been received.

     Professor Weldon proposed to occupy the table during the months of

July, August, and September, to investigate the phenomena of variation

in Crustacea ; and the result of his work will of necessity form part of

next year's report.

    An application for permission to use the table during the ensuing year

has been received from Mr. J. Parkinson, for the purpose of making in-

vestigations on the budding of the compound Ascidians, especially of the

Botryllids. He wishes to go to Naples at the beginning of October and'

to remain six months.

    An application has also been received from Mr. James F. Gemmill,.

Lecturer on Vertebrate Embryology in the University of Glasgow, for

permission to use the table during the months of September and October..

In support of this application Professor Dohrn has kindly written to say

that he will be glad to allow Mr. Gemmill to occupy a table, if approved

by the Committee, concurrently with any other appointment made by the

Committee.

     Other applications have also been received ; in fact, more candidates
for the table have recently come forward than at any previous period.

Your Committee trust that the General Committee will sanction the

payment of the grant of 100/., as in previous years, for the hire of the

table in the Zoological Station at Naples.

     On April 14 there was commemorated at Naples the twenty-fifth

anniversary of the foundation of the Zoological Station. The occasion

was  observed  with  much  ceremony                                               and a number of  eminent scientific
                                                                               ;

and to confer upon him and his colleagues various orders of dignity and

academic honours. Among the numerous addresses presented to Professor

Dohrn, one, subscribed by more than nineteen hundred naturalists and
philosophei-s from all parts of the world, is sufficient to indicate the esteem
in which the Zoological Station is universally held. In the course of an
eloquent speech Professor Dohrn specially acknowledged his gratitude and
indebtedness to the British Association for their support, which has ex-
tended from the early critical period of the station's existence up to the

present time.

     The progress of the various publications undertaken by the station is
summarised as follows :

     1. Of the ' Fauna und Flora des Golfes von Neapel' the monographs
by Dr. G. Jatta on 'I Cefalopodi, Sistematica' (pp. 268, 31 plates), and
by Dr. H, Ludwig on 'Seesterne' (pp. 491, 12 plates), have been pub-

lished.

     2. Of the ' Mittheilungen aus der zoologischen Station zu Neapel *
vol. xii. part iii., with 7 plates, has been published.

     3. Of the ' Zoologischer Jahresbericht ' the whole 'Bericht'for 1895

has been published.

   A4. new and greatly revised English edition of the ' Guide to the

Aquarium ' has been published.

     The details extracted from the general report of the Zoological Station,
which have been courteously furnished by the officers, will be found at
the end of this report. They embrace lists (1) of the naturalists who
have occupied tables since the last repoi't, and (2) of the works published
during 1896 by naturalists who have worked at the Zoological Station.

I. Report on the Occupc Hon of the Table. By Mr. H. M. Yernon.

The Conditions of Animal Life in Marine Aquaria.

I was originally appointed to the British Association table at Naples

for the months of April and May, but my term was subsequently extended

Myto the end of June.  object in coming to Naples was to continue some

work I had been engaged upon during a previous stay at the Zoological

Station. This work consisted in an investigation upon the effects of

environment upon the development of Echinoderm larvse. At the present

time I am endeavouring to elucidate something as to the conditions of

--Animal Life especially as regards those appertaining to Marine Aquaria

--by the help of these larvge, which are obtained very readily by means

of artificial fertilisations.

   --The work consists of two more or less distinct parts first, of the

growing of the larvae of Strongylocentrotus lividus under various condi-

tions, and then preserving and measuring them under the microscope, so

as to determine what change, if any, has been produced in their size by

the different environmental conditions ; and secondly, of the analysis of

the various specimens of water in which the larvae are allowed to develop,

so as to determine how the degree of organic impurity of the water affects
the growth of the larvje, and how this impurity may be most effectually,

as judged by both chemical and physiological standards, removed.

The analyses of the water thus far made have consisted in determining
         THE ZOOLOGICAL STATION AT NAPLES.                             355

only the free ammonia and the albuminoid ammonia present. The

method used is the well-known one of distilling off a portion of the water,

and determining the ammonia present in the distillate colorimetrically

after the addition of Nessler's reagent, and then further distilling after

the addition of an alkaline solution of permanganate of potash, thereby

obtaining in the distillate what is known as the albuminoid ammonia

present in the water. The values thus obtained afford a fair criterion as

to the comparative amounts of organic impurity present.

As, at the time of writing, I have been engaged on this work only

about two months, the results obtained must necessarily be regarded as of

a somewhat preliminary nature. Such as they are, however, they seem

Ato show that the method is one of some value.  good many experiments

have been made to determine the most favourable conditions for the

removal of the ammonia, which is present in large quantities in the tank

water of the Aquarium, by means of vegetable life. It has been found

that the alga Ulva removes the free ammonia present fairly rapidly, though

it has not much influence on the albuminoid ammonia. Indeed, if the

amount of this alga taken is moi-e than about one square inch per litre of

water this actually increases in amount, presumably owing to the meta-

bolism of the vegetable tissues. The alga acts best in diffused daylight, it

being bleached in sunlight. Larvae allowed to grow in water purified by

this moderate amount of alga were found to be 14 per cent, larger than

those grown in the unpurified water. If too much alga has been added

they are smaller than the normal, or do not develop at all.

Probably vegetable life exerts its influence most powerfully through

the agency of minute algae and diatoms. Thus it was found that every

grain of the coarse sand which is placed in the tanks of the Aquarium is

covered with a thin layer of algse and diatoms, and that in water filtered

fairly rapidly through a layer of this sand a few inches deep the amount

of free ammonia present is diminished to about a fifteenth of its previous

amount.

Several other possible means of purification of the water have been

examined. Thus it has been found that if water be exposed to sunlight

a few days in a flask filled up to the neck, whereby very little surface

comes into contact with the air, the amount of ammonia present is, if

anything, increased, but yet larvae subsequently grown in such water are

15 per cent, larger than the normal. Larvae grown in water which has

been exposed to the action of the air as well as the sun in a flat, covei-ed

glass jar are, however, rather smaller than the normal, and also the

ammonia present in such water is appreciably increased. Larvae grown

in water previously heated to boiling are slightly increased in size.

Again, a series of observations is being made upon the relative capa-

cities for ' fouling ' water possessed by various members of the animal
kingdom. Various animals of known weights are placed for known times

in measured volumes of water, and the increase in the amount of ammonia

present is then determined in a portion of the water. In another portion

larvae are allowed to develop, and so by subsequent measurement the

adverse effect on tlieir growth of the products of metabolism of the various

animals is determined. Still, again, other observations are being made as

to the effects upon the growth of the larvae of the addition of various

salts, such as nitrates, nitrites, and ammonium salts, to the water.
    In conclusion I wish to offer my thanks to the Committee of the

British Association for the privilege of being allowed to hold the table,

     Dr. P. L. ScLATER, Mr. E. A. Smith, and Mr. D. Sharp

The Committee was appointed in 1890, and has been annually re-

appointed. It has continued to work in conjunction with a Committee
appointed by the Royal Society for the same purposes. Since the last
Report Mr. R. C. L. Pei-kins was maintained at work in the islands till

March last by aid of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu. He

has now returned to England, and is engaged in arranging his second set
of collections for being worked out. The Committee is endeavouring to

get all the material reported on by competent specialists, several of whom

have made considerable progress. The work to be done is, however, so
extensive, especially in arthropods, that the Committee anticipates a
period of two years must elapse before the work can be satisfactorily

completed. Papers, of a preliminary nature, have been published since
the last Report by Mr. E. R. Sykes('Proc. Malacol. Soc.,' 1896), by

--Zoological Bibliography and Publication. Second Report of the Com-

    mittee, consisting of Sir W. H. Flower (Chairman'), Professor W.
    A. Herdman, Mr. W. E. Hoyle, Dr. P. L. Sclater, Mr. Adam

     Sedgwick, Dr. D. Sharp, Mr. G. D. Sherborn, Rev. T. R. R.

    Stebbing, Professor W. F. R. Weldon, and Mr. F. A. Bather

       (Secretary).

The Report presented in 1896 stated that this Committee was issuing

two circulars : (I.) Questions concerning general principles of Bibliography
and Publication, sent to experts and leading zoologists (II.) Suggestions

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

concerning various cognate matters ' wholly within the control of editors

and publishing committees,' sent to the editors of all publications con-
nected with zoology.

Circular I. has been sent to 115 zoologists, the majority of whom have

had practical experience in Bibliography. From 36 of these, in various

parts of the world, replies have been received, containing, in many cases,

Aa detailed discussion and practical suggestions of much value.                                                                     digest

of these replies is being drawn up, and the Committee hopes to furnish a

definite Report thereon next year. Meanwhile certain of the suggestions

and criticisms received have greatly helped the Committee in its con-

sideration of the replies to Circular II.

To this latter Circular and its strictly practical proposals the Com-

mittee thinks it advisable to confine attention for the present. Circular

II. has been sent to the editors of nearly all the publications listed in the

' Zoological Record,' viz., to some 800, the exceptions being those whose

addresses could not be ascertained ; it has also been sent to the editors of

various publications not hitherto included in the ' Zoological Record ' list,

e.g., all zoological publications recently started.

     Replies were not specially solicited, but comments have been received

from 39 editors or publishing bodies, to all of whom the Committee

desires to express its thanks. Among them may be mentioned : the R.

Physical Society of Edinburgh, the Natural History Society of Glasgow,

the Cambridge Philosophical Society, the Entomological Society of London,

the Liverpool Biological Society ; ' Nature,' ' Natural Science,' * The

Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen, Amsterdam ; Geological

Society of America, Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, Essex

Institute, Cincinnati Society of Natural History, Natural History Society

of New Brunswick, 'Science,' 'Bulletin of American Palaeontology,'

' Entomological News.' All these replies are favourable to the suggestions

of the Committee in the main, and some even ask for further advice.

Exception has, however, been taken by some to suggestions 1 , 3, and 7 ;
360 REPORT--1897.

while comments have also been made on suggestions 2, 4, and 5. It is               I

proposed to deal with these in order.
      First, the Committee wishes to state clearly that it has no wish, even if

it had the authority, to lay down laws for zoologists or for publishing
bodies and editors. It is, however, plain that many are grateful for
some guidance, and the Committee hopes that it may serve as a medium
for conveying to those who need it the general opinion of the experienced.

There are also difficulties which, though they appear to some insuperable,

may possibly be surmounted in ways that have been communicated to the

Committee.

                 (1) 'That each part of a serial publication should have the date

         of actual publication, as near as may be, printed on the wrapper,
          and, when possible, on the last sheet sent to press.'

     Five correspondents do not see the use of this, thinking that the date
on the wrapper is enough, and that in the case of annual publications the
date of the year suffices. The Committee would point out that wrappers
are constantly lost in binding, and that periodicals are often broken up by
specialists or second-hand booksellers, the consequent loss of date causing

much trouble to workers of a later day. To avoid this, the Cincinnati

Society of Natural History would add the date at the head of each paper,
while ' Natural Science ' prints the month and year across every page-

opening. Some societies, e.g. the Philadelphia Academy, issue a certificate
of dates at the end of the volume. The Liverpool Biological Society ' put
at the head of each paper the date when it is read, and are willing to add
the date when it is printed off' : neither of these dates are necessary, and
they may be misleading. In most cases the actual day of publication is
immaterial, especially in cases where no new species are described, but at
least the month should always be given, and the Committee does not see
that there need be any difficulty in doing this. If some unforeseen delay

does occur, the date can always be rectified with a date stamp.

                 (2) 'That authors' separate copies should be issued with the
          original pagination and plate-numbers clearly indicated on each
          page and plate, and with a reference to the original place of publi-

              cation.'

     The Committee believes this to be a most important recommendation,
and its view is supported by all the zoologists consulted. Nevertheless,
many leading publications continue to issue authors' copies repaged, and
often without reference to volume-number, date, or even the name of the
periodical. The remedy is so simple that the Committee urgently appeals

for its universal application.

                 (3) 'That authors' separate copies should not be distributed
           privately before the paper has been published in the regular
            manner.'

     It is a curious fact that on this question editors take a different line

to working zoologists. All the latter who have discussed the matter

agree with the Committee as to the extreme inconvenience caused by the

general custom. Among the editors, however, nine {i.e., nearly one-

quarter) protest against the present recommendation. The objectors
represent small societies which publish at lengthy intervals, and their
reajjons are : that it is not fair to an author to prevent him from receiving
              ON ZOOLOGICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND PUBLICATION.          361

his separate copies for perhaps a year ; that it is not to the advantage of

science that work should thus be delayed ; that a society which did this

would receive fewer contributions and lose its members. In brief, the

Weargument is : '  are too poor to publish properly ; therefore we must

allow authors to publish improperly.' This form of argument suggests an

easy remedy, and one that, on the informal suggestion of the Committee,

has already been put into practice by the Liverpool Biological Society

and by the R. Physical Society of Edinburgh. The remedy is this :

In cases lohere a volume or jM^t can only appear at long intervals, each

author that requires separate cojnes of his jjaper for private distribution

before its p)ublication in the volume or part should be 2}erinitted them only

--on this condition that, for every month before the probable issue of the
-- --volume, a certain number of copies say five should be placed by him in

the hands of the society or its accredited publisher, in order that they may

be offered for sale to the public at a fixed price. Further, that the society,

for its part, shoidd announce the jniblication, with price and agent, of their

papers to some recognised office, or to some such paper as the ' Zoologischer

Anzeiger.' The details of expense must be settled between the author and

the society.

     (4) ' That it is desirable to express the subject of one's paper in
its title, while keeping the title as concise as possible.'

     It is satisfactory to find no objections raised to this recommendation,

since there is no doubt that there is room for much improvement in this

direction. Such phrases as ' Further contributions towards our knowledge

of the ....,' or ' Einige Beobachtungen iiber ....,' or ' Essai d'une

Monographic du genre . . . . ' might well be dispensed with as super-
fluous. The ornithologist who, in 1895, published a book with a title of
ninety-one M'ords would seem to have forgotten the functions of a

preface.

    On the other hand, it is pointed out that certain periodicals, such as

the ' Bulletin de la Societe Entomologique de France ' and the ' Sitzungs-
berichte der Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin ' publish
communications without any title, to the constant confusion of naturalists
The Committee begs to urge the reform of this practice, in which it can
see no advanta"goe^.

               (5) ' That new species should be properly diagnosed, and
          figured when possible.'

     The only comment on this is the proposed omission of the words
' when possible.' With this the Committee sympathise, but wish to avoid
all appearance of laying down a law that would constantly be broken.

     (6) ' That new names should not be proposed in irrelevant foot-
notes or anonymous paragraphs.'

     Naturally nobody supports such actions as are here objected to, but
since some have doubted the possibility of the latter, it is as well to state
that the suggestion was based on an actual case occurring in the Report
of a well-known International Congress. The proposal of a new name,
without diagnosis, in a footnote to a student's text-book, or in a short
review of a work by another author, is a by no means rare occurrence.
The Committee believes that such practices are calculated to throw nomen-

clature into confusion rather than to advance science.
362 REPORT-- 1897.

              (7) ' That references to previous publications should be made
          fully and correctly if possible, in accordance with one of the recog-
          nised sets of rules for quotation, such as that recently adopted by

           the French Zoological Society.'

     Dr. Paul Mayer, of Naples, writes : ' Most authors are extremely idle

in making good lists of literature themselves, and even oppose my correct-

ing them according to our rules. There ought to be some training in this
at our Universities.' This is confirmed by one or two other editors, but
not all have the energy of Dr. Mayer. Some, indeed, oppose the word
' fully ' on the ground that it leads to waste of time and space. The
Committee would explain that the reference to a particular set of rules

was intended merely as a guide to those who have not had the training
that Dr. Mayer would like to see ; they would also point out, in the

words of the editor of the Cincinnati Society of Natural History, that

' what may be intelligible to the specialist is very puzzling to the general
student.' Nowadays, when so many zoologists work with the aid of

authors' separate copies, it is an enormous convenience to them to have
the title of the paper at least indicated, and not merely the volume, date,
and pagination given. The Committee, therefore, cannot agree that this
suggestion involves a waste of time.

     Finally, the Committee recommends that copies of this Report be'dis-
tributed to the editors of all publications connected with zoology ; and
for this purpose it recommends its reappointment with a grant of 61. Is.
for expenses of printing and postage.

It is with extreme regret that your Committee have to report the serious
illness of Mr. William Eagle Clarke, shortly after his return last autumn
from the delta of the Rhone, to which his zeal in investigating the sub-
ject of Bird Migration had led him at an unhealthy season. In conse-
quence of this illness he has been able to make but little progress in
executing the task of working out the details of the Observations already
so successfully digested by him, which task had been entrusted to him by
your Committee.

     It seems quite certain that no useful result could follow from at pre-
sent placing in other hands any of the records which the Committee
possess, even if such a course would be fair to Mr. Clarke, who has already

bestowed so much labour and time upon them, and therefore your Com-

mittee, in the hope of his eventual recovery, respectfully request reappoint-
ment.

      BOYCE.)

          The Green Disease.

Since our Report, read at the Liverpool Meeting of the British Associa-

tion 4ast September, in which we announced that we had discovered a pale
green disease, accompanied by a leucocytosis, in certain American oysters
laid down on our coasts, two papers have appeared which require brief
notice. One of these is an article by Dr. D. Carazzi in the ' Mittheilungen
of the Naples Zoological Station for 1896, and the other is the ' Supple-
ment to the Report of the Medical Officer for 1894-95,' which deals with

oyster culture in relation to disease, and which appeared towards the end

of 1896.

Dr. Carazzi has worked with the ordinary European oyster {Ostrea

edulis) at Spezia. The green oysters which he has investigated are

the ' Huitres de Marennes,' and some oysters of unknown origin which

he obtained from the bottom of a yacht. He has also had specimens of
the Portuguese oyster, but, so far as appears, no American oysters. He

considers that all the green oysters he has examined have been healthy.

He has apparently not seen any condition at all resembling the pale chalky

green, unhealthy state that we find in certain American oysters, and so he

Weseems inclined to deny its occurrence !  have endeavoured to demon-

strate to Dr. Carazzi the existence of this diseased condition by sending

him both living specimens and also pieces of the affected mantle, etc.,

fixed, preserved, and imbedded in paraffin ready for sectioning. Dr. Bul-

strode, in the Medical Officer's Report referred to below, has clearly met
with the green disease we described last year ; and we have also had the
satisfaction of showing it to Dr. P. P. C. Hoek, of Helder, who visited

our laboratories last February for the purpose of seeing our oyster work.

Our specimens and preparations have also been seen at all stages of the

investigation by our assistants and colleagues ' at University College,

Liverpool.

     The latter of the two works, a book of 174 pages, and many illus-
trations, consists of reports by Dr. Thome Thome, Dr. E. Klein, and

Dr. Bulstrode, upon the conditions under which oysters are cultivated
and stored, and upon the connection between unhealthy conditions and
the presence of pathogenic organisms in the oysters. Although these

reports contain little that was not known to those interested in the
subject, still they served to draw public attention to what had been only
previously known to oyster investigators, viz., that some--by no means

' Our thanks are especially due to Professor Sherrington, Dr. C. Kohn, Dr.

WeAbram, Mr. Cole, and Mr. Scott.  are indebted to Mr. G. Petrie, Liverpool, and

Mr. Rupert Vallentin, Falmouth, for help in obtaining special kinds of oysters.
364 REPORT-- 1897.

--all of our oysters and mussels are grown or kept under most insanitary

conditions, and so may, when taken as food, without the necessary precau-
tions, from unhealthy localities, cause disease or poisoning. The con-
clusions on the public health question are entirely in accord with what we
(Boyce and Herdman) recommended in a former report (Ipswich, 1895) as
the two requisite sanitary measures, namely, first, the inspection of all
grounds upon which shelliish are grown or bedded, so as to ensure their

--practical freedom from sewage ; and, secondly, the use, when necessary, of

what the French call ' d^gorgeoirs ' tanks of clean water in which the

oysters should be placed for a short time before they are sent to the
consumer.

                                               Copper in Oysters.

      There are two other points in the Medical Officer's Report to which
·we must allude. The first is that Dr. Bulstrode's report corroborates our

account of the pale green disease which we have discussed in our pre-

vious papers, and which we refer to more fully below. He has independ-

ently met with a condition in oysters from the South Coast of England
which is clearly the diseased condition we had described. This is the
more important as Dr. Carazzi in the paper referred to above seems
inclined to doubt our account of the pale green disease. The second
point is that Dr. Thorpe, who examined some green oysters obtained
by Dr. Bulstrode at Falmouth, found tliat they contained a notable
amount of copper. This observation has raised once more the question,

which was by many considered settled, as to whether large amounts

of copper might be taken up by the oyster, and as to whether any of
the green forms of oyster owe their colour to copper.

    We have alluded in former reports ' to the great difference of opinion

that has existed in the past as to the green colour of certain oysters, and
there can be no doubt that that difference of opinion has l)een largely due
to the fact that the observers worked with different kinds of oysters. Some
investigated Marennes oysters {0. edulis) and found that with dark blue-
green gills they were in a perfectly healthy state, that they contained very
little copper, and that some iron was present in the pigment. In all that
they were perfectly correct ; but that does not prove that the pale green
 American oyster {0. virginica) is also in a healthy state, and that its green
colour is due to iron and not copper. If there is one thing more than
another which this investigation has taught us, it is caution in drawing
general conclusions from what is found in one oyster or one brand of

oysters. At an early period of the investigation we were inclined to agree

 with some previous investigators that copper, though present in small

quantity in all oysters, had nothing to do with the green colour ; but now
 we have to definitely announce that we find copper in considerable quan-

 tity in the green American oysters, that the copper reaction coincides
 histologically with the green granular leucocytes, and that consequently

 the copper may be regarded as the cause of the green colour.

       Professor Bizio records that he found (in 1835 to 1845) copper in
 oysters at Venice ; and he suggests that the colour of the Marennes
 oyster is due to a compound of copper. Subsequent work upon Marennes

 oysters, in which little or no copper was found, may have seemed to throw

ON THE LIFE CONDITIONS OF THE OYSTER.  365

discredit on Bizio's observation ; but we think it very possible, in the
light of our recent experience, that Bizio was dealing with the same
copper-bearing green pigment that we have met with.

     From numerous analyses that have been made for us by Dr. C. Kohny

it is pretty certain that about 0'006 grain (0-4 mgrme.) of copper is the
amount that is normally present in the healthy oyster ; and this copper is
usually supposed to be located in the htemocyanin, which, as Fredericq

and others have shown, is a constituent of the blood of many crustaceans
and molluscs. The amount of copper, however, that we have lately found

in green oysters is far in excess of what can be accounted for as due to-

the haemocyanin.

     Out of 120 American oysters opened at one time, we picked the six
greenest and the six whitest. Dr. Kohn analysed these for us and found
that the six green ones contained 3'7 times as much copper as the white.
This shows that there is an absolute increase in the amount of copper

present in the body, and not merely a redisposition, such as the concen-

tration of the copper of the haemocyanin in certain leucocytes.

    Further, Dr. Kohn finds that the greenest parts of an oyster, if

snipped out and analysed, contain, in a ratio corresponding to that stated
above for whole oysters, more copper than the corresponding parts of a.
white oyster. These experiments, and the histological reactions described

below, demonstrate the coincidence of the copper distribution with the

green colour.

                                        Seat of the Green Colour.

    It may be well that we should state again the method of occurrence

and the histological distribution of the green colouring matter. In the-
American oyster [0. virginica) re-bedded on the English coast, a well-
marked pale chalky green colouration is fi-equently observed, especially
in autumn. This colour, in its appearance and distribution, is unlike

that seen in the gills of the Marennes oyster. It may occur in patches,
on the mantle, but more frequently it is confined to the vessels and

heart ; in some cases, owing to the universal injection of the vessels.
the entire oyster has a greenish tinge. Microscopic examination shows,
that the green colour is due to leucocytes, which are coarsely granular.
The leucocytes are amoeboid and tend to collect in masses. The oysters
in which this massing of green leucocytes occurs do not appear to us;
as healthy as those which are colourless. They are frequently thin,,

with the liver shrunken, but we were unable to find evidence of any
parasitic or other irritative cause of the disease, either by staining or

cultivation. Examination of considerable numbers of the English native
{0. edulis) shows that the green colouration is occasionally encountered
in that form, and that it is due to the same cause, but it is by no mean*
so frequent as in the American species.

                                    Investigation of the Pigment.

     The following are our details of the histo-chemical investigation of
the pigment. The green pigment is insoluble in boiling alcohol, ether,
chloroform, xylol, and other fat solvents ; it is soluble in dilute acids and
alkalis. The addition of potassic ferrocyanide to sections containing

the green colouring matter, or to the leucocytes themselves, gives a red
reaction, indicating the presence of copper ; but the reaction can be
366 EEPORT-- 1897.

most readily obtained by the addition of a small quantity of "5 per cent,

hydrochloric acid to the potassic ferrocyanide. Ammonium-hydrogen

sulphide gives also an immediate reaction with the green pigment.

Ammonia strikes a beautiful blue wherever there is green. It was then

found that pure hsematoxylin is an extremely delicate test, giving an

immediate blue reaction in exceedingly dilute solution. Previous treat-

ment of the green colouring matter by 3 per cent, nitric acid in alcohol

prevented these reactions, and subsequent treatment with acidulated

potassic ferrocyanide resulted in a very faint general prussian blue coloura-

Wetion of the tissue generally.    concluded that there was no inoi'ganic

iron present in the leucocytes, that the leucocytes which form the green

patches contain a considerable quantity of copper, and that, just as in the

case of iron, as shown by Professor Macallum,^ pure hematoxylin is a

most delicate test, but that great care must be taken to ascertain by other

reagents which of the metals is present. Very numerous tests were

made with the blood obtained from white oysters, and micro-chemical

reactions revealed in some instances faint traces of copper. Hsemocyanin

has been described in the blood of molluscs and apparently in the blood

Weof the oyster.  have examined numerous samples of blood taken from

the white oyster, but have failed to get any blue colouration on exposure

to air. In the green oysters a very faint blue colour has been noticed in

some cases on exposing the blood to air.

                  Cause of the Pigmentation.

     There can be no doubt that Ryder,* in America, about 1880, investi-

gated the same kind of green oyster with which we are dealing. He

showed that the green colouring matter was taken up by the amoeboid

blood-cells, and that these wandering cells containing the pigment were

to be found in the heart, in some of the blood-vessels, and in aggregations

in ' cysts ' under the surface epithelium of the body. He describes the

colour (in the ventricle) as a ' delicate pea-green,' and states that it is

not chlorophyll nor diatomine ; he suggests that it may be phycocyanin
Weor some allied substance.
                                   have now shown that it is due to a copper

compound.

   We consider that Ryder came nearer to what we now consider to be

the truth than any previous investigator has done. He was trying to

show that the colour was derived from the food. Carazzi has recently

suggested that the colour (this, it must be remembered, is in the Marennes

oyster), due to iron, is derived from the bottom on which the oyster is

Welying.  have tried numerous experiments in feeding oysters on iron and

copper salts, both soluble and insoluble, of various strengths, and also in

--keeping oysters on a bottom of iron or copper salts including rusty iron,
--old copper, and copper filings but in none of these experiments (the full

details of which we shall publish later) have we got sufficiently consistent

and continuous results to enable us to determine whether or not the animal

obtains its copper from the contents of the alimentary canal or from the

water through the surface of the body. These experiments and observa-

tions are still being carried on.

We may add that the green oysters containing copper are found in

some localities where there can be no question of copper mines or old

Wecopper from ships' bottoms.  venture to suggest that the pigmentation

may be due to a disturbed metabolism whereby the normal copper of the

body becomes stored up in certain cells.

   We desire to continue this work. Our investigation is drawing to

a conclusion, but there are still some points we hope to settle, such as

the origin of the copper and the conditions determining its deposition.

The colouring matter in the other kinds of green oysters also requires

Wereinvestigation.      desire, then, that the Committee should be

reappointed for one year more, with the addition of Dr. Kohn, who has

rendered us valuable service on the chemical side, and with a grant to

meet the expenses of the investigation.

--Index Animalium. Report of a Committee, consisting of Sir W. H.

     Flower (Chairman), Mr. P. L. Sclater, Dr. H. Woodward, Eev.
     T. K. R. Stebbing, Mr. R. MacLachlan, and Mr. F. A. Bather

     (Secretary), appointed to superintend the Compilation of an Index
      Animalium.

The object of this Committee is to prepare, and ultimately to publish, an

index to every name, whether valid or invalid, that has ever been applied

as the generic or specific denomination of an animal, recent or fossil.

The work of compiling the Index is carried on by Mr. C. Davies Sherbom

at the British Museum (Natural History).

The Committee has decided to deal first with the names occurring in

literature published between the years 1758 and 1800 inclusive, since this

section of the literature is the most important for questions of priority.

Within these limits Mr. Sherborn has during the past year prepared a

list of the literature to be searched.

Since the last Report was drawn up 982 volumes and tracts have

been indexed, and about 10,000 species listed. In addition Mr. Sherborn

has prepared a separate index of the names of animals in the tenth and

twelfth editions of Linnaeus's ' Systema Naturse,' since it was considered

by the Committee that the publication of this would be a useful prelimi-

nary step of much value to naturalists.

The Committee begs to remind zoologists that the Index, in the form

of a card catalogue, now containing about 140,000 references, can be re-

ferred to in the library of the Geological Department of the British

Museum (Natural History) any week day between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

   A detailed account of the methods and progress of the work was

published in the ' Proceedings of the Zoological Society ' for 1896, pp.

610 614, and was reprinted in the 'Geological Magazine' (n.s., Dec. iv.,

Avol. iii. pp. 557-561, Dec. 1896).     notice of this and an appeal for the

support of zoologists was published in ' Natural Science ' for June 1897

(vol. X. pp. 370-371).

The value of this work to zoologists (including palaeontologists) and

the satisfactory progress that the grant of 100?. by the Association has

rendered possible justify the Committee in recommending its reappoint-

ment, with the addition of Mr. W. E. Hoyle, and in asking for a renewal

of the grant.

--Ajrican Lake Fauna. Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr.

      P. L. ScLATER (Chairman), Dr. John Murray, Professor E. Eay
     Lankester, Professor W. A. Herdman, and Professor G. B.
      Howes (Secretary).

 Mr. J. E. S. MooRE, A.R.C.S., London, left England on September 7,
 1895, and returned to Europe on January 1, 1897.

      The primary object of his expedition was the collection, by means of
 dredging, tow-netting, and other resources, of material for the adequate
 working out of the structure, and, as far as possible, the development, of
 the singular fresh-water Medusa (Limnocnida tanganyikoi), and some
 other remarkable animal forms which, from their shells brought home by
 travellers, were known to inhabit Lake Tanganyika, and to present a
 combination of characters unlike that of any other fresh -water stock.
 Incidentally, the faunas of Lakes Shirwa, Kela, and Nyassa were as far
 as possible studied ; and in this way much light has been thrown on the
 geographical distribution of the fauna of the great African lakes. It

--has been ascertained that Tanganyika contains at least two distinct

 faunas one which is more or less fully represented in all the great
 African lakes, and another peculiar to Tanganyika itself. The latter
 embraces the Medusa, some of the fresh -water fishes yet to be determined,

 some new species of Crabs and Prawns, a deep-water Sponge, and mem-
bers of some eight or nine genera of Gastropods. Some of the latter are
 already known from their shells (such as Typliobia, Lithoglyphus limno-

 irochus, and Paranielania), but there are others which have yet to be
described. All these animals, like the Medusa, exhibit marked marine
 affinities, but they cannot be directly associated with any living oceanic

forms ; and it is suggested they may represent the remains of a special

fauna which has persisted in the lake for a vast period.

     Observations were also made upon the Protozoa of Lake Tanganyika,
with the result that there were discovered apparently new species of

Condylostoma and Peridinium, both of which are widely distributed

over the surface of the lake.

   A number of topographical observations were made, and rock speci-

mens were collected which will add to our knowledge of the geology of the
districts visited. Besides this, representatives of classes and orders of
animals other than those referred to above were collected. Mr. Moore
is at present working out the collections at the Royal College of Science,
South Kensington, and the full results will be published in a series of
papers to be communicated to the Royal and Zoological Societies, and in

the ' Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science.'

   --The following is a diary of Mr. Moore's movements while in Africa :

     Arrived at Capetown on September 21, 1895, and at Durban on Sep-
tember 28. Left Durban on October 18 (having been detained by the
loss of a steamer), and arrived at Chinde on November 2. Left Chinde
on November 4, and arrived at Blantyre, via the Zambesi and Shire
Rivers, on November 27. Being detained by the war in progress at the
north-east end of Nyassa, Mr. Moore left Blantyre for Zomba on Decem-

ber 23, and after an interview with Sir Harry Johnston, to whom Mr.
       ON AFfilCAN LAKE FAUNA.                  369

Moore expresses his special indebtedness for assistance and advice, he left

Zomba again for Blantyre on December 26. On January 1, 1896, he left

Blantyre for Mtope, on the Upper Shir^ River, and proceeded thence by
boat to Fort Liwonde. Proceeding up the Shire E-iver to Fort Johnston,

which was reached on January 8, he, through the kindness of Sir Harry
Johnston, was enabled to embark his men and goods on the gunboat
' Pioneer,' on which he proceeded up Lake Nyassa, arriving at Karonga
on February 28. There a further delay occurred, owing to the necessity

for collecting men for the march across the plateau. On reaching
Mweinwanda's village, 40 miles N.W. of Nyassa, delay arose from fever.
On recovery, Mr. Moore proceeded to Fwambo, which was reached on
March 16. Leaving that place on the 17th, a day's journey brought
him to the Chartered Company's new station at Fort Abercorn, from

which, after a long day's march, the south end of Tanganyika was reached
on March 19. The remainder of Mr. Moore's time was passed on or
near the shores of Lake Tanganyika, in visiting places favourable for
dredging, and in making observations on the topography of the district.

Several excursions were undertaken into the surrounding country, east
and west, especially with a view to the study of the remarkable geology
of the Loofu Valley, the river of which reaches Tanganyika through a
precipitous gorge, near the south end of Cameron Bay. Mr. Moore
left Kituta on September 7, 1896, and returned by the same route as he

went up, reaching Europe on New Year's Day, 1897.

370 REPORT-- 1897.

--Investigations made at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Plymouth.

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. G. C. Bourne (Chair-

    man), Professor E. Eay Lankester {Secretary), Professor S. H.
    Vines, Mr. A. Sedgwick, and Professor W. F. R. Weldon,
    appointed to enable Mr. Walter Garstang to occupy a table at

     the laboratory of the Marine Biological Association at Plymouth
    for an experimental investigation as to the extent and character of
     selection occurring amoyig certain eels and fishes, and to cover the

      cost of certain apptaratiis.

The Committee have received the following report from Mr. Gar-

stang :

'I occupied the British Association table at the Plymouth Laboratory

during the last Easter vacation, and found the large experimental tank,

Awhich I had arranged to be built, ready for work.  number of pre-

liminary experiments upon the relations as enemies and prey between

certain small shore-crabs and shallow-water fishes were made during my

tenure of the table, and showed the feasibility of studying the process of

selection under the semi-natural conditions of a specially constructed

Aaquarium.  large number of coloured figures have been made under my

direction by Miss Willis, to illustrate the course and results of the

experiments.

    My' appointment, in May last, as naturalist at the Plymouth Labora-
tory compelled me, however, to resign my occupation of the British

Association table, and has temporarily interrupted the progress of the

work. This, however, will be resumed at an early date, and I hope to be

in a position to lay the results of the inquiry before the Association at

the Bristol meeting.'

--The Position of Geography in the Educational System of the Country.

     Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr. H. J. Mackinder
     {Chairman), Mr. A. J. Herbertson {Secretary), Dr. J. Scott
     Keltie, Dr. H. E. Mill, Mr. E. G. Ravenstein, and Mr. Eli

      SowERBUTTS. {Prepared by the Secretary?)

The holding of the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London,

in 1895, forcibly drew attention to the position of geography in our educa-
tional system. Sir Clements Markham, in his eloquent presidential address,
spoke most impressively of the inadequate manner in which geography
was treated in our country, and urged the need of altering this. In the
discussion on geographical education, the British members emphasised the
statements of the President, and a committee was appointed to draw up a
resolution on the subject of geographical education. The Committee de-
cided that any resolution proposed for adoption by an International Con-
gress should not reflect on the affairs of any country, but must deal with
general considerations applicable to all countries, and accordingly the
Committee proposed and the Congress passed the following resolution :

     ' The attention of this International Congress having been drawn by
the British members to the educational efforts being made by the British
Geographical Societies, the Congress desires to express its hearty sympathy
THE POSITION OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL. SYSTEM. 371

with such efforts, and to place on record its opinion that in every country
provision should be made for higher education in geography, either in the

univei'sities or otherwise.'

    At the meeting of the British Association at Ipswich in 1895, the
president of the Geographical Section, Mr. H. J. Mackinder, Reader in

Geography at Oxford, discussed the question of geographical education in

-- --his address contrasting British and German conditions and pointed out

the deficiencies as well as the merits of British geographers and teachers
of geography. Ultimately the Committee responsible for this report was

appointed to inquire into the position of geography in the educational

system of the country.

    No report on the position of geography in our educational system can

be adequate which does not take into account Dr. Scott Keltic's well-

known Report to the Council of the Royal Geographical Society published

as a supplementary paper of the Royal Geographical Society in 1885 (vol. i.,

Part IV.). It has not been thought necessary to discuss fully manv

matters dealt with in detail in Dr. Keltic's report, to which readers are

referred.

Unfortunately the Committee, owing to there being no funds at their

disposal, have not been able to undertake a personal inspection of various

educational institutions at home and abroad, such as that carried out by

Dr. Keltic. They have had to rely on their individual experiences as

teachers and examiners in geography, on a comparison of documents relat-

ing to geographical education published in this and other countries, and

on numerous correspondents, both at home and abroad, to whom they now

tender their best thanks for full and courteous replies to numerous

questions. In addition to those whose communications are printed in the

Appendix arc Professors Kan of Amsterdam, Malavialle of Montpellicr,
Neumann of Freiburg i. B., Penck of Vienna, Elisee Reclus of Brussels.

     There are obvious disadvantages about this method. Programmes

reveal the intelligence of their compilers but not the efficiency of those

Awho follow them in teaching.  good teacher can succeed in obtaining

excellent results with a poor syllabus, while an inefficient one may fail to

educate even when he follows a well-planned course.

Examination papers show the conceptions of geography held by the

examiners, yet the teaching may be of a much better or much worse type

than the nature of the examiner's questions would indicate. The personal

experience of members of the Committee as examiners has been of great

service in testing how far sound geographical instruction is given in

different institutions. The previous training of their own pupils is also

a valuable index of the work done in geography in our schools.

                1. ELEMENTARY EBUCATION.

                       A. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

   --Day Schools. In Dr. Keltie's report in 1885, it is stated that ' Geo-

graphy has been made compulsory, and must be taught according to a
generally prescribed method which, if carried out everywhere with intelli-
gence and enthusiasm, would be nearly all that could be desired.'

    Geography unfortunately is now only an optional subject in the
elementary schools in Great Britain. It may be one of the two possible

class subjects chosen from a number. Geography is taught in two-thirds

                                                                                                                BB2
372 REPORT-- 1897.

of the schools in England and AVales, and about 95 per cent, of those in

Scotland. In England and Wales in 1894-95, 15,250 schools took

geography out of 23,027 ; in 1895-96, 15,702 out of 23,075. In Scotland
in 1894-95, 2,990 schools out of 3,063 ; in 1895-96, 3,018 out of 3,094 chose
geography as a class subject.

The syllabuses of geography differ in the two countries. (See

Appendices I. and III.)

The English syllabus has not been altered  materially since  1885                    but
                                                                                  ;

the pupils no longer need to learn the geography of extra-European

countries, except British Possessions and the United States of America.

    Two alternative programmes are permitted by the Education Depart-

ment for England aiid Wales.

   ACourse differs little from the ordinary programme, but is better in

so far as it emphasises the study of climate and of industrial products.

    Course B has nothing about the world as a whole, but home geography

is taught in Standard II., and the geography of Asia and Africa in

Standard VII.

   A fourth programme is printed for a combined course in history and

--geography. Geography is taught only in the first four standards in I.,

II., and III., the syllabus is the same as in the normal course, but the

geography of Europe and Canada and Australia is prescribed for
AStandard IV.
               fifth scheme permits the teaching of geography in

Standard IV. and higher standards, when other class subjects have been

chosen in lower standards.

The Scottish syllabus does not differ greatly from the English ones,

but includes the ' Geography of the World in Outline.' Only one syllabus

is given in the Scottish Code.

The syllabus for Irish National Schools (Appendix IV.) lays more

stress on maps. It is taught in all but the two lowest classes. Physical
Geography forms a subject in the science programmes of the fifth and

iiigher classes, and may be one of two extra subjects for which results

"payments can be claimed.

The chief fault of these programmes is that while they permit an

extension of topographical information they make little provision for an

increase of geographical power. In them the more advanced classes in

geography learn about distant lands, but do not necessarily progress in
their knowledge of geographical principles. This is more important than

an accumulation of additional facts, and in many of Her Majesty's

Inspectors' reports the lack of this grasp of principles is deplored.

     The reports of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools in England and
Wales lead us to infer that a gradual, if slow, amelioration is going on

in elementary school teaching of geography, but that, while ' the ordinary

general facts in the text-books or manuals are generally well got up,' ' the

information is often too bookish and not sufficiently practical,' and that
' the want of definite scientific training in some teachers often leads to

imperfect or erroneous instruction in the important physical aspects of
the subject.'

     In Scotland Dr. Ogilvie reports the ' schools in which mere strings of
names and disjointed facts are glibly repeated are getting fewer and

further between.' The Scottish inspectors also point out, however, that

while sufficient attention is paid to topography, the other more educa-

tional and more practical branches of geography are often badly treated.

    When the geography syllabuses for foreign elementary schools are
       THE POSITION OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 373

 compared with those of this country, it is found that many recognise the

 need for more advanced geographical teaching in the higher forms. ^

   --Evening Continuation Schools. Geography is taught in many evening

continuation schools, and is reported to be an attractive subject. The
syllabus is given in Appendix VIII. The subject of elementary physio-
graphy is also taught, but it contains very little physical geography.

 B. THE TRAINING OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHERS IN
                                     GEOGRAPHY.

     The successful teaching of geography in our schools depends not so
much on sufficient syllabuses or efficient inspection as on properly trained
and enthusiastic teachers.

      Primary school teachers have opportunities for studying geography,
after passing the standards (1) during their apprenticeship at school, and

(2) in the training colleges.

     England and Wales. --Pupil teachers revise the geography of tlie world
in greater detail than in the school classes (Appendices IX. and X.).
This is the preliminary work necessary befoi-e attempting tlie training
college entrance examination, known as the Queen's Scholarship examina-
tion, which is on a restricted syllabus.

     In England and Wales this teaching is not of a very high standard,
judging from the examiners' reports. ' The answers to the general
questions showed that candidates had seldom been taught to group their
information upon any principle or to lay stress on the connection between
facts.' That is to say, the candidates seldom know any geography.

     Yet there are great inducements held out to those who know enough
geography to gain distinction in this examination. The best candidates
are rewarded by being ' released from the obligation to take up the subject

again in the training colleges, and are also exempt from it in the

certificate examinations.'

     The proportion of students who take geography in the resident
training colleges is very large, but this may be due to the enlightened
views of the principals of these colleges, who may realise the need for

thorough training in geography of all elementary school teachers, most of

whom will be called upon to teach it.

     The following table shows the numbers taking geography in their

certificate examinations.

        Year
374 REPORT-- 1897.

      The syllabus for the certificate examination varies from year to year,
 but the same paper is set for first and second year students. (See
Appendix XI.)

      The inspectors' reports show that the quality of the work depends
 largely on the quality of the teaching in the training colleges.

     In the certificate examinations the subject of physiography may also

 be taken. The syllabus followed is that of the Science and Art Depart-
 ment, which makes physiography equivalent to elementary physical
 science, and therefore a most useful preparation for physical geography,

--but by no means equivalent to it, and not to be confused with it.
     Scotland. In Scotland the Code for pupil teachers is much the same

 as that in England, but the syllabus of the Queen's Scholarship examina-
tion is more general. (See Appendices XII. and XIII.)

      The Scottish inspectors report that the ' attention given to climate and
 productions is inadequate,' and that the text-book apparently is still
the only geography book of many candidates.

     The standard of this examination is much higher than that in England

and Wales, for the Royal Geographical Society continues to give prizes
and certificates to the best candidates in Scotland, but not in England
and Wales.

     Perhaps this explains why the attention given to geography in the
 Scottish training colleges is so perfunctory, and why a smaller percentage

of candidates take geography in their certificate examinations in Scotland
than in England, for the rule excusing the better geographical students
from a further study of geography is in force in both countries.

     The Committee have been informed that the pupils in most Scottish
Training Colleges, whether they study geography necessarily or voluntarily,
do so by themselves. Their work, howevei', is prescribed by a master,
who sets an examination paper at intervals, and afterwards criticises the
work done by the students in these examinations.

     In the Scottish Code the subject is called ' Geography and Physio-
graphy,' and physiography is regularly taught in the training colleges.
This is obviously inadequate geographical training. The syllabus is given

in Appendix XIV.

  --Ireland. In Ireland monitors have to study additional geography to

that of the class in which they are enrolled (Appendix XV.). The entrance
examination to the Training Colleges contains little or no physical geo-
graphy. Geography must be studied during the first year at the Training

College, but is not a necessary subject of the second year's jcourse for

those who make 60 per cent, in the examination in geography at the end

of the first year (Appendix XVI.).
     In Ireland, even the Inspectors and their assistants must pass an

examination in geography (Appendices XVII. and XVIII.).

   --Other Cozmtries. In foreign lands teachers are usually more syste-

matically trained in geography, and programmes of their course of study

are given in Appendices XIX. to XXI.

2. SECONDARY EDUCATION.

                          A. SECONDARY SCHOOLS.^

  --England. In England we do not possess the guides to the position of

geography in secondary schools which could be followed in the case of

primary schools. Secondary education is still in an unorganised condition,

' The Public Schools are included in the term Secondary Schools.  ·
THE POSITION OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 375

and every vai-iety of geographical education can be met with, for geo-

graphy is actually not taught in some schools, while in a very few cases

it may be looked upon as the central subject of the curriculum.
     Several members of the Committee have had considerable personal

experience in conducting examinations in geography for secondary school

pupils. The Geographical Association, founded by secondary school-

masters interested in the teaching of geography, has been good enough to
place at the Committee's disposal the correspondence which was received
in a recent enquiry made by them concerning geography in secondary
schools. Selections from this correspondence show what diiferent treat-
ment is meted out to geography in different schools. The brief and

--Wepointed letter of one headmaster may be quoted here : ' Dear Sir,

have no army candidates and I have no interest in geography, yours truly,

,' and contrasted with that of another master, who wrote : ' Person-

myally, I found all  teaching, historic, literary, &c., on geography, and

the results are most encouraging.'

It is impossible, therefore, to form an accurate account of the position of

geography in secondary schools in England except by personal inspection.

In a few it is adequately recognised and admirably taught, in some it is

completely neglected, in the majority it is given to a master who has had

no training and often has no interest in the subject.

    As there is no authoritative body dealing with such schools in
England, the Geographical Association consider that the best way to

improve the position and teaching of geography in the existing conditions,

is to improve its position and quality in public examinations. Accordingly

a number of suggestions have been submitted to about three hundred

secondary schools for criticism, but only one-third have taken any notice

of them. (Appendix XXIIa.)

These replies have furnished the basis of a series of recommendations

which have been sent to the examining bodies affecting secondary schools.

(Appendix XXIIb.)

The examinations affecting secondary schools are those admitting to

the universities, the professional colleges, or different branches of the

-- --national service military, naval, civil the University Local Examina-

tions and the Examinations of the College of Preceptors and the Society

of Arts.

In some of the university and college entrance examinations geography

has a place in the examination paper in English, but in most cases it is a

very unimportant part of it. (See Appendix XXIII.)
    Geography has a prominent place in many of the examinations con-

ducted by the Civil Service Commissioners, but in some of the higher

examinations it should be awarded more marks ; for instance in the

Army Entrance examination, as is mentioned in the memorial of the

Geographical Association, which points out, however, that the style of

questions set in these examinations is improving.

In the University Local Examinations ' geography is a subject both

for the Junior and the Senior Certificate, and there has recently been

established a more ambitious scheme for the higher certificate.'
     The Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board conducts the examinations of

schools such as the Public Schools and the Girls' High Schools. ' In the
Higher Certificate Examination, Geography only comes in as incidental

to the examination in History.' Physical Geography and Elementary

Geology forms, however, an optional subject in this examination. Geo-
376 REPORT-- 1897.

graphy may be taken as an independent subject of examination for the
Junior Certificate, but is not compulsory. (See Appendix XXIV.)

     The College of Preceptors conducts examinations in schools either on
a syllabus drawn up by the college or by the school. In the former case
no geography is required in the first and second grades, but for the third

and fourth grades a syllabus is given. (See Appendix XXVa.)
     Schools may be examined in extra subjects, of which physical geo-

graphy may be one or the geography of two continents another.

      It is an optional subject in the professional preliminary examinationi

conducted by the College of Preceptors (Appendix XXVc.) ; but no com-

mercial geography is required for the commercial certificate.
     In the certificate examinations of the College of Preceptors candi-

--dates, in addition to other subjects, must choose one of the three

English, History and Geography ; but all may be taken. The out-

line of requirements seems to indicate that topographical and political
geography is all that is necessary ; except for first-class certificates, where-
' Geography, Political, Physical and Mathematical,' is the title employed.

     The Society of Arts conducts examinations in geography which are-
taken advantage of by many schools.

     Wains.--Mr. F. W. Phillips, Headmaster of the Newport Intermediate

and Technical School, writes : ' Geography is an obligatory subject in all
intermediate schools, to the extent that it must be introduced into the
curriculum somewhere or another. This does not necessarily imply that-
every form in the school will take it, for the letter of the regulation, though
perhaps not the spirit, would be complied with if but one form did so.
Generally speaking, it might be taken for granted that it will be attended

to in the lower school in all cases.

   --' Its fate in the upper school will depend upon :

     ' (a) The extent to which the different departments of the upper school

are developed
                                                                          ;
     ' (6) The ultimate attitude of the Universities towards the subject.

     ' The development of departments will vary with the si/e of the schooL
The final development would give at least three strong departments,
classical, science and commercial, each of which would be represented by at
least one form, called, say, the Classical Sixth, the Science Sixth, and the;
Modern Sixth. If the school be very strong there might be three corre-
sponding fifth forms. But, for the moment, take the three Sixths into
consideration. Will they do geography 1

     ' The Modern Sixth. Yes, certainly, a course of commercial geography.
     ' The Science Sixth. Hardly, unless thei-e were some distinct encourage-
ment for scientific geography in the chief science scholarships.
     ' The Classical Sixth. Not unless the subject be made a possible one

for university matriculation, or unless it were allied with history in
scholarship examination.'

   --^Scotland. Secondary education is somewhat better organised in

Scotland than in England. The academies and high schools prepare their
advanced pupils for the leaving certificate of the Scottish Education Depart-
ment or for the preliminary examinations of the Scottish Universities.

     In the examinations both of the Education Department and of the
Universities geography occupies a subordinate place in the examination,

in English.
      THE POSITION OF GEOGBAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 377

      The position of the Scottish Education Department has been clearly

 defined as follows :

     ' With regard to history and geography, my Lords have little to add to

 the remarks which they have made in previous years. These subjects
 enter largely into the curriculum of many schools ; they are required by

 many of the bodies by whom the leaving certificate is recognised, and my

 Lords are unwilling to do anything which would discourage the con-
 tinuance of such instruction. They endeavour to give a wide option inr

 the questions set, and to afford opportunity to all who have not entirely
 neglected the subjects to show a knowledge of them in some branch or
other. More than this they have not demanded, and do not propose to
 demand, as a necessary condition of a pass, but more extensive knowledge

 will receive ample recognition.' ^

     Candidates must answer one question, and a second question may be-

 attempted, if desii-ed, in the lower grade examination, while two ques-

tions must be answered, and three may be attempted, in the higher grade

 examination. Full marks can be obtained for honours grade certificates,

without any question in geography being answered. (Appendix XXVII.)

      ' The geography is in general faulty, and there is I'arely evidence that
this subject is taught in any methodical way, or presented to the pupils,
in such a manner as to make a vivid impression upon them.' ^

      In the preliminary examinations for the Scottish Universities two-
questions in geography have to be answered in one of the papers in
English for Arts and Science students, but only one question is compulsory

for medical students. (Appendix XXVI.)

      In the Edinburgh University Local Examinations elementary history
and geography form one compulsory subject in the preliminary, geography
and physical geography two optional subjects in the junior, geography an
optional subject in the senior, and commercial history and geography a-

--compulsory subject in the commercial certificate examinations.
      Ireland. Geography forms part of the paper set in the examinations
of Irish intermediate education. The reports of the examiners in recent
years indicate that some knowledge of topography is taught, especially of
the British Isles, but questions on physical geography are rarely well

answered. (See Appendix XXVIII.)

     Geography is also a part of the entrance and some Scholarship exami-

nations of Trinity College, Dublin (Appendix XXIX.) ; and one question

is usually set in this subject in the entrance examinations of the Royal

University (Appendix XXX.).

   --Other Couritries. In Dr. Keltic's report detailed accounts are given

of the position of geography in the secondary education system of foreign
countries. Since then some of the programmes have been modified, some-
for the better, others for the worse.

     In France geography is taught in every class of the Lycdes, and the

new programmes are given in Appendix XXXII. Professor Levasseur's

paper, read to the Sixth International Geographical Congress, gives a

useful comparison of old and new programmes.
     In Prussia geographers complain of a retrograde movement in the last

    ' Report for 1895, 6y Henry Ceaik, Esq., C.B., on the 'Inspection of Higher

Schools and the Examinations for Leaving Certificates,' p. 192.

378 REPORT-- 1897,

programme, especially in placing political before physical geography ; and

the German philologists and schoolmasters have passed a resolution
demanding that geography should be taught in every form or class of the
Gymnasium. Other German States have not followed the Prussian

authorities in this.

     In the United States of America a committee of ten appointed by the
National Education Association to enquire into secondary school studies
have recommended that physical geography should receive three hours'
teaching per week in the first year of secondary schools (age 14-15). In the
fourth year, in all save the classical forms, physiography, in the American
sense of the word (i.e. geomorphology), is suggested as an alternative with
geology for three hours' work per week. The committee which advised
the committee of ten about geographical education have unfortunately
neglected advanced geography, except in its physiographic or geomorpho-
logical and meteorological aspects.

        B. TRAINING OF SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS
                                 IN GEOGRAPHY.

   --United Kingdom. Our secondary schools need trained teachers in

geography far more than elaborate programmes. If the training of ele-

mentary school teachers leaves much to be desired, it is due not so much

to lack of organisation as to deficiencies in the ideals of the responsible

authorities. The secondary school master and mistress have had very little
chance hitherto of learning any geography, except privately or by going
to foreign institution.?. The most important educational work in the
immediate future is the provision of proper geographical training for
secondary school teachers, a training which will enable them to read maps
and think geographically, and not merely to read and reproduce the
words of a text-book, to regard geography as an interpretation of a living
world and not a catalogue of positions or definitions of directions.

     Most secondary school teachers in this country and abroad are trained
in the universities. But only two universities in the United Kingdom
recognise geography as an optional subject for the ordinary degree, while
a third has made it a minor subject necessary for a degree in History. In
none has it the position it occupies in the majority of even the smaller
Continental universities. There are facilities for learning some geography
at Oxford and Cambridge, and, to a slight extent, at the University Colleges
of England and Wales, as is noted in the next section of this report.
But it is to be regretted that so few masters and mistresses in our second-

--ary schools have been trained in modern geographical ideas and methods.
     Other Countries The German geographers, at their last biennial con-
gress at Jena in 1897, protest most strenuously against the deterioration of
geographical teaching in Prussia in recent years, owing to the new regula-

--tions which permit masters untrained in geography to teach it the normal

condition in the United Kingdom. On this matter Dr. H. Wagner, of Got-

tingen, says in his report of the proceedings of this Congress in the ' Scottish
Geographical Magazine ' (June 1897) : 'Besides the fact that the weekly
lessons in geography in the upper classes have been curtailed, a greater
evil lies in the practice of the heads of educational institutions to intrust

the teaching of geography to masters who have never studied the subject

at the university, or submitted their knowledge of this branch of learning
to the test of an examination. Dr. Fischer gave ample proofs of this from
      THE POSITION OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 379

statistics relating to the numerous schools of Berlin. Being convinced
that the higher school boards are not fully acquainted with this untoward
state of matters, or do not properly realise its consequences, the Geo-
graphical Congress resolved that Dr. Fischer's paper should be sent to all
the high schools of Germany.' But it must be borne in mind, as Dr. H. R.
Mill points out in his report ('Geographical Journal,' June 1897), that
' this does not mean that they [the teachers uncertificated in geography]
are not without a competent general knowledge of the subject, probably
better in all cases than that possessed by even the more intelligent
English teachers.'

     The conditions have not gone backwards in all German States. The

syllabus of geographical studies necessary to teach geography in the

Gymnasia of Austria and Baden are given in Appendices XXXIII. and

XXXIV.

     In Belgium the teacher of geography in an Ath^n^e is a doctor in

history and geography (Appendix XXXV.).

     In the French Lycdes, too, the teacher is usually an agr^ge in history
and geography. The syllabus for the agregation for 1896 is quoted in

Appendix XXXVI.

                      3. HIGHER EDUCATION.

                                  Universities and University Colleges.

  --England and Wales. In the United Kingdom there is one professor

and two lecturers in geography. The professorship is in King's College,
London. There has been a reader in geography at Oxford for ten
years, and a lecturer at Cambridge for eight years. In the Victoria
University geography is taught by the geologists and economists, while
for five years an independent lectureship in geography existed at the
Owens College, which was merged in that of political economy owing
to lack of funds, and not lack of interest. In the other university
colleges of England and Wales geography is taught to training college
students who have not done well in that subject in the Queen's Scholar-
ship examination, usually by the Master of Method, and in Birmingham

     In Cambridge geography is now a compulsory part of the Historical
Tripos (Appendix XXXVII.).

     After ten years' experience of geographical teaching Oxford has

resolved to make the readership in geography permanent, and geography
is recognised as an optional subject in the B.A. degree (Appendix
XXXVIII.).

     Victoria University now makes geography an optional subject in its

as a subject of university rank, and deal with it only in their entrance
examinations (and in the case of St. Andrews in the L.L.A. examinations,

for which, however, study at a University is not required).

                                             University Extension Courses.

     In England and Wales the university extension lecture system has
done something to help teachers of geography in various centres. In
1896-97, 4 courses of 25 lectures by London University Extension Lec-
turers, 5 of 12 lectures by Cambridge University Extension Lecturers,
4 of 6 lectures by Oxford University Extension Lecturers, and 1 of 12

--and 1 of 10 lectures by Victoria University Extension Lecturers in all

206 lectures.

                                                       Other Institutions.

     In the London School of Economics, in the Heriot-Watt (Technical
and Commercial) College, Edinburgh, there are lecturers in geography.
The London Chamber of Commerce and other bodies have aided in the
extension of geographical knowledge. The number of professional colleges
and schools teaching applied geography is small, although the specialised
branches of the subject ought to be dealt with in such institutions and
not in the ordinary schools. The absence of Commercial Geography
from the courses of many Higher Commercial Institutions is greatly to be

deplored.

                                                                   Foreign.

     In the April number of ' Petermann's Mitteilungen,' there is a list of
classes held and lectures being delivered at the universities and higher
schools in the German Empire, and the German parts of Austria
and Switzerland, on geography and allied subjects during the summer
session of 1897. From this list it appears that 85 professors in the
German Empire, 20 in Austria, and 9 in Switzerland are engaged in such
work, and if we omit the courses in geology and meteorology, and general
courses in statistics, anthropology, and ethnology, we find 51 professors in
the German Empire, 1 1 in Austria, and 5 in Switzerland, giving courses
in subjects that may be held as belonging more strictly to the domain of
geography, the number of courses being 98, 17, and 16 respectively. . . .
It would shed an instructive light on the difference of the estimation in

which geography is held as a branch of the higher education in this

country if we had for comparison a similar list for the United Kingdom,
and in the absence of such a list it may be worth while to point out
that in the list of the University Extension summer courses, given in
the April number of the ' University Extension Journal,' there are only
5 geographical courses, and even if we double this number so as to take
into account the classes held after lectures . . . we have only 10 summer
courses in England (in addition to any university courses that may be
going on), to compare with the 131 courses in German Europe.'

     In the ' Geographisches Jahrbuch ' for 1896, the following are the
numbers of geographical chairs and lectureships in the univei'sities and

--colleges of the chief countries : France, 41 ; German Empire, 35 ; Austria,

16 3 Italy, 16 ; Russia, 15 ; Belgium, 7 ; Switzerland, 7 ; United Kingdom,
5. The lecturers in the university colleges should perhaps be added to the

                            ' Geographical Journal, June 1897, pp. 660, 661.

number for the United Kingdom, which would then be raised. But it is

better to deduct every teacher in the foreign institutions who has

more than geography within his province, even though it be meteorology

--or ethnography, geology or history ; then the figures are for the German

Empire,  31  ;  France,  28 ;  Austria,  16 ;  Italy,  11                  and the United  King-

dom, 5. These figures do not include geographers such as Professors do

Lapparent and Levasseur in France, Oberhummer in Germany, Boyd

Dawkins and Lapworth in England, whose chairs combine geography with

other subjects.

     The position and nature of geographical work in Austrian and Belgian
universities is noted in Appendices XL. and XLI.

  4. GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETIES AND PUBLICATIONS.

    Any report on the position of geography in the educational system of

the country would be incomplete if it omitted to notice the excellent work
being done by the five British geographical societies. All of these, by
their lectures and publications, have done much to spread an interest in,
and true knowledge of, geography throughout the country.

     They have supported the better teaching of geography in our schools
and colleges, by giving awards, subscriptions, and other encouragement.
The Royal Geographical Society has trained many explorers. The lecture-
ships at Oxford and Cambridge are due to the initiative and hitherto
largely to the financial support of the Royal Geographical Society, and the
independent lectureship at the Owens College, Manchester, was main-
tained at the joint cost of the Royal and the Manchester Geographical

Societies.

     Short statements of the educational work done by British geographical
societies are given in Appendix XLII.

      In the last anniversary address to the Royal Geographical Society
(' Geographical Journal,' June, 1897), Sir Clements Markham, the Presi-
dent, outlined some of the educational schemes of the society :

   -- A(a) The Training of Explorers. ' diploma is to be granted to those

pupils of Mr. Coles who have gone through a complete course of instruc-

tion, and whose sufiiciency is certified to by a committee, consisting of the

--instructor and two members of our Council.'
     (b) The Training of Teachers. ' The Council has now resolved to give
a large measure of support, out of the Society's funds, to a London School

of Geography, if such an institution should be successfully established

under Mr. Mackinder's auspices. Our plans have been altered, as we

--acquired experience, but our aim has always been the same to train

good geographical teachers, and to promote the teaching of geography on
a sound basis in our secondary schools and universities.'

     The number of geographical societies in the United Kingdom is small,
5, when compared with 26 in France, 21 in Germany, 10 in Russia and
5 in Switzerland. The membership in the British siocieties is large,
but the Royal Geographical Society has more than half the total number
of members of the British societies. Of the 153 geographical publications
which appear regularly, 48 are in French, 42 in German, 15 in English
(6 American, 5 British, and 4 Australian), 12 in Russian, &c.

      In Germany, France, Switzerland, and Italy, National Geographical

Congresses are held. The Geographical Section of the British Association,

perhaps, may be compared with them, and it has undoubtedly helped

greatly in spreading an interest in geographical science.

5. CONCLUSION.

     In this report the questions of methods of teaching geography, the

importance of good maps and appliances, the need of open-air and museum

teaching as well as of frequent excursions, are not discussed, although in

the improvement of our methods lies much of the hope for the future.
At present, in the minds of many people, including some of our educa-

tional authorities, there is a very vague conception of the scope of

Wegeography and its educational value.     lack geographical traditions in

the British Isles, and will continue to be without them as long as our

teachers of geography are mainly self-taught or trained in different

foreign schools.

  --Elementary Education. In all elementary schools geography should be

made a compulsory subject, and the syllabuses of the different standards

modified as has been suggested on page 372 ; while instructions to inspectors
(see Appendix II.) should be improved, and embody loftier educational

ideals, such as those so admirably outlined in the ' Instructions, Pro-

grammes et Rfeglements. Enseignement Secondaire,' issued to teachers

by the French Education Department in 1890 (pp. 89 to 104).
     But the position of geography in our elementary schools could be very

much improved, without altering the present syllabuses, if pi'operly

trained teachers in geography and a satisfactory equipment of geographical

apparatus could be found in every school.

The first requirement for the progress of geography is that the teachers

themselves should be interested in the subject, and that they should be
given the means of a thorough geographical education in the training

colleges. Geography is, next to English, the most commonly taught sub-

ject under the present system, and therefore every elementary school

teacher should have a thorough grounding in modern geographical methods

and ideas. Its importance in the elementary school warrants its being

a compulsory subject in every year of the training college curriculum.

The spirit of the teaching, both in school and in college, should be
' education through geography,' the summary of the French work just

mentioned.

  --Secondary Education. The utilitarian as well as the educational

value of geography should ensure its being taught in every class and

form of our secondary schools, as is the case in France. Most subjects
taught in school have a geographical side, and are made more intelligible

by a knowledge of geography on the part of teacher and scholar ; and
geography should have an assured and independent place in every entrance

examination to universities or professional colleges.

     All secondary school teachers, however, will not need to teach

geography, and so all need not be geographers. Those who have charge

of the geography classes, however, should have had an adequate geo-

--graphical training, preferably at one of our universities.
     Higher Education. In our universities geography should have its due

place, equivalent to that of any other university subject now fully recog

nised. For degree examinations it should be an optional subject, both in
      THE POSITION OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 383

arts and science. It should be compulsory for some students in a minor
standard, for instance, for students reading for honours in history, or
anthropology and ethnology, or economics or geology. Teachers of geo-
graphy in the lower classes of secondary schools should have passed in
geography in this lower standard, while those responsible for the teaching
of geography in the highest classes should have taken honours in
geography. The universities should therefore provide the skilled teaching
and efficient equipment that are necessary for a subject regarded as of
first-rate importance by nearly every first-class university outside the

English-speaking lands.
     In all technical, commercial, and professional schools, general as well

as applied geography should have a more prominent place in the cur-
riculum than it occupies at present, both from an educational and
utilitarian point of view. This is of special importance in the case of com-
mercial colleges at a time when the competition for the markets of the
world is becoming very keen, and every little advantage of superior general
knowledge, such as economic geography, properly taught, can supply, counts
for much.

     The Chairman of the Committee was unfortunately prevented from
attending the meetings of the Committee after the first one, and Mr.
Sowerbutts was unfortunately too ill to be present when the final report
was considered. Both members, however, have had an opportunity of
revising the report. Mr. Sowerbutts wishes to lay even greater emphasis
on the importance of Commercial Geography for a commercial nation.

   --Note. In addition to the appendices given here the reader is referred

to the numerous programmes, examination papers, and opinions on geo-
 graphy printed with Dr. J. Scott Keltie's Report on Geographical Educa-

 tion.

    An admirable account of the position of geography in the educational

 system of France was given by Professor Levasseur to the Sixth Inter-
 national Geographical Congress in 1895. See Report of Congress,

 pp. 27-71.
      Professor du Fief gives a similar account, applicable to Belgium, in

 the ' Bulletin de la Soci^t^ royale beige de G^ographie,' xvi.

      Professor H. Wagner's papers on 'Methodik und Studium der
 Erdkunde ' in the ' Geographisches Jahrbuch ' should also be consulted.

      Some recent papers on Geographical Education were reviewed, in the
 'Scottish Geographical Magazine 'for 1896, by Mr. A. J. Herbertson,
 and those containing bibliographical notes were specially mentioned.

    A small volume for the use of teachers, ' Hints to Teachers and Students

 on the Choice of Geographical Books' (Longmans, 1897) has been com-
 piled by Dr. H. R. Mill.

     32. To obtain the mark ' good ' for Geography the scholars in Stan-
dard V. and upwards, not being half-timers, should be required to have
prepared three maps, one of which, selected by the Inspector, should be
drawn from memory on the day of inspection. Such maps, if of any part
of Great Britain and Ireland, should be accompanied by a scale of miles,
and if of large and distant countries by the lines of latitude and
longitude. Geographical teaching is sometimes too much restricted
to the pointing out of places on a map, or to the learning by heart
of definitions, statistics, or lists of proper names. Such details, if they
form the staple of the instruction, are very barren and uninteresting.

Geography, if taught to good purpose, includes also a description of the
physical aspects of the countries, and seeks to establish some associations
between the names of places and those historical, social, or industrial facts

which alone make the names of places worth remembering. It is espe-
cially desirable, in your examination of the Fourth and higher Standards,

that attention should be called to the English (sic !) Colonies and their
productions, government, and resources, and to those climatic and other
conditions which render our distant possessions suitable fields for emigra-
tion and for honourable enterprise. In order that the conditions laid

down for the geographical teaching of the lower classes may be fulfilled, a

globe and good maps, both of the county and of the parish or immediate
neighbourhood in which the school is situated, should form part of the
school apparatus, and the exact distances of a few near and familiar places
should be known. It is useful to mark on the floor of the schoolroom the

meridian line, in order that the points of the compass shall be known in

relation to the school itself, as well as on a map.

                                          Training Colleges.

                                       Elementary Teachers, ' Volkschule.'

     Understanding of maps and globes. Knowledge of the earth's surface,
physical and political, especially Europe, and more particulary Central

Europe. Map drawing, and geographical representation of the chief

elements of physical geography.

                                                     Teachers, ' Biirgerschule.'

     Mathematical, physical, and political geography of the world, of
Europe, and especially of Central Europe, and a thorough knowledge of
geography of native land.

     Knowledge of the Constitution and Organisation of the Austro-
Hungarian monarchy in general.

     General knowledge of commercial geography.
     Accuracy in dealing with comparative geography.
     Skill in map-drawing, and in the graphic representation of physical
geography.

XX. Programme of Course in Geography in the Training Colleges
                           OF THE Grand Duchy of Baden.

  --First Course. General geography. More detailed knowledge of

Germany.

  --Second Course. The five continents, with more detailed treatment of

Europe.

   --Third Course. Mathematical and physical geography. Knowledge

of the solar system.

     In teaching geography emphasis is to be laid upon the intelligent
understanding of a map, and upon gi'aphic descriptions of interesting

geographical incidents.

   -- --To this end globes and maps without the political divisions showing

the oro- and hydrographical relations, also the distribution of temperature
and of cultivated plants, should be selected for the earlier lessons.
Political geography comes later.

     Whilst in the preparatory school attention is more directed to topo-
graphical relations, in the training colleges it is more important to keep
in view the nature of the countries, their climatic conditions, their
characteristic animal and plant forms, and the life and occupations
of the people who inhabit them and are dependent on the soil for their

livelihood.

     The various countries will be treated with more or less detail according

to their importance.

     Map-drawing is to be diligently practised. In map-drawing the pupils

are to be so far advanced that they can draw a map of the school district

on an enlarged scale, showing all the geographical features.
      In the methodical introduction to geographical teaching liberal use is

to be made of atlases, wall maps, globes, telluria, and other apparatus in

 illustration.
       THE POSITION OF GEOGRAPHY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 395

XXI. Ordinance of the Grand Ducal Ministry op Justice, Culture,
     AND Education, Baden, December 19, 1884, respecting the Examina-

    tion FOR Women Teachers.

      Acquaintance with the most important points in physical and mathe-
matical geography general knowledge of the five continents, and special

                                                                              ;

knowledge of the native land in its physical and political aspects ; facility
in reading maps and in the use of globes and telluria.

                   2. SECONDARY EDUCATION.

                            A. SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

     XXII. Public Examinations in Geography and the Secondary

                                                      Schools.

 A Report on the Answers received to a Circular sent out in 1894-5 by the

                          Committee of the Geographical Association.

     In considering the best means of improving the teaching of geography
in Secondary Schools, the Committee was soon driven to the conclusion
that one of its earliest tasks must be to approach the various Boards of
Public Examiners.

     For the schools are necessarily compelled to adapt their teaching to
the requirements of the examinations for which they prepare their pupils.

And it is felt by the Committee that geography can never take its proper

place among subjects that train and educate the mind, so long as the
teaching of geographical principles is neglected, and the subject treated as
a mass of isolated facts, to be acquired by unintelligent cramming.

     They therefore addressed themselves in the first instance to the
Educational Committees of the Royal Geographical Society and the
Royal Colonial Institute ; and having received an assurance of their
sympathy and approval, they drew up four suggestions which they sent
out in the form of questions to about 300 Secondary Schools. To
these questions 92 answers have been received, including expressions of

--opinions from nearly all the great Public Schools a result that the Com-

mittee regard as satisfactory, considering the apathy that prevails on the

subject of geography in so many of our Secondary Schools.
     The following are the suggestions, together with a summary of the

opinions elicited in reply :

     (i.) That papers in Geography should be set and looked over by

Geographical experts.
     This meets with general approval, provided always that the examiner

has had experience in teaching and examining boys.

     (ii. ) That the princijyles of Physical Geography should form part of

every examination [in Geography].
     This is almost universally accepted, but a general wish is expressed

that the term Physical Geography should be limited and defined.

    (iii.) That the subject ' Geography ' as set, especially in the Army Ex-

aminations, is too loide and too vague, and that a subdivision of it loould

be a great advantage, so as to include, besides the 2Jrinciples of Physical
396 KEPORT--1897.

Geography, the Physical, Political, Historical, and Commercial Geography

of some Continent.
     All are agreed that the subject is at present too wide and vague, and

many express the wish that a syllabus or text-book should be issued by

authority for the guidance of teachers and examiners alike.
     The suggestion that the Geography of some particular Continent should

be set for each examination finds many supporters, but the weight of

opinion is in favour of requiring a general knowledge of the Geography of
the earth, as well as a special study of some selected area, such as a
Continent, India, or the British Colonies, the subject to vary from time

to time.

      It is also suggested that a larger choice of questions should be given,
of which the candidate should be allowed to attempt only a certain
number.

     (iv.) That in Competitive Examinations Geography ought either to be
comjjulsory or to receive a sufficient number of marks to make it ^ pay.'

    As regards the Army Examinations, it is generally felt that Geography
ought to be a compulsory subject, and many think that the marks at

present assigned to it are insufficient. Some regret the abolition of the

Army Preliminary Examination j but a few declare themselves to be well

satisfied with the present arrangement.

    As to other Examinations, opinion is divided ; and while many would

be glad to see more weight given to Geography, they point out that this
could only be done by sacrificing some other subject, and they deprecate
any action that would tend to increase the existing strain and pressure.

--XXIIa. Memorandum of Reforms in Examinations in Geography

     Advocated by the Committee of the Geographical Associa-

      tion.

     1. That the main principles of Physical Geography should form the
basis of Geographical teaching at all stages, and should be fully recognised
in all Examinations in Geography.

     2. That a general knowledge of Geography, based on Physical Prin-
ciples, should be required, together with a special study of some selected
region, e.g. India, a group of British Colonies, South America, Central
Europe.

     3. That it is desirable that all Public Examining Bodies, such as the
Civil Service Commissioners, the Universities (in their Local and Certi-
ficate Examinations, and London Matriculation), and the College of Pre-
ceptors, should recommend a course of instruction in accordance with the
ideas suggested above. This would stimulate Geographical teaching in
Schools, ensure that Geography should be systematically taught through-
out the School, and do away with the need for separate classes to prepare
candidates specially for the various Public Examinations in Geography.

     4. That in the Examinations above referred to. Geography and History

should be dealt with in separate papers, and that the maximum of marks

should be approximately the same for each.

XXIII. Geography in the Entrance or Matriculation Examinations

     ' ' The headings of the syllabus for the first class,' says the official programme,
' have appeared already in those of the preceding classes. The interest of this
course rests entirely in the questions the professor chooses to discuss, and the way
he puts the most important. They are of every variety. It is not enough to teach
the pupils, who are about to become men, what are the leading powers of the
present day by their agricultural and industrial products and their commercial

activity. No doubt these are important points ; but these are not the only ones
that should be compared. An attempt should be made to distinguish the charac-
teristic traits of each of the States with which we have dealings, to determine in

what measure the land and the people and their racial characteristics have contri-
buted to the prosperity and power of a nation, to compare the part played in
history by a people with its present condition, to realise what is the actuality on
which we should fix our attention in each different part of the world : such are
the aims of this course. It should be looked upon as the last chapter in the history

of civilisation.'

 XXXIII. Excerpts from the Regulations for the Examination

         OF Teachers in Gymnasia and Realschulen in Austria.

      For gymnasia a teacher may choose geography and history as a chief

 subject, for Realschulen geography as minor subject.
      The programme in geography is

    A thorough knowledge of the earth in mathematical, topographical,

 physical, and political aspects ; a satisfactory acquaintance with European
 countries, together with the geography of Central Europe, especially that
 of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy.

      The examinee must have made himself acquainted with the statistics
 of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in relationship to other lands.

      The present positions, conditions, and routes of international
 commerce must be thoroughly known.

      The examinee must show readiness and certainty in every sort of

 graphic representation used in instruction.

--XXXIV. Excerpts from the Regulations for the Examina-

     tion OF Teachers in Middle Schools in the Grand Duchy op

      Baden.

      Candidates must have been at a German gymnasium or Realgym-
 nasium (for certain candidates), and three years at a German University.

      There are three grades of examination, 3, 2, and 1. Those passing in
 the third grade can teach in the Sixth, Fifth, and Fourth Forms of gymnasia
 and modern schools (Realanstalten) with a nine years' course ; those
 passing in the second grade, in the Lower and Upper Third and Lower
 Second Forms ; and those passing in the first-grade, in the Upper Second
and the Lower and Upper First Forms.

      Only those who receive a first-class certificate in the first grade can

teach in all classes.

     Two major and two minor subjects must be chosen, and two major

and one minor subject must belong to the group of Languages and History,
or else to the group of Mathematics and Science. Geography is an

exception, and may be reckoned as a major subject in either group.

Geography must be a minor subject if history is a major subject.
     The programmes in Geography are as follows :

      1 For the certificate in Geography for the loiver classes (third grade)
the candidate must show evidence of an elementary but sound knowledge
of mathematical, physical, and more particularly of topographical and
political geography ; he must also be able to illustrate the most im-
portant facts of mathematical geography with simple apparatus.

     2. To obtain the certificate for the middle classes {second grade) the
candidate must possess a more thorough knowledge of the above-men-
tioned branches of geography, also an acquaintance with the history of
discovery, and with the historically most important highways of the

world's commerce.
     3. The candidate for a certificate to teach in the highest classes {first

grade) must be thoroughly familiar with the principles of mathematical
geography, so far as these are founded on elementary mathematics, and

                                                                              DD 2
404 REPORT-- 1897.

with the proofs of the same, and be able to give an account of the
 physical and most important geological conditions of the earth's sur-
face. In addition he must have a comprehensive knowledge of the
political geography of the present day, and a wide view of the historical
political geography of the chief civilised peoples, together with the main

 facts of ethnography.

    A4. readiness in map drawing is demanded from candidates in all

 grades.

      XXXV.--Requirements of a Teacher of Geography in a

                                 Belgian Athenee Royal.

     One professor teaches both history and geography. This professor,
except by personal dispensation, must have either the old diploma of
Professeur agrege de VEnseignement Moyen poior les ffumanites or the
diploma of Docteur en Philosojjhie et Lettres, the only one now given.

     For the degree of Candidal en Philosojyhie et Lettres he must study
geography, and, for the doctorate, geography and the histoiy of

geography.

all of which are judged by the professors under whom the candidate has

studied. The second part of the examination takes place before special
examiners. The subjects for 1896 were :

                                             (I History.) II. Geography.

    Form and divisions of globe.

XXXVII. Excerpt from Report by Mr. Yule Oldham, M.A.,

     Lecturer in Geography in the University op Cambridge, to the

    Royal Geographical Society, May 1897.

      ' Geography has received the practical recognition of being introduced
as an essential part of the new revised Historical Tripos.'

XXXVITI. Excerpt from Communication by Mr. H. J. Mac-

     kinder, M.A., Reader in Geography, University of Oxford, on
     the Position op Geography in that University.

     ' In almost all the papers set in the Honour School of Modern History
at Oxford there are two questions on Geography, which, if well done,
count considerably. As a result, the greater number of the candidates
find it worth their while to attend the lectures of the Reader in Geo-

graphy.

      ' Geography counts as an optional subject for a Pass degree, and is
taken by a few candidates.'

XXXIX. Excerpt from Communication by Professor A. W.

     Ward, LL.D., D.C.L., Principal of the Owens College, Man-
     chester, on the Position op Geography in that College and in

     THE Victoria University.

     ' The new Regulations (Victoria University) substitute, for the old

optional Preliminary subject of Physiography, the following :

                                                   ' geography.

effects of Natural Features and conditions.
      * Outlines of Geography of the British Empire (including Historical
Geography), Political and Commercial Geography of the United Kingdom.

     ' You will perceive that this amounts to the inclusion of geography only

in the first year's course ; but apart from the fact that it has been thought

wiser, in dealing with this subject, to begin with the foundations, we were

specially anxious to recognise it in the first instance as a university sub-

ject at the stage where school and university training came into contact.
     ' The College remains without any endowment for the teaching of

geography, since both the Royal and the Manchester Geographical Societies
have discontinued the grants (of 50Z. each) made by them during periods
of five and four years respectively.

     ' The teaching of the subject will accordingly, in this College, be for
the present divided between Mr. Flux (Lecturer in Political Economy),
who has been appointed Lecturer in Political and Commercial Geography,
and Professor Boyd Dawkins, Professor of Geology '

XL. Excerpts prom Communications received from Professor
    Penck, of Vienna, on the Position op Geography in Austrian

      Universities.

' In the regulations for University examinations the word geography is

scarcely mentioned, and the syllabus in it is of the most general descrip-

tion. That, however, lies in the nature of German University organisa-

tion. The examiner has the right to specify the range of subject in which

he will examine, and thus he promotes individualisation. He can ask

more from the more talented and less from the less brilliant students ;
can go into details in the case of specialists, &c. The University examina-

tions are not meant to test the whole extent of the candidate's knowledge,

but to prove its depth and thoroughness. , . .

'The candidate for a degree in an Austrian University has two

examinations to pass, the minor one in Philosophy, the major one in two

subjects in one of which he must submit a thesis. If the subject of his

thesis be geographical, then he is examined in Geography, and another

science, such                         as  Geology, Meteorology,  Physics,  Chemistry, or  History.

    XLII. Reports on the Educational Work of the British

                                    Geographical Societies.

                                             Eoyal Geographical Society.

     ' The Royal Geographical Society, in addition to providing systematic
training for intending explorers, has taken a leading part in improving

ordinaiy geographical education.
     ' So far as can be traced, the first instance of encouragement given to

general geographical instruction was through the Society of Arts. In
1866 it was resolved that a prize of 51. be granted to candidates at the
Society of Arts Examination for Geography. This grant continued to be
made till 1873, when the Society of Arts intimated that they had discon-
tinued the award of a prize for geography.

      ' Prizes for geographical teaching in the great public schools were first
awarded by the Society in 1869 and continued to be awarded till 1883.
It is admitted that they had little or no influence in bringing about the
object in view, the recognition of geography as a regular subject in the
curriculum of our public schools.

     'In addition to this, in 1876 silver medals were awarded in connection
with the geography paper in the Oxford and Cambridge Local Examina-
tions. These medals continue to be awarded ; in these examinations
geography occupies a really important place, and the number of candi-
dates is very large.

     'In 1882 the Council instituted prizes to be awarded for geography
examinations to the cadets on board the training ships Worcester and
Conway. These continue to be awarded, with satisfactory results.

      'In 1884 the Society appointed Dr. Scott Keltic as an Inspector of

geographical education for one year, and authorised him to make a collec-

tion of books and appliances used in teaching geography.

   --'The result of this action on the part of the Council was (1) the

appointment of a Reader in Geography at Oxford for five years, in
February 1887, at a stipend of 300^., to be paid half by the Society and
half by the University. (2) The appointment in June 1888 of a Lecturer
in Geography at Cambridge, to whose stipend the Society would con-

tribute 1501. annually. As the Lecturer first appointed never entered on
his office, a new Lecturer was appointed in May 1889, the Council agree-

ing to pay its contribution to his stipend for five years from the date of
his appointment. This was renewed for five years in January 1893.

A(3) contribution of 50?. annually by the Society towards Travelling

Scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge for four years from June 1891.

A(4) contribution of 601. a year from 1886 to 1891 to the Oxford

University Extension. (5) Contribution of 50?. a year for three years

towards the stipend of a Lecturer on Geography at Owens College,

being a statement in the Commissioners' Report that Geography should

have a place in the first rank in the new University.

' The total sum spent by the Society in the last eleven years in the

endeavour to improve geographical education in this country amounts to

over 6,000/.

' The Council have in 1897 agreed to contribute largely to the support

of the London School of Geography proposed by Mr. Mackinder.'

                                       Royal Scottish. Geographical Society.

   --'One of the objects for which the Royal Scottish Geographical Society

was founded is stated as follows : " To press for the recognition of geo-
graphy as a branch of higher education, and to encourage its study in the
Schools and Universities of Scotland by offering prizes or by other means."

     ' In pursuance of this object the Council, in June 1886, sanctioned a
scheme for the encouragement and improvement of the teaching of geo-
graphy in elementary Scottish schools by means of examinations and
prizes ; and through the courtesy of the Royal Geographical Society

they obtained the loan of its collection of appliances used in geographical

education, and exhibited them in the Museum of Science and Art, Edin-

burgh ; they also arranged for a series of lectures on the teaching of geo-
graphy, which were delivered at the same time in the Museum. The
scheme of examinations and prizes was abandoned in 1891 in favour of
courses of educational lectures for the benefit of teachers and others ; and
such courses have, with the exception of the year 1895-96, been delivered
annually since January 1891.

     'In October 1890 the Council, through its President, the Duke of

Argyll, petitioned the Universities Commissioners to recognise the claims
of geography as a department of higher education, urging that the subject
should be included in every University preliminary or entrance examina-
tion, and that it should be accepted as one of the optional pass subjects
qualifying for a degree in arts and in science ; also that provision should

be made for the systematic teaching of geography within the Universities,
or within one or more of them, by the foundation either of professorships

or of lectureships fully equipped with the necessary apparatus in maps,
charts, globes, and models.

     ' The Council enumerated the beneficial results that would follow on
the adoption of their recommendations, and gave an account of what was
being done for the systematic study of geography in the Universities of

other countries.

     ' In reply to the above petition the Council was informed, in January
1893, that by Ordinance No. 11 ("Regulations for Degrees in Arts") a
knowledge of geography was required of every candidate for the pre-
liminary examinations, and that a similar regulation affecting the
preliminary examinations in science had been issued ; it was also inti-
mated that no lectureship had yet been founded, but that the University
Courts had the power to institute them, though it seemed probable that
the necessary funds would have to be raised by private benefaction.'

                       Manchester Geographical Society.

From its foundation the Manchester Geographical Society has done

much to aid the spread of sound geographical knowledge in Lancashire,

Cheshire, and Yorkshire by school examinations, popular lectures, and
subscribing half the stipend of the lecturer in geography at the Owens

College as long as there existed an independent lectureship in that subject.

The reports of the examination scheme are found in the volumes of the

A* Journal.'  full account of the popular lecture scheme of the society

was read at the Liverpool  meeting  of  the  British Association,  1896                       an

We* have made several attempts here to press the special study of

geography in the local schools, both private and public, on some occasions

offering prizes for examination, but have experienced great difficulty,

owing to the apathy of teachers, who declare that the number of code

subjects already in force is so great that they hesitate to voluntarily take

Weup another special subject.       admit all teachers and pupils to our
--lectures at reduced charges have even done it free, and they will not

come.

--The Glimatology of Africa. Sixth Beport of a Committee, consisting

     of Mr. E. G. Ravenstein (Chairman), Sir John Kirk, Mr. G. J.
      Symons, Dr. H. R. Mill, and Mr. H. N. Dickson (Secretary).

(Drawn wp by the Chairniian.)

--Instruments. Your Committee in the course of last year granted a

set of instruments to Mr. G. W. Herd man, C.E., who until recently

resided, at Johannesburg, in the South African Republic. That gentle-

man, being at present engaged upon surveys in the Orange Free State, has

been unable to make the observations desired by your Committee. He

handed over his instruments to Mr. Hopwell J. S. Morrell, B.A. Oxon.,

who appeared to be well qualified for the work, but who has since left

AJohannesburg, taking the instruments with him.          fresh set of instru-

ments has been ordered for Mr. Herdman, who has forwarded a draft for

10/. to defray its cost.

     The Rev. Mr. Ormerod, of Golbanti, on the river Tana, has been

granted a rain-gauge.

The Committee have likewise been requested by the Foreign Office to pro-

cure suitable sets of instruments for Nyasaland. This has been effected at a

total cost of 66/. 8s. 10c?., for which two mercurial barometers, two maxi-

mum and two minimum thermometers, two hygrometers, twelve ordinary

thermometers, and fourteen rain-gauges have been procured. The two sets

of instruments previously forwarded by the Committee to Nyasaland have
been made over to her Majesty's Commissioner, subject to the condition

that the observers to whom they have been granted shall be permitted

to retain these instruments as long as they are willing to make good use

of them, and send the results to the Committee.

     All the above instruments were inspected by our Secretary before they

were forwarded, and the usual Kew certificates have been obtained.

     For this Foreign Office grant we are indebted to the interest taken in

scientific work by the Right Hon. G. Curzon, and to the advocacy of the
late Commissioner, Sir Harry Johnston.

Observations have been received from eighteen stations in Tropical

--Africa.
    Nyasaland. The supply of instruments recently forwarded will make

it possible to equip a series of meteorological stations extending from

Chinde, on the coast, to the southern end of Tanganyika. Mr. Alfred

Sharpe, her Majesty's Acting Commissioner, and Mr. J. McClounie, the
head of the scientific department of the Protectorate, take much interest

in the work, and have promised to promote the objects of your Committee

to the best of their power.

     In the present report we are able to publish abstracts of two years'
observations made by our old and valued correspondent, Mr. J. M. Moir,

at Lauderdale. Mr. Moir is, after a holiday at home, about to return to

Nyasaland ; but his work has been continued during his absence by Mr.

WeThomson.  are also enabled, through the courtesy of Mr. A. Sharpe,

to publish rainfall observations for ten stations. Earlier unpublished

observations for Livingstonia have been added from the note-book of the

--late Mr. Stewart.
     British East Africa. The usual reports have only been received up to
June last, and we therefore defer their publication until the reports for a

full year shall have come to hand.

    The Scottish missionaries at Kibwezi, to whom your Committee

granted a set of instruments last year, have regularly sent in their

registers since July last. They have been kept with much care, and

include hourly observations for sixteen term- days, the first of the kind

received from this protectorate.

   A return of one year's rainfall at Mumia's, in Kavirondo, has been

received from Mr. C. W. Hobley, who also forwards a few observations

made with a Symons's earth-thermometer.

   --Uganda. Through the kindness of the Foreign Office, we hope to be

enabled to publish in our next report full meteorological records for a
number of stations. In the meantime we present abstracts of fourteen

months' observations on the variations in the level of the Victoria

    Western Africa. No observations whatever have been received from

Bolobo, on the Congo, and Lambarene, on the Ogowai. From Warri

(Benin) only one month's record has come to hand.

   We have learnt with regret that the Rev. Bonzon, at Lambarene, is

dead, and have taken steps to obtain his meteorological registers, and to

recover the instruments which were lent him.

The abstracts published have been made by the Chairman of the

Committee.

Your Committee have expended their grant. They propose that they

be reappointed, and that a grant be made of 10^.

     The following are the stations for which meteorological returns will be

found in this report :--

     Chiromo (16° 31' S., 35° 10' E., 300 ft.) on the Shire. At Port Herald, 27 miles

lower down, 35 in. fell in 1893.
      CJiiJiTvawa (16° 1' S., 34° 56' E., 350 ft.) on the Shire, at the foot of the road

leading up to Blantyre.
     Nyamtetl Plantation, position uncertain, described as lying in the Cholo district,

which is to the east of the road leading up to Blantyre. Observer : J, N. Cox.
     Mandala (15° 48' S., 35° 2' E.), 1 mile to the south of Blantyre. In 1890

54-9 in. fell on 82 days (F. J. M. Moir). At Blantyre 50-8 in. fell in 1882, 52-9 in. in
1883, and 55-9 in. in 1886.

     Zomla (15° 23' S., 35° 20' E., 2,970 ft.). In 1892 5277 in. fell on 95 days, in 189$
38-06 in. on 79 days. At Namitemle, on the road to Mpimbi, on the Upper Shire,
82-32 in. fell in these two years (1892 and 1893) on 186 days.

     Lauderdale Estate, Mlanje (16° 2' S., 35° 36' E., 2,580 ft.). The observations for
1896 were made by Mr. Thomson, those for previous years by Mr. J. W. Moir.

     The ' Crater ' is an old crater or a basin cut by the Mloza Stream. It lies 2 miles
to the N.E. of Lauderdale, at an elevation of about 4,500 ft.

      Nyasaland Coffee Company's Estate, Mlanje, 4 miles S.E. of Lauderdale.
      Bunraven, a Mlanje plantation, 10 miles S.E. of Lauderdale, near Fort Anderson.
     At Fort A7iderson (16° 6' S., 35° 43' E.) 64-25 in. of rain feU on 164 days in 1893.

    FoH Johnston (14° 40' S., 35° 12' E.) on the Upper Shire. The station of the

African Lakes Company lies to the north, at the southern extremity of Lake Nyasa.

      Livingstonia (14° S., 34° 45' E., 1,570 ft.).

     Lihovia (12° S., 34° 40' E., 1,570 ft.), a station of the Universities' Mission, on an island
near the eastern shore of the lake. The rainfall is considerably less than on the western
shore at Bandawe. In 1892-93 37-87 in. fell, as compared with 5235 in. at Bandawe.

     Bandame (11° 55' S., 34° 5' E.). The observations in 1896 were made by Mr.
K. S. Prentice. The mean annual rainfall for seven years amounts to 67-23 in.
(ranging from 50-53 to 9259 in.). Eain fell on an average on 74 days (57 to 126),

but it seems that these earlier records were not quite complete, no account having

been taken of the lesser rains which fell between May and September. At Njuyu,
on the plateau to the west, the rainfall is much less. The annual fall for four years,
for which we have synchronous records, amounted to 5502 in. (on 67 days) at

Bandawe, and to only 2446 in. (on 41 days) at Njuyu.
     Tanganyiha Plateau. The rainfall is considerably less than near the lakes.
     At Maliwanda the rainy season extends from November to April, and 36-19 in.

fell in 1882-83 (Mr. Stewart's notebook).

    At Jltawa 29-5 in. fell in 1895 (according to Mr. Dewar, of the Mwenzo Mission),
and at Fmamlo the mean for two years (1893-95) was 39-5 in.

Part I. A New Apparatus for Studying the Mate of Condensation of

     Steam on a Metal Surface at Different Temperatures and Pressures.

    By Professor H. L. Callendar, a7id Professor J. T. Nicolson.

As the result of some experiments by electrical methods on the measure-

ment of the temperature changes of the walls and steam in the cylinder of
a working steam-engine, which were made at the McDonald Engineering
Building of McGill University in the summer of 1895, the authors arrived
at the conclusion that the well-known phenomena of cylinder condensation
could be explained, and the amount of condensation in many cases
predicted from a knowledge of the indicator card, on the hypothesis that
the rate of condensation of steam, though very great, was not infinite, but

finite and measurable. An account of these experiments was communi-

cated to the Institution of Civil Engineers in September 1896, and will, it
is hoped, be published in the course of the ensuing session. In the mean-
time, the authors have endeavoured to measure the rate of condensation
of steam under different conditions by a new and entirely different method,
with a view to verify the results of their previous work, and also to estimate
the influence, if any, of the film of water adhering to the walls of the cylinder.

     In considering the condensation of steam on a metal surface, it is usually
assumed that the surface exposed to the steam is raised up to the
saturation temperature corresj)onding to the pressure of the steam, and
that the amount of condensation is limited by the resistance of the water-
films to the passage of heat from the steam to the metal and from the

metal to the water. If the steam contains air, there may also be a

considerable resistance due to the accumulation of a film of air on the
surface, but it is comparatively easy to exclude this possibility in
experimental work.

     In the steam-engine experiments above referred to, it was practically
certain that the water-film due to the cyclical condensation never
exceeded one-thousandth of an inch in thickness, and that the resistance

offered by it was unimportant. At the same time, it appeared clear that

the temperature of the surface of the metal at its highest was considerably
below the saturation temperature of the steam, a condition which could
only be explained by supposing the rate of condensation of steam on a
surface to be limited by some physical property of steam itself, apart from
the resistance of the condensed film of water. Interpreted in this manner,

the experiments led at once to the conclusion that the rate of condensation

at any moment was simply proportional to the difference of temperature
between the saturated st^am and the surface on which it was condensing.

     The limit thus found was shown to be capable of explaining many of
the phenomena of cylinder condensation in a rational manner, but the
method by which it was establisned was of an indirect and somewhat

intricate character, and appeared to require some simpler and more direct

confirmation.

     If the rate of condensation of steam were really infinite, it should be

possible, by ta suitable modification of the surface-condenser method, to
obtain values of the condensation considerably in excess of those given by
the formula deduced from the temperature cycle observations.

     To accomplish this, it is necessary to eliminate as completely as possible
the resistance to the passage of heat of the water-films between the steam
and the metal, and between the metal and the circulating water, and at

the same time to measure as accurately as possible the temperature of the

metal.

     These considerations led to the form of apparatus shown in the figure.
The resistance to the passage of heat from the metal to the condensing
water in this apparatus is practically eliminated by employing a thick
cylinder, 5 in. diameter and 2 ft. long, with a screw thread cut on its outer
surface. Water from the high-pressure mains is forced to circulate round
this surface with a very high velocity, in the narrow space between the

                                                                                                            EB2

cylinder and the surrounding tube. In this manner it is possible to obtain

a very uniform temperature for the external surface, differing but little

from that of the circulating water.

    If the cylinder is made sufficiently thick, its temperature may he

approximately determined at any depth by inserting mercury thermometers.
It was intended at first to use thermo-couples for this purpose, but the
apparatus in this form would have been unsuitable for students' use in the
ordinary course of laboratory work, which was one of the primary objects
in view in the construction. It would also have been desirable to make
the cylinder of copper, which would have reduced the resistance of the
metal to the lowest point. The authors were compelled, however, to
content themselves for the time with cylinders of cast iron and of mild

steel.

     The internal surface of the cylinder, upon which the steam was

condensed, was a hole one inch in diameter, drilled in the solid metal. In

order as far as possible to minimise the resistance of the surface film of

condensed water, a revolving bx'ush was constructed of very thin strips of

steel to wipe the surface five or six times a second. This wiper was found

to wear in a very short time to so perfect a fit, and the water-film must

have been so energetically stirred, that its resistance to the passage of

heat must have been far less than that of the best conducting metal.

Under these conditions, if the rate of condensation of steam were

infinite it should have been possible to obtain a rate of condensation many

times greater than the limit deduced from the cylinder condensatioii

experiments above mentioned.

On making the experiment, however, it was found that the wiper

made very little difference to the amount of condensation. With the

Aviper revolving at the rate of 160 per minute, the condensation was

increased by about 5 per cent, on the average of several experiments. It

may be concluded from this that the drops of condensed water with which

the surface is partially covered are in such rapid motion that they do not

appreciably obstruct the passage of heat from the steam to the metal.

A film of the same average thickness, if it were absolutely quiescent, and

if its conductivity, as generally estimated, were only one-hundredth of

that of cast iron, would no doubt prove a serious obstacle, but, as a matter

of fact, the viscosity of water at these temperatures is so small, and the

motion so rapid, that the drops cannot be treated as a quiescent film.

The temperature at various distances from the inner surface of the

cylinder was determined by means of mercury tliermometers inserted to a
depth of 8 or 9 inches in holes drilled parallel to the axis. From the

temperatures so observed, the conductivity of the metal and the tempei-a-

tures of its inner and outer surfaces could be approximately inferred. It

was found, however, that the presence of the holes interfered materially

with the flow of heat through the metal, and that the readings of the

thermometers under these conditions were not altogether trustworthy.

From a number of observations on the cast-iron cylinder, a conductivity

of 5-3 thermal units (pound degi-ee) Fahr. per square foot per minute was

deduced  for a gradient of  one degree  F.  per  inch                         a result which agrees
                                                                           ;

very closely with the authors' previous determination by a different

method. For the steel cylinder a conductivity of 5 '8 was similarly

deduced. These results apply to a mean temperature of about 140° F.,

and are much lower than the values generally assumed for iron.

In order to verify the authors' previous result as to the rate of

condensation of steam, the temperature of the inner surface of the metal
was calculated on the assumption of a rate of condensation equivalent to
0'74 T.U.F. per second per square foot per degree F. difference of

temperature. The values so found agreed with the observed temperatures
within the limits of error of the observations. Owing to the inferior
conductivity of the iron, the test was not altogether satisfactory, as the
difference of temperature between the steam and the surface rarely
amounted to as much as 30 degrees. With a cylinder of pure copper, and

using thermo-couples for determining the temperature at a given depth, it
should be possible to obtain a more certain confirmation by this method.

     In performing the experiments, a number of variations in points of
detail were introduced from time to time. The flow of the circulating
water was varied in velocity, and directed in different ways. In order to
secure uniformity in the distribution of temperature measured in different
directions from the centre, the spiral circulation was found to be essential.
In the second apparatus, the screw thread was at first replaced by a baffle
plate, which was intended to direct the water into a spiral course, but the
results found were unsatisfactory.

     In some cases steam was admitted from the top of the apparatus, and
in other cases from the bottom. With the steam supply at the bottom, it
was found that the condensed water refused to drain down the vertical

1 inch tube in opposition to the current of steam, although the maximum

velocity of the steam could not have exceeded 10 feet per second.

     The following set of observations, each of which represents the mean

of several taken on different days under similar conditions, will sufficiently

indicate the general nature of the results.

     The observations taken at different pressures do not indicate any-
marked difference in the rate of condensation per degree-second. These
results, so far as they go, are in agreement with the authors' previous
work, but they hope to be able to obtain more conclusive evidence.

Part II. An Electrical Method of Measuring the Temperature of a Metal
    Surface on which Steam is Condensing. By H. L. Callendab, M.A.,

     F.Ii.S., Professor of Physics, McGill University, Montreal.

The object of the following experiments, which were made at the

McDonald Physics Building with a different apparatus, was the measure-

ment of the temperature of the metal surface itself by a more direct and

accurate method. It was also desired to verify as exactly as possible

whether the rate of condensation of steam at atmospheric pressure were

the same as at the higher temperatures and pressures at which most of the

preceding experiments were made.

The condenser used for these experiments was a very thin platinum

tube, a quarter of an inch in diameter and sixteen inches long. The

thickness of the tube was only six-thousandths of an inch, and the greatest

difference of temperature between its inner and outer surfaces at the

maximum rate of condensation observed in the experiments could not have

been greater than a quarter of a degree Centigrade.

The mean temperature of the metal itself was determined in each case

by measuring the electrical resistance of that portion of the tube on which

the steam was condensing. The author has had considerable experience

in the application of this method, which, moreover, is very easily applied

if suitable apparatus is available.

The platinum tube was enclosed in an outer tube of brass or glass, and

Asteam was admitted to the space between the two tubes.  steady current

of condensing water was maintained through the platinum tube. The
amount of condensation could be inferred by measuring the flow of water,

and observing the difference of temperature between the inflow and the

outflow. In many cases the condensed water was also measured.

Applying a small correction for radiation, the two methods always agreed

within one-half of one per cent. The pressure of the steam in the outer

tube, which was never far from the atmospheric, was observed by means

of a mercury column.

     The conditions of the experiment as to flow of water and steam, size
and length of the external tube, &c., could be varied within certain limits.
The following is a summary of some of the more interesting results ob-

served.

1. With a short length of condenser and a very free escape of steam,

the condensation observed was equivalent to 22-2 thermal units F. per

square foot per second, for a difference of temperature of 28°-5 F.

between the steam and the metal surface. This is equivalent to a rate of

condensation of 0'78 T.U.F. per degree-second, reckoned per square foot

of the surface of the metal. This was the smallest value of the rate
observed. The platinum tube was vertical, and the current of steam

downwards, conditions which tended to keep the surface of the metal

comparatively clear of condensed water.

2. "With the same conditions, but with a length of tube nearly twice

as great exposed to the steam, the condensation observed was 22-3 T.U.F.

per square foot per second, for a difference of temperature of 25°-3 F.
EXPERIMENTS ON THE CONDENSATION OF STEAM.  423

This gives a rate of 0-88 per degree-second. The lower half of the tube
was more thickly covered with water than, the upper half, the steam also
was full of flying spray, which may have assisted in conveying heat to the
metal, and in maintaining the same rate of condensation on the lower half
of the tube as on the upper half, in spite of the somewhat higher tempera-

ture of the circulating water in the lower half.

     3. With the same arrangement, but with the steam current reversed
and reduced until the escape was as gentle as possible consistently with
keeping the tube full of steam and entirely excluding air, a somewhat
larger rate of condensation was observed, namely, ti3-6 T.U.F. per square
foot per second. The pressure throughout the tube was very nearly
atmospheric, and the gentle upward current of steam tended to keep the
tube very thickly covered with drops and rivulets of water. The difference
of temperature was only 22°-0 F., giving a rate of condensation of 1-07

T.U.F. per degree-second. This is equivalent to 2-25 watts (joules per
second) per square cm. per 1° C, and was the largest value observed
throughout the work. It would appear probable that the surface exposed

by the di'ops is so much greater (in the present instance about twice as
great) than the surface of the metal, and that the drops themselves are in

such rapid motion, that the increase of surface by facilitating condensation

more than compensates for any resistance which the water-hlm may offer

to the passage of heat to the metal.

     4. To verify this view, the outer glass tube was replaced by a much
smaller tube, so as to leave very little space for the steam current. The
pressure of the steam was thus raised to nearly four inches of mercury

above the atmospheric at the entrance of the tube, and the surface of the
platinum was violently scoured by a spiral rusli of steam and spray.
Under these conditions, the condensation observed was reduced to 19-2
T.U.F. per square foot per second, instead of being increased as might
naturally have been expected with so strong a current of steam. The
effect of the energetic scouring of the metal surface was shown by a slight

rise of temperature of the metal as compared with the previous experi-
ments. The observed difference of temperature between the metal and
the steam in this case was 19°-8 F., giving a rate of condensation of 0-97

T.U.F. per degree-second.

     From these and similar observations, in which the conditions of the
experiments were varied to a certain extent in points of detail, it may be
concluded that the presence of water on a metal surface may tend to
increase rather than diminish the amount of condensation. The rate of

condensation of steam at 212° F., allowing for the fact that in these
experiments the surface was unduly increased by the presence and motion
of the water drops, would appear to be at least of the same order of

magnitude as the value deduced from experiments on the cyclical con-
densation in the cylinder of a working steam-engine in which the

temperature of condensation varied from 290 F. to 330° F., and the rate
deduced was 0-74 T.U.F. per square foot per degree-second. Since, how-
ever, it is possible that the latter value was diminished to an uncertain

extent by a slight film of grease on the hot and dry surface, and since the

value deduced from the surface-condenser method is perhaps a little too

large owing to the presence of the water-film, it would be unsafe to

conclude that the rate of condensation is the same at different tempera-

tures, although the evidence so far as it goes appears at present to point

in that direction.
424 REPORT 1897.

     Comparing the three different methods of experiment, which all lead

to a similar result, it may be regarded as highly probable that the old'

view of an infinite rate of condensation requires revision, and that the
value of the rate of condensation of steam on a metal surface, as determined
by the author's previous experiments, is at least a first approximation to
the truth. The question at issue is one of fundamental importance in the
theory of the steam-engine, and the authors have shown in the Paper
already quoted that, if the law of condensation there proposed be admitted,
a number of interesting practical deductions can be made, and problems

may be solved which have not hitherto been regarded as amenable to other

than empirical treatment.

At the meeting in Liverpool in 1896 your Committee reported that

sufficiently accurate gauges of the British Association screw threads -were
not generally procui-able. They described methods of exactly measuring
male threads, and proposed a form of gauge for male threads -which they
anticipated could be more accurately produced, and more easily verified

than the forms in common use.

     In continuation of this course they have been in correspondence with
some of the principal tool-makers in England and America, with a view
to procuring accurate gauges of the different screw threads of the British
Association system constructed on the lines indicated in their last

report.

     The Pratt and Whitney Company of Hartford, Connecticut, had
already begun to construct tools for these threads, when the Secretary of
the Committee wrote to them, and are giving close attention to their
accurate production. The Company have kindly promised to communicate
with the Committee as soon as the work is sufficiently advanced to allow

hope that exact gauges will soon be obtainable from this source.

                                                                      1892-94
elementary  schools,  1888-91  ;  (2)  children  similarly examined,                                                 ;

(3) cases collected by the Charity Organisation Society in various parts of

London and presented for report as to mental and physical status. These

were examined and individually reported on by Dr. Francis Warner.

This portion of the work is new, and was specially selected, as evidence

concerning these childi'en was asked and obtained from these inquiries

by departmental committees of the Local Government Board, the Home

Office, and the present Committee of the Education Department on

Defective Children. The evidence is published in their parliamentaiy

reports, and some of the recommendations made have been adopted.

The class ' children who appear to require special care and training '

includes all cases given as ' exceptional children ' (see Group 5), and in

addition ' all children mentally dull, with defects in development, abnormal

--nerve-signs, and low nutrition,' i.e., Group 27.
     Exceptional Children. This includes all children whose physical or

mental conditions show them to be obviously at a permanent disadvantage

therefrom in social life. This group includes : Idiots (76) ; imbeciles

(77) ; ' children feebly gifted mentally ' (78) ; children mentally excep-
tional (79) ; epileptics and children with history of fits during school

life (80) ; dumb children (81) ; and all children crippled, deformed,

maimed, paralysed. All these exceptional children need to be considered

individually as to their special requii'ements.

    Idiots includes all children who on account of their bodily and

brain defects and the absence of mental power might be certified as.

--idiots under the Idiots Act and sent to an asylum.
    Imbeciles. This includes all children who might be certified as men-

tally imbecile and transferred to an asylum. Speaking generally, these

are less hopeless cases than the idiots, and more educable under industrial
training. Some of these cases were the result of disease, not of congenital

defect of brain.

' Children feebly gifted ntentally.'--These children are distinctly

deficient in mental power, but might not be certified as imbeciles, and

Noare therefore not fit for such medical certification.  child was regis-

tered in this group unless it was believed upon evidence observed and the

teacher's report combined to be incapable of school work in the ordinary

classes. It is difficult to define what physical conditions seen, as apart

from mental tests, indicate the child as unfitted in mental capacity for the

usual methods of education, and an arbitrary attempt to do so has not

been made. There appears, however, to be a large class of 'children

feebly gifted mentally ' with defect of mental power short of imbecility,

--but still with some deficiency.
     Children mentally exceptional. These children, while not necessarily

mentally dull, and without brain power, appeared deficient in certain

mental characteristics and in moral sense, such as habitual liars, thieves,

and incendiaries ; others were liable to attacks of total mental confusion,
or periods of total mental ineptitude or violent passion, or were moral

imbeciles. Some of these children were the offspring of insane parents

or criminals. It is quite possible that some of these children were really
        ON THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DEFECTS OF CHILDREN. 429

epileptic or subject to jjetU-mal. Some of these children while thus men-

tally exceptional were not ordinarily dull pupils in schools.

   --Epileptics and children with history of Jits during school life. In

every school, inquiry was made for children subject to fits, whether

occurring in school or alleged to occur at home during school life and
Agiven as a reason for absence from school.
                                             report given as to history

of fits was recorded, and the case was entered in this group, but at the

inspection of a school facts could not be usually observed proving the

child to be epileptic.

  --Children crippled, maimed, deformed, or paralysed. Any child

crippled, maimed, deformed, or paralysed was included in this group.

Conditions of disease and paralysis were in various stages, but in all cases

the child appeared to be at some permanent disadvantage. The condi-

tions causing crippling were in various stages : many of these children

were quite capable of  work and  play,  some were mentally  defective they
                                                                                                       ;

varied greatly in brain power and in physical health.

   A card was specially prepared for each of these cases, showing the

defects present. The tables were prepared by sorting and classifying

such cards :

     It is obvious that different educational arrangements are needed for
the children ' feebly gifted mentally/ according as they are or are not
blind or dumb, while the epileptics form a particularly difficult class to

deal with. Again ; crippled children who are not mentally deficient or

paralysed, are not to be grouped with those so defective.
      Following the experience gained in giving evidence before the depart-

mental committees and those responsible for the care of exceptional
children, the cases have been grouped as given in Tables A. The total
numbers feebly gifted mentally are easily obtainable by addition of the

eleven sub-groups.

     In the tables the boys and girls are arranged in age-groups, and as to

the educational standards.

    In Tables B the cases are arranged as in our report presented last

year.

    Standard O contains children too old for the infant school and too

dull or backward for Standard I.
     The primary main classes of defect are indicated in the tables by

symbols :

   A . Defect in develoi^ment only ; not in combination with other class of

defect.

     B. Abnormal nerve-signs only ; not in combination with other class of

defect.

   C Pale, thin, or delicate only.

     D. Reported as mentally dull or backward only.

Six other primary groups are arranged by taking cases with two main

classes of defect only.

     Four primary groups present three main classes of defect only.
     One primary group presents the four main classes of defect combined

in each case.
-- G--The remainder groups E, F, and
                                      contain the cases with defects

not classed above as main classes ; such as eye cases, children maimed or

crippled, &c.

     To obtain the total number of cases with any class of defect, whether

combined with other class of defect or not, the numbers representing all
the primary groups containing such defect must be added together. The

total or compound group AB=primary AB-f ABC-|- ABD + ABCD.

     The Committee desire to be reappointed, to act in conjunction with
the Childhood Society, for the scientific study of the mental and physical
conditions of children, and ask a grant of £20 in aid of this work.

This Committee was nominated at the Liverpool meeting last year, with
the object of initiating an ethnological survey of Canada on lines cor-
responding with those already followed by the Committee for the Ethno-
graphical Survey of the United Kingdom, as well as to continue, so far as

may be possible, work of the kind carried on since the Montreal meeting

(1884) by the Committee on the North- Western Tribes of Canada. It
comprises three members of the Committee for the Ethnographical Survey
of the United Kingdom, including the Chairman and Secretary of that
committee. Fourteen members resident in Canada were also nominated,
but one of these, Mr. Horatio Hale, has since died.

     In nominating the Canadian members some regard was given to geo-
graphical position, so that the principal regions of the Dominion would be
represented. This, while necessary under the circumstances, has to some
extent prevented an intei'change of ideas as complete as might be desired.
Some correspondence and discussion on the general scope of the work and

the plans to be followed have, however, taken place. Messrs. E. W.

Brabrook and E. S. Hartland have contributed valuable information and
suggestions respecting the work of the similar committee for the United
Kingdom, and several Canadian members have evinced a strong interest
in the survey now to be undertaken.

      It has not yet, however, been found practicable actually to initiate
any systematic observations, to print and distribute the necessary schedules,

or to provide sets of instruments for physical measurements, no funds
being available for these purposes. It is believed that a number of

observers may be enlisted in several of the numerous lines of inquiry

which appear to be open to the Committee, embracing both the immigrant
European population of Canada and its aborigines.

     Of suggestions received from members of the Committee the following
general considerations presented by Professor D. P. Penhallow, of McGill
University, may be quoted :

     ' The very unstable character of our population and the extensive
mixture of races to be met with in a given community require that we
should adopt somewhat different lines of procedure from those employed
by the Committee for the United Kingdom. Therefore, while we might
wisely adopt the main lines of investigation employed by the Committee
for Great Britain, as embodied in their report for 1893 ("B. A. Report,"
1893, p. 621), and while these lines of investigation might be applied to
       ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                                                                                                              411

both Indians and Europeans, they should be conducted with reference

to--

      ' (a) Indian communities.
      '(1) Displacement of tribes from their original locations through the

intervention of Europeans.

     ' (2) The absorption of tribal remnants into existing tribes.
     ' (3) The infusion of French or other European blood.

     ' (b) European communities or families.
     ' (1) The precise European locality whence they originated.
     * (2) The American locality of most continuous residence and of first

settlement.

     ' (3) The environment at date of investigation.

     ' For the treatment of folklore as ethnological data, I do not think we

can do better than adopt methods suggested by Mr. Gomme in his very

valuable paper as embodied in the Report on Ethnographical Survey,
Oreat Britain (" B.A. Report," 1896, Section H, p. 626, &c.).

     ' The great extent of country to be dealt witla and the great length of
time required to reach anything of the nature of complete results would
seem to make it desirable that we proceed in the most systematic manner.
The results might therefore be collated by

      "(1) Families or tribes.                          locality                                                                                     should  be

       * (2) Parishes.

     ' (3) Towns or villages.

      * (4) Provinces and, as far as possible, a given
studied exhaustively before another is undertaken.'

     After some consultation with the members of the Committee who
could most easily be communicated with, the following letter was ad-

dressed to the Committee generally :

   --' Sir, You have doubtless received some time ago from Mr. G.

'Griffith, Assistant General Secretary of the British Association for the

Advancement of Science, a notification of your nomination as a member

of the committee to organise an ethnological survey of Canada. It is
hoped that you will be willing to take an active part in this important

work, and, although it may not be possible to do much more than establish

some plan of operations before the date of the forthcoming meeting of the

Association in Toronto in August next, that you will now assist and

advise in the perfecting of such plan.

      'The project is based upon that being carried out by another com-
»nittee of the Association nominated some years ago to " organise an
ethnographical survey of the United Kingdom." This committee has
already made several valuable and interesting reports, and has enlisted
various local scientific societies and a number of individuals in the work.

     ' The chief objects of investigation in the United Kingdom are set out

as follows :

* (1)  Physical type of the inhabitants.                                                                                                             and
' (2)
' (3)  Current traditions and beliefs
' (4)                                                                                                                                             ;
' (5)
       Peculiarities of dialect

       Monuments and other remains of ancient culture ;

       Historical evidences as to continuity of race.

' It has been sought to discover, in the first place, the most suitable
442 REPORT-- 1897.

localities for investigations ; i.e., those which are in large measure
secluded from the change and mingling of population incident to large
cities, and to select those villages and places where the people have
remained for some generations, at least, comparatively undisturbed and

homogeneous in character. In this way it is believed that the ethno-
graphic elements going to make up the population of the United Kingdom
may be traced, and the changes induced by the mingling of the various
elements under different local conditions may be advantageously studied.

     ' As applied to Canada, it is obvious that an inquiry of the kind

cannot be conducted on exactly the same lines. It resolves itself, in the
first instance, into two distinct branches :

     ' (1) That dealing with the white races, and
     ' (2) That dealing with the aborigines or Indians. Both are important
and likely to yield results of great interest ; but, while the second has
already been recognised and pursued to some considerable extent, the

first has remained almost untouched.

     'In regard to the first, it is obvious that it includes two specially
fruitful fields, one relating to the older centres of French colonisation

in Quebec and Acadia, and the other to the half-breed population of
Manitoba and the North-West, where French and Scottish immigrants

have mingled with the native races.

     ' In Quebec and in the Acadian Provinces the researches of Abb^

Tanguay have already placed on record the origin and descent of most of
the old French families, and the basis thus established is an excellent one
on which to build up a knowledge of any changes, whether physical or in
language, customs and beliefs, due to the new environment in which the
original French colonists have lived and increased. With that object it
is desired to make, in the first place, a list of those localities in which
development of the kind has been most uninterrupted and continuous,

and in these to obtain the co-operation of some local observers who may

be willing to devote time to special inquiries along fixed lines, of which

the details may be subsequently elaborated.
     ' There are also, it is believed, many places in the older provinces of

Canada in which English, Scottish, Irish, and other settlers have been so
long established as to give rise to special peculiarities worthy of note.

      ' Respecting the aborigines or Indians of the eastern part of Canada,

it may be stated that their language is now fairly well understood,

while their customs, folklore and traditions, where these have not already

been recorded, have largely passed away. But much remains as a profit-

able subject of investigation, particularly in respect to the location of

ancient settlements and places of resort, burial places, routes of travel,

&,c. There are also many events connected with their early intercourse

with the whites of which traditional accounts might yet be gathered with

advantage.

      'In the western part of Canada the investigation of all matters
relating to the Indian tribes constitutes the most important branch of the
work proposed ; and although in most places great changes have occurred
in recent years a vast amount of valuable material yet remains to be
recorded, connected not only with their language, but also with their
traditions, art, customs, mode of life, and physical characteristics. The

time is rapidly passing away in which investigations of the kind may be
made to advantage, and no effort should therefore be spared to collect
            ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.  443

everything connected with these people. It may confidently be stated

that no actually observed fact respecting them is without some definite

 value.

      ' With slight verbal changes the same main heads of investigation as

 have been already cited appear to be applicable to the native races ; but,

 in addition, many other special lines of inquiry might be followed, such

 as the displacement of native tribes by the whites, the coalescence of
 diminished tribal communities in later years, and the absorption of the

 weaker of these by the stronger. Photographic records of all kinds will

 ill connection with the native races possess great importance.

      ' The above suggestions of a general and preliminary kind are ofiered
 to the members of the Committee with the object of eliciting an expres-

,

 sion of opinion, and further and more detailed plans such as may appear
 to be best for the objects in view. As no money grant is at the disposal

 of the Committee, the work must in the meantime, at least, be carried on
 entirely by the efforts of volunteers ; but some means may, it is hoped,
 be found of obtaining a small fund applicable to the purposes of the

Committee.

     ' In the meantime it is hoped that every member of the Committee

will assist with advice in regard to the best organisation, not only for the

collection, but also in -respect to the collation and eventual publication of

the facts.

            ' Yours faithfully,
                         (Signed) 'George M. Dawson.'

     The Committee have been so fortunate as to obtain from Dr. Franz
Boas and Mr. B. Suite respectively the subjoined valuable contributions
in the line of its investigations. 'The Growth of Toronto Children,'
by Franz Boas ; ' Origin of the French Canadians,' by B. Suite. The first
constitutes an interesting example of the importance attaching to accurate
physical measurements. The second explains the nature of the founda-
tions upon which further study of the French element of the Canadian

population must rest.

                              APPENDIX I.

             The Growth of Toronto Children. By Franz Boas.

     In 1891, when active preparations for the World's Columbian Expo-

sition were being made. Professor F. W. Putnam, director of the Peabody
Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnography, and then chief of the
Department of Anthropology of the Exposition, placed me in charge of
the Section of Physical Anthropology. At an early time during the

preparation of the exhibits we agreed upon a plan to represent as fully
as possible the growth and the development of American children.

Valuable material was available, but it seemed desirable to extend the
investigations over regions in which heretofore no observations had been
collected. I submitted our plans to Mr. James Hughes, superintendent
of public schools in Toronto, Ont., and to Professor Earl Barnes, of
Leland Stanford, Jr., University. Through the interest taken by these
gentlemen I have been enabled to obtain series of measurements of the
school children of Toronto and of Oakland, Cal. The former series
was taken under the supervision of Dr. Alexander F. Chamberlain ; the
--444 KEPORT 1897.

latter, under the direction of Professor Earl Barnes. In both of these

series the same plan, excepting details, was followed.

The measurements embrace the following data : Stature without shoes,

Afinger-reach, height sitting, weight.         series of special measurements of

the head were taken, which, however, include only a few hundred indi-

viduals. The following statistical data were collected : Age, in years and

months  place    of  birth ;  nationality  of  grandparents                                               place  of birth of
                                                                                                       ;

parents occupation of parents ; number and ages of brothers and sisters ;

order of birth of the child measured ; and the mental ability as judged

by the teacher.                      "

                              ,

In treating this material I have endeavoured to exclude a certain

series of errors. The number of children of various ages which have been

measured is not equal. The series begins with comparatively few children.

The number increases from year to year, until, beginning with the ninth

year, it decreases again. It follows from this fact that among the six-

year-old children, for instance, there are more of the age six years and

eleven months than of six years and no months ; and that, on the other
hand, among the fifteen- year-old children there are more of the age

fifteen years and no months than of fifteen years and eleven months. In

treating the various series of observations all children between six and

seven, seven and eight, &c., have been grouped together, and usually the

series is assumed to represent sizes for the average ages ; that is, for

six and a half, seven and a half, &c. On account of the varying fre-

quency for the several months, this is not quite correct. Among the

younger children the average will be a little more than six and a half,

will be a little less than fourteen and a half, fifteen and a half, &c. By

      It appears, therefore, that the result is not quite certain, since the
error is great as compared to the average difference. Since for later-born
children the errors of the average are very great, I have not carried out

the calculation. I have calculated the same differences, and their mean

errors, for the statures of girls :

This table is of importance also as showing that the difference in

stature of first-born children and of later born children cannot be ascribed

to the influence of differences in nationalities. The change of proportion

of English and Canadian blood in the grand total is so slight that we

cannot possibly assume that it will materially modify the average stature

Weof the people  may therefore safely say that the difierence in

stature of first-born and later-born children is not influenced by compli-

cations resulting from the influence of nationalities.

                 APPENDIX II.

       Origin of the French Canadians. By B . Sulte.

    We intend to explain the formation of a certain number of French

people into settlers on the St. Lawrence during the seventeenth century,
atnd from which has sprung the present French Canadian population.

     (1) Acadia was peopled without any kind of organisation between

1636 and 1670, or thereabouts. No one has yet satisfactorily demon-

strated where the French of that colony came from, though their dialect
would indicate their place of origin to be in the neighbourhood of the
mouth of the river Loire. They are distinct from the French Canadians
in some particulars, and not aUied by marriages with the settlers of the
St. Lawrence.

Brittany never traded with Canada, except that, from 1535 to 1600,

some of the St. Malo navigators used to visit the Lower St. Lawrence and

barter with the Indians, but there were no European settlers in the whole

of that pretended New France. Afterwards the regime of the fur com-

panies, which extended from 1608 to 1632, was rather adverse to colonisa-

tion, and we know by Champlain's writings that no resident, no 'habitant,'

    tilled the soil during that quarter of a century. The men who were

I employed at Quebec and elsewhere by the companies all belonged to Nor-

mandy, and, after 1632, twelve or fifteen of them married the daughters

of the other Normans recently arrived to settle for good. Brittany

remained in the background after, as well as before, 1632. This is con-

firmed by an examination of the parish registers, where seven or eight

Bretons only can be found during the seventeenth century.

          (2) The trade of Canada remained in the hands of the Dieppe and
j Rouen merchants from 1633 to 1663. It consisted solely in fish and fur,

' especially the latter. Therefore any man of these localities who wished

to go to Canada to settle there was admitted on the strength of the charter

of the Hundred Partners, who were bound to send in people brought up

to farming in order to cultivate the soil of the colony, but who did

[ nothing of the kind, except transporting the self-sacrificing emigrants.

There is even indication that the transport was not free. The other sea-

ports of France having no connection with Canada before 1662, five or

.six families only came from these ports.

    (3) When the business of the Hundred Partners collapsed about 1660,

Paris and Rochelle came in for a certain share of interest, as they were

    the creditors of the expiring company, and soon we notice immigrants
[arriving from the neighbouring country places of those two cities.

          The settlers (1633-1663) came, as a rule, individually, or in little

1897.                                                      GG

groups of three or four families related to each other, as many immigrants

from various countries do at the present day.

    From an examination of family and other archives, extending now
over thirty years of labour, we make the following deductions :

     Perche, Normandy, Beauce, Picardy, and Anjou (they are here in

their order of merit) contributed about two hundred families from 1633 to

1663, the period of the Hundred Partners' regime. By natural growth

these reached the figure of 2,200 souls in 1663.

    In 1662-63 there came about one hundred men from Perche and 150
from Poitou, Rochelle, and Gascony, with a small number of women.
This opens a new phase in the history of our immigration by introducing

Poitou and Rochelle amongst the people of the northern and western

Province of France, already counting two generations in the three dis-

tricts of Quebec, Three Rivers, and Montreal.

      (4) After 1665 the city of Paris, or rather the small territory en-
circling it, contributed a good share. The whole of the south and east of

France had no connection with Canada at any time. Normandy, Perche,
Maine, AnjoUj Touraine, Poitou, Saintonge, Angoumois, Guienne, and

-- --Gascony on a straight line from north to south furnished the whole of

the families now composing the French Canadian people.

     (5) From 1667 till 1672 a committee was active in Paris, Rouen,
Rochelle, and Quebec to recruit men, women, and young girls for Canada.

This committee succeeded in effecting the immigration into Canada of

about four thousand souls. Half of the girls were from country places in

Normandy, and the other half were well-educated persons, who did not
go into the rural districts, but married in Quebec, Three Rivers, and

Montreal.

Since these people were brought to Canada by the organised efforts of

a committee, we might expect to find some detailed record of their arrival
Weand origin, but as yet no such information is known to exist.
                                                                 are

merely told by contemporary writers of that period how many arrived at

--such and such a date, and the port of embarkation that is all. Happily,

the church registers, notarial deeds, papers of the courts of justice, and

several classes of public documents show abundantly the places of origin

of those who actually established their families here.
     (6) In 1673 the King stopped all immigration, and this was the end

of French attempts to colonise Canada. The settlers, of course, remained

as they were, and in 1680 the whole population amounted only to 9,700
souls. Double this figure every thirty years, and we have the present

French population of the Province of Quebec, Ontario, and that of the

groups established now in the United States.

    (7) The bulk of the men who came during 1633-1673 were from rural

districts, and took land immediately on their arrival here. It is notice-

able that a large number of them had besides a trade of their own, such
as that of carpenter, cooper, blacksmith, so that a small community of
twenty families possessed among themselves all the requirements of that

kind that could be useful.

    No land was given to those who did not show qualification for agri-

cultural pursuits, and they were placed for three years in the hands of an

old farmer before the title of any property was signed in their favour.

    (8) In regard to troops disbanded in Canada at various dates much

--misunderstanding exists. The real facts are as follows : Before 1665 no

soldiers, therefore no disbandment ; from 1665 to 1673 a few isolated
          ON THE ETHNOLOGICAL SURVEY OF CANADA.                                      451

cases ; the regiment of Cai-ignan came to Canada in 1G65 and left in 1669,

with the exception of one company, which eventually was disbanded here
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

from 1673 to 1753 the garrisons of Canada consisted, as a rule, of about

three hundred men in all, under an infantry captain, sometimes called

the Major when no longer young.

     Besides that ' detachment,' as it was called, an addition of six or seven
companies was sent in the colony during the years 168-1-1713, on account
of the war. From 1753 to 1760 the regiments sent under Dieskau and

Montcalm (seven-year war) do not seem to have left any number of men

in the country. Therefore the ' military element ' had very little to do

in the formation of our French population.

     (9) The date of the arrival of most of the heads of families will never
be ascertained accurately. In order to face that difficulty with chances

--of success I have resorted to the following plan : Prepare an alphabetical

list of all the heads of families, and afterwards, when consulting the old

archives and various sources of information, be careful in comparing your

list with any date or other indication you may find. In this manner it
tui-ns out that a man was married in 1664 in Quebec, was a witness before
the court in 1658, made a deed in 1672, in which he states that 'before

leaving AlenQon in 1652 to come to Canada.' . . . The date of '1652'

and ' Alen9on ' are the very things I want ; therefore I erase ' 1664 ' and

' 1658,' previously entered, and keep the oldest date, with the name of

the locality. This process is slow but not the surest, but still it is the best

yet found to reach a fail' approximate estimate. Finally, I hope to publish

that tabular statement in a couple of years from now.

    (10) On the subject of uniformity of language, which is so remarkable
amongst the French Canadians, we may observe that it is the best

language spoken from Rochelle to Paris and Tours, and thence to

Rouen. Writers of the seventeenth century have expressed the opinion

that French Canadians could understand a dramatic play as well as the

elite of  Paris                         no wonder to  us,  since we know that  theatricals were
                                     ;

common occurrences in Canada, and that the ' Cid ' of Corneille was

played in Quebec in 1645, the ' Tartuffe ' of Moliere in 1677, and so on.
The taste for music and love for songs are characteristics of the French

Canadian race. The facility with which they learn foreign languages is
well known in America, where they speak Indian, Spanish, and English
as well as their own tongue.

VI. Report of the Committee on the Ethnographical Survey of Ireland .    . 510

1. This Committee was first appointed at the Edinburgh Meeting in 1892,
upon the joint recommendation of the Society of Antiquaries, the Anthro-
pological Institute, and the Folklore Society, for the purpose of organ-
ising local anthropological research, with the ultimate aim of establishing
an ethnographical survey of the United Kingdom. In the paper in which
the views of the three Societies were laid before the Association, it was

acknowledged that so large and ambitious a scheme must take many years
to perfect, and could only be proceeded with in detail. It was indeed

hinted that in other countries no power short of that of the State would
attempt to carry it out, and that iia time it might be right to ask for
State aid to do so in this country.'

      2. It will be convenient, on the present occasion, to recapitulate the
steps which the Committee has taken towards the fulfilment of the duty
entrusted to it. The first was to invite the co-operation of delegates of
the Royal Statistical Society, the Cambrian Archaeological Association,
the Royal Irish Academy, and the Dialect Society, in addition to those of
the Societies already represented on the Committee. This invitation was

readily acceded to, and the Committee has derived much help from the

learned gentlemen nominated by the several bodies in question. Sub-
Committees for Wales and for Ireland were formed.

      3. The Committee next proceeded to consider and define the plan of
its operations, which was to observe and record for certain typical villages,
 parishes, or places, and their vicinity (a) the physical types of the

 inhabitants, (b) their current traditions and beliefs, (c) peculiarities of
 dialect, (d) monuments and other remains of ancient culture, (e) historical

 evidence as to continuity of race.

      4. Such simultaneous observation and record appeared to the Com-

--mittee to be the best means by which the object desired that of studying

the whole man and ascertaining what man is in any district--is to be

-obtained. It is necessary, not only to measure his skull and record his
 physical characters, but also to look up the history of his descent, find out

           ' Journal of the Anthropological Institute, xxii. 262.
ox THE ETHNO(;KArinCAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 453

from the remains of their workmanship wliat sort of people his foi'bears were,

and ascertain what superstitions and beliefsthey have transmitted to liim.'

5. In the business of forming a list of places in the United Kingdom

which appear specially to deserve ethnographic study, the Committee

sought the assistance of a great number of persons possessed of local

knowledge, and the substance of the correspondence is digested in the first

and second reports of the Committee. They contain a large amount of

interesting local information, and specify the names of more than 300

places as suitable for the survey.

6. It became the duty of the Committee, as a next step, to condense

into a small and convenient pamphlet the instructions necessary to enable

observers to conduct the survey on a definite and uniform plan. The

volume of ' Notes and Queries on Anthropology,' prepared by another

Committee of the British Association ; the ' Handbook of Folklore,

published by the Folklore Society ; the directions for tiie Archseological
Survey, formulated by the Society of Antiquaries ; and other publications,
afforded ample material for this, but they were too voluminous for

general use. The Committee has succeeded in reducing the necessary

hints and instructions into a pamphlet of twelve pages, which has been

found by experience sufficiently to indicate what is required.

7. Individual members of the Committee have rendered it excellent

service by contributions to the study of the branches of the subject, which

have been printed in appendices to its reports, viz., Mr. E. Sidney Hart-

land, the secretary, in his notes explanatory of the schedules, appended to

the third report ; and Mr. Laurence Gomme, in his paper on determining

the value of folklore as ethnological data, appended to the fourth report.

8. The foundation having thus been laid, the Committee proceeded to

take observations in detail, some of which have been published in the

Reports, others in the transactions of local and other Societies, and others

are reserved for examination and digest when further information has

been obtained.

9. The following is a brief summary of the returns actually received

from various parts of the United Kingdom up to the date of the Com-

mittee's last Report :

--England. Suffolk (Miss Layard and others) ; Hertfordshire (Professor

Haddon)                                              Cambridgeshire (Professor Haddon) ;                                Lancashire (Rev.  F.
                                                  ;

--Moss) ; Yorkshire (Dr. E. Colley and others).
     Wales. Pembrokeshire (Mr. H. Owen and Mr. E. Laws).
  --Scotland. Galloway (Dr. Gregor) ; Aberdeen (Mr. Gray).
   --Ireland. The Aran Islands (Professor Haddon and Dr. Browne) ;

Dublin  (Dr.                                         Browne)                                           Inishbofin  and  Inishshark,  co. Galway (Dr.
                                                                                                    ;

Browne)                                              Mayo (Dr.  Browne).
                                     ;

A10. preliminary report on folklore in Scotland, by the Rev. Dr.

Walter Gregor, formed Appendix III. to the Committee's fourth Report.

Dr. Gregor had undertaken, at the request of the Committee, to make a

special -visit to certain districts of Scotland for the purpose of the survey.

The remainder of his collections of folklore (items 168 to 734) are

appended to this Report, and also an abstract of his measurements of

the inhabitants.

11. In arranging the folklore for the Appendix to the present Report,

all headings that could be dispensed with have been omitted, and where

                                                                ' Archwological Journal, liii. 227.

consecutive items were collected at the same place the name of the place is

only mentioned in the first instance instead of before every item, as in the

previous Appendix, with the view of economising space as much as possible.
     12. The Committee much regrets to record that Dr. Gregor, who was

an accomplished observer, died on February 4th last, while actually engaged
in his work on its behalf. The special qualifications which he possessed
for that work, and the manner in which he set about and performed it,
have impressed the Committee with a deep sense of the loss it has
sustained. The Committee has endeavoured to express this in a communi-

cation which has been addressed to Dr. Gregor's family.
      13. The collections contained in the Appendix to the present Report,

added to those published in that to the fourth Report, will supply an
excellent model for observers as to the manner of making and recording
collections of folklore, and they are accordingly printed in extenso. It is

not intended in future to print all such collections in the same manner, but
to reserve them for digest and comparison as the work progresses towards
completeness, and probably for publication either in local source:; of infor-

mation or in such combined form as may hereafter be found to be desirable,

and be adopted with the approval of the Council of the Association.
     14. The Committee has endeavoured to fill the place left vacant by the

death of Dr. Gregor by the appointment of the Rev. H. B. M. Reid to
carry on the work initiated by him, and it has also appointed the Rev.
Elias Owen in Wales and Dr. Colley March in Dorsetshire as special
observers in the same manner, these gentlemen having very kindly

consented to devote their time to this work without remuneration, being
guaranteed only the expenses they incur.

     15. The Committee has also to acknowledge communications from Mr.

F. W. Hackwood of observations taken in Wednesbury ; from Dr. Andrew

Dunlop, Dr. O. C. Powell, Mr. E. K. Cable, C.E., Mr. Nicolle, Mr. A.
CoUenette, and Mr. J. Le Bas, of observations relating to the Channel
Islands ; and from Mr. M. S. Hagen of observations in Ropley, Hampshire.

     16. The Committee has also to thank the Hampshire Field Club for
reprinting and circulating among the members of that club an extract from
the pamphlet of questions issued by this Committee, and for passing a resolu-
tion to promote as far as possible in that county the work pf this Committee.

     17. Numerous other local societies have also shown a desire to
co-operate with the Committee, which gladly and gratefully accepts

their assistance.

     18. It may be convenient, for the guidance of such workers as kindly

volunteer- their services in this manner, to mention some of the limitations
of the work of the Committee.

     19. With regard to the physical observations and measurements, and

to photographs, it is not desired to obtain other than those which are
typical of the district, and answer the rough test of having been free
from intermixture with the inhabitants of other districts for at least
three generations.

     20. With regard to current traditions and beliefs or folklore, it is not
considered necessary for this Committee to undertake the work on which

the Folklore Society has embarked, of collecting and digesting for each
county the folklore which is scattered over the numerous published works
relating to the district. It will be sufficient if original observations are

made and recorded upon the plan adopted by Dr. Gregor.
    21. With regard to dialect, the Committee cannot better define its
     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 455

limitations than by reference to the brief code of directions drawn up for
the Committee by Professor Skeat and contained in the Committee's

pamphlet.

     22. With regard to monuments and other remains of ancient culture,
the work of the Committee has been in some places anticipated, and in
others is being carried on concurrently by the Archaeological Survey set on

foot by the Society of Antiquaries, and by that undertaken by the

Cambrian Archreological Society. Where such survey has not been com-
menced, the Committee suggests that the method adopted by the Society

of Antiquaries should be followed.

     23. With regard to the historical evidences of continuity of race,

where they exist in any publication, it will only be necessary to give
a reference to that publication ; but there will be great value in a full
record of any that exist only in unpublished sources of information.

     24. The duty which is entrusted to this Committee, and which is
undei'taken by those local bodies that have kindly interested themselves
in its work, is necessarily so laborious, that the Committee is anxious that
such local bodies should not burden themselves with any labour that can

be avoided in the discharge of it.
      2-5. The Committee would be glad if this intimation should have the

effect of inducing other local bodies, that may possibly have been deterred
from offering help by a feeling that the requirements of the Committee

involve greater labour than such bodies are prepared to devote to the
matter, to reconsider the position and undertake the essential portion of
the work in the respective localities.

     26. The Committee is prepared to provide any such local body and
competent individual observers in any district with the necessary instru-
ments for the physical measurements by way of loan, and with a proper
equipment of forms of return, &c.

      27. The whole of the grant appropriated to the Committee at the
Liverpool meeting has not been expended, and the Committee asks to be
reappointed and permitted to use the unexpended portion, with a further
grant, so as to have placed at its disposal the sum of 50^. in all during the

coming year.

    A28. small amount of the sum allotted to Dr. Gregor for his

expenses having been returned to the Committee unexpended has been

surrendered to the Association.

      29. The Committee has been glad to observe the commencement in
Switzerland of an ethnographic survey under the management of the Swiss

--during the course of that year a daughter died.
    182. Kells. On Hogmanay great care was taken to keep the fire alive-

morning to rekindle it.

   --182rt. Kirkmaiden. On Hogmanay the fire was ' happit ' with more

than ordinary care to keep it from ' going out,' as such a thing would be
most unlucky, and also because no neighbour would give a live peat to-

each of the horses and cattle on the farm. After doing this he came back

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             '"

458 REPORT-- 1897.

                  First Foot.

  --200. Kirkmaiden. The fishermen of Drumore do not like a woman to

enter their houses as ' first fit ' on the morning of New Year's Day.

201. It is accounted unlucky to meet a barefooted woman as ' first

fit ' when one is going to fish.

    202. My informant saw a fisherman of Portlogan meet his wife one

morning as he was setting out for the fishing. He returned to the house

--Aand then set out again for his work.
203. Kells.     man that lived in the parish of Kells used to say that,

if in going to fish he met a certain woman that lived in Dairy, he might

as well turn, for he would have no luck that day. My informant knew

the man.

   --204. Kirkmaiden. It is accounted unlucky to meet a woman as 'first

fit ' when one is going to shoot. It is especially unlucky if she is bare-

footed.

   --205. Balmaghie. It is unlucky to meet a woman with flat feet as

' first fit.'

  --206. Port Patrick. It is unlucky to meet as ' first fit ' one with a

--A Wsquint-eye. It increases the unluck if there is red hair.
207. Laurieston.                         , an old woman that lived in Lauries-

ton was reputed a witch. No one liked to meet her as ' first fit.'
--A208. Dairy.
                  man that lived at the Ford House, Dairy, had the

repute of having an ' ill fit.' One day he entered a house in Glenlee as a

woman was churning cream. When he left the house she cast some salt

into the fire.

                  ' Can'lesmas Bleeze.'

--209. Laurieston. The scholars assembled in the schoolroom. The

roll was called, and as each one's name was called out, he or she went

forward to the teacher's desk and laid down a piece of money. There was

a contest between a boy and a girl who was to be king or queen, and the

teacher knew beforehand who were to contend for the honour. Their

names were called out last. They went to the teacher's desk as the others

did and laid down a shilling (about). The one that laid down for the

longest time was king or queen as the case might be. Whisky toddy,

weak and sweet, was then given to each scholar. Sometimes oranges and

Myother good things were added. Then followed a dance.          informant,

when a scholar, used to supply the music from a fiddle, and for years after

he left school. Parents, scholars, and friends were at times entertained at

a dance in the evening. Next day was generally given as a holiday to

the scholars. When the custom fell out of use a present was made to the

teacher about Christmas. The custom of making a present at Christmas

continues.

   --[The Rev. H. M. B. Reid notes upon this : ' The arrangements were

made a few days before February 2 (Candlemas). If February 2 fell on a

Sunday, the next day after was kept. In Glenlochar School (Balmaghie)

the king and queen were not known beforehand (schoolmaster's widow,

aged 79).']

   --210. Balmaclellan. As each scholar came into the schoolroom he or she

went to the teacher's desk, and laid down his or her gift. The scholar's

name and the amount of the gift were recorded. When all had brought

their gifts, the teacher called out the name of the girl that had given the
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 459

largest sum among the girls. She was styled queen. He also called out

the name of the boy that had given the highest sum among the boys.

He became king. Whisky toddy was then prepared. The teacher then

--gave a glass of it to the king and queen each . The king then poured

into glasses from a jug the toddy and handed them to the other scholars,
whilst the queen kept the jug filled from the bowl in which it had been
made. There might be one hundred and twenty scholars at Balmaclellan
school, and the quantity of whisky used was a bottle, so that the toddy
was weak. It was made very sweet. (Told by one who was a scholar at
this school, and who has been treated to the toddy.)

      211.' After the drinking of the toddy the scholars engaged in various

kinds of games. In later times a 'bake ' or biscuit was given, in addition

to the toddy, to each scholar. (Told by one who was a scholar and had

taken part in the feast.)

   A212. 'bake 'was given to each scholar in addition, to the toddy.

Sometimes the scholars engaged in dancing. (Told by one who has been

an actor.)
      --My213. Corsock.
                         informant attended a small school at Merkland,

Corsock. The same custom was observed at it. Each scholar, as he or

she entered the schoolroom, laid down his or her gift. "When all had

presented their gifts, a glass of weak toddy was served to each scholar.

Toasts were at times given by some of them. My informant gave the

following :

                    ' Here's health, wealth, wit t' guide it,

                     Ower my throat I mean t' guide it.'

   --214. Kirhnaiden. It was a custom not long ago to bring something

into the houses on the morning of Candlemas Day before taking anything

out.

                                                         Hallowe^en.

   --215. Bahnaghie. The following mumming-play is performed by the

school children at Hallowe'en :

     There are seven actors, three of whom carry sticks or swords.

     (1) Bauldie, wearing a 'fause face' (a mask), commonly black, dressed
in a big coat, and carrying a stick as a sword ; ordinary cap on head.

     (2) The Captain, dressed in the same way.
     (3) The General, dressed in the same way.
     (4) The Doctor, wearing a mask, black with red spots on chin, cheeks,
and brow, with a big ' tile ' hat on head, a stick in one hand, and a bottle

of water in the other.

heels, an old mutch, with an old umbrella in hand.

black coat, a big brown paper bag on his head, with a stick in his hand.

   --(7) Weean face painted white, wearing a small frock, and ordinary

      All except the Doctor enter the kitchen. They are asked ' What do

you   want  ?       They answer by singing ' Gentle Annie ' or any other school

                 '

song. Then speaks

             Bauldie :  Here comes I, Bell Hector
                                                                                                                            ;

  --218. Balmaghie. At Hallowe'en the children carried one lantern

made of a hollowed-out turnip, and called at the houses and got apples,
hazel-nuts, money (which was divided), potatoes, mashed, with a sixpence
among them (this last at a cotman's house). The sixpence was divided.

    [It may be mentioned that in Forfarshire the children sang, swinging

the hollow neij^, or turnip :

                            The Moon.

   --219. Kirhnaiden. 'Faul ' is a name for a halo round the moon. The

Aweather proverb is, ' far-afF faul is a near-han' storm.'
   A220. halo round the moon is called a ' broch.' There is commonly

Aan opening in it, which is called the ' door.' The weather proverb is, '

far-off broch, a near shoor.'

   --221. Borgue, Dairy, Kirhnaiden. The spots on the moon are formed

by the man that gathered sticks on the Sabbath. He was transferred to

the moon, with his bundle of sticks on his back, as a punishment for

Sabbath-breaking.

   --222. Fortlogan. The mairt used to be killed when the moon was on

--the increase.
     223. Kirhnaiden. If a hen is set when the moon is on the increase it

is believed that the birds are hatched a day earlier than if she is set

during the time of waning.
--A224. Fortlogan.
                      sow brings forth as many pigs as the moon is old

--at the time she conceives.
     225. Kirkmaiden. Flax had to be steeped at such a time as that the

moon would not change while it lay in the 'dub,' or 'lint-dub.' It was

believed that if a change did take place the mucilage became thick and
the fibre was injured. To counteract this evil a piece of iron was thrown
into the ' dub ' among the flax.

    226. On seeing the new moon for the first time an unmarried woman

repeats the M'ords :

All hail to the muin, all hail to thee !

I pray thee, guid muin, come, tell to me
This night who my true love's to be.

Without speaking a word [afterwards] she goes to bed. She dreams of the
lover that will wed her.

   --227. Dairy. The first time a woman sees the new moon, she has to

--curtsey to her.
     228. Mochrur)%, Dairy. It is unlucky to see the new moon for the

first time ' through glass,' i.e., through a window.

     229. Balmaghie.-- li the new moon is lying on her back 'the rain does

not get through,' and so there will be fair weather. If she stands straight

up and down all the rain runs ofij and so the weather will be wet.

   --230. Rerrick. The circle round the moon is called a ' ring.' It indi-

cates a change of weather. The saying is

                              The farder oot the ring
                               The narder han' the storm.

  --231. Corsock. The halo round the moon is called a 'faul' (fold). It

is an indication of a coming storm. The open space in it lies in the

--direction from which the storm will blow.
     232. Rerrick. The circle round the moon is called a ' broch.' It is

looked on as an indication of a change of weather.

   --233. Corsock. When one sees the new moon for the first time, let the

money in the pocket be turned and three wishes formed, and they will be

fulfilled.

   --234. Dundrennan. Cabbage-seed must be sown in the waning of the

moon, else the plants will run to seed.

                          The Sun.

--235. Corsock. If at sunrise the sky becomes red, and the red extends

far over the sky, the day will be fine ; but if the red remains low, and

disappears soon after sunrise, rain follows in a short time.
--A236. Kirkmaiden.
--A237. Dundrennan.       mock sun is called a ' dog.'

                          glassy glittering sunset is an indication of a

breeze.

                                                    Thunder.

  --238. Minnigaff, Balmaghie. During a thunder-storm some are in the

habit of opening the door and windows of the dwelling-house, with the

idea of allowing the lightning to escape if it enters the house.

   --239. Balmaghie. The fire is taken out of the grate. Sometimes it is

extinguished with water.

   --240. Kirkmaiden, Minnigaff, Balmaghie. It is usual to cover up all

looking-glasses.

                          The Dwelling-house.

--241. Kirkmaiden. When the foundation of a house is laid, the work-

men are entertained with whisky. This whisky is called the ' funin pint,'

i.e., foundation pint.

    242. When the carpenters begin to put on the roof of a house, they

receive at times whisky. This is called the ' reefin pint,' i.e., roofing pint.

(Informant a carpenter.)
--243. Dairy. It is unlucky for one to build a house to live in.
--My244. Kirkmaiden.
                          informant has heard it said that it is unlucky

for one to build a house to live in.

  --245. Dcdry. It is not lucky for one to enter for the first time by the

back-door a house he (she) is to live in.

   --246. Balmaghie, Kirkmaiden. The floor of the dwelling-house must

never be swept towards the door, but towards the hearth.

   --247. Kirkmaiden. The hearthstone is accounted the most sacred part

of the dwelling-house.

  --248. Kells. When Kirkdale House, in the parish of Anwoth, was

built, the man that laid down the first load of stones for the buildino-
of it was hanged for the murder of a woman whom he had led astray, and

the mason that laid the first stone of it was killed in the course of its
4'64 REPORT-- 1897.

erection. The common explanation of these fatalities was that the owner

of the house had gained his fortune by unjust means.

     249. Kenmure Castle, in the parish of Kells, was planned to be built
on an island in Loch Ken, and a quantity of stones was laid down for its
building. During one night before the work was begun, they were all
(taken away and laid down on the site the Castle now holds. (Told in

Balmodellan.)

250. In a holm on the river Ken near Kenmure Castle there is a

large block of stone. It was thrown from Cairne Edward by the devil to

destroy Kenmure Castle. He put too much force into his cast, and the

--rock went over the Castle and fell on the holm beyond it.

    251. Rerrick. When the old church of Rerrick was being taken

down, the aunt of the wife of the man that had contracted to do so

remonstrated with her for allowing him to undertake the work. He or
Aanother of the workmen, she said, would be killed.

him and injured him.

   --252. Kirkmaiden. In flitting into a house that has been left vacant

fey another, no one enters it without first casting into it a living creature,
<;ommonly a cat or a hen. If ' ill has been left on the house,' it falls on
the animal that is thrown into it. It dies, and the lives of those that

are to dwell in the house are spared.

A253.  family at Aachliach, when removing, bore a grudge against

those that were to occupy the house after them. They swept the hearth

and the house clean, and put on 'a stone fire.' Something had been for-

j^otten in the house, and a daughter returned to fetch it.  The  '      that

                                                                   ill

--inany years was able to walk only on crutches.
      254. Eerrick. In going into a house from which another person or

iamily has removed, it was usual to cast into the house a living creature,

.as a cat or hen, before any of the family entered.

255. If one, on leaving a house, had a grudge against those that were

to live in it, the house was swept clean and a fire of stones and green

thorn was placed on the hearth.

   A256. family of the name of Burnet went into a house at Holehouse,

from which had gone out another family that bore an ill-will against the

new tenants for putting them from the house. The fire of stone and

green thorn had been placed on the hearth. The usual precaution of

casting in a living creature had been omitted. The youngest son was

Hethe first to enter the house. '      did nae guid aifter,' i.e., he fell into

weak health. My informant has heard the young man's brother tell the

story.

    257. My informant's daughter was removing from a house. To leave

the house as neat as she could for those that were to occupy it after her,

^3he swept the floor of the house, lifted the sweepings, and cast them out.

The man that was to inhabit the house was present. Seeing what she
did, he called out, ' Ye bitch, why did ye soop awa ma luck ?

                                                           Meal.

   --258. Bahnaghie. The ' kist,' or box in which the meal is kept, is
--called the ' ark ' or ' meal-ark.'

     259. Laurieston. Said a woman aged eighty-five, ' The meal is beetlt

doon i' the meal-ark till it is firm an' sad.'

--260. Tungland. The whisk used for brushing the dry meal off the

cakes is called ' the sooper,' and is made of the wing-feathers of domestic

fowls.

  --261. Kirhnaiden. In rolling out a cake, if a hole broke open in it,

--it is augured that strangers will eat of it.
     262. 2finnigaff. If the cake breaks in the rolling out, it is an omen

--that sti-angers will turn up to have a share in eating ' the bakan.'
     263. In baking a cake, if the ' crown of the farle ' breaks, it indicates

that strangers will eat of that bread.

  --264. Galloivay generally. The cake is commonly cut into three ' farles.'

   --265. Kirhnaiden. To find out whether the cake is sufficiently 'tired,'

it is usual to lift the ' crosn o' the farle.' If it breaks when lifted, it is

taken as an omen that the death of a near i-elative is at hand.

    266. When the crown of the 'farle' breaks during the course of

baking, the deatli of a friend will be heard of before the ' farle ' is eaten.

  --267. Bahnadellan, Rerrick, Laurieston, Dairy. If the crown of the

' farle                           breaks  in  the  course of  baking, it  is  regarded as a portent of  a
                               '

death at no distant period.

  --268. Tungland. If the crown of the ' farle ' breaks when taken off

--the 'girdle,' a death will soon be lieard of.
     269. Dairy. -When the ' girdle ' is taken off the fire and laid on the

floor after baking is finished, and before being laid aside, a scone or

' farle ' is left on it to keep off" ill-luck.

--270. Minnigqf.--The hollow side of the ' farle ' is placed uppermost.

to ' nip the croon o' the farle ' in eating it, i.e., to begin to eat tiie manner

from the top or crown.

  --272. Minnigaff. By many it is accounted bad manners to break oft'
--the crown of the ' farle ' first when one begins to eat it.

     273. Rerrick. It is accounted unlucky to begin to eat from the

' croon o' the farle.'

  --274. Laurieston. Said an old woman to me : 'A " melder bannock "

was made for the wee yins.'
--A275.
                                  kind of bannocks, called ' treacle bannocks,' used to be made
for use about the New Year. They were composed of oatmeal with,

treacle added. Sometimes carraway seeds were added.

--276. Kells. It is unlucky to pull down a meal mill.

My277.                            informant's uncle was a miller. He was put out of his mill

by a family of Maxwell. J. McQueen, a neighbour, said that ' they widd

a' gang like braxy sheep. Nae boddie widd doe ony guid that knockit

doon a mortart (moultert) mill.' The family afterwards went to ruin.
The meal- mill was turned into a saw-mill.

278. ' They never thrive that middle wi' kirk or mill.'

279. There was no milling on New Year's Day, ' except when thrang.'

281. "When the apprenticeship was finished, there was 'the prentice

lowsan' i.e., there was a feast, a 'high ' tea with a little drinking of

Awhisky.    dance completed the festivity. What money was left over

was given to the young man to help him to make a start in life. Till

lately this was quite a common custom.

houses of their customers to exercise their calling. This was called ' tc

his apprenticeship, for his companions and friends to give a ball. It was

Mycalled ' the lousin ball.'  informant has seen such balls.
--285. Balmaghie. Saddlers were, at one time, in the habit of going to

                    bottle of whisky was always carried to the smithy

--when a horse was to receive his first set of shoes.
     287. Eirkmaiden. -A bottle of whisky was given to the blacksmith
when he put on the first set of shoes of a young horse. Part was drunk

--when the first nail was driven.
    288. Mochrum. When a young horse was brought to the smithy to

be shod for the first time, the blacksmith, before driving the first nail,

' sounded ' the foot by striking it with the hammer.

  --289. Portlogan. In welding two pieces of iron, if they 'misst the

heat,' and did not weld, some barley-straw was got, laid on the ground

round the ' studdy,' and burned. The two pieces of iron were again laid

Myin the fire to ' tack the heat again ' for welding.                                                                         informant has seen

this done.

290. No regular blacksmith could be induced to make the nails for the
Acrucifixion of our Saviour.
                              travelling blacksmith did so. The tinkers

have wandered ever since. (Communicated chiefly by two blacksmiths.)

  --291. Corsock. It was the custom to drink whisky on the occasion of a

young horse getting the first set of shoes. If the first nail driven went

straight, the blacksmith used to say : ' The whisky's win.' If the nail
did not go straight, it was thought the blacksmith had not fairly won his
' dram,' for it might be refused. Though the custom has, for the most
part, been given up, the blacksmith will sometimes say when he drives
the first nail straight : ' The whisky's win.'

   --292. Girthon. When an apprentice blacksmith finished his appren-

ticeship, his companions and friends sometimes gave a ball, called 'the
lousin ball.' The apprentice gave no money for its expenses, and if there
was any money ovei-, after paying the expenses, it was given to the

--apprentice.

words :

            ' Here's to pottie, paint, and glue.'

common harassed a bull were asked for alms by a tramp. Each gave
him a little. The tramp turned from his begging, entered into some sort
of business, and made a fortune, and so became a ' man.'

     295. Another explanation, differing in some respects from this, was
communicated by a tailor.

   --296. Kirkmaiden. When an apprentice gardener completed his

apprenticeship, his companions gave him a ball called the ' lowsan ball.'

   --297. Dundrennan, Parish of Rerrick. Weavers did not weave on

New Year's Day.

                                                 The Clergy.

   --298. Borgue. It is unlucky to speak ill of a minister.
  --299. Balmaghie. It is unlucky to speak ill of a minister, or to do him

any harm. Once a few men would play a trick on a minister, and they

contrived to induce him to take strong drink till he was overcome. This
act caused a scandal, and the minister was charged with drunkenness

before the Presbytery by libel. The men that had been the cause of his
slip were summoned as witnesses. All of them were ill and confined to
bed when the trial came on, so that not one of them was able to appear at

the court to give evidence.

    ' No. Why do you ask ?

     ' It's an aul story here, the minister's dog aye barks at them it dinna

                       Cattle.

--304. Dairy. In spring the cattle of a farm used to be bled. Part

of the blood was baked into a kind of bread (oaten) called 'bleed

scones.'
--305. Kirkmaiden. About sixty years ago all the cattle were bled in
Aspring. The blood was preserved, and cooked as food.
                                                       little was

mixed with it.

                                  stone Avhorl or 'bort stone' is

placed by some over the byre door inside, to keep off witches.

   --307. Crossmichael. Cattle were rubbed over with a ' bort stone ' to

ward off disease.
--A308. FenningJiame.
                       ' holt stone,' i.e., a stone with a natural hole

or cavity in it, or ' bort stone,' i.e., a stone whorl, was kept in the water-

ing trough of the cattle. Sometimes the guidwife took a besom, whisked

it round and round the trough, and then sprinkled some of the water over

the cattle as they stood round the trough.

309. In the cattle- watering-trough on the farm of Garchew, in the

parish of Penninghame, a 'holt stone ' was kept for the protection and

luck of the cattle. It was called ' Old Nanny's mother's trough stane.'

Old Nanny Wilson died about 1891, at the age of ninety years.

   --310. Corsock. Sometimes the nose of a cow, stot, or calf will swell.

The animal is said to be ' weasel-blawn.' It is supposed the swelling is

caused by the bite of an adder. If there are any feathers in the house,

they are taken and placed under the animal's nose, and set on fire. The
                                                                                                 HH2

smoke is supposed to effect a cure. If there are no feathers available at
the time, a fowl is killed without delay and plucked, and the feathers

--are used.
     311. Kirkinaiclen. Before the cows were put forth to grass for the
first time in spring, some had the custom of sprinkling over them a
mixture of salt and urine that has been long kept, and thus smelt

--strongly.
    312. Dairy. Sixty years ago my informant has seen fire put down

in the byre-doorway on Beltane, and the cows were made to pass

--over it.
     313. Corsock. It is the belief that, if a cow or a ewe, immediately

after coition, gets a fright from any object, the offspring is of the same

colour as the object that causes the fright. John McKie at Drumhuphry,

Kirkpatrick-Durham, was one day leading a black Galloway cow from

the bull, when a white animal jumped a hedge near the cow. She took

--Afright. The offspring of the cow was white.
314. Kirkmaiden.           little salt used to be put by some on a cow's

back when bought.

315. If a cow began to tremble, it was believed she had been struck

Awith a fairly shot.  wise woman was sent for, and she carefully groped

Aover the animal's body for the hole made by the shot.        cure was a

cjuantity of soot, salt, and butter made up into three balls, and put down

the animal's throat.

A A316. man's cow became ill and fell down.              ' skeely ' woman was

sent for. She came and rubbed the animal all over with an 'elf-shot.'"

The animal jumped up as if nothing had been the matter.

  --317. Corsock. If a cow did not give her milk, some feathers were

taken from a pillow or bolster, placed before her, right under her nose,,

--Aand set fire to, so that she might inhale the smoke.
318. Kirkmaiden.           byre-girl sprinkles her urine over a cow's

back when she is going to calve. This is done to keep off witches

and ill-luck. Not long ago a farmer's widow ordered her byre-girl to

do this.

    319. When a cow dropped the calf, a little salt was placed on her

--back.
     320. Tungland. Some salt or oatmeal was put on the cow's bach

over the ' neers,' i.e., kidneys, when she dropped the calf.
--My321. Kells.
                      informant's mother used to put a little oatmeal on

--the cow's back after the calf was dropped.
    322. Tungland. When a cow calved, oatmeal and salt mixed together

--Awere sprinkled along the cow's back and over the calf.
323. Balmagltie.      mixture of oatmeal and salt was put on the cow's

--back over the kidneys when she dropped the calf.
     324. Tungland, Kirkmaiden. Beesnan is the name of the milk first

drawn from the cow after calving. Part of it is at times given to the

--cow.
    325. Kirkmaiden. When the cow calved, a little salt was, and is

still, put by some into the pail into which the milk is drawn. (From

more than one informant.)

My326.       informant has seen a sixpenny piece put into the pail into

which a cow was milked the first time after calving. (More than one

informant.)

327. Part of the milk of newly-calved cows is cooked into a dish
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICx\L SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 469

called ' Beesnan cheese.' Pancakes, called ' Beesnan pancakes,' are at

times made of it.

   A328. little salt was put into the churn when butter was being made

to keep off witch-spells. (Informant eighty-one years of age.)

    329. When cream was long in coming, some had the custom of putting
a sixpenny piece into the churn or under it.

     330. Some had the custom of drying a newly calved calf with ' shillin-

sids.'
--A331. Balmaghie.
                           little of the cow's droppings was put into the

calf's mouth when it came from the cow.

   --332. Kirkmaiden. Some put an egg into the calf's mouth when

dropped from the cow.

   --333. Tune/land. The calf gets part of the ' beesnan.'

                                  The Horse.

--A334. Kirkmaiden.        mare was always foaled outside if possible. If

foaled inside, the foal when grown would lie down when passing through

a, ford, or break a man's leg.

335. It was accounted unlucky if a mare foaled inside the stable.

--336. Portlogan. Twa white feet you may buy,

              But three never try.

--337. Corsock. Mares are still foaled outside, except in early spring if

tfhe weather is too cold.

338. Some keep whistling during the time a young horse is being shod

for the first time. It is thought the whistling keeps the animal quiet.

   --338a. Some farmers had the custom of carrying a sheaf of oats to the

smithy when they took a young horse to receive the first set of shoes.

When the shoes were being put on they kept feeding the animal with

handfuls of the grain, under the idea that this kept it quiet.

   A339. young horse commonly gets its name when it is between two

and three years old, when one begins to train it to work. (My informants

--Myare blacksmiths in Corsock.)
340. Kelton.  informant in 1894 went into a cot-house in the

parish of Kelton. As he was entering he observed a horse-shoe placed

on the ground at each side of the door. He asked the cot-man's wife

what she meant by having them there, and where she got them. She said :

We' brocht them frae oor last place in Borgue, and they are a pair o' the

shoes o' the pair o' horse my man drove, an' as lang as they are there,

we'll keep oor place.' ' But if one was t' steal them, what would happen 1

said my informant. ' Then we'll no be lang here,' was the answer.
--An341. Kirkmaiden.
                           old horse-shoe is sometimes nailed to the inside

of the byre-door to bring luck.

   --342. Rcrrick. The skeleton of a horse's head was found below the

pulpit when the old parish church was pulled down.

                                                               Sheep.

   --343. Kirkmaiden. About forty years ago it was the custom to put a

Idttle salt in the mouth of the lamb when it fell from the ewe. This was

supposed to cleanse the mouth.

     344. Sheep before a change of weather always leap and frisk, and box

(·butt) each other.

                         Pigs.

--A345. Tungland.        sow, when she farrows, gets a farle of bread (oaten)

and butter.

   --346. Kirhmaiden. Some would allow only one with dark eyes to look

for the first time on a young pig when brought home. One woman would

not permit any one to look on the young pig she brought home till Betty

McMaster with her black eyes looked on it.

                         The Cat.

--A347. Bahnac/hie.      black cat not belonging to the house coming in is

looked upon as unlucky.

                                              The Hedgehog.

   --348. Balmaghie. To meet a live hedgehog in the morning is regarded

as an omen of good luck.
     349. To come across a dead hedgehog is deemed unlucky.

                         The Hare.

--350. BahnadeUan. It is unlucky to meet a hare,
--351. Balmaghie, Rerrick. It is deemed unlucky if a hare crosses the

path in front of one.
--A352. Corsock.
                       man of the name of McGeorge, if he had been going

to fetch home a young pig to rear and had met a hare, was wont to turn

--Aback. He believed the pig would not thrive if brought home that day.
353. Port Patrick.       fisherman accounts it unlucky to meet a hare

Wewhen he is going in the morning to ' fish his net ' (salmon). '  needna

gang, boys, there she is,' says a fisherman to his companions, if such a

thing happens. He does not utter the word ' hare.'
--A354. Rerrick.
                       hare running along the street of the village of

Dundrennan is looked upon as very unlucky. Some years ago a hare ran

along the street. Not long after an epidemic broke out, but my informant

did not remember what epidemic it was.

  --355. Borgue. It is deemed unlucky to meet a hare in the morning.
  --356. Kirkmaiden. If a fisherman in going to the fishing meets a hare

he will turn and go back, as there will be no luck that day.

                                     The Wild Rabbit.

--357. Balmaghie. Some account it unlucky to meet a wild rabbit.

                         Domestic Fowls.

--A358. Rerrick, Kirkmaiden.  cock crowing at the door forebodes the

coming of a stranger.

  --359. Kirkmaiden. It was at one time a belief that if a cock reached

the age of seven years he laid an egg, which, when hatched, produced

a cockatrice.

  --360. Kirkmaiden. It is an indication of a coming misfortune if a

cock crows at night.

   --361. Balmaclellan. If the cock goes crowing to bed, he'll rise wi' a

watery head.

opened the door, and light in hand looked in what direction the bird was

looking. That direction indicated the direction from which some piece of

--bad news was to come.

    363. Kirkmaiden. When a hen crowed she was killed at once. Such

Aa thing was accounted very unlucky. ' era win' hen's no sonsey ' and
A' crawin' hen an' a whisslin' lass is no sonsey ' and ' Whisslin' maidens an'

--crawing hens are no lucky aboot ony man's hoose,' are three saws.
     364. Kirkmaiden. The small egg a hen sometimes lays bears the

names of a ' nocht ' and ' a mock.' Such an occurrence is regarded as the

forerunner of some piece of misfortune.
--365. Minnigaff. The first egg a hen lays is called a 'maiden egg.'
--A366. Kirkmaiden.
--A367. Portlogan.   hen is set in the evening after sunset.

                    hen is not set during the month of May. TJie

saying about chickens hatched in May is :

                             Come oot in May
                             Moom for aye.

--368. Portlogan. A hen hatches as many chickens as the days of the

moon's age when she is set.
--A369. Kirkmaiden.
                             hen is set with an odd number of eggs,

commonly thirteen.

   --370. Kirkmaiden. If the tread is right on the top of the egg, a cock-

bird is hatched, if it is towards the side a hen-bird comes forth.

   --371. Kirkmaiden. If a black spot is painted on the egg of a white

hen before it is placed for hatching, the bird hatched will have a black

spot.

   --372. Balmaclellan. It is considered unlucky if a hen lays a very

--Asmall egg. Guidwives did not like to get such an egg.
373. Balmaclellan.           hen is set in the gloaming with the number of

                     The Adder.

  --415. Kirkmaiden. If one meets with an adder and tries to kill it, but

fails to do so by its escaping, a ' tryst ' is made to meet with it next day

at a fixed hour and place, and it will keep the ' tryst,' so that another

opportunity is given to put it to death. The uncle of one of my in-

formants actually did this. It was a common thing to do this when one

of my informants was a boy.

   A416. farmer of the name of Milnmine occupied the farm of Myroch.

One day he went to an uncultivated hillock that was covered with whins

to cut some. Near it was a hollow, and looking down into it from the

--hillock, he saw a great number of adders as many as would fill ' the box

--of a cart all squirming through each other,' witli a white one in the

middle of them. He threw among them the axe with which he was to

cut the whins, and turned and fled. Next day he returned to search for

--his axe. In his search he found an adder- stone a white stone with a

hole through the centre of it. He preserved it carefully by putting it

into his ' kist.' He was never without money afterwards.
--My417. Minnigaff.
                     informant's husband had an adder-stone. It

                  cure for the sting of an adder is for the one stung

to drink new milk to vomiting.

   A420. cure is to drink new milk and to rub the wound with a salve

made by boiling ash leaves with new milk.
--A421. Borgue.
                  decoction of ash leaves boiled in milk is applied to

Mythe wound caused by the bite of an adder.          informant saw this

applied to the cure of a calf stung by an adder about 1850.

                                                       Caterpillar.

   --424. Girthon. The caterpillar of the Nettle Butterfly ( Fanessa uriicce)

bears the name of ' Grannie.' When one meets one crossing the path or

otherwhere, it is spit upon. If this is not done, it is believed that some
misfortune will befall the grandmother, if she is alive.

                                           The Spider.

429. Kirkmaiden.    informant has seen pieces of rowan tree laid on

the mantel-piece to protect the house from witches.

  --430. Portlogan. The thowl pins of a boat, or at least some of them,

are always made of rowan tree.

   --431. Kirkmaiden. Fishermen tie their lines to a I'owan stick to keep

--the witches at a distance.
    432. Borgue. Rowan tree was used as a protection for unbaptizecl

children against witches.

   --433. Balmaghie. Our Saviour always carried in one hand a staff of

hoUand, i.e., the holly tree, and in the other a rod of rowan tree.

  --434. Corsock. The farmer of Grogo Mill had in the byres some of the

stakes to which the cattle are fastened, made of rowan tree, as a safeguard

from witches. He died about ten years ago.
    435. Kerrick.--^lj informant saw an old woman bring a piece of

rowan tree into the byre of one of her neighbours on the occasion of a cow

--falling ill.
    436. Balmaghie. About twenty years ago my informant saw at Loch-

inbreck a woman milking her cow tied to a rowan tree.

    --437. Corsock, Kells. In houses built some time ago, it was quite com-

mon to have some of the lintels made of rowan tree.

  --438. Corsock. It was customary to plant rowan tree in the garden.
   --438a. Kells. It was a custom to plant rowan tree as well as elder,

--near the dwelling-house and byres, as a protection against witches.
     439. Corsock. 'Binnans,' i.e., bindings for cattle, were formerly made
of bent rods of wood. It was not uncommon to have some of them in each
byre made of rowan wood as a safeguard against witches.

   --440. Kirkmaiden.- In Claish Glen, near Portlogan, grow fairy trees,

i.e., blackthorn bushes, which no one will cut, and some will not even

touch them.

A441.        blackthorn bush growing in a field is sometimes called a

* fairy thorn.' It is not removed, though it stands in the way.

                          Whooping-covgli.

  --444. Kirkpatrick, Durliam. My informant has talked with a woman

whose maiden name was the same as that of her husband's, who used to

give a ' piece ' to children labouring under whooping-cough that were

brought to her for cure.
-- My445. Kells.
                  informant has seen children labouring under whooping-

cough brought to receive a ' piece ' from his wife, whose maiden name was

the same as his own. When the child was unable to eat the whole of the

' ipiece ' that had been given, the remainder was carefully wrapped in the

child's pinafore and taken home.
--A446. Rerrick.
                  cure for whooping-cough is to put the patient

through under the belly of an ass.

   --447. Corsock. It was a custom to take children having whooping-

cough away in carts four or five miles to the hills, to cure them of the

disease.

                                                                 Warts.

   --448. Corsock. Put ivy leaves steeped in vinegar over warts as a cure.

My informant has tried. this cure.

   A My449. cure for warts is to rub them with green bean-leaves.

informant has done this.

     450. The juice of Dandelion (Leontodon taraxacum) is used as a cure

ior warts.

      451. Swine's blood rubbed over warts dispels them.

   --452. Kells. Take a potato, make a hole in it, fill the hole with salt,
--and allow it to melt. Rub the warts with the lotion.

     453. Crossmichael. Take a pebble for each wart, roll them in a piece
of paper, and lay the parcel on a public road. Whoever picks up the

parcels gets the warts.

                                                              Whitlow.

finger or thumb.

                                                The Mumps.

  --455. Corsock. The Mumps (?) is called 'Branks.' The mode of cure

is to put a horse's branks over the patient's head and lead him or her to
water as one does a hoi'se.

                                                                 Jaimdice.

  --456. Bahnaghie. Strip off the inner bark or fell from the wych elm,

boil it, and drink the juice. There is one of these trees about a quarter

of a mile from Lauriestou. It is quite a practice for folks to come to it

for a few branches to get the bark. Sometimes they come from a distance,
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 477

as it is the only tree of the kind in the district. It has been cut down
oftener than once, but new shoots have sprung up.

                                                  The Hair.

   --457. Fortlogan. If one's hair when cut is burned, it will make him

' that cross that there is nae leevan in the hoose wi' 'im.'

    458. When one's hair is cut, it is carefully gathered up, twisted

together, and pushed into the thatch of the dwelling-house.

   --459. Kirkmaiden. When one's hair is cut, it is gathered up, put into

a hole of a dyke, so that the birds may not get it.

   --460. Fortlogan. If birds get one's hair and build their nests with it,

the late owner of it will have headache as long as the female bird remains

' clocking.'

                      Birth.

--461. Kirkmaiden. The Bible was put below the pillow of a womar^

in travail. (Informant eighty-one years of age.)
--462. Minnigaff. After the birth of a baby there is a feast called
A' The Blythe Meat.'
                      kebback always forms part of the good things.

The father cut a big piece off it, put it on a plate along with a knife, and

handed it to the mother in bed. She cut the cheese into small pieces and

gave each of the guests a piece.

   --463. Kirkmaiden. At ' The Blythe Meat ' there is always a kebbacfc

or cheese, called 'the cryin-out cheese.' The father always cuts it. The

first piece cut was always given to the nurse. It was larger than the

pieces given to the others present at the feast. (Informant eighty-one

years of age.)

   --464. Kirkmaiden. It was the custom for the mother to fetch water

from the well for the llrst time after her confinement in a very small vessel,

most commonly in her thimble. This was done to keep the baby fronji

My' sliveran.'  informant (eighty-one years of age) was told to do this.
--465. Kirkmaiden. It is unlucky to put the first-born child into a new

cradle. (Informant eighty-one years of age.)

A466.  cradle, when taken into a house, is not taken in empty.

(Informant eighty-one years of age.)
--A467. Balmaghie.
                      ci'adle is always taken into, a house with its fooc

foremost.

  --468. When a cradle is borrowed, something is always put into it.

     469. Kirkmaiden. The cradle is rocked across the floor with its head

towards the door. (Informant eighty-one years of age.)
--470. Laurieston. The cradle is always placed across the floor.
--A471. Kirkmaiden.
                      Bible was usually put into the cradle till the

child was baptized.

  --472. Dairy. Sometimes a piece of bread and cheese is tied under the

baby's dress when about to be baptized. After baptism the bread and

cheese are given to the unmarried present at the baptism, who put then>

under their pillows to ' dream on.'

   --473. Kirkmaiden. On the occasion of a baptism, when the minister

left the house, sometimes an elderly woman would sprinkle part of the-

baptismal water over the other childi-en of the family, and ask God to-

--bless them. This custom is sometimes followed at the present time.
    474. Kirkmaiden. The one that saw a baby's first tooth had to make

the present of a dress. (Informant eighty-one years of age.)
478 REPORT-- 1897.

                                         Marriage Divination.

     476. Kirkmaiden (1). Two stalks of a plant beginning to flower,

but without bloom, are taken, one to represent the ' lad ' and the other
the ' lass,' and laid beside each other under a stone. Next morning the
diviner makes an examination of the stalks. If both stalks are in bloom,
the love will be mutual ; but if only one is in bloom, all the love is on the
side of the one whose stalk is in bloom.

      476. (2) The first egg of a ' yearack,' i.e., a hen that begins to lay the
year she is hatched, is taken and broken, and the white of it is dropped
into a glass filled with water. From the forms made by the white of the
egg in the water omens of coming events are drawn.

     477. (3) Take a snail on the morning of May Day and shut it up in

any kind of dish. Omens are drawn from the figures made by the slime.
The diviners tried to detect the form of letters in the slime marks.

   --478. Portlogan (4). The young woman that divines takes a mirror

and stands with her back to the moon, and holds up the mirror to the

moon so as to let the moon strike on it. As many images of the moon as
are reflected in it, so many years will pass before she is married.

    479. Minnigaff.--li a young unmarried woman eats on Hallowe'en a

whole herring, i.e., with scales, bones, entrails, and fins, without speaking
a word, and then goes to bed also without speaking, she will see in a dream

the man that is to be her husband. My informant has known of this

being done.

     480. If an unmarried woman on Hallowe'en goes through the

barn, entering by the one door and going out by the other, with a
stocking on the wires, she will ' meet her fate,' i.e., she will meet her future

husband. My informant knew a young woman who did so. Her master

met her. The young woman thought some one had sent him. She went
to the dwelling-house and told her mistress, who was lying very ill. All
that the mistress said was : ' Mary, he kind to my wee ones.' She died

--next day. In course of time Mary was married to her master.
     481. Ayrshire. The first time a young woman sees the new moon

she takes her garter and begins to cast knots on it, and without stojDping
to keep in mind the number of them, she repeats this formula :

                                  This knot I knit _
                               To see the thing I ne'er saw yet.

                          To see my love in his array

                             As he walketh every day.

                                  If that he appears in green,
                                 Better his face I ne'er had seen

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

                                   If that he appears in blue,
                                His love is ever true.

If at the end of repeating the formula nine knots have been cast, the

--wooing will end in wedlock ; but if not, the wooing will end in failure.
    482. Balmaghie. If an unmarried man or woman is asked to take

the last piece of food on the dish, it is an indication of getting a handsome
wife or husband.

     483. It is accounted unlucky to hear one's own proclamation of
banns of marriage made in church.

  --484. Mochrum. It is unlucky to have the bridal dress fitted on.
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 479

--485. Dairy. It is not lucky for a bride to put on the bridal dress

--Abefore the marriage day.bride ought on no account to look in a looking-

--glass after being dressed.
      487. Dairy. If the bi-idegroom enters the marriage-house before the

minister, the married pair will not live together.

  --488. Kirkmaiden, Mochrum. The minister must always be in the

bridal house before the bridegroom enters. If this is not the case the

--bridegroom and his party wait till the minister enters. I have seen this.
     489. Mochrum. It is considered unlucky if the minister shakes hands

with the bride or bridegroom before they are joined in marriage.

   A490. mother should not see her daughter married.

491. It is accounted unlucky if the bride-cake is broken or chipped.

492. It is unlucky to be married to a bi-ide who is with child at the

time of marriage.

   --493. Laurieston. It is accounted unlucky for a marriage party to
Ameet a funeral.
                  farmer with his party was driving to be married.

A funeral was seen approaching along a road that joined the road

leading to the church and churchyard. The marriage party drove quite

quickly so as to get in front of the funeral procession, but did not

make out to do so. The bridegroom took the matter much to heart.

After marriage, things did not go well on the farm. This misfortune, as

well as every mishap that befell, was attributed to the funeral cortege

meeting the marriage party. The fai'mer brooded so much on the

matter, and spoke so constantly on it, that his wife's life was made

Mymiserable.  informant knew the farmer.
--494. Rerrick. It is accounted unlucky for the bride and bridegroom

to meet during the time between the proclamation of banns and the

meeting before the minister to be joined in marriage. In the parish of

Eerrick a marriage took place between a pair that lived in the same house.

On the afternoon of the Sunday on which the proclamation of banns

was made, the bride and bridegroom took a walk together along the

sea-shore. This act excited no small attention, and called forth many

remarks about how improper it was to do such a thing.

  --495. Crossmichael. It is unlucky to finish a bridal dress and then

put it on to see how it fits or looks. Some little bit, such as sewing on a

hook or button, is left unfinished. After trying on the dress it is finished.

This was done in the case of my informant's daughter on the occasion of

her marriage in August 1896.

496. It is considered lucky if the dressmaker accidentally let slip

Myfrom her hand the bridal dress she is making.  informant's

daughter was married in August 1896, when the dressmaker who lived

in the house of the bride's father to prepare the bride's outfit told this

' fret.'

                                           Marriage Customs.

  --497. Kirkmaiden. In the days when hand-spinning was part of the

employment of the women of the household, the young women spun the
thread and yarn for their own sheets and blankets.

     498. The bride's mother sometimes went to invite her guests to the
marriage. The bridegroom invited his own guests.

  --499. Minnigaff. At the feet-washing, the feet, both of the bride
480 KEPORT-- 1897.

and bridegroom, were put into the bine [hooped tub {ef. bin)] at once.

--AThe water was mixed with cinders and soot.
500. Mochrum, Dairy.        bride must always wear something

borrowed.

  --501. Kirkmaiden. An oatmeal cake used to be thi'own at the bride's

head as she was entering her future home. It was accounted lucky if it

struck her and broke.
--My502. Dairy.
                       informant has seen a farle of oatmeal cake broken

--on the bride's head as she entered the door of her own house.
    503. Ayrshire. When the bride came to the door of her new home,

an oatmeal cake was thrown over her head. It was accounted lucky if it

--broke in falling, or when it fell on the ground.
     504. Crossmichael, Kirhiuiiden. The bridegroom's mother, if alive,

--often was the one to give the bride the welcome to her own house.
     505. Laurieston. In villages, as the bridal procession is passing, the

children have a custom  of  calling  out ' Ba !  Ba !                   Coppers are thrown
                                                                     '

among them. When the bridegroom's party is approaching, the bride's

party at times rushes out and meets it. Both parties meet each other with
much shouting.

  --506. Balmaclellan. It was not long ago the custom, when the bride-

groom's party was within a mile or so of the abode of the bride, for a few of

the young men to set out to ' run the broose.' The bride gave a silk

handkerchief to the one that reached the house first, and so 'won the

broose.'

  --507. Laurieston. The mother is never present at the marriage of

any of her children.

  --507a. Crossmichael. The minister commonly cuts the bride-cake. In

doing so he hands the ' toorack ' i.e., the top, to the bride. The part below

is given to the bridegroom, and the remainder is cut up for the guests.

This custom was followed at the marriage of my informant's daughter in

August 1896.

     508. The door is thrown wide open when the bride is entering her
new home.

    509. Old folks have told my informant that it was at one time the

custom, when the bride presented herself at the door of her future home,

for one to take a besom and to sweep the floor of the apartment ; the bride

entered towards the sweeper (?), all the time repeating the words--

              ' Soop the hoose till the bride comes in,'

till the bride reached the hearth.

   --510. Balmaclellan.- Sometimes it was an aged woman who welcomed

the bride to her own home. She broke bread over her head. This bread

was taken by the unmarried folks and placed below their pillows 'to

dream on.'

  --511. Crossmichael. When the bride entered her own house it was the

custom at times to go right up to the hearth and touch the ' crook.'

                            Death Omens.

--A512. Corsock, Borgue.    dog howling at night is a portent of death.

513. Kirkmaiden.--^orae years ago one of the gamekeepers at Logan

House took ill, lingered for some time, and died. For a good many days

before his death the dogs kept up a great howling, generally in the gloam-
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 481

Aing.   day or two before the death took place, one dog in particular

gave way to extraordinary howling. It all ceased after the death.

  --514. Balmaghie. Chairs cracking in a house is a portent of death in

--the family.
     515. Dairy. Doctor Trottar was one day called to visit a patient.

When setting out, the horse stumbled and fell. Those who saw what

took place said the patient would die. The patient died. (Told by his

daughter.
--My516. Kirkmaiden.
                      informant's grandfather, a carpenter, said he

always heard the noise of a saw during the night before he got the order

to make a coffin.

My517.         informant's father, a carpenter, said he always heard one

knock on the end of his own bedstead before he got an order to make a

coffin.

  --518. Kells. If one dies, and lies unburied over Sunday in a parish,

another will die within the week.
--A A519. Rerrick.
                   dog howling at night is an omen of death.   young

woman at a farm in Rerrick was seized with inflammation of the lungs.

After she fell ill, the dog began to howl, and no means could be found to
stop the animal while she was lying ill. She died, and after the death the

dog ceased his howling.

    520. My informant at Burnfoot was one afternoon entertaining a

friend or two at tea. As they were making ready to leave three extra-

ordinary knocks were heard in a room on the other side of the lobby. The
guests and she immediately went into the room to try to find out the

cause of the knocks. One of the guests searched all round and under the

table from which the knocks seemed to proceed. Nothing could be seen.

A post or two after brought intelligence of the death of a very intimate

friend, who had died about the time the knocks had been heard.

   A521. man named James Whyte died at Burnfoot. On his death his

son went to the house of my informant's father, tapped on the window,

and said his father had just died. Immediately before the news of the
death was given, a very loud crash, as if something had fallen and been

smashed to pieces, was heard in one of the rooms.

My522.         informant's grandmother told her that when a child of hers,

twenty-one months, was lying ill in the cradle, a most sweet sound was

heard to begin near the door of the apartment in which the cradle stood,

and move round the apartment, past the fireplace, to the cradle, where it

--stopped. When the mother looked into the cradle, the child was dead.
    523. Bahnaclellan. When one of the ministers of Balmaclellan was

lying very ill and low, his niece was one night watching him. All at once

the sweetest music she had ever heard began. Her uncle heard it too,

Heand said : 'That's a call for me. I will not be long here.'  died not

long after. (Told by the minister's niece to my informant.)

   --524. Laurieston. If a dead body lies unburied over Sunday, there will

be ' other tway deaths within the week,' or if not within the week within,

a short time.

                      Death Customs.

--525. Kirkmaiden. All the doors and windows of the house in which

Myone lay dying used to be thrown open.  informant has seen her sister

do so.

  --526. Portlogan. When one was dying, it was the custom to keep the

--door of the house wide open.
    527. Kirhnaiden. It is the custom to stop the clock when one dies.

My informant has seen this done within three years.

    528. When the eyes of a dead person do not close, penny pieces are put

over them.

  --529. Balmaghie. To ' straucht a corpse ' is to lay out a dead body.
  --530. Kirhnaiden. The dead body always lies on the bed on which

the death takes place, till it is dressed and put into the coffin.

    531. It was not an unusual thing for a woman to spin the thread of

her own grave-clothes.

My532.  informant, a carpentei', is in the habit of washing his hands

after putting the dead body into the coffin. It was at one time the usual

custom to do so.
A533.
       plate containing a little salt was till lately placed on the

breast of the dead body.

     534. The dead body, except for some special reason, is usually kept

unburied for five or six days.

535. Till about twenty years ago it was the usual custom that a few

neighbours, both men and women, met at the house of death about 10

o'clock at night. Refreshments were usually served as they arrived, and

when they left in the morning. For these refreshments some brewed their
Aown beer.
            good deal of time was spent in reading the Bible, in singing

--psalms, with prayer occasionally.
     536. Balmaghie. One ought never to refuse to 'see a boddie's dead'

when asked to look on a dead body.

537. J/oc/irMwi.--Invitations to a funeral used to be given till within
Aa few years ago by a messenger.
                                    common form of invitation was :

' Your company is requested to the funeral of  at

--o'clock.
     538. Kirkmaiden. The messenger that called the people to a funeral

almost never entered the house of those invited, but stood outside the
door and gave the message. If he did enter the house, he did not sit

down. On finishing his round, he returned to the house of death.

      539. Refreshments till within a few years ago were given to those
that attended a funeral. In the case of a farmer or any of his family the

guests assembled in the barn. Men were appointed to hand round the

refreshments, and they were called ' service men.' There are generally

four or five, and at times as many as six ' services.' Commonly a ' service
man ' stood at the door and proffered a glass of whisky to each one on his

arrival. When all were assembled, the ' service men ' began their work.

--First came a ' service ' of whisky with bread and cheese ' funeral bread,'

i.e., oaten cakes baked for the funeral. The second consisted of sherry

and port wine with short-bread, or small ' bakes,' i.e., biscuits, or ' dollar
biscuits.' The third might be of rum or brandy, and the fourth of gin, or

whisky, or beer.

    When the custom fell into disuse, many of the old-fashioned folk

expressed their displeasure, and said that ' a beerial was na worth

    540. Mochrum. At a funeral sometimes whisky and a bake were given

at the church door.

the funeral, return to the house of the departed and partake of a meal,

commonly ' high tea.' The joiner who makes the coffin commonly gets a

list of those that are wished to be so entertained.

   --542. Kirkmaiden, Minnigaff. It was till not long ago a custom to

cut off a piece of the grave-clothes immediately before the coffin was closed,

--and to preserve it.
     543. Kirkmaiden. The coffin is taken out by the door and not by a
window, except in rare cases when it cannot be taken through the door-

--way. The body must be taken out by the door the deceased came in.
    544. Balmagliie. At a funeral the women of the house never go out-

--side, but shut themselves up.
     545. Kirkmaiden. The coffin is usually carried to the graveyard. To

take the coffin to the graveyard in a cart, which is sometimes done, is
accounted a less honourable mode of burial than to be carried.

546. Fifty years ago there was very little conversation carried on by

those that formed the funeral procession ; and if any was carried on, it was
in subdued tones. It is quite different nowadays. There is conversa-

tion, and it runs on all kinds of subjects.

  --547. Mochrum. In tolling the church-bell at a funeral, three tolls in

succession are given, and then an interval.

My548.  informant, a gravedigger, has sometimes seen each of the

relatives of the deceased throw a handful of mould on the coffin after it was

lowered into the grave.
--A549. Kirkmaiden.
                         man of somewhat bad character died at Logan.

When the coffin was being carried to the grave many extraordinary diffi-

culties came in the way. At last one old man called out, ' In God's name,

--lay 'im doon, an' lat the deil tack 'im.'
    550. Cross michael. When one' dies the room is darkened.

My551. When one dies the clock is stopped.   informant has heard

the order given ' Stop the clock.'

    552. On the occasion of a death it is the custom to burn the chaff of

the bed and the bed-straw.

  --553. Balmadellan. Between forty and fifty years ago, Fanny Ireland

or Macmillan, an old woman that lived in Balmadellan, fell ill. The aunt
of my informant's wife went to ask how she was. She found she had not

long to live. She stayed a long time. When she returned home, her

mother asked her why she had stayed so long. She said she had been
helping to carry the dying woman ' weathershins ' round her house, and
* was jist worn oot ' doing so. The women had taken the dying woman

from bed and carried her ' weathershins ' round the house ' to keep awa''

evil spirits.'

   --554. Mochrum. Unbaptized children used to be buried under the wall

Myof the graveyard or of the church.  informant has done this.

555. The church bell was rung at the funerals of children that had

been baptized, but not at those that had not been baptized.

   --556. Kirkmaiden. Still-born as well as unbaptized children are, or

were till lately, buried in the gloaming and under the walls of the church.
It is unlucky to step over the graves of such.

                                                             Suicides.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                '

During the night after the funeral, the coffin was dug up and placed

outside, against the door of the house in which she had lived. The sheriff

made his appearance to settle the matter. The coffin was interred outside

--the churchyard wall, near the gate, just off the public road.
     559. Kirkmaiden. The body of a suicide was buried close under the

wall of the churchyard, outside. Sometimes the wall was taken down to

allow the coffin to be placed below the wall. When the grave was filled,

--the wall was rebuilt.
     560. Mochrum. If there was a tree in the churchyard, the body of a

--Asuicide was buried under it.
561. Dairy.      suicide at Knockman was being carried to the grave-

yard at Dairy. After the procession had gone about a mile, a crow

alighted on the coffin. Those that were cari-ying the coffin set out to run

as fast as they could. They could neither stop nor let go their hold of the

bier and give it to others. The race continued as long as the crow sat on

the coffin. At the village of Dairy the crow flew off, and the procession

went on at leisure to the churchyard. This took place about a hundred

years ago.

   --562. Kirkmaiden. In one case the mother of a suicide went to

America. The body of her son had been, according to custom, buried
outside the wall of the churchyard. The churchyard was afterwards
enlarged, and the suicide's grave came within the walls. The mother
came to know the fact, and in writing home to a friend said how thankful
she was that her son's grave was now within the walls of the churchyard.

                                 The Drowned.

   --563. Balmaghie. It is accounted unlucky for the one that is the first

--to touch the body of one that has been drowned or has perished.
     564. Dairy. After a time a light appears over the spot where the

--Abody of one that has been drowned lies.
565. Balmaghie.  blue light appears over the spot where the body

of one that has been drowned lies on the ninth day after death, when the

--gall-bladder breaks.
     566. Kirkmaiden. The one that saves another from drowning runs

the risk of being drowned.
--My567. Newton Steivart.
                                 informant, an ex-policeman, in his investi-

gation into a case of drowning in the river Cree, heard old people say,

' She has not got her complement yet.'

My568.  informant, an ex-policeman, saw in 1889 a loaf hollowed out

and a little mercury put into the hole. The loaf was then laid into the

river Cree, at the point where the young man that had been drowned fell

into the water, and allowed to float down.

             Other Superstitions relating to Death.

-- A569. Kirkmaiden.        grave is not opened till seven yeai's after the

last interment.

   --570. Rerrick. It is believed that if the windows of the room in which

a dead body lies are opened, the decay of the body is hastened.
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAIv SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 485

--571. Balmaghie. It is accounted unlucky to meet a funeral.

572. It is looked on as unlucky to stand on the threshold and look on

a passing funeral.

   --573. Kirkmaiden. When the master of the house dies, if bees are kept,

Mythey die or leave.  informant said he knew of such cases in the parish.

                                              Farminff Customs.

                                                                 Sowing.

  --574. Kirkmaiden. When once the bags containing the seed-grain are

taken to the field to be sown, if rain come so as to prevent the sowing
from being carried out, they are not lifted from the field and carted back
to the barn, but left till the weather permits the seed to be sown.

     575. The grain used to be sown from a sheet knotted up and hung
from the neck. This sheet had always to be taken clean out of the fold
for the grain that was first sown.

     576. If the knot by which the sheet from which the seed-grain was
sown was tied undid itself, the sower would not live to sow another spring.

W. Morrison, farmer in East Muntlock, was sowing one spring when the
knot of the sheet unloosed itself. He died before the next spring.

                                                       Reaping,

--577. Gallotcay (general). Reaping was at one time done by the

hook.

   --578. Rerrick. The reaper on the first 'rig,' who was always supposed

to be the best workman, was called 'The Pintsman' (pointsman), and the

one on the last ' rig ' ' The Heel.' There was a binder and stooker to
each four ' shearers.' Breakfast was between five and six o'clock in the

morning, and consisted of oatmeal porridge and milk. The porridge was

always made the night before in a big boiler, and poured into small

wooden tubs called ' gones.' These ' gones ' were then covered up with

the grain sack, to keep the porridge warm. The steam got condensed, and

fell down all round the inside of the ' gones,' making the outside of the

Weporridge cold and unpalatable ; so that, as my informant said, '  suppit

as fast as we cud, till we got to quhaur they were warm.' For sixteen

reapers and four binders there might be three of these ' gones.' They were

Aplaced along a big table.   basin to hold milk was placed for each two,

and not one basin for each.

     Instead of milk what is called ' crap ' was sometimes used. This

' crap ' is boiled whey. When curd for making cheese is separated from
the whey, small lumps of curds are left in the whey. When all the curd

that can be got is separated from the whey, the whey is boiled. This

boiling causes all the small particles of curd to coagulate still further, and

then to tioat. When the whey cools, they sink to the bottom.

     Dinner, which consisted of broth made of swine-flesh along with

potatoes, was served at noon. Work was resumed almost as soon as

dinner was finished, and was carried on without stop till 8 or 8.15, if

daylight permitted. Supper consisted of porridge and milk, the same as

breakfast. This was the course followed about fifty years ago on the

farm of Baligue, parish of Rerrick. (Told by one that did harvest work

--on the farm for one harvest.)
     579. Balmaghie. The 'pint' (point) rig was shorn by the 'first man*

in the kitchen, and the second rig by the byre-woman.
486 REPORT--1897.

--580. Kirkmaiden. The one that cut ' the Hare ' at times got five

shillings.

    581. Whisky was given to all the workers when ' the Hare ' was cut.
     582. ' The Hare ' was commonly placed over the kitchen door.
     583. ' The Hare ' was often kept over the ' door-head ' till the following

--harvest. (Informant eighty-one years of age.)
    584. Portlogan. ' The Hare ' was kept by some as long as it would

--hang together.
    585. Kirkmaiden. When ' the Hare ' was cut, no more work was done

that day.

     586. About forty years ago, some had the custom of hanging up ' the
Maiden ' in the best room of the house.

  --587. Balmaghie, Girthon, Kells, Dairy, Corsock. * The Hare ' is called

--' the Kirn.'
     588. Balmaghie. ' The Kirn ' was placed over the kitchen door, and

the Christian name of the first man that entered would be the name of

the husband of the byre-woman, and the Christian name of the first woman

--Athat entered would be that of the wife of the ' pint rig man.'
589. Dairy.  fancy ' Kirn ' was made, decked up, fixed to the

wall of one of the apartments, and kept till the following year.

  --590. Kells. In cutting the ' Kirn,' it was the aim of the reapers to

cut it below the plaiting of the ears of grain. The one that cut it carried

--it home.
    591. Corsock. When scythes came into use, the 'Kirn 'was cut by

the reaper blindfolded. The quantity of grain left for it was divided into

three, plaited, and the ears twisted together. The one that was to cut it

was blindfolded, and led to a distance from it. He then set out to find

--Ait and cut it.       small quantity of grain was left for the ' Kirn.'
      592. Laurieston.

Each reaper got a chance of cutting it. Blindfolded, he or she was led

some distance from it, and then sickle in hand proceeded to find it out

and cut it. When it was cut, a cheer was commonly raised. It was carried

home.

  --593. Kirkmaiden, Balmaghie, Kells, Kirkmaiden. There is a feast after

--harvest, which is called ' the Kirn.'
     594. Balmaghie, Kirkmaiden. ' The Kirn ' is sometimes given after

--all the crop has been secured in the stackyard.
    595. Kirkmaiden, ' The Kirn ' is at times given when the crop is

--all cut.
     596. Laurieston. The sheaf last cut was finely plaited and twisted.

A branch of rowan tree with the berries was generally tied into the

middle of it as a protection against witches. This was laid on the table

at the ' Kirn ' feast. After the feast was finished, dancing was begun

either in the barn or granary.
--A597. Kirhnaiden.
                        dish at the 'Kirn' feast is 'beetlet praties'

(mashed potatoes), which are always stirred in the form of the figure 8 in

being made ready. Into this dish were put a ring, a thimble, and a button.

The ring signified marriage. The one that got the ring ' slept on it ' that

night.

  --598. Corsock. Dirty water of various kinds used to be thrown over

the one that brought the last load of grain from the field into the stack-

yard. This custom at times led to rough action in retaliation against
ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 487

Mythe one that threw the water.        informants have seen this custom

--carried out.
     .599. Kirkviaiden. Wjomen and boys were always lurking about

corners with pails of water to throw over the one that brought from the

field the last load of grain into the stackyard.

     600. If whisky had not been given to the reapers when ' the Hare ' was

cut, the one that took the last load of grain into the stackyard objected to

the throwing of water on entering it.

                                     Fishing and Bathing.

   --601. Kirhnaiden. Fishermen in turning their boats always do so

sunwise.
      602. Fishermen account it unlucky to take a lythe (a species of cod)

for the first fish into the boat.
      603. Fishermen put a few white stones into their boats to secure luck.

   --604 Mochrum. Bathing in the sea is done when the tide is ebbing.

It is believed that, if there is any disease, the rising tide brings it in, and

one bathing at that time may catch it.

     605. Miners count it unlucky to meet a woman as ' first fit ' when

they set out to work in the mine.

     606 . Meeting one with black hair, whether man or woman, is accounted

lucky.

      607. Before an accident took place, noises of various kinds were heard.

Sometimes the noises resembled the voices of men speaking, sometimes like
the sound of the miners ' travellin' the laither,' i e., going up and down the

ladder, and sometimes knocks were heard on the 'lock.'
     608. Certain among the miners were looked upon as carrying ill-luck

with them. If such a one, when a lode of lead was found, made his

appearance in the section, the lode gave out in a short time.
      609. There was no whistling in the mine. J. Moffat, a miner, whistled

one day. Not long after a stone fell on him and killed him.
      610. It was believed that no metal would be got if there was any

profane swearing. An oath or profane word of any kind was therefore

seldom heard in the mine.
     611. It was usual for the miners to sing to bring luck. They sang

«ither songs, hymns, or psalms.

     612. Some men wei-e accounted more lucky than others in finding

metal.

     613. Some men would not work for months near a spot where one

had been killed.

                                                                         Custoins.

     614. In sinking a shaft, when ore was struck, a barrel of beer was
given by the mine-owners. It was drunk on the spot.

     615. Every time a ' bunch ' of ore was come upon, a barrel of beer
was consumed.

     616. The mine was divided into sections, and these were divided by
lot among the different companies that wrought in the mine. At the

head of each company was a foreman called the ' bargain-tacker.' He
488 REPORT-- 1897.

was responsible for the working of the section, and to him the wages of

the company that wrought the section were paid in the gross. He paid

each of his company his share.
      617. The first time the ' bargain-tacker ' received his pay after receiv-

ing a new section and after choosing his own company, he had to ' pay his
fittan,' i.e., treat the men of his company.

     618. "When a young man of a company got married, the men of his
company ' stood treat,' and often made a present besides.

    619. When a miner was buried the working of the mine was generally-

stopped. The master and all the miners attended the funeral.
     620. There was a good deal of eating, and more drinking, at a miner's

Afuneral. Hence arose the saying : * Mines funeral is as guid's a Mines

waddin'.' [' Mines ' is the local name for Blackcraig Mines.]
     621. ' Short-bread ' was commonly used as part of the entertainment

at a miner's funeral. It was commonly baked by neighbours and presented
by them.

    622. Any frogs that might have been found in the mine were carefully

tended. They were carried to a place of safety, and food was given them.

cast.

     Black Jack, sulphur.

    Gump o' lead, a pocket of lead.

     Vogg-hole, a hole that is full of water. The lead hangs all round it

      625. It is unlucky to lay the tongs on a table.

   --626. Ilochrum. It is unlucky to break a looking-glass.

     627. It is unlucky if a looking-glass falls and is broken.

   --628. Kirkmaiden. It is unlucky to give hre out of the house.
   --629. Dairy. It is unlucky to stumble when going upstairs.

      630. In going a journey on horseback, if the horse stumbles in start-
ing, there will be no luck in the journey.

     631. In setting out on a journey, if the left foot is placed first, there
will be luck.

      632. Sneezing in the afternoon is accounted unlucky.

   --633. Bcdmaghie. To spill salt is unlucky. To do away with the un-

luck, a little of the salt is thrown over the left shoulder.

     634. At the Communion in the Church of Balmaghie, one very wet

Sunday an old man laid his dripping head on the Communion Table. He
left the impress of his head on the white cloth. He died within the year.

--Leaving the impress was looked upon as very unlucky.
     635. Dairy. Sneezing in the morning indicates luck.
     636. In setting out on a journey, if one puts the right foot first, luck

attends the journey.

     637. If one puts on any piece of dress inside out, luck follows as long
as the piece of dress is worn as put on.
     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 489'

  --638. Balmayhie. If one puts on a piece of dress inside out, it must
--not be changed. Changing puts away the luck.

     639. Dairy. If one sees a wraith in the morning, it indicates long life.

--It is not a good omen to see one at night.
     640. Galloxoay (general). It is accounted lucky to have the toes
webbed or partly webbed.

  --641. Dairy. Certain persons are considered as having a 'lucky hand.'

' You have the lucky hand,' is the saying.

   A642. film of carbon hanging from a bar of the grate foretokens the

arrival of a stranger.

     643. If the black films that appear on the bars of a grate fall off at

once when blown, strangers will soon arrive. If they require two or three
puffs, it will be two or three days before they make their appearance.

      644. If the youngest or the eldest of a family sneezes before breakfast,

a stranger will arrive during the course of the day.

     645. If the right hand becomes itchy, it is an indication that money
will be received in no long time. If it is the left hand that itches, money

will be paid away.
     646. If the left ear becomes hot, one is speaking evil of you ; if the

right ear, good things are being said of you.

  --647. Crossmichael. If the ' girdle,' or a pot, or any cooking utensil

that may be hung over the fire, slips in the ' crook,' a stranger will arrive.

                              Giants.

--648. Balmagliie. At Barstolick there lived three giants that were the

terror of the whole neighbourhood, and no one was bold enough to meet

and fight them. At last a man of the name of McGhee undertook to do
battle against them. He fell upon them unawares at night, and succeedecJ

in killing them. For this deed he got a grant of the lands of Waylard.

   A649. giant and his wife lived in a cave now called the Giant's Cave

at Aldequhat. One day the giant fell asleep in his cave whilst a big

Akettle of fish was cooking.  man that was fishing in the loch went into-

the cave, found the giant asleep and his wife away. He overturned the

boiling kettle over the giant's face, and blinded him. He jumped up in

'A' burnt, a' burnt.' The roar was heard by his wife, and she called

Heback : ' Quha did it 1 Quha did it 1 '  answered : ' I mysel' did it.'

Her reply was : ' I thysel' can blaw thysel'.' The man, dreading the wife's

return, meantime made his escape from the cave with all speed, mounted

his horse and fled, as the wife was coming to the cave. When she found

out what had taken place, she set out in pursuit of the man that had done

the evil deed. It was a hard race, but she overtook him. She seized the

horse by the tail. The man turned round in the saddle and struck out

with his sword and cut off her ai-m, and so escaped.           family

on the house in which the family lived. It fell on the house, crushed it,.

                                            The Devil.

--651. Kells. There was a large rock near the Old Bridge over the Ken,

between Carsphairn and Dairy. The devil, looking from a hill called

Dundeuch at some distance from the river, resolved to destroy the bridge.

He seized a huge rock, but fearing that he might overshoot the bridge if he

threw it with the force of his whole hand, poised it on his little finger

and threw it. He misjudged the weight of it, and it fell short. The rock

has been very much broken up for building purposes. It is known as

--A' The Deil's Finger-stane.'
652. Dairy.  funeral was proceeding to the churchyard of Dairy

along the road between Dairy and Moniave. "When the procession reached

a certain 'straun,' i.e., stream, a stranger joined. No sooner had he done

so than the cortege ' set up speed ' and ran with great haste to the

churchyard. The stranger disappeared suddenly, no one knew where.

He was the devil. The deceased had made a compact with the devil and

sold himself to him, and was to be claimed at the spot the stranger joined

the funeral procession. He came to the appointed spot to 'claim his
own.' When he got his own he disappeared. Hence the stream got the

name of the Bargain Straun. (Told in Corsock.)

   --653. Kirkcowan. The farmer of Balaird, part of which lies on the

river Bladenoch in the parish of Kirkcowan, had a field of hay on

the banks of the 'burn.' He and his servants were busy amongst it

when a violent torrent of rain fell, and the burn came down suddenly

in great flood, so that it overflowed its banks, and was sweeping away

quantities of the hay. Seeing the crop floating away in spite of all their

exertions to secure it, the farmer lost all control of himself, and gathering

together the forks and rakes, &c., they were using, threw them into the

rushing water, and cried out : ' B' the Lord ! if ye (the devil) tack

the hey, tack a' wi' you.'

  --654. Girthon. The farmer of Culreoch, which lies on the banks of the

river Fleet in the parish of Girthon, was a ' twisty aul' carle.' One very

windy day he was carrying a bundle of fodder to give to some of his

cattle. He had to go round a corner particularly exposed to the force of

the storm. The wind caught the bundle of fodder as he tried to round the

corner, and he was driven back oftener than once. At last he planted

down his foot with force, bent his body against the storm, and burst out :

< Na, nor yet yir fayther aither.'

  --655. Borgue. The Brownie is looked upon as a helpful being. Food

used to be set in convenient places for the brownies to eat during night.

  --656. Dairy. At Borgue the aunt of my informant's father used to

lay out food for the brownies during night. For this kindly act they did

all sorts of heavy work, as threshing.

     657. Brownies did during the night the work of those that treated

them kindly. At Bogue, in the parish of Dairy, there is a Avell called
Kitty Ramsay's Well. Beside this well those who wished to have their

services placed food for them. They ate the food, drank the water of the

well, and did the work of their benefactors.

and from interfering with the cows.

    659. Dairy.-- On Halloweven the fairies rode on cats at the Holme
Glen, Dairy. On that night considerate housekeepers shut up their cats,

to prevent them from being laid hold of by the fairies.

    660. Kirkcou-an.--A man had a cow and a goat which he pastured in

his little field. In this field was a knoll, and it was the abode of some
fairies. They took to riding on the goat round and round the knoll. The

man was at last under the necessity of selling the goat, so fond had the
fairies become of riding the animal. He bought another and placed it on

the field in the thought that it would be free from the attention of the

fairies. Some time after his wife asked to go and see how the new goat

was faring. He saw the fairies riding ' time aboot ' round the knoll on

--the goat's back. (Thirty two years ago.)
     661. Dairy. About seventy-five years ago there lived a woman at
the Brough, in the parish of Kells, in an old house about a mile from New

Galloway. In front of the house door there was a slab over the drain
that carried off the house dirty water. One day a fairy woman, dressed
in green, appeared to her and asked her to throw her slops not on the

slab but a little further off. She made a promise to her that if she did
so, she would never come to want. The woman did so. Some time after
she fell ill. Every morning a quantity of new pins was found on a small
table that stood beside the patient's bed. The pins were sold, and the price
of them was sufficient for the support of the woman. Dr. Trottar of
Dairy came into possession of one of them. From that time forth money

matters prospered with him.

    662. Kirkmaiden.--My informant told me that he has heard of the

site of a byre being shifted, because it had been built over fairy dwellings,

and thus the water of the byre dropped down into it, and caused annoyance

to its inmates.

    663. When the new house at Greenan was being founded, a woman

appeared and asked the masons and others taking a hand in the work to

change the site. She told them that the house on that site would be

rio-ht over her dwelling, and in consequence much annoyance and incon-

venience would be caused to her and her household.

                                                    who was looked

on as ' uncanny,' wanted from her some of a particular kind as seed. She

went to the cottage to buy them. When she entered, the female servant

Gwas ' kirnin.' She asked Mrs.  to sell her a stone of this particular

kind of potatoes. She was told she could not have them, as they were all

sold. She appeared not to believe this, and as she was leaving the house

--Ashe looked back at the ' kirn.' No butter was got from that churnful.

Nanny lived in Crossmichael parish. One day a neighbour's cow fell ill

and fell down. Nanny was known to have a grudge against the owner,

and was suspected as the cause of the illness. Several of the folk around

assembled to give what help they could, and among them was Nanny.

They tried to lift the animal, but were unable to do so. The minister

made his appearance. When he saw how things stood, he said : ' Nanny,

meyou an'  'ill try t' lift her.'  Nanny made her excuse : ' Hoot awa', hoo

cudd an aul' boddie like me help t' lift her ? ' ' We'll try 't,' said the

minister. Nanny could no longer refuse. So the minister and Nanny

laid their hands on the cow to lift her. The hands had hardly touched

her, when up jumped the animal as if nothing had been the matter.

Nanny had witched her.

occasion was going to one of these, and to be able to contribute something

to it she required some money. She churned her cream except a small

quantity, sold the butter in Dairy and bought a bottle of whisky. To

conceal from her husband what she was going to do, she took the small

quantity of cream she did not put into the first churning, churned it, ami

showed the butter to her husband as if that was all the butter made.

673. Dairy.       informant one day engaged Jennie Mainsie, a reputed

witch, to cut some seed potatoes for her. She treated the woman well

and paid her full wages. Before leaving she asked to be shown round the

garden. This was done. She then requested to be allowed to look into

the coal-house. Her request was granted. After all this she said,

* Noo, I've dune ye a' the ill I can.' Next morning my informant went

Ainto the coal-house to bring in coals for the fire.  big lump of coal fell

on her foot and crushed it,

    675. Lcmrieston. When a cow's milk was taken away by a witch, as

much of the animal's milk as could be drawn from her was put into a pot

with a quantity of pins. The pot was hung over the fire to boil, and the

door of the house was bolted. The witch in due time came to the door

and asked admission. Her request was denied. If she were admitted,

--the milk would not be restored, but if kept out the milk would return.
    676. Kirkmaiden. On the farm of Kilstay, tenanted by Mr. Kerr, a

grass-witch at one time wrought evil among the cows, so that no butter

Acould be got from the cream taken from their milk.    man that had

wide fame for his skill in such cases was called from Ireland. The man

came. The first step he took was to go into the byres and count the

animals, and to examine them. He then ordered all the wickets or holes

in the walls of the byres to be opened, so that whatever of evil influence

was in them might get out. He next ordered all the members of the

household to go into the dwelling-house, shut the door, cover all the

windows, fall on their knees, and pray to God that what he was going to

do would have the effect he wished, and not stir or open the door till three

knocks were heard on it. He went into the byre, and did something no

one knew, but the bellowing of the animals was terrible to be heard.
After a time the three knocks on the door were heard, and the door was

opened. The man had accomplished his work. When the cows were

examined, each had a piece of vervain tied into the hair of the tail. The

man then made a rope of hair, and tied it threefold round the bottom of

the churn, and at the same time gave orders that it should not be
removed. Things now went on all right, so that it was at last deemed
safe to remove the rope. This was done with the result that no butter
was got as formerly. The rope was replaced and Mr. Kerr, who was a
handy man, made a sort of shallow tub to put over it and preserve it.
Butter was again got. Vervain stitched into a band of silk was after
this worn round the waist next the skin by the folk of Kilstay Farm.

woman named Mrs. Melroy, who had the evil eye. The power was so
strong that if when milking her cow, she had looked on the milk in the
pail, it would have been sour before she reached the dwelling-house. Her

husband was a dyer, and he would not allow her to look into the dye-vat,

--for if she did so the dye would not take.
      678. Dairy. If one carrying milk meets one with the evil eye, the

Aucabrick, parish of Kirkmaiden. The present tenant wished to remove

it, and one day, without telling his father, went to remove it. He had

gone so far with the work as to have a chain fixed round the stone and

the horses attached to the chain. His father saw what was going on.

He made all haste to the spot, and reached it in time to stop his son in

his work. The stone is still standing in the field.

panied by his dog, one day waded across the shallow part of the loch.

Having reached the island, he laid himself down under some bushes as

the day was warm. He began scratching the gi'ound with his stick. He
turned up a piece of turf, and under it he saw a pot of gold. He looked

behind him, and near him stood a creature in shape of a man with eyes
as ' big as a broth plate an' legs as thick as a corn sack.' He held a paper

in his hand. He asked the shepherd to sign it, and said to him that the

cold would be his if he did so. The dog in the meantime had taken to

Hi^ht in complete terror. When the shepherd heard the terms of getting

the gold, and noticed how the dog had behaved, he turned and ran. The

dof^ in fright fled to the house, rushed below the bed, and would not leave

his place of refuge for some days. Search was afterwards made for the

treasure, but in vain. Another version of the tradition states that the

shepherd dreamed that there was a pot of gold hidden on the island,

and thus was led to search for it.

684. There is a well called the Lag "Wine Well in the parish of

Carsphairn. The tradition is that there is in it a lump of gold which is

guarded by the devil. On one occasion some men resolved to lead away

the water from the well to dry it so as to reach the gold. They met and

began cutting a trench. They had not been long at work till the sky

grew black as night, and a thunderstorm, accompanied with torrents of

rain, burst over them. At the same time such swarms of ' mowdies,'

--i.e., moles, came out of the ground that the diggers were put to flight.

    Report on the Ethnography of Wigtonshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.

     The data for this Report were collected with great care by the late
Dr. Walter Gregor, and the Committee regret that our esteemed colleague
did not live to receive the congratulations which they feel are due for
this valuable piece of work. The schedules have been tabulated and the
indices recorded by Dr. A. C. Haddon, who desires to express his thanks
     ON THE ETHNOGRAPHICAL SURVEY OF THE UNITED KINGDOM. 501

to Mr. E. W. Brabrook for assistance rendered. The following is the

record of the work done in 1896 by Dr. Gregor in his own words :

     'On April 14 I went to the parish of Kirkmaiden as the guest of
James McDonall, Esq., of Logan. By his help personally, and through
him, by the help of the Rev. Mr. Cavan, Free Church minister at Dro-
more, and the Rev. Mr. Guttridge, Episcopalian clergyman at Logan,
twenty-one sets of measurements were obtained, fifteen of males and six

of females. On Monday, April 20, I proceeded to the Manse of Minnigaf,
-where I was again cordially received by Mr. and Mrs. Reid. As on my
former visit, Mr. Reid afforded me evei-y assistance he could, and eleven
sets of measurements were taken, five of males and six of females. On

Friday, April 24, I went to the Manse of Mochrum, and had the help of
Mr. Allan and his daughter. In that parish were got eleven sets of
measurements, seven of males and four of females. On the kind invita-
tion of Mr. Reid, minister of Balmaghie, I went to his manse on April 28,

My stay in that parish produced seven sets of measurements, six of

males and one of a female. The Manse of Kells was my next destination,
which I reached on May 6. There I had the help and influence of

Mr. Philip. In that and the neighbouring parish of Dairy only three

«ets of measurements were taken as my schedules were exhausted. Fifty-

three sets of measurements form the result of this second visit, thirty-six
-of males and seventeen of females.

    ' As on my former visit I tried to find out those whose ancestors have

lived for the longest period in Galloway in the line both of father and

mother.

      ' In all the districts I visited every opportunity of collecting the folk-
lore was laid hold of, and a good deal of it, some of which will prove

of interest, was gathered. It may be stated that when natives of other

·districts were met with, they were questioned, and what information was
obtained was noted down, and the county it comes from was stated. It

will take a considerable time to make ready my notes, but the work will

be carried out as speedily as I can.

     ' The Committee are again under great obligation to all those who have

exerted themselves to carry out this investigation.
      ' I have to state that everywhere I was received with the utmost

cordiality, and the hospitality and true kindness accorded to me by my

fcosts and their families are beyond all thanks.
      ' I have the honour to send to the Committee the fifty-three schedules.'

     Dr. Gregor has filled up schedules for 46 Wigtonshire and 36 Kirkcud-

lirightshire men (total 82), and for 21 Wigtonshire and 1 3 Kirkcudbright-
shire women (total 34), making a gross total of 116 Galloway folk.

These observations have been tabulated according to counties and sexes.

As there is no appreciable difference between the inhabitants of the two
counties, at all events so far as the men are concerned, we may describe

the Galloway type in the following terms :

                                                            Men.

     The average height of the men is 1733 mm. (5 ft. 8J in.), the maximum
being 1853 mm. (6 ft. 3 in.) and the minimum 1587 mm. (5 ft. 2^ in.).
The average height sitting is 905 mm. (2 ft. 11| in.).

     The skin is ruddy ; it is not stated whether there is a tendency to
freckle. The hair usually is darkish brown and straight ; the actual
502 REPORT-- 1897.

figures are red 6, fair 16, brown 32, dark brown 24, black 3. (51 out of
82 are credited with straight hair, but the proportion is probably greater.)

--The eyes are as follows : blue 35, light grey 25, dark grey 8, green 1,

light brown 5, dark brown 8. Only a few (15) are stated to have
prominent cheek bones. The nose is straight, with a slight tendency to

sinuosity. The ears are flat with distinct lobes.

    The average cephalic index is 77'4, varying between 70-3 and 82-6. No

deduction has been made to reduce it to the cranial index of the skull.

The average length-height index is 66"8, and the breadth-height index
86 '9. The average upper facial index 49, and the nasal index 60 "4.

                                               Wo7nen.

    The average height of the women is 1600 mm. (5 ft. 3 in.), the maximum
being 1710 (5 ft. 7J in.) and the minimum 1423 mm. (4 ft. 8 in.) The

--Kirkcudbrightshire women are somewhat shorter (1578 mm. 5 ft. 2 in. ) than
--the Wigtonshire women (1621 mm. 5 ft. 3|), though this is not the case

with the men, but the numbers are insufficient to lay any stress on this fact.

The skin is usually ruddy. The colour of the hair varies more than

--among the men. Thus for Wigton the figures are red 3, fair 5, brown 4,

dark brown 5, black 4 ; and for Kirkcudbright, red 1, fair 1, brown 8, dark

brown 3, black 0. It is generally straight. The eyes are as follows :

Wigton : Blue 6, light grey 2, dark grey 3, green 0, light brown 2, dark

brown 8. Kirkcudbright : Blue 3, light grey 5, dark grey 1 , green 0, light
brown 2, dark brown 1. Thus the Wigtonshire women are somewhat

darker than those of Kirkcudbrightshire. The other facial features

resemble those of the men.

The average cephalic index is 78-4, varying between 71 "5 and 88'5.

The average length-height index is 68, and the average breadth-height

index 87 ; that of the Wigtonshire women is 88'4, and that of the

Kirkcudbrightshire is 85-7, as the breadth is precisely the same in both

instances (147  mm.)                      the  difference  in  the  index  is  due  to  the  average
                                       ;

height of the cranium being greater in the Wigton (130 mm.) than in the

Kirkcudbright (126mm.) women. The upper facial index is 47, and the nasal

index 61 '2. Thus, besides being slightly more brachy-cephalic, or rather

less dolicho-cephalic than the men, the Galloway women have relatively

broader faces and wider nostrils.

The tables upon which this abstract is based have been handed to the

Anthropological Institute for publication.

The district surveyed by Dr. Gregor is of especial interest, as it is.

included in the country of the ancient Picts, a people concerning whose

affinities various theories have been made. When the Ethnographical

Survey of Great Britain and Ireland was originated, it was intended that

Athis should be one of the first problems to be attacked.                               comparison

with the results obtained from other areas formerly inhabited by the Picts

will show whether the above-described type is mainly that of the Picts,

or whether it is a composite type, which will require a finer analysis.

However this may be, we have at least advanced a definite stage towards

the solution of this important historical and anthropological problem. Dr.

Beddoe's ' The Races of Britain,' p. 249, should be consulted on this sub-

ject.

    Report of the Cambridge Committee for the Ethnographical Survey of
                                                   East Anglia.

     The Committee present the reports on the physical characters of the
inhabitants of two districts in the neighbourhood of Cambridge.

     Last year Professor Macalister gave a course of lectures on Anthro-
pology at Aberdeen, which excited a good deal of local interest. Several
members of his audience were stimulated to study the subject, and some
of their personal observations on the hair and eye colours of the inhabit-
·unts of Aberdeen and elsewhere are here appended.

     Professor Macalister also interested Mr. J. J. Taylor, M.B., of

Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in making anthropometrical observations.

Mr. Taylor took the opportunity of a bazaar to measure and note the
characters of 66 natives of Yorkshire. The following tables give details

of 31 of these who came from a restricted area.
     Some former students of Professor Haddon's took a similar oppor-

tunity in Belfast in 1894 and measured a large number of people. In
both cases the visitors to the bazaars paid a small sum to be measured,
and they received a printed form on which was entered a copy of their
measurements. This method of obtaining measurements and other
anthropological data might very well be employed elsewhere.

to observations I made, with the assistance of some of my students, on

the physical characters of the inhabitants of the parish of Barley. Though
situated in Hertfordshire this village is on the borders of Cambridgeshire

and Essex. The rector, the Rev. J. Frome Wilkinson, afforded me every

facility in his power, and induced several of his parishioners to be

measured.

     The families of thirteen of the men measured at Barley have been

established in the district for some two or three hundred years. The
parents of No. 8 came from Braintree in Essex, and those of No. 14 fi-om
Suffolk, where, in both instances, their families had been for generations.
I have included them in the totals, as they do not appreciably affect the
averages ; No. 8 is, however, less typical.

     The average Barley man may be described as having a ruddy skin,

which does not freckle ; brown hair, with a tendency to fair or red, though
dark hair is by no means uncommon. The hair is as often straight as
wavy. Eight have blue eyes, two each light and dark grey, one green,
and two light brown. The face is in an equal number of cases of medium
breadth, or long or narrow. Nos. 12 and 15 have broad faces. The

--cheek bones are inconspicuous. The nose is most usually straight two

had turned-up noses. The lips are thin or of medium thickness. The

 ears are, as a rule, fairly prominent, but they are not of a coarse type.
The average stature (excluding No. 15) is 1,695 mm., or 5 feet 6| inches.

      The more important head measurements and indices will be found in
the table. Full face and profile photographs were taken of the fifteen
individuals measured ; copies of these are deposited with the schedules

 containing the detailed information.

     None of the people in the neighbourhood of Barrington and Foxton

had projecting cheek-bones ; the ratio, however, between lengtli and
breadth of face varied widely, as seen under the Facial Indices in the

table.

     The complexion varied, 15 being ruddy, 5 dark, and 4 pale ; dark hair

predominated, 10 individuals possessing it of that shade, 9 brown, 1 red,
and 3 fair.

     The colour of the eyes was chiefly liglit : 7 blue, 6 light grey, 2 light
brown, 5 green, 3 dark grey, and 1 dark brown.

     Lips were mostly of medium thickness, 4, however, having thin and

2 thick lips.

    Height of men variable, from 1,533 to 1,744 mm.

     The cephalic index would show by itself that the people are a very
mixed production, and this is corroborated by the rest of the indices.

    From a cursory study of the table, it seems impossible to separate the
people into any series of types, or to determine any common type.

     Photographs of most of the individuals accompany the table, along
with further details not mentioned above.

--Silchester JExcavaiion. Report of the Committee, consisting of Mr.

     A. J. Evans (Chairman), Mr. John L. Myres (Secretary), and

    Mr. E. W. Brabrook, appointed to co-operate with the Silchester

     Excavation Fund Committee in their Explorations.

The Committee beg leave to report that the excavations on the site of the
Roman City at Silchester during the year 1896 were begun on May 1

and continued, with the usual break during harvesting operations, until

October 26.

    The area selected for excavation included two insulce (KY . and XVI.),

immediately south of insulce XIIT. and XIV., which were excavated in

1895. The result was, on the whole, satisfactory, and as usual ended in

some curious and totally unexpected discoveries.

    Insula XV. appears, like insulce IX., X., XI., XII., and XIII., to

have been given up to the dyeing industry, of which traces were found in

1894 and 1895, and a large area in the northern part of the insula was

perhaps used as a bleaching ground. Two wells were discovered, one

with a wooden framing at the bottom, the other with a large wooden tub,

which will be added with other antiquities to the Silchester Loan

Collection in the Reading Museum.

Insula XVI. contained a large and important house of the courtyard

type in the north-west angle, and two other houses of the corridor type,

as well as an isolated square building. Traces were also found of other

Astructures, which were probably of wood.  large number of pits were

met with in the trenches, and from these some good vessels of pottery

Aand other antiquities were recovered.  pit of unusual size near the

south-east angle yielded a large quantity of bladebones of sheep ; the
numerous perforations in these showed that they had been used in the

manufacture of counters.

    Besides the operations in insulce XV. and XVI., a small area was

trenched to the south of the parish graveyard, which is within the walls,

in view of its immediate inclosure as an additional burying ground. The

area is close to the two square temples uncovered in 1890. The founda-

tions of a small house of the corridor type were disclosed, near which was

found a lump of worked porphyry.

     It will be seen, therefore, that the results of the year's work in no
way fall behind those of former years, and that further progress has been

made in the systematic excavation of the site of the Roman city, which
has now been carried on by the Committee of the Excavation Fund for

seven successive seasons.

   A special exhibition of the antiquities, &c., found was held at Bur-

lington House during the month of May, and a detailed account of all

the discoveries has been published by the Society of Antiquaries in

' Archpeologia,' Iv. pp. 409-430.

     It is proposed during the current year to excavate the two insulce
(XVI. and XVII.) extending from insula III. as far as the south wall.

     Although more than half of the area (100 acres) within the walls has

now been systematically excavated, and with most important results, the
Committee desire to point out that there is still several more years' work

to be done before the Romano-British city can be regarded as completely
disclosed. They therefore ask to be reappointed, with a further grant of

40^. The whole of the grant made in 1896 has been expended.

VI. An Investigation of the Changes in Nerve-cells in various Pathological

   ....Conditions. By W. B. Waerington, M.D., M.R. C.P.

It was felt by the Committee that the most hopeful chance of the dis-

covery of the changes which the nerve cell and nerve fibre undergo during

activity was by means of investigations in two directions, viz., the changes

in histological appearance and in electrical reactions. In furtherance of

this object the Committee requested Dr. Mann to investigate the histo-

logical appearances in nerve cells after long continued activity ; Professor

Boyce to investigate the histological changes in nerve cells resulting from

the  action  of  drugs                              and  Mr.  Lloyd, the  histological  changes  in nerve
                                                 ;

fibres under the influence of reagents. For the investigation of the

electrical phenomena Professor Waller undertook the electro-physiology

of isolated nerve ; and Professor Gotch, the investigation of the electrical

changes in the spinal cord and roots during activity.

     In addition to these two main branches of the inquiry there were

numerous other important questions which required an answer ; among

these the meaning of the medullation of nerve fibres and its relation to

their functional activity. The investigation of this problem was entrusted

to Mr. Anderson. Again, the cells of the sympathetic nervous system
       ON THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF NERVE CELLS.                 513

form a group requiring investigation apart from those of the central nervous

system, and it is especially important to know whether one cell and

one only is situated on the course of these efferent visceral fibres,
as appears to be the case from Langley's experiments with nicotine

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

Mr. Bunch, therefore, at tlie suggestion of Professor Schafer, was en-
trusted with the investigation of the position of cell stations on the
course of sympathetic nerves. Finally the state of activity in a nerve
centre owing to the activity of neighbouring or specially correlated nerve
centres is a very important question in connection with the functional
activity of nerve cells ; Professor Sherrington, therefore, was requested to

contribute to the report the results of his investigations into the
activity of the nervous centres which correlate antagonistic muscles in

the limbs.

     These difTerent investigations have been carried out by the different
observers as far as has been possible in the time, and the results obtained
up to the present have been embodied in a series of reports sent in to the
Committee. Of these reports it is advisable at present to publish only
those in which the investigation has reached a fairly complete stage ; this

comprises the reports of Dr. W. B. Warrington, of Dr. J. L. Bunch, of

Professor Gotch, of Mr. F. Seymour Lloyd, of Professor Sherrington, and
of Professor Waller. All these were brought before the Physiological

Section at Toronto, and are hereto appended. As regards the researches
of Dr. Mann and Mr. Anderson, though considerable progress has been
made the results ai'e not yet ready for publication. The Committee

are of opinion that what has already been done affords strong evidence of
the value of further investigation on the same lines, and therefore request

to be reappointed.

       APPENDICES.

I. On the Origin, Course, and Cell -connections of the Viscero-motor
       Nerves of the Small Intestine. By J. L. Bunch, M.D., B.Sc.

[From the Physiological Laboratory, University College, London.]

    My investigations into the origin, course, and cell-connections of the

viscero-motor nerves of the small intestine have been continued with the

aid of a portion of the grant made to the Committee.
     About forty experiments in all have been performed, the animals

employed being dogs and cats.

   --The following points have been made out :

     1. In no case has excitation of the vagus either in the neck, after
administration of a small dose of atropine, or in the thorax, with or with-
out atropine, caused any contraction, or any increase of the normal
rhythmic contractions of the intestine. The action of the vagus is in every
instance confined to the stomach. In one case (dog) there appeared to be
a diminution in the extent of the movements and a tendency to their

inhibition. It is possible that this result may have been produced by a

pull exerted upon the small intestine by contraction of the stomach, but
it does not seem that this was the cause. It is noteworthy that on 2^ost-
mortem dissection in this case the vagi were found to be distributed mainly

to the ccfiliac plexus, a small proportion only of the nerves passing directly
to the stomach.

1897.                                              LL
--514
REPORT 1897.

      2. Excitation of either great splanchnic nerve has always causeddiastolic
tone in the intestine of the cat, with a tendency to diminution of the
extent of the normal rhythmical contractions ; these, however, do not, as
a rule, cease during the excitation.

      3 Excitation of either splanchnic almost always causes systolic tone in

the intestine of the dog. The normal rhythmic contractions are usually
continued during the excitations, but their diastole is incomplete. The
effect is often followed by diastolic tone. In a few dogs experimented on
the effect produced was similar to that in the cat. Varying the rate of
excitation pi'oduced no difference in the result in either dogs or cats.

      4. It is concluded that the vagi contain usually no viscero-motor fibres
for the small intestine, and that the splanchnics contain both viscero-
dilator and viscero-constrictor fibres ; the result obtained depending upon
the preponderance of one or other kind.

     5. The effects of stimulating the anterior nerve roots fi'om the 8th to the

1.3th post-cervical, or of the cut spinal cord between these roots, are
similar to those obtained on stimulating the splanchnic nerves.

     6. Intravenous injection of nicotine produces the same effect, but to a

much more marked degree, as stimulation of the splanchnics in the same

individuals i.e., in cats always strong diastolic tone ; in dogs usually
strong systolic tone, but in a few cases diastolic tone.

      7. After intravenous injection of about 3 mgr. nicotine in cats, or
about 5 to 7 mgr. in small dogs (7 to 10 kilos.) the effects of nerve-root
and splanchnic excitation are abolished, but excitation of the mesenteric
nerves still produces marked contraction of the intestine.

      8. It is concluded, therefore, that there is proljably no cell station
between the nerve roots and the ganglia of the solar plexus i.e., that
the fibres pass through the ganglia of the sympathetic chain without

interruption.

     The contrary statement, which I made in a paper presented last year
to the Section of Physiology, was based upon the results of two experi-
ments only, and the tracings of these were unsatisfactorily recorded ; it

has not been confirmed in any of my later experiments.

     The nerves to the small intestine appear, therefore, to conform to the
general law laid down by Langley x-egarding viscero-motor fibres, viz. : in
having no cell station in the ganglia of the sympathetic chain, and but
one cell station between the spinal cord and the peripheral nerves.

II. Hejmrt upon Electromotive Changes in Nerve during Activity. By

   Professor Francis Gotcii, F.R.S., and G. J. Burch, M.A. (Oxon.).

    The main object of the present investigation is to ascertain how far

the capillary electrometer can be utilised for determining the true rela-
tions of the electromotive changes of nerve. Previous observations by

many investigators have shown that excitatory electrical changes are

propagated along the tissue at a rate closely resembling that of the exci-
tatory process itself i.e., 30 metres in one second in the sciatic nerve of

the frog, at 1 5° C. The rate of propagation of polarisation electromotive
changes is variously stated to be 6 to 12 metres per second in nerve
(Bernstein), 30 to 40 metres in polarisable schemata (Hermann), 60 to
120 metres (Borruttau). Since the relationship of the so-called excitatory
changes to the polarisation ones must, from the nature of things, be
ON THE FUXCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF NERVE CELLS.                                                                                                                                 515

extremely intimate, the above discrepancies suggest au inquiry as to the

efficiency of the methods hitherto employed in the investigation. These

have consisted in using repeated electrical currents as the exciting or

polarising agencies, and noting the gal vanometric effects produced by their

summation. The authors were led by some preliminary experiments to

infer that the time relations of such multiple effects differ from those of

a single change. In order to obtain the necessary I'ecord of a single

change, a new projection electrometer was constructed and fitted up in

connection with a photographic recording arrangement, in a room set

apart for the purpose in the physiological laboratory at Oxford.

The new capillary electrometer is of the improved form referred to by

one of us (G. J. B.).^ It is less fragile than the older instruments, and

gives better definition with high magnifying power. In sensitiveness

and rapidity of action it is superior to those which we have hitherto

used. Great difficulties were met with at first owing to the transmission

of vibrations through the concrete floor to the pillar, which, although

placed in a well sunk 7 feet below the ground, did not furnish a satis-

factory base for our very sensitive instrument. These difficulties were

finally got rid of by the adoption of a special form of support. Since it

was essential to eliminate all vibration errors, a considerable part of the

grant allotted to this branch of the research has been devoted to the

construction of the stand just referred to.

The experiments are still in progress, but a large number of photo-

graphic records have been already made, particularly of polarisation effects

and after-effects. These have been obtained in the following polarisable

objects : (1) Schema on Hermann's model i.e., platinum wire core in

saturated solution of zinc sulphate                                                                                              (2)  sciatic  iierve                 (3)  sartorius
                                                                                                                              ;                                    ;

muscle.

  --1. Schema. The capillary records of the extrapolar polarisation

effects produced by a single polarising current give on analysis results

which show that the propagation rate is not the same as that obtained

from similar experiments carried out by the authors by the repeating

rheotome and galvanometric record. The differences between the two sets

of results seem to indicate that the rheotonic effects are confused by the

presence of a complexus of electrical states.

  --2. Nerve. The records with nerve exhibit several suggestive chai'ac-

teristics, but this part of the investigation is still in progress, and further

reference to it would at present be inadvisable.

  --3. Muscle, The sartorius muscle was utilised to determine the cha-

racters of the capillary records of the two classes of anodal after-effect, the

polarisation anodal positivity and the excitatory anodal negativity. These

records show, among other facts, that when the excitatory effect is pro-

duced it not only swamps the polarisation one, but increases in extent for

some little time after the cessation of the polarising current. The records

of the excitatory after-effect are further remarkable in showing no indica-

tions of oscillation ; it would therefore appear that this anodal excitatory
change is not a rapid series of states but a single prolonged change. It is

thus distinguished from other excitatory changes of similar duration, and

cannot be regarded as a response of the same order as that produced by

successive stimuli.

III. The Activity of the Nervous Centres ivhich correlate Antagonistic Mii^s-

         cles in the Limhs. By Professor C. S. Sherrington, M.D., F.R.S.

     The recent results of histology in regard to the nervous system have
brought with them the view that the physiological continuity between
nerve cell and nerve cell does not involve anatomical continuity of the
nerve cells. The theory of cellular contact put forward by Forel and
Golgi has received a large amount of confirmation from subsequent
Avorkers, as Cajal and KoUiker. The place of linkage between nerve cell

-- --and nerve cell the synapsis as it is termed by Professor Foster is a

place where the conduction of nervous impulses is supposed to occur
across an intervening substance. This character in the construction of
the chain of conductors has given rise to speculation as to possibility of
increase or decrease of difficulty for conduction along a given line due to
alteration at the gap between adjacent links in the chain.

      Various histologists (Renaut, Demoor, Duval, Solvay, Lepine, <fec.)
assert that the cells of the nervous system possess, to a certain degree, the
power of contractility of their processes. Cajal thinks that the neuroglia
cells are certainly contractile, probably more so than the nerve cells
proper. These authors speak of the expansion and retraction of the
branches of the nerve cell. Certain drugs which depress nervous action,
such as chloroform and chloral, and certain conditions such as fatigue
and sleep, are described as producing or being accompanied by retraction
of cell branches in the nerve cells of cortex cerebri, cerebellum, and
elsewhere. The retraction of the cell processes is supposed to withdraw
the cell from its connections with its neighbours. Interruptions in the
chains of conduction for impulses can thus be brought about. There is

much that is at any rate simple in this view, and I have attempted to

apply a test to it in the case of a certain place of linkage in the spinal

cord.

   A place of linkage as well known perhaps as any in the central

nervous system is that between the afferent fibre of the sensory spinal
root and the motor nerve cell of the ventral horn of the spinal cord. I

have attempted to examine what happens when the conduction across this
link becomes under certain circumstances difficult. It is well known that
to judge by their reflex effects afferent nerve fibres are more easily

excitable through their end organs than from their cut ends ; in other
woi'ds, reflexes are more easily elicitable from the surfaces of the skin
than from the cut ends of cutaneous nerves. The depression of function
in this case seems to occur at the synapsis between the spinal end of the
afferent fibre and the motor cell of the ventral horn with which it is

.usually in facile connection. It may be because the severance of the

nerve fibre breaks that tonic action (postulated in it as the basis of
muscular tonus) which streams along it inwards from its peripheral

vsensifacient endings. Some peculiar depression of conductivity does seem
to be produced between it and the motor horn cells, for the section of

the afferent roots to a spinal region renders extremely difficult the obtain-
ing of a reflex from the ascending stem of the root-fibres that have been

--transected that is, the connection between the afferent spinal fibre and

the motor spinal cell becomes more difficult in consequence of mere sever-
ance of the afferent spinal fibre from its own parent cell. The question I
ON THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF NERVE CELLS.  517

would raise is the following : Is this increase of resistance in the neural
conduction due to change in the mutilated afferent nerve cell e.g., retrac-
tion of its cell-processes withdrawing them from their normal apposition
against the motor cell-- or is it due to change in the motor cell or its pro-

cesses e.g., retraction of its dendrites.

     The subjoined observations throw, I think,- some light on this point.
     1 In the monkey and cat after spinal transection at the top of the cervical
region flexion of the hind limb can be elicited by stimulation of the skin
of the fore limb of the same side-- e.g-., forepaw. Section of the afferent

spinal roots of the hind limb, sets aside this reaction.

     2. Similarly, in monkey and cat excitation of the pinna of the ear
elicits flexion in the hind limb of the same side of the body, but section

of the afferent roots of the nerves of the hind limb sets the reaction aside.

     3. When, after transection on the cerebral side of the pons in cat, the

condition of extensor rigidity which I have described elsewhere (Proc.
R. S. 1896), and termed ' decerebrate rigidity,' has set in, severance of the
afferent roots of the nerves of the limbs immediately abolishes this rigidity.

     It would appear from these observations, therefore, that the severance
of the afferent roots exercises an effect upon the motor nerve cell itself.
The effect is such as to cause some change in the motor nerve cell that
makes it less accessible not only to the afferent fibres which have been

ruptured from their own parent nerve cells, but also to various other

afferent fibres.

    An objection may be raised against this conclusion on the ground that

the mere operation of section of a number of afferent nevxe roots involves
necessarily the opening of the vertebral canal and the laying bare of a
portion of spinal cord, and that that may of itself depress all the functions

of all the elements in the spinal cord thus treated. This consideration

appears to me a very valid one, and I believe that as a necessity the

operative procedure does tend to depress the activities of the cord where it
is exposed. But the following observations, I think, show that the depres-
sion of conduction cannot be explained in the above cases by the mere

influence of the operation.

     1. The excitation of the pyramid tract becomes rather more effective
after the section of the afferent roots than it was before ; that is, the
connection between the endings of the pyramid tract fibres and the motor
cells of the ventral horn are more easy and patent than previously ; that is,

an exaltation of function in&tead of a depression has occurred in this

nexus.

     2. In the monkey and cat, after spinal transection at the top of the
cervical region, although it is easy to obtain flexion of the hind-limb by
excitation of the fore-limb of the same side of the body, or of the pinna of
the ear of the same side as the hind-limb in which the reflex movement

--occurs, it is extremely difficult in my experience often altogether impos-

--sible to obtain from one fore-limb or pinna any movement of the hind

limb of the crossed side. After section of the afferent roots of the nerves of

a hind-limb it becomes comparati\ ely easy, however, to elicit in the crossed
hind-limb movements by excitation of fore-limb and pinna of the same
side of the body as that upon which the afferent roots have been severed.

But to cut the afferent roots both sides of the spinal cord were in the

preliminary operation laid bare.

      It seems, therefore, that severance of the afferent fibres to a limb, pro-

bably by interrupting a normal continuous conduction along those fibres,
--518 REPORT 1807,

induces a change in the motor nerve cells upon which normally the con-

tinuous afferent activity plays in such a way as to render the connection

of the motor nerve cell closer with some afferent endings and less close
with others.

      If increase of resistance to conduction at a synapsis, that is at a place
of neural linkage, be due, therefore, to greater separation of nerve cell

from nerve cell by retraction of cell branches, I would urge that it occurs
in a very marked degree in the dendrite branches of the motor-cell of
the ventral horn of the spinal cord.

IV. On the Action of Reagents njwn Isolated Nerve. By A. D. Waller,

                           M.D., F.R.S., and S. C. M. Sowton.

    A preliminary general account of the experiments we have made

during the past year in prosecution ^ of the investigation of the Action of

Reagents upon Isolated Nerve, may be given under the following heads :

§ 1. The influence of acids and alkalies upon currents of action.

§ 2. The influence of acids and alkalies upon electrotonic currents.

§ 3. The influence of carbonic acid and of tetanisation upon electro-

tonic currents.

§ 4. The influence of alterations of temperature upon electrotonic

currents.

§ .5. The action of some anaesthetics and of some alkaloids upon elec-

trotonic currents.

--§ 1. The influence of acids and alkalies upon currents of action.

Experiments under this head were undertaken at an early stage of our

Weinvestigation.    soon realised, however, that it would be desirable to

postpone the prosecution of this branch of the subject until we should have

examined the more fundamental problems concerning the action of acids

and alkalies upon electrotonic currents (§ 2). The following summary
statement will, however, serve to convey an idea of the scope and tenor

of this first group of experiments :--[M= Molecular, ]Sr=N'ormal]

    Dilute acid solutions (M/40 to M/10) cause primary augmentation,
followed by secondary gradual diminution of the negative variation.

     Stronger acid solutions (M/10 to M/.5) cause primaiy diminution and

abolition of the negative variation.

     Alkaline solutions at all effecti\-e strengths (M/50 to M/5) cause

primary diminution and abolition.
     The eff'ect of an acid solution is not in proportion with its ' avidity.'

Approximately equal effects are produced by decinormal acetic, nitric and
sulphuric acids.- But in the case of some other acids, equinormal solu-
tions give markedly unequal effects. Thus phosphoric acid is less active,
and lactic acid is more active than nitric acid ; approximately equal effects

being produced by lSr/5 phosphoric acid, by N/lO nitric acid, and by N/20

    ' An account of previous observations is given in the Phil. Trans. U.S. for 1897,

and in three papers published in 'Brain ' during 1896 and 1897.

lactic acid. Lactic acid is more active than oxalic acid. Caustic potash
is more active than caustic soda [and potassium salts are more active than

sodium salts]. Approximately equal effects are produced by N/50 potash
and by N/15 soda.

     §§ 2, 3, and 4. Influence of acids and alkalies, of carbonic acid and of
tetanisation, and of temperature, upon electrotonic currents, have formed

the chief subject-matter dealt with during the past year.

Short accounts of these investigations have been given by one of us in

the Proceedings of the Physiological and of the Royal Societies ; · and
the significance of the results obtained is considered in some detail in the

5th and 6th of a series of ' Lectures on Animal Electricity,' delivered at

the Royal Institution (advance proofs of which are presented with this

AReport, together with copies of the papers mentioned in it).     short

paper, published in the Proceedings of the Physiological Society, ^ con-

cerning the action of CO.2 upon muscle, arose from and is connected with

our investigation on nerve.

The general lines of our inquiry and its results have been as follows :

Electrotonic currents are extrapolar effects aroused in living medul-

lated nerve. They are assuredly physiological as well as physical, inas-

much as they are temporarily suppressed by a rise of temperature to a little

above 40°, and by the action of anaesthetic vapours.

ANormally, in frog's nerve, the current (i.e., on the side of the anode)
Kconsiderably exceeds the
                             current (i.e., on the side of the kathode).

AThe ordinary magnitude of is, to that of K, as 4 or 5 to 1.

AIn consequence of a rise of temperature to 40°, the          current is

K A/Kdiminished, the current is increased. In any case the    quotient is

Kdecreased. In some cases it is reduced below unity, being greater than A.
AThe typical effect of moderate acidification is a diminution of the
Kcurrent and an augmentation of the current (diminution of A/K).
AWith acidification below the degree termed ' moderate ' the current

may be increased. "With acidification above the degree termed ' moderate

Kthe current may be diminished.

     The typical effect of moderate basification is diminution of the Kcurrent.

   KIt thus appears that the current is favoured by acidification, dis-
Afavoured by basification, and that alterations of the current are less

uniform and characteristic.

   KThe effect of prolonged tetanisation upon the current is similar to
Kthat of acidification, viz. the current is increased.

   AThe effects of tetanisation upon the current are less uniform, viz.
Athe current may be increased, unaltered, or diminished.

     There is a close resemblance between the effects of carbonic acid and

A Kthose of prolonged tetanisation upon the and currents. This resem-

blance (which is commented upon in some detail in the 6th of the ' Lec-

tures on Animal Electricity ') may be admitted to rank as confirmatory

evidence of the principal conclusion previously arrived at from an exami-

nation of currents of action, to the effect that ' the tetanisation of isolated

nerve gives rise to a production of CO.,.'

detailed and systematic report on any given portion of this extensive iield.
All that we think desirable at this stage is to offer evidence of the physio-

logical character of the electrotonic currents under our study, by showing

that these currents are subject to modification by anaesthetic and other

Wedrugs.  have selected for this purpose reagents, the effects of which

upon the currents of action were most familiar to us, viz. ether, chloro-

form, and aconitine.^

Electrotonic currents ai'e tem-porarily diminished under the influence

of ether (about 50 per cent, vapour in air), jiermanently diminished under

the influence of chloroform (about 10 per cent, vapour in air). As regards

the expression ' permanently,' it should be remarked that it implies ' during

an observation of reasonable length, generally one hour,' for we have more

than once observed partial recovery at the end of several hours, and with
a new transverse section to the nerve.

     [The question of structural disorganisation of nerve by ether and chloro-
form vapour is dealt with in a separate report ("Waller and Lloyd).]

     Aconitine hydrochloride in weak solution (1 in 1,000 saline) gives an

A Kaugmentation of and ; in stronger solution (1 in 100) it gives a
A Kgradual diminution ending in abolition of and ; in solutions of inter-

mediate strength it gives augmentation followed by diminution. In all
the experiments upon which these statements are based the nerve was

left to soak for one minute in the test-solution.

V. Histological Changes in Medullated Nerve after Treatment with the

     Vajjours of Ether and Ch loroform, and with CO^ By A. D. Waller,
     M.B., F.llS., and F. Seymour Lloyd.

          § 1. Introductory Note by Dr. Waller.

The following observations form part of an investigation of the action

Aof anaesthetic vapours on the electro-mobility of isolated nerve.   brief

preliminary account of that investigation was given at the Liverpool

meetingof the British Association (1896). The following fuller account

deals principally with the practical bearings of the investigation.

The question whether the alterations of electrical response effected by

various re-agents depend upon gross and visible alterations of nerve

substance presented itself to my mind at the outset of my observations,

more especially in connection with the more or less pronounced toxic

action of different anissthetics, and has subsequently been urged upon me

from several quarters ; together with the question whether the nerves

under observation have been really living, and whether their alterations

of response in consequence of reagents has not possibly been due to gross

physical disorganisation.

    This group of questions may be understood in two senses, one needing

only a very brief and clear answer, the other requiring some little reason-

ing, and probably further microscopic investigation. The answers I am

about to give refer only to nerves submitted to volatile re-agents and to

three re-agents in solution, viz. KBr, NaBr, and Aconitine.

my(a) Briefly, there is under the conditions of    observations no visible

alteration in structure of the nerve-fibre, but on pi'olonged exposure to

reagents there are more or less distinctly visible alterations. Judged by

the only sign available, viz., the negative variation the nerves have been

     ' The effects of ether, chloroforin, aconitine, kc, upon currents of action are

 living, and the alteration of response has not been due to visible disorgani-

 sation ; moreover, where a recovery of response after more or less prolonged
 suppression was commonly observed or not observed in cases where it was.

 to be expected, for example, after ether, rarely after chloroform, after

 carbonic acid, not after aconitine. I have attached importance to the

 fact of recovery after temporary suppression as being evidence of an effect,

which, though no doubt physico-chemical in last resort, may nevertheless

be characterised as physiological. And the same remark is applicable to

 all those cases where there is a temporary augmentation of response.

     (b) A priori it may reasonably be supposed that any alteration of

response depends upon some physico-chemical alteration of substance,

visible or invisible. The degree to which we are able to extend our know-
ledge of such material change de visu varies, and we may never draw the

distinction between organic and functional, or material and immaterial, tc

correspond with the distinction that may happen to exist for us between
visible and invisible. As regards the present investigation, it was sufficient

at the outset to be assured of the physiological nature of the observed

alterations of response ; the limit of visibility of the material alterations

upon which these symptoms depended became a matter of secondary
interest, that might or might not be of sufficient interest to excite histo-

logical investigation. I have been too fully occupied with the purely

physiological aspect of the subject to be able to give due time and care to
its histological prosecution, and all that I have learned in this direction, in

particular the fact that temjjorary alterations are visible in nerve under
the temporary influence of anesthetics, has been obtained from the careful

observations of Mr. F. S. Lloyd. From his report it appears that under

conditions of experiment considerably more severe than those obtaining

in my galvanometric investigation, alterations of structure so slight as

hardly to be detected without the closest examination, and in some
particulars difficult to distinguish from artifacts, are all that can be
observed. The permanent and a fortiori the temporary abolitions of

electrical response produced in my experiments have therefore not been

due to gross disorganisation.

§ 2. The Microscopic Changes noticed in Isolated Nerve, after treatment with

         Ether and Chloroform Vapour and with CO.^. By Mr. Llotd.

· The nerves of the frog were invariably employed, especially the sciatic-

and popliteal iierves, also the dorsal cutaneous nerves. For ordinary

Fig. 1. "^ork a simple glass thimble was employed, in which a.

              tightly-fitting cork was placed. The tube being half filled

              with ether or chloroform, as desired, a frog was pithed and

              a nerve dissected out as quickly and with as little injury

              as possible. This was lightly stretched on the under surface

              of the cork, and this replaced in the tube. The nerve-

              thus having been exposed to the concentrated vapour

              (EtjO, 50 per cent. ; CHCI3, 12 per cent.) for as long or

              short a time as desired, the cork was withdrawn, and

              1 per cent, osmic acid solution substituted for the chloro-

              form or ether, the cork replaced, and the nerve ' fixed ' by

              exposure to the osmic vapour for half to one hour.

              When, however, it was desired to study the microscopic-

              change in the nerve simultaneously with the passage of the

--employed :  required vapour over it, the following apparatus was

clipped down we have a cell into which the tubes CC open.

  --The following sketch (fig. 3) will show how it is used in conjunction

with the required vapour :

The nerve is dissected out and lightly stretched on the under surface

of the cover glass on the cover AA, which is then placed on BB, so that

the nerve comes to be inside the cell. One tube C is then connected by

rubber tubing with a wash-bottle containing water, the purpose of which

is to keep the vapour moist as it passes over the nerve. The wash-bottle

is connected with a WoolfF's bottle containing ether or chloroform, and

                                CHLOROFORM

fitted with the bellows commonly supplied to freezing microtomes, to

vaporise the ether.

     In studying the efiect of COg a Kipp's apparatus is fitted on in place
of the ether bottle and bellows. The cell can be placed under a low or
high power of the microscope, and the changes observed simultaneously

with the passage of the vapour.
     For the observation of the fresh nerve simultaneously with the passage

of the vapour, it is convenient to employ nerves as small as possible. The
nerves chosen for this purpose were usually the long slender cutaneous
filaments seen on opening up the skin of the frog's back. They possess
the advantages of being small, and are removable in considei'able lengths
for observation with a minimum of damage, as they lie comparatively free
in the subcutaneous lymph space.
ON THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF NERVE CELLS.  523

      In such a case, the changes in the nerve, as a whole, are readily ob-
servable, and moreover it is often possible to find fibres optically isolated

at the extreme edge of the bundle, so that individual appearances may be

studied.

      A.t other times, however, one of the popliteal nerves was taken, and
after placing it in position on the slip, one end was quickly and lightly
separated with mounted needles. In nearly every nerve thus treated
were visible one or more fibres separated from their fellows for a short
distance, rendering individual observation easier, the only drawback being
that in this case the nerve must of necessity be more or less injured.

    When treating nerves for examination, after fixation, by the ' thimble

method described above, obviously the size of the nerve was not a matter
of importance, provided that the vapour was given sufl&cient time to

penetrate the bundle.

      After medullated nerve fibres have been exposed in either of the above
ways to the vapour of ether, or chloroform, or to carbon dioxide gas, for
periods varying from 2-5 minutes (according to the size of the nerve

chosen) certsdxv slight microscopical changes maybe observed to have taken

place in them. In most cases these changes are but slight, and the fibres

are not all equally affected. Some may show little or no change from the

normal, while the rest show a more or less distinctly visible change.
      In observing a preparation, therefore, it is advisable to search it

throughout for any of the differences from the normal state, to be subse-

quently described, for it is not uncommon to only find a few fibres

typically affected throughout a whole nerve trunk.
     The ' effects ' produced by ether vapour and by carbon dioxide are very

similar, and usually slight, but the chloroform effect is generally marked
in the majority of cases, and is a more thorough change, affecting most of

the fibres of a nerve trunk.

      These effects are not easily visible in the fresh specimen, but are
usually recognisable in tissue subsequently fixed and darkened by osmic
vapour, which was found to be the most satisfactory of several fixing
agents tried.

     The histological changes fall under two headings :

     {a) Changes in the appearance and consistency of the medullary

                sheath
                                                                    ;

     (h) Changes at the nodes.

   --Ether Vapour. The earliest effect is noticeable as soon as twenty

seconds after the commencement of administration, a faint granularity
appearing in the medullary sheath and slowly increasing for about thirty
seconds. It is not an invariable result of the action of ether vapour, and

is not always visible in the fresh specimen, but is usually present in the

osmic preparation. It must be borne in mind that the myelin tends to

--become granular after death, and that granularity is often caused by

manipulation, thus : Granularity is invariably present at the cut ends of
a nerve.

     Another change common to etherised nerve, which is made evident by

the blackening action of the osmic acid, is the increased distinctness of
the medullary segments or incisures, which appear rather more distinctly
than in normal nerve, as light V-shaped markings on a darker ground.

     The most distinctive change, however, is at the nodes of Ranvier.

(As has been before remarked, the change may be but slight, and does not
524 REPORT-- 1897.

necessarily show in every fibre.) At some nodes there may be seen a

slight approximation of the myelin on each side towards the centre of the

node. Besides this, in several fibres, instead of the medullary sheath end-

ing in a rounded extremity at the node, it seems to flow along the axis

cylinder from one side to meet the myelin of the opposite side, producing

an appearance fitly described by the term * the waist effect.' In specimens

fixed in osmic vapour, and subsequently treated with carmalum, the axis

cylinder is seen to traverse the node, and to be apparently there ensheathed

by a delicate darkened covering continuous with the medullary sheath on

each side of it. This would seem to indicate that there is actual fusion of

the myelin of opposite sides across the node. In the smaller fibres the

change may be so marked as to almost obliterate the appearance of the
node. The ' waist effect ' is seen in many fibres usually, the approxima-

tion perhaps in but few.

The nodal effect becomes visible after 1-2 minutes of administration^

and is usually marked after 2|-3 minutes.

Etherised fibres do not reduce osmic acid so readily as normal fibres

i.e., they do not colour so deeply.

Carbonic acid produces appearances in nerve very similar to etherised

Wenerve, but rarely to such a marked extent.                        find much the same

appearances in  the  nodes                    granularity  may  be  entirely  absent.  When
                                           ;

present, it is usually coarse ; the incisures are even more distinct than

in etherised nerve. In one or two cases the appearance has been so*

marked as to give distinct prominence to the myelin opposite the

incisures, the fibre having a knotted appearance comparable to that of a
bamboo cane.

The CO2 effect is usually visible after two minutes' administration,
CO2 nerves stain readily with osmic vapour. The consistence of the

myelin seems to be somewhat altered by action of the CO2, the medullary

sheath tending to break up under manipulation rather more than a,

normal nerve would under similar treatment.

   --Chloroform Vapour. As in etherised nerve, granularity may be

observed. It is of a somewhat finer nature than the granulation due to^
ether, and appears somewhat later.

    On examination of a fresh preparation, simultaneously with the

administration of the vapour, there is sometimes seen comparatively early

a slight approximation of the medullary sheaths at the nodes, followed hj

a gradual separation commencing shortly after, and reaching its height in
about two to two and a half minutes.

    On fixing with osmic vapour, the darkening of the myelin shows at the

nodes a distinct gap, visible plainly even under the low power. The

medulla seems to taper along the axis cylinder for some distance on either
side, and terminates in a ragged edge, which seems to suggest fusion with

subsequent separation. Other nodes may, however, show no such tapering

appearance, the medulla merely being retracted from the node.

Provided that time has been given for the vapour to penetrate, the

majority of fibres in a chloroformed nerve show the change, which is

usually far more marked and more constant than the change in etherised

or ' carbonised ' nerve.

The chloroformed nerve does not stain quite so deeply with osmic

vapour, as a normal fibre exposed for a similar time.

The consistence of the myelin seems to be altered, it seems to become

short lengths at irregular intervals.

     The incisures are visible, but are usually not nearly so i^rominent as in
etherised or COj nerve. The identification of specimens from a number
of mixed slides is generally fairly simple, ijrovided that the whole speci-

men is thoroughly examined, and all the general appearances noted.
     If, however, the change is ill-marked, the identification may be a

matter of great ditficulty. Chloroformed nerve is the easiest to identify,

VI. An Investigation of tlte Changes in Nerve-cells in Various Pathological
            Conditions. By W. B. Warrington, M.D., M.R.C.P.

     Professor Sherrington and Dr. Mott, in the ' Proceedings of the
Royal Society,' vol. Ivii., have given an account of the influence which the
sensory nerves have upon the movements of the limbs. From studying
the conditions of the spinal cord in such cases I have been able to find
marked changes in the anterior coronal cells.

      Thus, the altered functional state of the motor-cells, which occurs

when the afferent impulses impinging on them are cut off, is accompanied
by a structural change.
526 REPORT--1897.

The roots cut were those of the cauda equina, and the cells most

affected were found in the postero-lateral group.

The typical picture of alteration in the cells is very characteristic.

     Using the methylene blue and erythrosin stain, as described by
H. Held, the affected cell is somewhat enlarged, is stained red with a
small amount of blue chromophilic granules at its periphery. The nucleus

remains well marked, and gradually assumes an eccentric position.
Finally, the cell is reduced to a hyaline-looking mass, and the nucleus

entirely disappears.

Nissl and some others state that changes similar to those described

above constantly occur in a cell after division of its axis cylinder. This has
been especially investigated in the case of the oculomotorius and faciales

nuclei after section of the corresponding nerve-trunk.

     In several instances in which I divided the facial nerve at the stylo-
mastoid foramen and the oculomotorius nerve intracranially, and made a

subsequent examination of the nuclei, I was unable to find changes in

the cells corresponding to the descriptions of these observers.

Some of the cells certainly showed alteration in structure, but these

were only a very small proportion, while similar cells were seen on the

Anintact side.  account of this investigation will shortly be published

in the 'Journal of Physiology.'

1. The work of the Committee has, during the past year, been still

directed to improving the method by which the curves of the phonograph

may be transcribed. The improved Phonograph-Recorder is fully described

in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh ' for session

1896-7, and in the ' Science Lecture ' delivered by Dr. M'Kendrick to the

Philosophical Society of Glasgow, and published in the ' Proceedings ' of

that society for session 1896-7.

2. The main results obtained by the Committee during the past year

are contained in the following extracts from the lecture above referred

to:--

  --(1) Physical Constitution of Words. First, with reference to speech, I

wish to point out that when the record of a wo7-d is examined it is found

to consist of a long sei'ies of waves, the number of which depends (1) on

the pitch of the vowel constituents in the word, and (2) on the dm'ation

of the whole word, or of its syllables individually. There is not for each

word a definite wave form, but a vast series of waves, and, even although

the greatest care be taken, it is impossible to obtain two records for the
Asame word precisely the same in character.
                                                   woi'd is built up of a suc-

cession, of sounds, all usually of a musical character. Each of these

sounds, if taken individually, is represented on the phonograph-record by

    ' See also Brit. Assoc. Meporti for 1895 and 1896 ; and Tramactiom of the Itoyal

Society of Edinburgh, 1896.
ON THYSIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE PIIOXOGRAPH. 527

a, greater or less number of waves or vibrations, according to the pitch of

the sound and its duration. The pitch, of course, will depend on the

number of vibrations per second, or per hundredth of a second, according'

to the standard we take, but the number of the waves counted depends on
the duration of the sound. As it is almost impossible to utter the same

sound twice over in exactly the same fraction of a second, or in the same

interval of time, the number of waves counted varies much in different

records. The rate per unit of time determines the pitch, the number the

duration of the sound. In a word, these successive sounds blend into

each other, and, in many records, the passage from one pitch to another

can be distinctly seen. The speech sounds of a man vary in pitch from

100 to 150 vibrations per second, and the song sounds of a man from 80

to 400 vibrations per second. The sounds that build up a word are chiefly

those of the vowels. These give a series of waves representing a varia-

tion in pitch according to the character of the vowel sound. In the

record of a spoken word the pitch is constantly moving up and down so

the waves are seen in the record to change in length. It is also very

difficult to notice where one series of waves ends and where another

begins. For example, in the word Con-stan-ti-nople, the predominant

sounds are those of o-a-i-o-iJl, and the variation in pitch is observable to

the ear if, in speakiiig the word, we allow the sound of the syllables to be
prolonged. If we look at the record of the word, we find these variations

in pitch indicated by the rate of the waves, or, as the eye may catch this

more easily, by the greater or less length of wave, according to the pitch

of the sound. The consonantal sounds of the word are breaks, as it were

in the stream of air issuing from the oral cavity, and these breaks (I am'

not discussing the mechanism at present) produce sounds that have also

often the character of vowel sounds. Thus, at the beginnin<^ of ' Con-

stantinople,' we have, as will be observed on pronouncing the syllable very

slowly, the sound iikko. This sound is represented in the record by a series

of waves. Then follow the waves of the vowel o. Next we have the
sound nn (driving the air through the nose), also represented by a series
of waves. Next the hissing sound ss, which has first something in it of

the vowel e or i, and then the iss-s. This sound also is shown by a series

of waves. Then there is ta, which has a double series of waves (1) those
for it or t, and the next for a. This passes into the prolono-ed vowel a

this into in, then a long o, then a sound like op, and, lastly, the sound ill,

a sort of double-vowel sound. As so many of these sounds have the

character of vowels, it is impossible, by an inspection of the record to
say where one set of waves begins and another ends. There are no such

breaks corresponding to the consonants                                                                                                                               the vibrations of the consonants
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

glide on as smoothly as those of the vowels. The number of waves pro-
ducing a word is sometimes enormous. In ' Constantinople ' there may
Abe 500, or 600, or 800 vibrations.
                                     record of the words ' Royal Society

of Edinburgh,' spoken with the slowness of ordinary speech, showed over

3,000 vibrations, and I am not sure if they were all counted. This brief

illustration gives one an insight into Nature's method of producing speech
sounds, and it shows clearly that we can never hope to read such records

in the sense of identifying the curve by an inspection of the vibrations.
The details are too minute to be of service to us, and we must again fall
back on the power the ear possesses of identifying the sounds, and on the

use of conventional signs or symbols, such as letters of the alphabet,

vowel symbols, consonant symbols, or the symbols of Chinese, which are
528 REPOKT-- 1897.

monosyllabic roots often meaning very different things according to the

inflection of tone, the variations in pitch being used in that language to

--convey shades of meaning.
    (2) Remarks on Analysis of Curves. When human voice sounds are

produced in singing, especially when an open vowel sound is sung on a
note of definite pitch, the record is much more easily understood. Then
we have the waves following each other with great regularity, and the
pitch can easily be made out. Still, as has been well pointed out by Dr.
E.. J. Lloyd, of Liverpool, a gentleman who has devoted much time and
learning to this subject, it is impossible by a visual inspection of the
vowel curve to recognise its elements. Thus two curves very similar,

--possibly identical to the eye, may give different sounds to the ear that is

to say, the ear, or ear and brain together, have analytical powers of the

finest delicacy. No doubt, by the application of the Fourierian analysis,
-ve may split up the periodic wave into a fundamental of the same period,

and a series of waves of varying strength vibrating 2, 3, 4, 5, &q., times
faster than the fundamental, and the relative amplitude of each of these

may be determined. If all these waves of given amplitude and given

phase acted simultaneously on a given particle, the particle would

describe the vibration as seen in the original curve. Dr. Lloyd, however,

is of opinion that even a Fourierian analysis may not exhaust the con-

tents of a vowel, as it does not take account of inharmonic constituents

which may possibly exist. Hermann · and Pipping ^ have also been

investigating the analysis of vowel tones, and their investigations have

revealed many difliculties. Hermann experimented with the ordinary

phonograph, and obtained photographs of the movements of the vibrating
glass plate. His curves are small, not unlike those seen in Koenig's flame

pictures. In many cases they have sharp points. This, however, may

not interfere with analysis. Pipping's curves were not obtained from the

phonograph, but from the vibrations of a minute membrane made to
represent the drum-head of the ear. His curves show large periodic
waves with minute waves on their summits, and they suggest that the
large waves may be vibrations due to the membrane itself. Not having

seen the apparatus, and as the observations have been made by one well
aware of the possibility of this error, I do not venture to do more than
suggest this difficulty, especially as I now show you a series of tracings
on a glass plate very similar to those in Pipping's figures. These were
obtained by singing a vowel into a receiver furnished with a small mem-
brane, to which a recorder was attached. The glass plate (smoked) moved

rapidly across in front of the marker. Alongside of these you will see

curves obtained directly from the recorder attached to the glass disc of a
phonograph. In the second you see waves more like those of Hermann.
The larger waves in the tracing, like that of Pipping, are, I believe, due,

in my experiment, to the vibrator, and do not represent the glottal

vibrations. This conclusion is strengthened by noting the pitch of the
sound, as made out by counting, not the larger, but the smaller waves,
which corresponds to that of the vowel sound. I therefore think that

argument should be based only on records obtained from the phonograph
itself, which is furnished with a vibrator tliat will not record its own
periodic vibrations unless the sound be remarkably intense. In ordinary
voice production and in ordinaiy singing the vibrator of the phonograph

--faithfully records only the pressures falling upon it no more and no

less.

  --(3) Recording Intensity of Tones. I shall now show you another

method of recording, not the individual vibrations of tlie phonograph, but

--the variations in intensity of the sounds of the phonograph the inten-

sities of individual notes and chords. I was led to use this method by

becoming acquainted with an instrument devised by Professor Hiirthle,

of Breslau. He has succeeded in recording the vibrations of the sounds

of the heart. I saw that his instrument was very useful, and I adapted

it to the particular purpose in hand. Hiirthle's instrument is an electro-

magnet acting on a metal plate connected with the elastic membrane of a

tambour. Another drum is connected with the first by an india-rubber

tube. The metal plate of the first tambour is pulled down by the electro-

magnet ; thus the air is rarefied in the tube and in both tambours, and

the lever of the second tambour moves. The next instant the lever flies

Weback.                                                 shall now connect ( ^raham's variable resistance apparatus with

tlie phonograph. As sound waves fall on it a change is produced in the

current passing through the electro-magnet ; the latter acts on its tam-

bour ;  a variable pressure is communicated to the other                                     tambour                                and  if
                                                                                                                                 ;

the lever of the latter is brought against a revolving drum, a tracing is

obtained. Each note and each chord are recorded, so that you get a

mechanical tracing of the variations of intensity.

  --(4) Electrical Stimulation of the Fingers by the Rhythm and Varying

Intensity of Tone. Now this experiment suggested another of a different

kind. Suppose I send the current not only through the variable resist-

ance apparatus above the disc of the phonograph, but also through the

primary coil of an induction machine. The wires from the secondary coil
pass to two platinum plates dipped in weak salt solution. I now set the

phonograph going ; and when I put my fingers into the beakers contain-

ing salt solution, I feel the intensity of every note. The variation of

intensity, the time, the rhythm, and even the expression of music, are all

felt. I shall now place on the mandril of the phonograph a cylinder on
which has been recorded another piece of music, which is much quicker.

I now feel a series of electrical thrills corresponding to every variation of

intensity of sound coming from the phonograph. That method shows that

the nerves of the skin can be stimulated by irritations coming to it at

the rate of the notes and chords of I'apid music. Some of the notes pro-

duced by the phonograph do not last longer than the five hundredth or

six hundredth part of a second, but they are quite sufficient to stimulate

the nerves of the skin, and, as I have pointed out, you can appreciate the

variations of intensity. You c&n feel the long-drawn-out notes from the

saxhorn or tioiubone. You feel the crescendo and diminuendo of

rhythmic movement, and you can estimate the duration of the note and

chord. You feel even something of the expression of the music. It is

rather a pity to say that even expression is mechanical. It is undoubtedly

Amechanical when you deal with the records of the phonograph. number

of interesting questions of a physiological nature are suggested by this

experiment. Tlie skin is not a structure that can analyse tone or distin-

guish pitch                                             it cannot tell you  the  number  of  vibrations,  although there

1897.                                                                                                     MM

is a curious approacli to it. While it is not by any means accui'ate, you

-- --can distinguish tone of low pitch very low tones by a feeling of ' inter-

mission.' Experimenting in this way, you may stimulate by interrupting

this circuit at the rate of 30 or 40 or 50 breaks per second, and yet the
skin will tell you the individual breaks ; but when you get above that
number you lose the consciousness of the individual breaks, and you have
a more or less continuous sensation. The phonograph does not necessarily
give you 50 or 60 stimuli to produce a sensation of a tone you do not

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

require that number. I found that 8 or 10 per second may give you the
sensation for a tone of any pitch. In the same way, you may be able to

notice a slight difference up to perhaps 50 or 60, but above that the sen-
sation seems continuous. It is not the number of stimuli that determines
pitch, but the rate at which the stimuli affect the sense organ, whether it

be ear or skin. Then the question arises, What is it in the skin that is

irritated 1 It is not the corpuscles. They have to do with pressure.

There is no oi'gan, so far as we know, for the sense of temjaeratui'e. You
may say that the feeling is muscular. Possibly it may be so ; but the
effect is most marked when the current is so weak as to make it unlikely

that it passes so deep as to reach the muscles.

   --(5) Mode of Communication tvith the Deaf. This experiment suggests

the possibility of being able to communicate to those who are stone-deaf

the feeling, or at all events the rhythm, of music. It is not music, of

course, but, if you like to call it so, it is music on one plane and without
colour. There is no appreciation of pitch, or colour, or of quality, and
there is no effort at analysis, an effort which, I believe, has a great deal to
do with the pleasurable sensation we derive from music. In this experi-

ment you have the rhythm which enters largely into musical feeling. On

Saturday last, through the kindness of Dr. J. Kerr Love, I had the

opportunity of experimenting with four patients from the Deaf and Dumb
Institution, one of whom had her hearing up till she was eleven years of

age, and then she became stone-deaf. This girl had undoubtedly a recol-

lection of music, although she does not now hear any sound. She wrote me

a letter, in which she declared that what she felt was music, and that it
awakened in her mind a conscious something that recalled what music
was. The others had no conception of music, but they were able to
appreciate the rhythm, and it was interesting to notice how they all,
without exception, caught up the rhythm, and bobbed their heads up and
down, keeping time with the electrical thrills in their finger-tips.

Science Lecture of the Philosophical Society above referred to.

The present report is to be regarded as a continuation of work the first

results of which were communicated by the Secretary of this Committee

to the British Association (Section I) at its meeting in Liverpool last

year, and afterwards published in the ' Journal of Physiology,' vol. xx.,

December 1896, p. 455.^
     The chief conclusions then arrived at concerned the effects of Witte's

-- --^peptone,' and were (1) That this substance in small doses below

--0'0'2 grm. per kilo hastens the coagulation of blood in the dog, while in

larger doses retardation is brought about, as other investigators have

found. (2) That the well-known fall of blood-pressure produced by this
substance when injected into the circulation is due to a peripheral influ-

ence upon the neuro-muscular apparatus of the blood-vessels. Ko

influence on the vaso-motor centre was detected. (3) That the vaso-

dilating influence of Witte's ' peptone ' is not confined to vessels of the

splanchnic region, but extends to other vessels also.

     This last conclusion was arrived at in an indirect way by observing the

effects of Witte's ' peptone ' on carotid blood- pressure when injected during

excitation of the spinal cord (after complete section), at the level of the

third cervical vertebra, the great sjDlanchnics on both sides having been

previously divided. Neither time nor circumstances had then permitted

the checking of this result by similar injections made during excitation

of the sciatics, nor of the observation of pletKysmographic variations of

limb volume under similar conditions of experiment.

Accordingly, in the work carried out during the past year which has

been entrusted to the Secretary, this was the first point to which attention

Awas given.  similar method of observation Avas then applied in turn to

the effects of Witte's ' peptone ' on the blood-vessels of the kidney and

spleen. This was succeeded by an analysis of the effects (a) on blood

coagulation, (b) on general blood-pressure and peripheral vaso-motor

mechanism, (c) on local vascular areas (limb, kidney, spleen) of the follow-

--ing substances pure peptone, anti-peptone, deutei'o-albumose, proto-

albumose and hetero-albumose. The investigation as regards the latter two

substances is aji yet too incomplete for publication, nor indeed can it be

looked upon as more than preliminary for any of the substances mentioned.

    The contents of the present abstract may therefore be summarised as

follows :

--On(a) the blood-vessels of the linih. Plethysmographic observations of

the volume of the limb were taken by Mosso's method and compared with

a simultaneous tracing of carotid blood-pressure. One or both sciatic

nerves were divided and excited by a fai-adic current. In the earlier

experiments an injection of Witte's ' peptone ' was made during this

excitation, the excitation being also repeated subsequent to the injection.

Later it was found more suitable to compare the results of an excitation

of definite strength, made after the injection, with the results of an excita-

tion of the same strength made before the injection.

Five experiments were performed, on dogs varying from 7 '6 to

10'8 kilos in weight, and employing Witte's peptone in doses of O'l, 0*15,

and 0-2 grm. per kilo of body weight.

The conclusions arrived at by this method support those expressed

last year, viz., that Witte's peptone produces a decided dilating effect on

limb blood-vessels by lowering the irritability of the peripheral neuro-

muscular apparatus, to centrifugal impulses. The effect, however, does

pletely abolish the efi'ect of vaso-constrictive impulses on abdominal blood-

vessels is only able to weaken their effect on blood-vessels of the limb.
--A(b) On blood-vessels of the kidney.
                                                                                                            record of kidney volume was

taken by means of Roy's oncometer and oncograph. This was accom-

Apanied by a tracing of blood -pressure.                                                                    solution of Witte's peptone was

injected into the saphenous vein. In the earlier experiments one or both

splanchnic nerves, or occasionally the spinal cord, was faradically excited

during, and after the injection. This procedure was subsequently modified,

and the effects of an excitation of certain strength made before the injec-

tion, were compared with the results of the same strength of excitation

made after the injection.

Seven experiments were performed. The dogs employed varied in

weight from 7'8 to 16-4 kilos, and the dose used in most cases was 0-1 grm.

per kilo. In a few experiments double this dose was employed.

The conclusions arrived at from these experiments are similar to those

deduced concerning the influence of Witte's peptone on limb blood-vessels.

This substa.nce produces a vaso-depressing influence on the blood-vessels of

the kidney to a considerable degree, especially in the larger doses employed.

The degree to which this influence extends is probably even less than

that upon the blood-vessels of the limb, certainly less than that upon other

vessels in the abdomen.
--A(c) On the blood-vessels of the sjAeen.
                                                                                                            spleen curve was taken by

means of Schafer's spleen box, or by a modification of it, made for the

writer of this report, which allowed the organ to be surrounded by a
layer of warmed oil, and thus prevented a loss of heat, otherwise liable to
occur. This method of recording splenic undulations of volume was found

to be much more satisfactory than that of Roy, and fully merits all that
Professor Schafer has elsewhere said about it. Side by side with the
spleen curve a tracing of carotid blood-pressure was recorded.

      Six experiments were performed, the dogs varying in weight from
7 to 11-7 kilos. In most of the experiments a dose of 0-15 grm. per kilo
was employed. In one this was increased to 0'2 grm. The left splanchnic
nerve in two of the experiments was divided and excited during the injec-
tion. In the remainder either the spinal cord or the splanchnic nerves
were excited, before and after the injection, with the same strength of

stimulus, and the results compared.
     The results showed that the effects of Witte's peptone on the blood-

vessels of the spleen were somewhat different from the effect of the same

substance on renal and limb blood-vessels.
     In the first place it was noted that the spleen volume suffers less of a

diminution from the fall of blood-pressure which immediately succeeds
an injection of Witte's peptone, and that this fall of the lever was soon

replaced by a return to its ordinary level.
     Agreeing with this, it was found that the early effects of this substance

on the peripheral irritability of splenic blood-vessels was very slight,
decidedly less than the same effect on splanchnic vessels generally. Later,
however, the contrary result was observed ; the splenic blood-vessels
seemed then to be more influenced by Witte's peptone than other vessels
in the abdominal cavity. This was shown in the later stage by a decided
rise of carotid blood-pressure on excitation of the spinal cord, unaccom-
panied by any effect on spleen volume, while the contrary obtained at an
earlier part of the same experiment.

                                     II. Effects of r%ire Peptone.

  --(a) On Mood coagulation. This was observed in four experiments,

the peptone used being prepared according to the directions of Grosjean '

and supplied to me by Dr. G. Griibler. The dogs used weighed from
85 to 18'45 kilos, and in each case a dose of 0-2 grm. per kilo was

employed.

     In all four cases coagulation was delayed from two to several hours.
In one case coagulation occurred at the end of the former period ; in two
others it had supervened next morning, the experiments having been per-
formed in the afternoon. In the fourth case the onset of coagulation was

not observed.

     These results agree with those of Grosjean, who found that pure pep-

tone delayed but never wholly destroyed the coagulability of blood.
Previous to Grosjean, Pollitzer had obtained inconstant results with

--ampho-peptone sometimes no efiect, sometimes a variable amount of

delay, on the whole his experiments leading to the conclusion that ampho-
peptone exerts but slight influence on blood-coagulation.

     Whether peptone in smaller doses is capable of producing hastening of

 coagulation has not as yet been in^^eetigated.

du laboratoire de Leon Iredericq, tome iv. 1891-92, p. 45.
534 REi'ouT-- 1897.

     One other noteworthy effect appeared in the samples of bloocJ

--drawn in three of the above four experiments viz., an unusually rapid

sinking of the red corpuscles, leaving a perfectly colourless and clear
plasma above. Within half-an-hour, plasma to the extent of one-third of
the whole blood drawn appeared above the corpuscles, and within one
hour this was increased to almost half, after which very little further sub-
sidence was observed. It was in this condition that the blood and plasma

coagulated.

      In the exceptional case curare had been administered ; the other dogs-
were not curarised

   --(b) On blood-press2i7'e and vaso-motor irritability. Seven experi-

ments, involving a record of blood-pressure, were made with Grosjean's
peptone. The dose employed was in all cases 0-2 grm. per kilo, and the

weights of the dogs varied from 7'4 to 18'4.5 kilos.
     The general results obtained were the same in all, and showed that

pure peptone causes a considerable fall of blood-pressure, and with this a
lowering of vaso-muscular irritability to central impulses. The degree
and duration of the fall were neither so great nor so lengthened as with
corresponding doses of Witte's peptone, nor was the peripheral vaso-motor
irritability depressed to the same degree. Thus, after a dose of 0'2 grm.
per kilo of pure peptone, blood-pressure had usually returned to its normal
level, and with it the response to vaso-motor excitation had likewise,
almost, if not fully reappeared.

      These results are in accord with those of Grosjean.

   --(c) On blood-vessels of the limb, kidnry, and spleen respectively.

In three of the above experiments a record of the volume of each of one
of these organs was taken, with the object of noting the effect of peptone
on its blood-vessels.

     In all three organs it was found that the dose employed produces a
distinct lowering of peripheral vaso-motor irritability immediately follow-
ing the injection. This, hov/ever, soon commenced to pass off, and within
a short period the response, by a gradual return, assumed its normal

proportions.

     With regard to any difference shown by the blood-vessels of these

organs, little positive can be said based on a single experiment for each.
So far, however, as this justifies remark, it would appear that limb blood-
vessels are more affected by pure peptone than either renal or splenic.

III. Effects of Anti-2)eptone.

--(a) On blood coagulation. This was observed in seven experiments

on dogs which varied in weight from 8-7 to 23-95 kilos. The doses em-

ployed per kilo were 0*1 grm. in one experiment, 0-2 grm. in four, and

0*3 grm. in two experiments.

In all of these, with one exception, blood coagulation was hastened, in

some markedly so. Thus, in one experiment with a dose of 0'2 grm. per

kilo, coagulation time was reduced from 9 m. 30 sec. to 2 m. sec. ; in

another, with a dose of 0-3 grm. per kilo, from 3 m.  sec.  to  1  m.  15 sec.
                                                                                                ;

and in a third, with a dose of 0-1 grm. per kilo, from 5 m. 10 sec. to 2 m. 45 sec.

In the exceptional case, with a dose of 0'3 grm. per kilo., blood-coagu-

lation-time was practically unaltered ; before injection time 3 m. 30 sec,
after 3 m. 55 sec.

This result stands in marked contrast to those published last year in
ox THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF TEPTOXE.  535

the paper before referred to, concerning Witte's peptone.' It was then
found that this substance, in doses of O'l grm. per kilo, retards coagula-
tion almost invariably, and the same effect was observed to be the rule
with doses as low as one-fifth this quantity. C4rosjean- had also found
coagulation to be delayed from one to ten hours by propeptone in doses of
0"1 grm. per kilo. Below 0-02 grm. per kilo a hastening of blood-coagu-
lation was the rule.

     The I'esult, however, is corroborated by those of Spiro and Ellinger,''

published during the course of this research. These observers found a
reduction of coagulation-time from eight to four minutes with a dose of

0'6 grm. per kilo. With regard to former investigators, it is to be remarked

that PoUitzer'* did not find that anti-peptone (tryptone) produced any effect
on the rapidity of coagulation, agreeing in this with Fano.'^ It is pro-
bable that neither of these experimenters used very pure products.

     Nor can the hastening effect of Witte's peptone on blood-coagulation,
in small doses, be attributed solely to an admixture with anti-peptone, since
deutero-albumose in certain doses, as will be shown later, has been found

to hasten this process, while in other doses coagulation is markedly

retarded.

   --(b) On hlood-pressure. Pollitzer evidently had noted that the effect

of anti-peptone (tryptone) on blood-pressure was different from that of
albumoses, since he makes an exception of it, stating that its effect is
doubtful. In the present research it has been found that anti-peptone
in its action on blood-pressure likewise contrasts with other products

of proteid digestion. In doses of 02 grm. per kilo, after a very tran-

sient fall immediately following the injection, blood-pressure returns to a
level, as a rule, somewhat higher than before the injection. This was ob-
served also in one of two experiments with doses of 0"3 grm. per kilo each.
In the other, the fall lasted somewhat longer, but even here the duration

of lowered blood-pressure was very temporary when compared with that

of Witte's peptone, minutes as compared with hours.
      Spiro and Ellinger '' also state that they have found essential differences

in the effects of this substance, amongst other things, on blood-pressure as

contrasted with albumoses. They, however, reserve their results for future

publication. It is interesting, as these observers point out, to note the
contrast of this substance with that of the albumoses, out of which it
arises, in view of the possibility that toxins and anti- toxins are similarly

related as to origin.

   --(c) On peripheral vaso-motor irritabilifi/. As might be anticipated,

this substance was not found to possess any depressing action on the tone

of blood-vessels, either abdominal or general. On the contrary, in many

cases a decided increase of irritability was shown.

  --(a) On blood coagulation. With regard to influence on blood-coagu-

lation, this substance has been found to produce a marked hastening in
certain of the experiments, while in others a marked retardation was
observed. Nor can the difference be .nttributed to the amount of dose.

So far this has proved irregular.
     Thus hastening has been obtained as follows :

is without doubt affected by doses of 01 grm. per kilo and upwards.
The influence is not very marked, and is probably less than that on
splanchnic blood-vessels other than those of the spleen or kidney. Nor

did the effect last long ; as a rule it had begun to disappear within live
minutes, and had almost if not wholly disappeared at the end of half an

hour.

In all the foregoing experiments the animals were fully anaesthetised

during the whole experiment by means of morphine and atropine

administered hypodermically prior to its commencement. Afterwards,

when necessary, a mixture of ether and chloroform was emjiloyed to main-

tain the anaesthesia. Curare was given when the spinal cord or nerves

other than the splanchnics were excited.

The products employed were furnished to me by Dr. George Griibler,

Dresden, and were with few exceptions injected into the external

saphenous vein, dissolved in 50 to 60 c.c. of normal saline.

It will be apparent that a considerable amount of work has yet to be

done to  make  even  the part of  this  research  now  reported upon complete
                                                                                                                                                        ;

while a large extent of the research has not as yet been carried sufficiently

far for publication owing to want of time. When this is finished it is pro-

posed to publish the whole, including the present part more fully written,

with tracings, tables, and protocols of experiments.

The Committee beg to report that the work in contemplation is progress-
ing favourably. From its nature, however, it is best pursued in the
summer months. They are not, therefore, in a position to make more

than an interim report, and beg to apply for a renewal of the grant for

The Committee since presenting their interim report (see B.A. Report,

1896) have continued their inquiries and investigations on the various
matters referred to them. The result of these has been largely to confirm

the statements already (loc. cit.) presented, to which reference may be
made for details. Thus for preserving specimens in a liquid medium

alcohol on the whole yields the best results, in spite of its decolourising
action. Rapid killing and in some cases special methods of bleaching
the specimens before immersion in the alcohol are additional precautions
which it is desirable to observe.
--538
REPOirr 1897.

     Experiments have been made to obviate the excessive transparency
which the more delicate parts (petals and the like) often assume when
preserved in spirit by precipitating salts in the tissues, but they have not

hitherto been attended with satisfactory results.
     For bulky objects, or for others in which flaccidity occasions no dis-

advantage, formalin maybe used in -5 per cent, to 15 percent, of the com-

mercial solution. It is cheaper than spirit, and in some cases preserves

the colour of the specimen in a more or less natural condition for many

months. This retaining of the colour, especially in the case of green
tints, is usually more effective if the specimen, rapidly killed by steam or
short submergence in strong alcohol, be treated for twenty-four hours or
longer Avith a strong bath of copper acetate.

      Further details of expex'iments with other liquids will be found in the

appendices of last year's report. Where the specimens are not intended to

be handled, drying in sand {vide appendix 1, Joe. cit.) gives admirable

results, and in many cases the natural colours are preserved. The extreme

fragility of the specimens thus treated constitutes, however, a serious

drawback when the objects are intended to be examined and handled by

students.

    No better methods of mounting specimens for exhibition purposes have
been devised than those in use in- the Museum of the Royal Botanical

Gardens in Edinburgh, an account of which is included in the interim

report already referred to.

     The Committee desire to express their thanks to those who have
kindly given them assistance by communicating such results of their own
observation and experience as were connected with the matters now under

consideration.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.
         TEANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.

SECTION A.--MATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCE.

 --President of the Section Professor A. R. Forsyth, M.A., D.Sc, F.R.S.

                            THURSDAY, AUGUST 19.

     The President delivered the following Address :

One of tlie most important events of the past year, connected with the affairs of

this Section, has been the reception by the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, of jt
deputation to represent the need for the establishment of a National Physical
Laboratory to carry out investigations of certain definite types. Such institutions
exist in France and Germany, and have proved of the highest usefulness in a field
of work that includes the wide range from pure research to the most direct appli-
cations of science to industry. Tlie desire for such an institution in England has
long been felt, and as far back as ] 891 Professor Oliver Lodge, when presiding
over our Section at the Cardiff meeting, argued in its favour. It has frequently
been discussed since that date, particularly in 1895, when Sir Douglas Galton
dealt with it so ably in his presidential address at Ipswich, and also in a commuui-
cation to our Section. The subject was then formally referred to a committee of
physicists, who, at last year's meeting in Liverpool, presented a report containing

a working scheme for developing the Kew Observatory into an institution of the

desired character. The recommendations of the report were approved by a unani-
mous vote of this Section; and were subsequently adopted by the Association.
Thereupon a joint committee, representing the various scientific bodies throughout
the United Kingdom interested in the matter, was constituted to further the plan :
in particular, to urge upon the Government the establishment of such a Laboratory,
and, if possible, to obtain from them the funds which are a preliminary necessity
for that purpose. It was a deputation from this joint committee which, headed
by Lord Lister, waited upon the Prime Minister on February 16 last. His reply
to the deputation was manifestly sympathetic with the request ; and it is a satis-
faction to be able now to say that the Government have appointed a Committee of
inquiry, which will also consider whether standardizing and other work, alreadj^
undertaken partially or wholly at the public cost, can fitly be associated with the
new institution.

     After having said, by way of preface, thus much upon the chief event of the
past year arising partly from our direct action, I wish to turn to the main line of

my address, and to ask, for a brief time, your attention and your consideration for

the subject of pure mathematics. If, remembering the brilliant address made
at the Monti'eal meeting, you regret that Lord Kelvin is not again now
occupying this position : or if, remembering the interest aroused by Professor
J. J. Thomson's address last year, you regret that the fascinating tale then opened
is not being resumed by some one with imagination enough and knowledge enough

to continue it : I can, not unselfishly, share your regret.
542 REPORT-- 1897.

      It appears, however, from the practice of the Council and the General Committee,
to be their policy that mathematicians belonging to the extreme right (if the phrase

may be used) shall from time to time be nominated to the presidency of the Section.

It is, I think, the case that this Section has always had assigned to it the subjects
of Mathematics and Physics. In their development, pure mathematics has con-
tinued to be associated with applied mathematics, and applied mathematics with

physics. So far as I know, there is no substantial reason why any change sliould

be made, and so far as I have been able to observe, there is a strong consensus

of opinion that no change by way of separation need be tried. Wide as is the

range of our discussions, distracting as is the occasional variety in the matter of

the papers we receive, the complexity of our Section, if in any respect a disadvantage,

does not appreciably discount the advantages it otherwise secures. Specialisation
in all our subjects has become almost a necessity for progress; but e.xcessive

obedience need not be paid to that necessity. On the one hand, there will be

danger of impei'fect appreciation if a subject is so completely restricted to a few
specialists that it is ignored by all but them ; and, on the other hand, there will be
danger of unsound growth if subject and thinkers alike become isolated, and cease
to take an active interest in the methods, the processes, and the results other than
those which directly concern them. Accordingly, I think that our group of
sciences, which form a continuous range, are better united than divided.

      Aristotle declared that it is unbecoming to praise the gods. Observing his
canon, I shall say nothing as to the wisdom and the justice of our Executive in
sometimes selecting a pure mathematician to preside over this Section. I shall

only appeal to your indulgence in accepting the opportunity they have thus given

me of speaking more specially about my own subject.

     I make this appeal the more earnestly, for two particular reasons. One of
these is based upon the conflicting views, popularly held and sometimes summarily
expressed, about the subject and those who are addicted to it. It is true that the
day has gone by, when it is necessary to give serious consideration to attacks upon
mathematical studies, and particularly upon analysis, such as were made by
the metaphysician Hamilton : attacks no longer thought worthy of any answer.
Feelings of hostility, if ever they were widely held, have given way to other
feelings, which in the mildest form suggest toleration and acquiescence, and in the

most extreme form suggest solemn respect and distant wonder. By common con-
sent, we are allowed without reproach to pursue our aims; though those aims

sometimes attract but little sympathy. It is not so long since, during one of the
meetings of the Association, one of the leading English newspapers briefly de-
scribed a sitting of this Section in the words, 'Saturday morning was devoted to
pure mathematics, and so there was nothing of any general interest ' : still, such
toleration is better than undisguised and ill-informed hostility. But the attitude

of respect, I might almost say of reverence, is even more trying : we mathema-

ticians are supposed to be of a different mould, to live far up the heights above
the driving gales of controversy, breathing a rarer intellectual atmosphere, serene
in impenetrable calm. It is difficult for us to maintain the gravity of demeanour

proper to such superior persons ; and perhaps it is best to confess at once that we
are of the earth, earthy, that we have our differences of opinion and of judgment,
and that we can even commit the Machiavelian crime of making blunders.

    The other of my reasons for claiming your indulgence is of a graver character,

and consists in the difficulty of framing general explanations about the subject.
The fact is that mathematics do not lend themselves readily to general exposition.
Clifford, it is true, could lecture and enchant his audience : and yet even his
lectures ranged about the threshold of the temple of mathematical knowledge and
made no attempt to reveal the shrines in the sanctuary. The explanation of this
initial difficulty is, however, at hand. Our vocabulary is highly technical, per-
haps as teclmical as is that of moral philosophers : and yet even the technicality
of a vocabulary can be circumvented by prolixity of statement. But the ideas
and the subject-matter in any branch of our study, when even only moderately
developed, are so abstract as to demand an almost intolerable prolixity of state-

ment if an attempt is made to popularise them. Moreover, of the many results
        TKAXSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                                            643

obtained, then; are fuw tliat appeal to an unprofessional sympathy. Adams could
discover a new planet by subjecting observations made of the known planets to the

most profound calculations; and the world, not over curious about the process,
could appreciate the significant result. But such instances are rare ; for the
most part, our particular results must remain somewhat intangible, somewhat

incomprehensible, to those who dwell resolutely and completely outside the range

of mathematical Imowledge.

    What then am I to do ? It would be pleasant to me, though it might not

prove satisfying to you, to discourse of the present state of one branch or of several
branches of mathematics, and particularly to indicate what seem to be lines of possi-
ble and probable growth in the future. Instead of pursuing this course, I shall keep

my remarks of a general character as far as possible, and shall attempt, not merely

to describe briefly some of the relations of pure mathematics to other branches of
science, but also to make a bold claim that the unrestricted cultivation of pure

--mathematics is desirable iu itself and for its own sake. Some I should like to
--believe many who pre here will concede this claim to the fullest extent and

without reservation; but I doubt whether this is so in general. And yet the

claim is one which needs to be made before an English-speaking audience. For it
is a curious fact that, although the United Kingdom has possessed some of the very

greatest of pure mathematicians in the second half of this century, the subject has
there received but a scant share of attention as compared with that which it has

found in France, in Germany, in Italy, in Sweden and jNorway, or in the United
States. I am not oblivious of the magnificent contributions to other parts of our
science made alike by British leaders and British followers ; their fame is known to

the world. But apathy rather than attention has been the characteristic feature of

our attitude towards pure mathematics ; and it seems to me a misfortune, alike for the

intellectual activity of the nation and for the progress of the subject, that English

thought has had relatively so small an influence upon its vast modern developments.

    Now it is not enough for my purpose to be told that the British Association

Aincludes all science in its scope, and consequently includes pure mathematics.

statement thus made might be framed in a spirit of  mere  sufferance                                          what I wish
                                                                                                           ;

to secure is a recognition of the subject as one which, being full of life and over-

flowing with a power of growth, is worthy of the most absorbing devotion. Tlie

most cursory examination of the opinions of scientific men leads at once to the

conclusion, that there are two views of the subject, both accurate so far as
they go, both inadequate whether alone or combined, which to some extent

explain if they do not justify what may be called the English attitude in the past.

Let me deal with these in succession.

One of  these estimates has  been framed by what is called  the  practical                                    man
                                                                                                                                        ;

he regards the subject as a machine which is to provide him with tables, as far

as tables can be calculated ; and with the simplest formulse and the most direct

rules, whenever tables cannot be calculated. Kesults, not methods, are his want

it is sufficient for him that an authoritative statement as to a result shall be made;

all else is ignored. And for what is beyond, in the shape of work that does

nothing to meet his special wants, or of the processes that have led to the results

he uses, he cares little or nothing. In fact, he would regard mathematics as a

collection of formulae and an aggregate of processes to grind out numerical results

whatever else there is in it, may be vain and is useless. In his view, it is to be

the drudge of the practical sciences.

    Now it is undoubtedly an advantage in any case that labour should be saved

and time economised ; and where this can be done, either bj' means of calculations

made once for all, or by processes that lead to results admitting simple formulation,

any mathematician will be glad, particularly if his own work should lead to some

such issue. But he should not be expected to consider that his science
has thus fulfilled its highest purpose; and perhaps he is not unreasonable if, when

he says that such results are but a very small part, and not the most interesting

part, of his science, he should claim a higher regard for the whole of it. Indeed,

I rather suspect that some change is coming ; the practical man himself is changing.

The developments in the training for a profession, for example, that of an
544 REPORT-- 1897.

engineer, and the demands that arise in the practice of the profession, are such as to

force gradually a complete change of view. When I look into the text-books that
he uses, it seems to me a necessity that an engineer should now possess a mathe-

matical skill and knowledge in some directions which, not so very long since,
could not freely be found among the professional mathematicians themselvps.

And as this change is gradually effected, perhaps the practical man will gradually

change his estimate of the scope of mathematical science.

    I pass from the practical men to some of the natural philosophers. Many of

them though certainly far from all of them, expound what they consider proper
and economical limits to the development of pure mathematics. Their wisdom
gives varied reasons ; it speaks in tones of varied appreciation ; but there can be
no doubt as to its significance and its meaning. Their aim is to make pure mathe-
matics not indeed the drudge, but the handmaid of the sciences. The demand
requires examination, and deserves respectful consideration. There is no question
of (Tivinc or withholding help in furthering, in every possible fashion and with every
possible facility, the progress of natural philosophy ; there is no room for difference
upon that matter. The difference arises when the opinion is expressed or the
advice is tendered that the activity of mathematicians and all their investigations
should be consciously limited, and directed solely and supremely, to the assistance

and the furtherance of natural philosophy.
     One group of physicists, adopting a distinctly aggressive attitude in imposing

limits so as to secure prudence in the pursuit of pure mathematics, regard the
subject as useful solely for arriving at results connected with one or other of the

branches of natural philosophy ; they. entertain an honest dislike, not merely to

investigations that do not lead to such results, but to the desirability of carrying out

--such investigations; and some of them have used highly flavoured rhetoric in express-

ing their dislike. It would be easy but unconvincing-- to suggest that, with dut
modifications in statement, they might find themselves faced with the necessity of

defending some of their own researches against attacks as honestly delivered by
men absorbed in purely practical work. But such a suggestion is no reply, for it

does not in the least touch the question at issue ; and I prefer to meet their con-

tention with a direct negative.

     By way of illustration let me take a special instance : it is not selected as being

easier to confute than any other, but because it was put in the forefront by one of

--the vigorous advocates of the contention under discussion a man of the highest

scientific distinction in his day. He wrote : ' Measured [by the utility of the

power they give] partial differential equations are very useful, and therefore stand
very high [in the range of pure mathematics] as far as the second order. They

apply to that point in the most important way to the great problems of nature,

and are worthy of the most careful study. Beyond that order they apply to

nothing.' This last statement, it may be remarked, is inaccurate ; for partial

--differential equations, of an order higher than the second, occur to give merely a
--few examples in investigations as to the action of magnetism on polarised light, in

researches on the vibrations of thick plates or of curved bars, in the discussion of

such hydrodynamical questions as the motion of a cylinder in fluid or the damping

of air-waves owing to viscosity.
     Putting this aside, what is more important is the consideration of the

 partial ditierential equations of the second order that are found actually to occur

in the investigations. Each case as it arises is discussed solely in connection with
its particular problem ; one or two methods are given, more or less in the form
of rules ; if these methods fail, the attempt at solution subsides. The result

 is a collection of isolated processes, about as unsatisfactory a collection as is the

chapter labelled Theory of Numbers in many text-books on algebra, when it is
 supposed to represent Ihat great branch of knowledge. Moreover, this method

 suflers from the additional disadvantage of suggesting little or no information about

 equations of higher orders.

     But when the equations are considered, not each by itself but as ranged under

 a whole system, then the investigation of the full theory places these processes in
 their proper position, gives them a meaning which superficially they do not
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.      545

exhibit, and indicates the way in which each solution satisfies the general con-

ditions of existence of a solution. For the full theory of partial differential
equations of the second order in, say, two independent variables establishes the con-
ditions of existence of a solution, the limitations upon the conditions which make
that solution unique, the range of variation within which that solution exists, the
modes of obtaining expressions for it when it can be expressed in a finite form, and

an expression for the solution when it cannot be expressed in a finite form. Of

course, the actual derivation of the solution of particular equations is dependent

upon analytical skill, as is always the case in any piece of calculating work ; but
the general theory indicates the possibilities and the limitations which determine
the kind of soliition to be expected. But not only does the general theory effect

--much by way of co-ordinafing isolated processes and, in doing so, lead to new

--results but it gives important indications for dealing with equations of higher orders,

and it establishes certain theorems about them merely by simple generalisations.

     In fact, the special case quoted is one more instance, added to the many

instances that have occurred in the past, in which the utilitarian bias in the

progress of knowledge is neither the best stimulus nor in the long run the most

-- --effective guide towards securing results. It may be it frequently is at first

the only guide possible, and for a time it continues the best guide, but it does not
remain so for ever. It would be superfluous, after Cayley's address in 1883, to

show how branches of mathematical physics, thus begun and developed, have
added to knowledge in their own direction; they have suggested, they have even
created, most fascinating branches of pure mathematics, which, when developed,

have sometimes proved of reciprocal advantage t9 the source from which they
sprang. But for proper and useful development they must be free from the
restrictions which the sterner group of natural philosophers would lay upon

them.

    Now I come to another group of natural philosophers who will unreservedly
grant my contention thus far ; who will yield a ready interest to our aims and

our ideas, but who consider that the possibility of applying our results in the

domain of physical science should regulate, or at least guide, advance in our work.
Some of these entertain this view because they think that possibility of early appli-

cation is, in the last resource, the real test of useful development ; some, because
they fear that the profusion of papers annually published and the bewildering

specialisation in each branch, are without purpose, and may ultimately lead to

isolation or separation of whole sections of mathematics from the general progress

of science.

     The danger arising from excess of activity seems to me unreal ; at any rate
there are not signs of it at home at the present day, and I would gladly see

more workers at pure mathematics, though not of course at the expense of attention
paid to any other branch. But for results that are trivial, for investigations that
have no place inorganic growth and development, or in illustration and elucidation,
surely the natural end is that they soon subside into mere tricks of ' curious pleasure

or ingenious pain.' However numerous they may be, they do not possess intrinsic

influence sufficient to cause evil consequences, and any attempt at repression will,

if successful, inevitably and unwisely repress much more.
      More attention must be paid to the suggestion that mathematicians should be

guided in their investigations by the possibility of practical issues. That they are

so guided to a great extent is manifest from many of the papers written in that

spirit ; that they cannot accept practical issues as the sole guide would seem
sufficiently justified by the consideration that practical issues widen from year
to year and cannot be foreseen in the absence of a divining spirit. Moreover, if such
a principle were adopted, many an investigation undertaken at the time for its in-
trinsic interest would be cast on one side unconsidered, because it does not satisfy

an external test that really has nothing to do with the case, and may change its

form of application from time to time.

     To emphasise this opinion that mathematicians would be unwise to accept

 practical issues as the sole guide or the chief guide in the current of their investiga-

tions, it may be suficient to recall a few instances from history in which the

1897.                              NN
--546 REPORT 1897.

purely mathematical discovery preceded the practical application and was not an

elucidation or an explanation of ohserved phenomena. The fundamental properties

of conic sections were known to the Greelis in the fourth and the third centuries

before the Christian era ; but they remained unused for a couple of thousand

years until Kepler and Newton found in them the solution of the universe. Need

I do more than mention the discovery of the planet Neptune by Adams and

Leverrier, in which the intricate analysis iised had not been elaborated for such

particular applications .^ Again, it was by the use of refined analytical and

geometrical reasoning upon the properties of the wave-surface that Sir W. R.

Hamilton inferred the existence of conical refraction which, down to the time

when he made his inference, had been ' unsupported by any facts observed, and

was even opposed to all the analogies derived from experience.'

It may be said that these are time-honoured illustrations, and that objec-

tions are not entertained as regards the past, but fears are entertained as regards

the present and the future. Very well ; let me take one more instance, by choosing

a subject iu which the purely mathematical interest is deemed supreme, the theory

of functions of a complex variable. That at least is a theory in pure mathematics,

initiated in that region  and developed  in  that  region                                 it  is  built  up  in  scores  of
                                                                                       ;

papers, and its plan certainly has not been, and is not now, dominated or guided

by considerations of applicability to natural phenomena. Yet what has turned

out to be its relation to practical issues ? The investigations of Lagrange and others

upon the construction of maps appear as a portion of the general property of

conformal representation ; which is merely the general geometrical method of

regarding functional relations in that theory. Again, the interesting and important

investigations upon discontinuous two-dimensional fluid motion in hydrodynamics,

made in the last twenty years, can all be, and now are all, I believe, deduced from

similar considerations by interpreting functional relations between complex vari-

ables. In the dynamics of a rotating heavy body, the only substantial extension

of our knowledge made since the time of Lagrange has accrued from associating

the general properties of functions with the discussion of the equations of motion.

Further, under the title of conjugate functions, the theory has been applied to

various questions in electrostatics, particularly in connection with condensers and

electrometers. And, lastly, in the domain of physical astronomy, some of the most

conspicuous advances made in the last few years have been achieved by introducing

into the di.scussion the ideas, the principles, the methods, and the results of the

theory of functions. It is unnecessary to speak in detail of this last matter, for I

can refer you to Dr. G. W. Hill's interesting ' Presidential Address to the American

Mathematical Society' in 1895; but without doubt the refined and extremely

difficult work of Poincare and others in physical astronomy has been possible only

by the use of the most elaborate developments of some pure mathematical subjects,

developments which were made without a thought of such applications.

    Now it is true that much of the theory of functions is as yet devoid of explicit

application to definite physical subjects ; it may be that these latest applications

exhaust the possibilities in that direction for any immediate future ; and it is also

true that whole regions of other theories remain similarly unapplied. Opinion

and divination as to the future would be as vain as they are unnecessary ; but my

contention does not need to be supported by speculative hopes or uninformed

prophecy.

If in the range of human endeavour after sound knowledge there is one subject

that needs to be practical, it surely is Medicine. Yet in the field of Medicine it

has been found that branches such as biology and pathology must be studied for

themselves and be developed by themselves with the single aim of increasing

knowledge ; and it is then that they can be best applied to the conduct of living

processes. So also in the pursuit of mathematics, the path of practical utility is

too narrow and irregular, not always leading far. The witness of history shows

that, in the field of natural philosophy, mathematics will furnish more eflfective

assistance if, in its systematic development, its course can freely pass beyond the

ever-shifting domain of use and application.

    What I have said thus far has dealt with considerations arising from the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                      547

outside. I have tried to show that, in order to secure the greatest benefit for

those practical or pure sciences which use mathematical results or methods, a

deeper source of possible advantage can be obtained by developing the subject

independently than by keeping the attention fixed chiefly upon the applications that

may be made. Even if no more were said, it might be conceded that the unrestricted

study of mathematics would thereby be justified. But there is another side to this

discussion, and it is my wish now to speak very briefly from the point of view of

the subject itself, regarded as a branch of knowledge worthy of attention in

and for itself, steadily growing and full of increasing vitality. Unless some

account be taken of this position, an adequate estimate of the subject cannot

be framed ; in fact, nearly the greater part of it will thus be omitted from

consideration. For it is not too much to say that, while many of the most

important developments have not been brouglit into practical application, yet they

are as truly real contributions to human knowledge as are the disinterested

·developments of any other of the branches included in the scope of pure science.

It will readily be conceded for the present purpose that knowledge is good in

and by itself, and that the pursuit of pure knowledge is an occupation worthy of

Athe greatest efibrts which the human intellect can. make.  refusal to concede so

much would, in effect, be a condemnation of one of the cherished ideals of our

race. But the mere pursuit or the mere assiduous accumulation of knowledge is

not the chief object ; the chief object is to possess it sifted and rationalised : in

fact, organised into truth. To achieve this end, instruments are requisite that

may deal with the respective well-defined groups of knowledge ; and for one
particular group, we use the various sciences. There is no doubt that, in this

--sense, mathematics is a great instrument; there remains for consideration the

decision as to its range and function are they such as to constitute it an inde-

pendent science, or do they assign it a position in some other science ?

I do not know of any canonical aggregate of tests which a subject should satisfy

before it is entitled to a separate establishment as a science ; but, in the absence of a

recognised aggregate, some important tests can be assigned which are necessary, and

Amay, perhaps, be sufficient.  subject must be concerned with a range of ideas form-

ing a class distinct from all other classes ; it must deal with them in such a way that

new ideas of the same kind can be associated and assimilated ; and it should derive
a growing vigour from a growing increase of its range. For its progress, it must

possess methods as varied as its range, acquiring and constructing new processes in

its growth ; and new methods on any grand scale should supersede the older ones,
so that increase of ideas and introduction of new principles should lead both

to simplification and to increase of working power within the subject. As a sign

of its vitality, it must ever be adding to knowledge and producing new restilts,

even though within its own range it propound some questions that have no answer

and other questions that for a time defy solution ; and results already achieved

should be an intrinsic stimulus to further development in the extension of know-

ledge. Lastly, at least among this list, let me quote Sylvester's words: 'It must

unceasingly call forth the faculties of observation and comparison ; one of its

principal methods must be induction ; it must have frequent recourse to experi-

mental trial and verification, and it must aflbrd a boundless scope for the highest

efforts of imagination and invention.' I do not add as a test that it must

immediately be capable of practical application to something outside its own range,

though of course its processes may be also transferable to other subjects, or, in

part, derivable from them.

     All these tests are satisfied by pure mathematics : it can be claimed without

Ahesitation or exaggeration that they are satisfied with ample generosity.

complete proof of this declaration would force me to trespass long upon your time,

and so I propose to illustrate it by references to only two or three branches.

First, I would refer to the general theory of invariants and co-variants. The

fundamental object of that theory is the investigation and the classification of all

dependent functions which conserve their form unaltered in spite of certain general

transformations effected in the functions upon which they depend. Originally it

began as the observation of a mere analytical property of a particular expression,

                                                                          NX2
548 REPORT-- 1897.

interesting- enough in itself, but absolutely isolated. This then suggested the

inverse question : What is the general law of existence of such functions if they
exist as more than mere casual and isolated occurrences ? and how can they all be

determined ? The answer to these questions led to the construction of the alge-
braical theory of invariants for linear transformations, and subsequently to the
establishment of co-variantive forms in all their classes. Next came the question

of determining what is practically the range of their existence : that is, is there a

complete finite system of such functions in each particular case ? and if there is,

how is it composed, when in a form that ought to admit of no farther reduction ?

These questions, indeed, are not yet fully answered.

While all this development of the theory of invariants was made upon

these lines, without thought of application to other subjects, it was soon clear that

it would modify them greatly. It has invaded the domain of geometry, and has

almost  re-created  the  analytical  theory                                    but  it  has done more than this, for the
                                                                            ;

investigations of Cayley have required a full reconsideration of the very foundations

of geometry. It has exercised a profound influence upon the theory of algebraical

equations; it has made its way into the theory of diti'erential equations; and the

generalisation of its ideas is opening nut new regions of the most advanced and

profound functional analysis. And so far from its course being completed, its questions

fully answered, or its interest extinct, there is no reason to suppose that a term

can be assigned to its growth and its influence.

    As one reference has already been made to the theory of functions of a com-
plex variable, in regard to some of the ways in which it is providing new methods

in applied mathematics, I shall deal with it quite briefly now. The theory was, in
efi'ect, founded by Cauchy ; but, outside his own investigations, it at first made slow
and hesitating progress. At the present day, its fundamental ideas may be said

almost to govern most departments of the analysis of continuous quantity. On many
of them, it has shed a completely new light ; it has educed relations between
them before unknown. It may be doubted whether any subject is at the present

day so richly endowed with variety of method and fertility of resource ; its activity

is prodigious, and no less remarkable than its activity is its freshness. All this

development and increase of knowledge are due to the fact that we face at once

the difficulty which even the schoolboy meets in dealing with quadratic equations,

when he obtains ' impossible' roots ; instead of taking the wily x as our subject of
operation, we take the still wilier x + y ^J -- \ for that purpose, and the result is a

transfiguration of analysis.

    In passing, let me mention one other contribution which this theory has made to

knowledge lying somewhat outside our track. During the rigorous revision to
which the foundations of the theory have been subjected in its re-establishment by
Weierstrass, new ideas as regards number and continuity have been introduced.
With biro and with others influenced by him, there has thence sprung a new
theory of higher arithmetic ; and with its growth, much has concurrently been
effected in the elucidation of the general notions of number and quantity. I have
already pointed out that the foundations of geometry have had to be re-considered
on account of results finding their origin in the theory of invariants and co-
variants. It thus appears to be the fact that, as with Plato, or Descartes, or

Leibnitz, or Kant, the activity of pure mathematics is again lending some assist-

ance to the better comprehension of those notions of time, space, number,

quantity, which underlie a philosophical conception of the universe.
     The theory of groups furnishes another illustration in the same direction. It

was begun as a theory to develop the general laws that govern operations of substi-
tution and transformation of elements in expressions that involve a number of
quantities : it soon revolutionised the theory of equations. Wider ideas succes-

sively introduced have led to successive extensions of the original foundation, and

now it deals with groups of operations of all kinds, finite and infinite, discrete and

continuous, with far-reaching and fruitful applications over practically the whole

of our domain.
     So one subject after another might be considered, all leading to the same

conclusion. I might cite the theory of numbers, which has attracted so
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                      549

many of the keenest intellects among meu, and has grown to be one of the most
beautiful and wonderful theories among the many in the wide range of pure

mathematics ; or without entering upon the question whether geometry is a
pure or an applied science, I might review its growth alike in its projective,
its descriptive, its analytical, and its numerative divisions ; or I might trace the

influence of the idea of contiuuity in binding together subjects so diverse as

arithmetic, geometry, and functionality. What has been said already may,

however, suthce to 'give some slight indication of the vast and ever-widening

extent of pure mathematics. No less than in any other science knowledge gathers

force as it grows, and each new step once attained becomes the starting-point for

steady advance in further exploration. Mathematics is one of the oldest of the

sciences; it is also one of the most active, for its strength is the vigour of perpetual

youth.

In conclusion, a few words are due to the personal losses caused since

eur last meeting. It is but little more than two years since Cayley passed

away; his life had been full of work, unhasting and unresting in the almost

placid course of his great mental strength. While Cayley was yet alive, one name

nsed to be coupled with his when reference was made to English pure

mathematics; the two great men were regarded as England's not unworthy

contribution to the exploration of the most abstract of the sciences. These fellow-

workers, diverse in temperament, in genius, in method, were bound by a friendship

that was ended only by death.  And  now Sylvester  too  has  gone                            full  of  years
                                                                                          ;

and honours ; though he lived long, he lived young, and he was happily active

until practically the very end. Overtlowing with an exuberant vitality alike

in thought and work, he preserved through life the somewhat rare laculty of

instilling his enthusiasm into others. Among his many great qualities, not

the least forcible were his vivid imagination, his eager spirit, and his abundant

eloquence. When he spoke and wrote of his investigations, or of the subject to

which the greater part of his thinking life had been devoted, he did it with the

--fascination of conviction ; and at times-- for instance, in his presidential address to

this Section at Exeter in 1869 he became so possessed with his sense of the high

mission of mathematics, that his utterances had the lofty note of the prophet and

the seer.

     One other name must be singled out as claiming the passing tribute of our

homage ; for, in February last, the illustrious and venerable Weierstrass died.

He was unconnected with our Association ; but science is wider than our body,

and we can recognise and salute a master of marvellous influence and unchallenged

eminence.

      Thus, even to mention no others, pure mathematics has in a brief period lost

three of the very greatest of its pioneers and constructors who have ever lived.

We know their genius ; and the world of thought, though poorer by their loss, is

richer by their work.

        Tho' much is taken, much abides, and tho'

        We are not now that strength which in old days

        Moved earth and heaven ; that which we are, we are

        One equal temper of heroic hearts,
        Made weak by lime and fate, but strong in will

        To strive, to seek, to find, and not lo jield.

Knowledge cannot halt though her heroes fall : the example of their life-long
devotion to her progress, and the memory of their achievements, can inspire us
and, if need be, can stimulate us in realising the purpose for which we are banded

--together as an Association the advancement of science.

      3. On the Unification of Time. By John A. Paterson, 2f.A.,

        President of the Astronomical and Physical Society of Toronto.

    (1) Time reckoniiigr, as at present conducted, presents curious anomalies. The
civil day begins at midnight and ends at the following midnight. The nautical

day begins atnoou and concludes at noon of the next civil day. The astronomical
day begins at noon and ends at the following noon ; it is therefore apparent that

any given date may extend over or into three difierent days.
     (2) Principally through the efforts of members of the American Society of

Civil Engineers and Mr. Sandford Fleming, now Sir Sandford Fleming, an inter-
national conference was convened at Washington to consider the whole question
of time reform. The representatives of twenty-five nations, as well as the
Canadian representative named above, met accordingly in Washington in 1884 at

the invitation of the President of the United States, and after a conference extend-
ing over a month passed seven resolutions, the first five of which have been prac-
tically and generally accepted by the civilised world. The sixth resolution of that
remarkable conference was carried unanimously, and is as follows : ' That th&

conference expresses the hope that as soon as may be practicable the astronomical
and nautical days will be arranged everywhere to begin at mean midnight.'

     (3) The question of time reform remained in this position until the year 1893,,
when the Astronomical and Physical Society of Toronto, in co-operation with the
Canadian Institute, appointed a joint committee, with Sir Sandford Fleming as
chairman, to suggest the best means of ascertaining the views of astronomers-
throughout the world. This committee accordingly addressed by circular letter

--the following question to astronomers and other scientific men throughout the-

world:

     'Is it desirable, all interests considered, that on and after January 1,1901^

the astronomical day should everywhere begin at mean midnight ? '

     The replies received were in number 171, of which 108 were favourable to the
change, and 63 unfavourable. In classifying the replies from astronomers accord-
ing to the countries from which they were received, 18, including England and the
United States, were in favour of the change, and 4 were unfavourable to th&

change. Cla.ssifying the results according to the shipping, the countries favouring-
the change represent 65 per cent, of the world's marine.

     (4) Captain W. Nelson Greenwood, of Lancaster, England, ably assisted the-

Astronomical and Physical Society of Toronto in obtaining the opinion of ship-
masters on the question. The result was that 98 per cent, of those heard from
were in favour of the change, representing a total tonnage of 45.5,810.

    (5) An eflbrt towards securing unanimity amongst the nations of the world

has been put forth by the Astronomical and Physical Society of Toronto and the
Canadian Institute by communications addressed to the Lords Commissioners

4. Preliminary Note on PJiotoyraphic Records of Objective Combination

   Tones. By A. W. Rucker, F.R.S., R. W. Forsyth, and R. Sowter.

     The method of detecting the combination tones by the resonance of a fork was
the same as that used by Rilcker and Edser ^' Phil. Mag.' 39, p. 341, 1895). The
interference bands were thrown upon an opaque screen pierced with a narrow slit,

behind which was a revolving cylinder covered with photographic paper. When

the bands were undisturbed, the traces were parallel straight lines, but these

became wavy when the fork was set in vibration. All the principal results
obtained by Riicker and Edser were confirmed, and some new experiments were
made with Konig's wave-siren.

1. On the Determination of the Surface Tension of Water, and of certain
    Dilute Aqueous Solutions by means of the Method of Rijyples.^ By

     N. Ernest Dorsey, Ph.D.

     The method employed is a development of that used by Lord Rayleigh. But
by mounting the mirrors on arms rigidly attached to the carriage of a dividing
engine, and by viewing the light reflected from the surface of the liquid with a
telescope moimted on the carriage and provided with a spider line, 1 have succeeded
in measuring the length of the waves directly with the dividing engine, and with

considerable accuracy.

    By means of a small lens the horizontal beam of light is rendered parallel

before reflection from either mirror. The surface of the liquid was cleaned by
means of a flexible brass hoop, as in Lord Rayleigh's work. In reducing the results
I have used Lord Kelvin's complete formula.

     In a series of twenty-one determinations of the surface tension of water the

average was 73-24 dynes per centimetre at 18° C, or 75-98 dynes per centimetre at
0" C. ; and the average departure of a single result from the mean of the entire
series was only one-fifth of 1 per cent. This value diflers from the one found by
Lord Rayleigh by about 1 per cent., which is his estimate of the accuracy of his
determination, and it agrees with the value found by an entirely diflerent method by
M. Sentis in February of this year.

     The concentration of the solutions was varied from one-tenth normal to normal, but
most of the work was on solutions more dilute than one-half normal, and hence these
results are not strictly comparable with those obtained by others who have worked
on solutions not so dilute ; but, on the whole, the values here found are in accord

     ' Published in the Physical Review, vol. v., Nos. 27 and 28, Sept. and Oct. 1897.
--552 REPORT 1897.

with those obtained by others. At these great dilutions the surface tension is a

linear function of the concentration in every case studied.

2. On a New Method of Deterjiiining the Sjjecijic Heat of a Liquid in
     terms of the International Electrical Units. By H. L. Callendar,

     M.A., F.B.S., Professor of Physics, and H. T. Barnes, M.A.Sc,
     Denwnstrator of Physics, of McGill University, Montreal.

     In view of the probable adoption of the Joule or Watt-second as the absolute
unit of heat, it becomes of special interest at the present time to make direct
determinations of the natural thermal units in terms of the electrical standards

now universally adopted.

      In recent years the specific heat of water has been very carefully determined in
this manner by Griffiths, and also by Schuster and Gannon. These observers
employed the usual calorimetric method, in which a mass of water is heated
through a carefully observed range of temperature by means of a measured
quantity of electrical energy. Although their methods differed widely in points
of detail, their results agreed to within one part in a thousand with each other.
But, as Schuster points out, the result so obtained by the electrical method for the
specific heat of water differs by one part in 400 from the result obtained by direct
mechanical measurements of Joule, Kowland, and Miculescu.

     Whatever the cause of this discrepancy, it seemed desirable to repeat the
electrical comparison by an entirely difl'erent method, to avoid any possible source
of constant error which may have remained unsuspected in the calorimetric method

as usually practised.

     The method which we have adopted consists in passing an electric current
through a fine tube, through which a steady current of liquid is flowing. The

electrical measurements required are the current and the difference of potential
between the ends of the tube. The thermal measurements are the steady difference
of temperature and the quantity of liquid flowing in a given time.

     The electrical measurements are all made on one potentiometer, preferably a
Thomson-Varley si. de-box, and present no difficulty, as it is easy to keep the
current steady to one part in a thousand for an hour or more, and there is no

change in the resistance of the circuit.
     The difference of temperature between the inflowing and outflowing liquid,

which is also very nearly constant throughout the duration of the experiment, is
measured by means of a differential platinum thermometer. The instruments used
for this purpose, consisting of a compensated slide-wire resistance box and pair of
thermometers, are the same as were exhibited by Prof. Callendar at the con-
versazione of the Royal Society in 1893, on which occasion the instruments were
used for demonstrating the lowering of the melting-point of ice under one
atmosphere of pressure. Readings can be taken to the ten-thousandth part of a
degree on a rise of temperature of ten degrees.

     The current of liquid is kept steady by means of an automatic electromagnetic
device, and the quantity flowing in a given time, the interval being also
automatically recorded on an electric chronograph, is determined by weighing.

     It will be observed that in this method, as compared with that usually employed,
since the temperature distribution is exceedingly steady, it is not necessary to
determine the thermal capacity of the calorimetric tube with any degi'ee of accuracy.

The rate of external loss of heat is also much more steady and more easily

determined, and there is no question of lag of the thermometers.
     The external loss of heat, which is generally the largest and the most uncert'iin

correction in all calorimetric experiments, can, in the present instance, be made
extremely small and regular by the expedient of enclosing the calorimetric tube, &c.,
in a glass jacket, which is exhausted as perfectly as possible and then hermetically
sealed, so that the vacuum cannot sufler further change. The loss can also be
measured and eliminated in a very simple manner. If observations are taken with
                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  553

different values of the electric and liquid currents, the values in each case being

adjusted to give the same rise of temperature, it is clear that the temperature

distribution, and therefore the external loss of heat, will be very nearly the same.

The total loss can be reduced to two or three per cent, of the heat supply on a rise
of temperature of 10° C, and the residual differences in any set of observations are

but a small fraction of the total loss, and are easily corrected.

   We have so far applied the method only to the cases of water and mercury,

which present most interest. There is no difficulty, however, in extending the
Wemethod to the case of other liquids.
                                                have made special arrangements for

applying the method to the determination of the variation of the specific heat with

temperature, for which purpose it is peculiarly suited, and was, in fact, originally

devised. The apparatus may be inspected at the McDonald Physics Building.

The essential parts were exhibited at the meeting.
    In applying the method to water we have found no difficulty in obtaining

steady readings over the range 0° to 50°, and we hope to extend the result to 75°.
Special arrangements, which have proved perfectly effective, are made to avoid

loss by evaporation.

The results of the observations cannot as yet be published, as they are not

sufficiently numerous to merit attention, and still require the application of certain

final coiTections. The variation to be measured is so small that many of these

corrections may considerably alter the result.

3. On the Behaviour of Argon in XRay Tubes. By H. L. Callendae, M.A.,

    F.R S., Professor of Physics, and N. N. Evans, M.A.Sc, Lecturer in

     Chemistry, of McGill University, Montreal.

In continuation of some experiments made by Professor Callendar in the early

part of 1896, the authors have studied the behaviour of argon and some other

Xgases in  Ray tubes of various types. The phenomena presented by a tube

filled with carefully dried and purified argon are in many respects peculiar. Under

certain conditions the gas appears to be absorbed with extreme rapidity, and with

intense sputtering and heating of the kathode. The phenomena appear to depend

on the complete elimination of hydrogen from the electrodes, as well as on the

degree of vacuum in the tube and the intensity of the current. From experiments

on other gases the authors conclude that hydrogen is the most suitable gas for

X Ray tubes, and that as a rule the residual gas present is hydrogen. It is possible

that the observed absorption of the argon is apparent merely, and corresponds to a

sudden increase of the resistance of the tube at a certain stage of the exhaustion,

and not to an actual disappearance of the gas.

            4. On the Fuel Supply and the Air Supply of tlie Earth.
                                By Lord Kelvin, F.R.S.

     All known fuel on the earth is probably residue of ancient vegetation. One ton
average fuel takes three tons oxygen to burn it, and therefore its vegetable origin,
decomposing carbonic acid and water by power of sunlight, gave three tons oxygen
to our atmosphere. Every square metre of earth's surface bears ten tons of air, of
which two tons is oxygen. The whole surface is 126 thousand millions of acres, or
610 million millions of square metres. Hence there is not more than 340 million

million tons of fuel on the earth, and this is probably the exact amount, because
probably all the oxygen in our atmosphere came from primeval vegetation.

     The surely available coal supply of England and Scotland was estimated by
the Coal Supply Commissiou of 1S71, which included Sir Roderick Murchison and
Sir Andrew Ramsay among its members, as being 146 thousand million tons.
This is approximately six-tenths of a ton per square metre of area of Great Britain.
To burn it all would take one and eight-tenths of a ton of oxygen, or within two-
--654
REPORT 1897.

tenths of a ton of the whole oxygen of the atmosphere resting on Great Britain.
The Commission estimated fifty-six thousand million tons more of coal as probably

existing at present in lower and less easily accessible strata. It may therefore be
considered as almost quite certain that Great Britain could not burn all its own
coal with its own air, and therefore that the coal of Britain is considerably in

excess of fuel supply of rest of world reckoned per equal areas, whether of land or

sea.

5. A Canadian and Imj^erial Hydror/raphic Survey. By Alexander

     Johnson, M.A., LL.D., Professor of Mathematics, Fice- Princijjal,
     McGill University.

     In 1884, at the Montreal meeting of the Association, a paper was submitted to

ASection by the present writer, in consequence of which a Committee was

appointed for the ' Promotion of Tidal Observations in Canada.' The writer was
made Secretary, and subsequently Chairman. This Committee, supported by the
Royal Society of Canada and by those specially interested in navigation, succeeded,
after many delays, in getting the Canadian Government, in 1890, to make a grant
for tidal observations, which were to include, not only the rise and fall of tide, but
also the tidal currents. The grant was continued from that time until the present
year, when it was reduced, so that the survey of the currents could not be con-
tinued this summer, although an investigation of the utmost importance for the
navigation of the St. Lawrence, more especially when the ' fast Atlantic Line ' ia

going to be established. Possibly the entire grant is imperilled.

     It is believed that this reduction would probably not have taken place had
there been in existence a fully organised Hydrographic Survey for Canada to
advise the Government. The lioyal Society of Canada had some time ago recom-
mended the creation of such a department, and at its recent meeting in Halifax
appointed a deputation to present its views to the Government.

     The work of such a department can probably be most effectively canied out
with the co-operation of the Admiralty.

     The object of the present communication is to seek the advice and aid of the
British Association in inducing the Imperial and Canadian Governments to act
together in making the necessary arrangements, which, if found satisfactory, might
possibly be extended to other colonies, and thus the basis of an ' Imperial Hydro-
gi-aphic Survey ' might be laid.

                  6. On the Specif c Heat of Superheated Steam.
 By Professor J. A. Ewing, F.R.S., and Professor Stanley Dunkeeley.

     The authors measure the amount of heat required to beat steam above its tem-
perature of saturation by allowing dry saturated steam to pass through a porous
plug and observing its temperature and pressure before and immediately after the
passage. The total heat of the steam before passing the plug is known from the
experiments of Regnault, and this is equal to the total heat of saturated steam at
the pressure beyond the plug plus the amount of heat required to heat steam at
that (constant) pressure from the temperature of saturation up to the observed
temperature. Hence the second of these two quantities of heat is found. In pre-
liminary experiments the pressure beyond the plug was atmospheric, and the
observations consequently related to the superheating of steam under atmospheric
pressure. The experiments have not yet been carried far enough to determine
with certainty what happens during the very first stages of superheating, but it
appears from the preliminary observations that the mean specific heat for the first
ten degrees of superheating is less than the mean specific heat for larger amounts
of superheating. At higher temperatures of superheating under this pressure the
specific heat approximates to the value 048, as determined in the direct measure-

ments of Regnault. It is the authors' intention to continue the experiments, and
extend the method to higher temperatures and to higher pressures in order to
obtain results that will be applicable to present engineering practice.

7. Xeiv Varieties of Katliode Rays. Bxj SiLVANUS P. Thompson, F.B.S.

             8. On the Spectra of Oxygen, Sulphur, and Selenium.
                           By C. RuNGE and F. Paschen.

     The spectrum of oxygen when an electric current is passed through a vacuum
tube containing that body, and when no spark gap or Leyden jar is interposed in

the circuit, closely resembles the spectrum of helium. It consists of six ' series' of
lines forming two sets of three each. Each set of lines is very similar to the whole
spectrum of any one of the alkali metals. There is therefore no more spectroscopic
evidence in favour of the supposition that helium consists of two elements than
there is for oxygen. Under similar circumstances sulphur and selenium give out

each a spectrum closely resembling one of the sets of three series. But we are not
sure whether the other set does not find its analogy also. The three sets in the
spectra of oxygen, sulphur, and selenium, which are analogous to one another, all
consist of triplets of a very marked character, the difference of wave numbers
increasing as we pass from oxygen to sulphur and from sulphur to selenium in
roughly approximate proportion to the squares of their atomic weights. The spec-

--trum of each of the three bodies, as a whole, is situated further to the side of the

smaller wave numbers that is to say, it consists of slower oscillations the greater

the atomic weight of the body.*

9. T1t,e Influence of Pressure on Spectral Lines.

               By J. Larmor, F.B.S.

A definite picture of the relations of the tether and matter is obtained by

assuming the material molecule to be made up of electrons or intrinsic strain-

Acentres in the tether.'-  system of electrons describing steady orbits round each

other, after the manner of the bodies of a solar or stellar system, would represent

a molecule ; any disturbance of this steady motion would induce radiation across
the tether, which would last until it had reduced the motion again to a state of

steadiness. The natural configuration of a molecule would, however, be the

unique one of minimum energy corresponding to its intrinsic constant rotational

momenta, for the influence of radiation would set towards this configuration, and

would not allow much departure from it.

The wave-lengths of luminous radiation are about 10^ times the linear dimen-

sions of the molecules ; thus the intrinsic luminous periods are those of rather

slow periodic inequalities (in the sense of physical astronomy) in the orbital

motions. This circumstance allows us to roughly appreciate the order of magni-

tude of the influence of the surrounding medium on these free periods. On account

of their slowness the tethereal oscillations which are governed by the inequalities

of the orbits of the electrons are sensible over the space occupied by some thousands

of molecules each way, and this number is so great as to tempt us to form an idea

of the influence of these imbedded molecules by considering them to form a con-

tinuous medium. If now the molecules were vibrating in a homogeneous medium,

say, surrounded by simple aether, the free periods would vary inversely as the square

root of the elasticity of this ambient medium, provided we could assume that

change of the medium did not involve change of type of the steady intramolecular

orbits. This latter circumstance, however, will also operate to alter the periods,

expect on the above hypothesis that increase of pressure would lower the free

periods roughly in the same ratio as it raises the square root of the dielectric
^ D·constant. To reduce to figures : a shift of
                                  of the distance between the lines

and atmospheric pressure is I'OOOG. Thus this shift towards the less refrangible

end would indicate a change of density of the surrounding air of the order of

that due to a pressure oi^ of an atmosphere at 0° 0.

This would make the eflect about 10- times too large for the observations

thus the main seat of the fether strain maintaining the vibrations of the molecule

is the free aether immediately surrounding it, and the loss of stiffness due to the

other molecules which are some way otf diminishes the free periods only about
10 ~- times as much as if it were averaged right up to the vibrator. With

eimilarly constituted lines, it is the relative shift SA/\ that is proportional to the

change of density of the medium.

  10. Changes in the Wave-frequencies of the Lines of Emission SjKctra of

                         Elements. By W. J. Humphreys.

      For more than two years the best spectroscopic equipment of the Johns Hopkins
 University has been devoted chiefly to the study of changes in the wave-frequencies
ofthe lines of emission spectra. It was found, soon after the investigation was
begun, that a change in atmospheric pressure about an electric arc, in which a
substance was being volatilised, caused a change in the wave-frequencies of the
spectral lines so produced. In studying this phenomenon a concave Rowland
grating of the largest size was used, and the electric arc was formed in a closed
cylinder provided with a quartz window, the pressure being obtained by pumping

--air into this cylinder to any extent desired usually till the gauge registered from

six to twelve atmospheres.

      Besides a number of eye observations several hundred photographs were taken,
rand a large number of lines carefully measured. In fact, the spectrum of almost
·every known metallic element has been examined at various pressures.

    No lines were found to shift more than a fraction (usually less than the tenth)

of an Angstrum unit, but the shifts are of such regularity that as the wOrk pro-
gressed several interesting relations between the shifts of the lines, the conditions
under which the lines are produced, and the elements producing them became
evident. Some of these relations (given below) may be more or less accidental,
while doubtless others of as great importance have been overlooked. However
the labour of the investigation was spent iu determining the facts in regard to the
lines examined, and not in hunting after empirical relations.

      It is impossible, of course, in a mere abstract to enter into details of any
description, and I shall therefore confine myself to the following summary of
results. These are :

      1. Increase in pressure around the arc causes all isolated lines to shift towards
the red end of the spectrum.

     This is entireh' independent of the manner of the lines spreading out, and is
the same for a line when reversed as when it is fine and sharp. Even those lines
which, like the sodium lines X3302 and X3303, spread to the violet give reversals

that shift to the red.

     2. The shift is directly proportional to the increase of pressure about the arc.
     3. It does not depend upon the partial pressure of the gas or vapour producing
tihe lines, but upon the total pressure. In other words, it is not affected by

quantity of material iu the arc.

     4. The shift of the lines seems to be nearly or quite independent of tem-

perature.
transajctions of section a.                       557

     5. The lines of bands, at least those of cyanogen and of aluminium oxide, are

not appreciably shifted.

     6. The shifts of similar lines of a given element are to each other as the wave-

lengths of the lines themselves.

     7. Different series of lines (as described by Kayser and Runge) of a given ele-

ment are shifted to different extents. When reduced to the same wave-length

these shifts are to each other approximately as one to two to four for the
principal, first, and second subordinate series respectively.

     8. Similar lines of an element, though not belonging to a recognised series, are
shifted equally (when reduced to the same wave-length), but to a different extent
than are those unlike them.

     9. Shifts of similar lines of different substances are to each other, in most
cases, inversely as the absolute temperatures of the melting points of the sub-
stances that produce them,

     10. The shifts of similar lines of different elements are to each other approxi-
mately as the products of the coefficients of linear expansion and cube roots of the
atomic volumes of tlie respective elements (in the solid state) to which they are

due.

     11. Elements belonging to the same half of a Mendelejeff group give lines which
shift proportionately to the cube roots of their respective atomic weights.

     12. The lines produced by those substances which, in the solid form, have the
greatest coefficients of linear expansion have the greatest shifts. The converse is

a'so true.

     13. The shift of similar lines is a periodic function of atomic weight, and

consequently may be compared with any other property of the elements which

itself is a periodic function of their atomic weights.

   A portion of this investigation was conducted jointly with Dr. J. F. Mohler,

and the whole of it under the direction of Professor Rowland and Dr. Ames,
Directors of the Physical Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University.

                  13. On the Constitution of the Electric Spark.
                           By Arthur Schuster, F.R.S.

     If the spark of a Leyden jar discharge is examined by means of a spectroscope-
it is found that the metallic lines are not confined to the immediate neighbourhood
of the poles, but are sometimes seen several millimetres away from the electrode*,
from which tbey must have been projected with considerable velocity.

    How to measure the velocity of projection has always seemed to me to be a

problem of interest. Apart from the information a knowledge of that velocity
might give us concerning the mechanism of the spark discharge, it is not impossible
that light might be thrown on some important points in spectrum analysis
which are at present under discussion. Thus, for instance, if the speed with which
a molecule is pushed forward into the centre of the spark depends on molecular

weight, we might hope to separate from each other those lines of a spectrum which

belong to different molecular combinations.

     At various intervals during a number of years I had made unsuccessful
attempts to deal with this problem, when I became acquainted with the elegant

method used by Professor Dixou in some of his recent experiments) in which a
photograph is taken on a film fixed to the rim of a rapidly revolving wheel.

    On trial it was found that the molecular speed is sufficiently small to be

measured by this method.
     The experiments were conducted by M. Gustav Hemsalech, to whose care

end skill their success is largely due. Without entering into a detailed descrip-

tion of the apparatus it will be sufficient to say that the photographs exhibited

^^^to the Section were taken on a film moving with a linear speed of about 80

in a direction at right angles to the slit of the spectroscope. While the air lines

appear perfectly straight, though slightly broadened, the metallic lines are

inclined and curved. The spark was taken from five Leyden jars, charged by

means of a Voss machine, the distance between the electrodes being about
A1 cm.
        single spark produces a good spectrum, reaching approximately from

X = 5000 to X = 4000.

Thotograph I. is that of a spark taken between zinc poles on a stationary film.

It serves to show the sharpness of the lines in a spectrum of zinc and air.

curvature of the zinc lines shows that the velocity of the molecules is gradually
diminishing away from the poles. Close to them it must be very large. The

averao-e velocity up to a distance of one millimetre from the electrode is

5?^2000  and at a distance of four millimetres.    This is reduced to somethin"g
second'

like 400.

     Photor/raph III. The upper pole is still zinc, while in the lower pole a piece
of metallic bismuth has been substituted. The three most refrangible ones, that
at 4259, being the strongest of them, are decidedly more inclined than the zinc

lines, while the line 4560 seems almost straight.

    IVPhotoqraph . The poles are again zinc and bismuth, but both poles are

moistened with a solution of calcium chloride. The photograph reveals the
curious fact that Bi 4259, which was very much curved on HI., is now much

less so. The comparison with Ca 4226 clearly shows the greater inclination of

Hthe calcium line. The latter is more inclined than and K,and if the difference

in molecular velocity is due to dift'erences in molecular weight, this would show

Kthat II and belong to a simpler molecule than 4226.

      I do not desire to express any opinion respecting the bearing of these experi-
ments on the hypothesis of dissociation, as some of the photographs reveal rather
puzzling appearances which must first be cleared up before any certain conclusions

can be drawn.

All the photographs show clearly that the luminosity of the metallic particles

is a plienomenon subsequent to the discharge proper which takes place through the

air. Even close to the pole the brightest parts of the metal lines are displaced, as
compared with the brightest part of the air line. If we could fix our attention

on a point halfway between two zinc poles we should see this point flash out

twice with a dark interval between the luminosities. At the moment the spark

passes, the air becomes luminous, and remains so for a period, which, in our

·experiments, did not exceed ttooooo ^^ ^ second.  After an interval of about

__!__ part the zinc molecules arrive at the centre of the spark, and remain

luminescent for an appreciable time with diminishing intensity. The numbers

are of course approximate, as they must depend on the intensity of the spark.

The photographs submitted had been enlarged about five times, but a few

prints taken from the original negatives were also shown.

li. A Reduction q/ Boivland's Value of the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat
    to the Paris Hydrogen Scale. Btj Wm. S. Day, Fh.D., Columbia

       University.

     The measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat made by Professor
Henry A. Rowland at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1877-79 ^
is probably the best one that has thus lar been made in which the heat was pro-
duced by the expenditure of mechanical energy. Later careful determinations
by electrical methods, however, give results higher by about one part in four
hundred. The discrepancy may be due to errors in the measurement of energy or
in the measurement of temperature. Rowland's measurement of temperature was
based on comparisons made between an air thermometer and three Baudin
mercurial thermometers, by which he reduced his measurements to the absolute
thermo-dynaraic scale. It' was the object of the investigation described here to
compare these thermometers with the hydrogen scale of the International Bureau
of Weights and Measures at Sevres, near Paris, and make a recalculation of his

value of the mechanical equivalent accordingly.
     For this purpose three Tonnelot thermometers, which had been carefully studied

at the International Bureau, and compared with their standards at several points
of the scale, were obtained and compared with the three principal thermometers
used by Rowland in his experiment. These comparisons were made in a horizontal
comparison tank, designed and constructed for the purpose. Rowland's thermo-
meters were originally compared and used in a vertical position, but the horizontal

position was chosen for these comparisons for several reasons of a practical nature.
The pressure coefficients of tha thermometers were measured, however, and a
pressure correction was applied to each reading. In all other respects the attempt

was made to use Rowland's thermometers in the way in which he used them.
     The zeros of the Tonnelot thermometers were determined immediately after

each measurement at any given temperature. The ice used in taking the zeros was
artificial ice, and was very pure. The thermometers were always read in taking
zeros, and in the comparison tank, by means of a reading telescope and micrometer.

     From the comparisons made, corrections were obtained for each of Rowland's
thermometers, which, when applied to their indications reduced to the absolute
scale by the tables given in his paper on the mechanical equivalent, would make
them agree with the Paris hydrogen scale. From these corrections, Rowland's
value of the mechanical equivalent was recalculated, taking into account each
individual experiment, the thermometers used in it, and the number of observations
made with each thermometer. The original values and the corrected values found
in this way are compared at several temperatures in the following table. The
numbers are in the C.G.S. system and hydrogen scale, and represent the number of
ergs required to raise the temperature of one gram of water one degree on the

liydrogen scale.

at 15°, 20°, and 25°, by his value at 15°, and do tlie same for Griffiths' values, we

get in each case as quotients the numbers 1, 0-998, 0'997/
     This seems to indicate that the discrepancy between Rowland's results and those

obtained electrically is not one of thermometry, but an error in the measurement of

energy, possibly in the standards of electrical resistance, or of electromotive force.

     [A note concerning these comparisons appeared in the Johns Hopkins University
Circular for June 1897. The corrected values for the mechanical equivalent given
in it differ a little from those given above, owing to a slight error iu the method

used at first in reducing the comparisons.]

2. On the Solution of the C^ihic Equation. By Alexander Macfarlanb.

In a paper recently contributed to the American Institute of Electrical

Engineers - the author showed that the two roots of a quadratic equation may

always be viewed as a pair of conjugate complex quantities, either circular or

hyperbolic. The real roots can be viewed as hyperbolic complex quantities. In

this paper it is shown how the two binomials which occur in Cardan's formula

may be treated as complex quantities, either  circular or hyperbolic                                                                                                     and a general

method is given for deducing all the roots of the cubic, whether the formula is

reducible or apparently irreducible. The trigonometrical meaning is shown of the

two non-real roots in the reducible case : they involve the cosine of an angle,

which is partly circular, partly hyperbolic.

to inclose eacli product in brackets, and to indicate tbe nature of the products by
the kind of bracket used, viz., round brackets for the scalar-product, square brackets
for the vector-product. Thus, if small Greek letters denote vectors

         (a/3) = scalar-product,
         [a/3] = vector-product.

Then is

         («^) = (/3a); [a/3]=-[/3al.

The product (aa) is denoted by a".

If sums of vectors are tq be multiplied, the factors are separated by a vertical

line . Thus the products of a + /3 into y are written (a + /3 y), Sec. Then is

     For these factors we have the products (n[/3y]) and [a[/3y]]. In the former the
law of association holds, and the square brackets may be left out, so that

         (a^y) = (a[/3y]) = ([a/3]y).

     This is the volume of the parallelepiped, with a, /3, y as edges.                                                   ={a[3y)  is the
condition that a, (3, and y lie in a plane.

     There is, besides, the formula

                                                  [a[/3y]] = (ay)3-(a,3)y.

      These formulna contain the whole of the algebra of vectors as far as products

are concerned. Division may be altogether avoided. But it is sometimes con-

venient to introduce the reciprocal to a vector a, --viz., by a~'- (not ) is under-

The author adopts Oliver Heaviside's proposal of calling a vector whose magni-

tude or tensor is the ?uimberl,ai\ ' ort ' (from orientation). Hence if a is an
ort, then is =a'- l, not the laiit of le7i(/t/i, but the 7umibej- 1.

     The author also adopts Maxwell's right-handed sj-stem : ai3y, taken in cyclical

order, form a right-handed system if standing in a and looking towards /3, the

third vector y points to the left. The thumb, index-finger, and middle-finger,
when spread out so as not to lie in a plane, form on the right hand a right-handed

system, but on the left a left-handed.

   A right-handed system of three vectors mutually at right angles is called a

right system.                        denotes generally by 'i, in, «3. The position

     Another notation found convenient is in connection with Hamilton's differential

operator v (called nahla by Maxwell). Being of the nature of a vector, it com-

bines with a vector-function »;, according to scalar- or to vector-multiplication,
forming (v;) and [ v?]- In the former the brackets can often be left out. For
the latter it is convenient to use a special symbol, viz., v, with an arrow-head put

on top of it. As this requires a special type, formulae involving it are given on a
sheet reproduced from writing. This new symhol is called the vector-nabla. It

is a symbol for Maxwell's curl.

then the flow takes place between surfaces represented by this equation. Thus

we can consider separately the flow in the two-dimensional sheet between consecu-

tive surfaces C and C + 80 ; and on the understanding that the equation of con-

tinuity is satisfied, the lines of this flow will be obtained by equating a stream func-

any other curve PBQ, provided there is no sink in the region between these curves

Pinto which fluid can disappear. Thus the flow across any curve connecting and

Q Fmust be a function of the coordinates of these points, say (P, Q) ; further, since
PQthe flow across  is the sum of those across PB and BQ, this function must be of

the form V'(Q) - y}r(P). If therefore r denote at each point the thickness of the

     This argument admits of immediate extension to hyper-space involving any

number n of Cartesian coordinates. In that case a knowledge of w -- 2 integrals

determines an equal number of systems of hyper-surfaces along which the flow

takes place ; these divide the region into two-dimensional sheets, the flow in each

of which takes place independently and is determined by a stream function, as above,

         9. Increase of Segmental Vibrations iyi Aluminium Violins.
                                 By Dr. A. Springer.

     Continued experiments made with aluminium sound boards have verified the
statements made by the author tive years ago, that aluminium possesses acoustical
properties more closely allied to those of wood than those of metals. Metals in
general give rise to comparatively continuous and uniform maintenance of higher
upper partial tones, frequently inharmonic to the prime, making the tone ex-
tremely penetrating and unmusical. In wood the mass is small, the natural

structure irregular, being full of countless interstices, the elasticity comparatively

imperfect causing the higher proper tones to rapidly die away. Aluminium not
only possesses the latter property, but to a much more marked degree; on
account of its lightness and probably intermolecular friction the higher upper
partials require special construction of a sound board to become audible. In wooden
instruments provision must be made to prevent the bass notes from entering into

segmental vibrations detrimental to upper partials, thereby giving a dull purity of

tone, lacking in brilliancy. To avoid this effect the author was obliged to depart
from the fixed rules adopted by violin makers and work in a manner diametrically

opposed to them.
     The author showed by means of open model an aluminium cross section under

the bridge instead of bass bar and a reinforcement of centre of the belly and back,
by which means the segmental vibrations are produced.

     After the paper was read a violinist played on one of the instruments exhibited,

illustrating the various points discussed.

  3. Monthly and Annual Rainfall in the British Emjnre, 1877 to 1896.
               By .John Hopkinson, F.R.Met.Soc, Assoc.Inst.C.E.

     Nearly twenty-four years ago there appeared in ' The Colonies ' a letter from

Mr, W. Sowerby suggesting that residents in the British Colonies should be

invited to contribute notes and queries on natural objects. This was followed by
a letter from Mr. G. J. Symons, F.R.S., adding a similar plea on behalf of
Meteorology. These suggestions met with the approval of the Editor of 'The
Colonies,' and he invited the Directors of the principal Colonial Observatories to
supply monthly reports of meteorological observations, and arranged with Mr.
Symons to supervise them.

     The first table published was for January 1874, and contained reports from
sixteen meteorological stations in the British Empire. The tables were continued
to June 1881, after which date they have appeared in Symons' 'Monthly
Meteorological Magazine.' In the table for .December 1896 are records from
eighteen stations, but only seven of these are survivals from January 1874. The
rainfall at ten of these stations can be carried back for at least twenty years, and
                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                       565

that at two for at least ten years. The ten stations with a twenty years' record
are liondon, England (Camden Square); Port Louis, Mauritius; Calcutta and
Bombay, India; Colombo, Ceylon; Adelaide and Melbourne, Australia; Welling-

ton, New Zealand ; and Toronto and Winnipeg, Canada ; the two with a ten years

record are Malta and Kingston, Jamaica.

In a series of tables are given the mean monthly nnd annual rainfall and

number of days on whicli at least O'Ol inch of rain fell at these twelve stations,

and also the maximum and minimum monthly and annual rainfall and number ot

Adays of rain.  summary of these twelve tables is then given. The means in

this table are those of the ten stations with records for twenty years, but the

extremes are those for the whole of the twelve stations. This table is followed by

a summary of the yearly rainfall at the twelve stations.
     It must not be "inferred that the rainfall at the places selected represents the

mean rainfall of the countries in which they are .situated. These places are in

most cases the principal towns in those countries. Nor are the extremes of the
rainfall in the British Empire represented. But it is believed that no previous
attempt has been made to ascertain the mean rainfall at nearly so many as ten
widely distributed places in the British Empire for nearly so long a period as twenty
consecutive and concurrent years. The observations, moreover, have been taken
in an entirely uniform manner, and are believed to be thoroughly trustworthy, the

results being strictly comparable one with another.

   A few observations are then made on the rain.''all at the various places, and

finally a summary of the principal results is given.

     Throughout the British Empire, so far as appears from these observations, the

mean rainfall is least in February and greatest in July, increasing every month
from February to July, and decreasing every month from July to February. There
may be no rain at some one or more of these rainfall stations in any month in the
year up to six months in succession. The heaviest fall in any month was 47'64
inches at Bombay, in July 1878, and only here has there been rain on every day

in any month. In Malta, in 1895, the rainfall was only 11-38 inches; at Colombo,

in 1878, it was 139'70 inches. In Malta, in 1888, there were only 59 days of

rain ; in Mauritius, in 1893, there were 241 wet days.

     If the twenty years be divided into four periods of five years each it will be

found that the mean annual rainfall at the ten stations baa been as follows :^In
the first period 47-15 iiiches on 150 days; in the second period 44'67 inches on

147 days; in the third period 44-21 inches on 155 days; in the fourth period

44-15 inches on 151 days. This does not show much deviation except in the first
period (1877-81). This was an exceptionally wet period in England, and now

appears to have been generally wet. The mean annual rainfall for the first ten

years was 45-92 inches on 149 days, and for the last ten years 44-67 inches on 153

days. For the whole period it was 45-29 inches on 151 days.

In this account of the rainfall at a few meteorological stations in the British

Empire, the effects of the seasons have been altogether neglected. Six of the

stations with records for twenty years are north of the equator and four are south

of it, not a very great inequality. In England the wettest period is nearly the

same as in New Zealand, but it happens to be in the summer and autumn in
England when in New Zealand it is winter and spring. And taking each place

individually there seems to be very little correspondence between the rainfall and

the season. It does not appear to be the succession of the seasons which causes
the rainfall to increase generally each month from February to July and to

decrease each month from July to February, although the very heavy rainfall at
Bombay in June and July tells much in making those months appear to be so wet

on the average throughout the Empire.

    With a larger number of stations any such disturbing influence as this would

be neutralised, and it may be worthy of consideration whether it might not be

well to appoint a small Committee of the British Association to collect and digest

statistics of the rainfall from a large number of places in the British Empire.

indicate a way to detect and explain a great nmny peculiarities of our climate.

Many of these have hitherto either not been paid attention to, or have been con-

sidered as slight anomalies ; yet they seem to be most permanent and important

features.

   A few of these anomalies--for instance, one consisting of two unimportant

--maxima, separated by a more or less apparent minimum in April spread over the

whole of Europe. Is it altogether impossible that one or more of such features
are not confined within the limits of Europe ? Should any of them be found to
prevail over a whole hemisphere, or farther still, ought we not to look beyond the

earth for their origin ?

    Other anomalies, however, have a smaller range. Two remarkable instances of

this are two very pronounced mimima which characterise the summer in western

Europe. The more important one at the end of July, separating two nearly equal

maxima in the middle of June and the middle of August, is strongly prominent on

the coasts of the Atlantic and the North Sea, and slowly decreases in the centre of

Europe, dying out at the Russian frontier. The other one, a similar minimum,

about a month earlier, is also strongest on the north-western shores of our continent,

but dies out much sooner : it can hardly be detected beyond the eastern frontier of

France. Here we have, I venture to aihrm, two effects of causes which, whatever

they may he, must lie to the west of us, in the Atlantic or beyond.

    Another feature, on the contrary, a minimum in the second half of December,

with a very decided rise of temperature towards the end of the year, which is very

characteristic for the extreme east of our continent, dies out long before it could
Wereach the middle of Russia.
                                 owe this effect apparently to something in Asia,

·or beyond.
     I forego to discuss in this short abstract some other advantages arising from

a systematic discussion of temperature curves. Such are a possible indication of
something being wrong in the exposures of thermometers : the possibility of getting
very good results with what would hitherto have been considered absolutely
insufficient material; the possibility of giving a near approximation to normal

temperatures for any station a priori, &c.
     But what I think is principally shown is

     (1) That it is not so much the general knowledge of the temperature of a place

that is interesting as the irregularities, even such small ones as one is tempted at

first to ascribe to errors of observation or such like causes

     (2) That here is an excellent way to find out, not indeed what the ultimate

causes of such irregularities are, but in which direction to look for them. One
fflance at the diagrams generally instantly shows that some interesting anomaly,

such as I gave a few instances of, originates to the west, the east, or the south of

our continent.

                                           Toronto Observatory.

    For many years fishermen and sailors upon the great lakes have noticed with

intense interest the rapid rise and fall of the water, most marked at the head

of shallow lagoons or bays. The phenomenon is not uncommon, having been

ably studied upon the Swiss lakes by Professor Forel and his predecessors,

Duillier, De Saussure, and others, where it obtained the name of ' Seiche,' and also

by  Mr.  Russell,  F.R.S., upon  Lake  George,  New  South  Wales. The                             writer's
                                                                                                _

attention was first drawn to this subject last summer, while in the vicinity of Lake

Huron, where a set of observations were taken. Upon returning to Toronto, b)^

permission of Mr. Stupart, Director of the Meteorological Service, a simple instru-

ment was devised for automatically recording these oscillations, and was set u]d at

the mouth of the Humber River, near Toronto. Shortly afterwards a similar
568 REPORT-- 1897.

instrument w&s placed at the west end of the lake at the Burlington Canal. The
records from these two instruments, when studied in conjunction with the Obser-
vatory synoptic weather charts and barograph traces, have revealed many interest-
ing points. Last January, to obtain a better knowledge of the smaller barometric

movements, a simple form of self-recording air barometer was constructed, seven-

teen times more sensitive than the mercurial. This again has recently been super-

--seded by a combined self-recordingwater-level instrument and air barometer that

is, both pens record upon the same time-sheet where an hour equals one inch and
one complete revolution of the cylinder equals twenty-four hours.

     The following are some of the results deduced from the records :
     1. That the longitudinal and transverse 'Seiche ' movements are very mai'ked

preceding and during storms primarily due to differences of atmospheric pressure

over the extremities of the lake, but greatly augmented when the gale strikes the
water Euri'ace. The mean time interval of longitudinal ' Seiche ' is four hours and

forty-nine minutes ; the transverse, forty-five minutes.
     2. There is a marked agreement between the time intervals of the smaller lake

undulations and those found upon the corresponding sensitive barograph traces,

both showing a predominance of twenty-minute intervals.

     3. These smaller lake undulations are due to atmospheric waves which are set
up along the boundary surfaces of different air strata when travelling in opposite

directions, the existence of which have been so clearly demonstrated by the late

Professor von Helmholtz in his mathematical papers read before the floyal

Prussian Academy of Sciences at Berlin in 1889 and 1890.

     4. The action of these atmospheric waves upon the surface of the water tends
to form minute undulations, which increase in amplitude as they move into bays,

&c., where the water becomes shallower, until finally they assume the proportions

as recorded upon the instrument.

     5. It appears, from a careful study of the Canadian ocean tidal records, placed

at the writer's disposal through the kindness of Mr. W. Bell Dawson, Director of

the Tidal Survey, in conjunction with the synoptic weather charts, that the

secondary undulations found upon them may also be due to similar atmospheric

action.

     6. Marked rapid and large undulations often occur during the autumn and
winter months upon both instruments when the barometer is actually rising and
fine weather prevails throughout Ontario. At such times an area of low pressure,

or cyclone, is situated over the south or south-western States, which usually moves

over or near to the lake region. In such cases the recorded atmospheric waves are

due to the lower, denser air of the anticyclone, moving towards the south-western

cyclone, along whose upper boundary surface huge waves, extending to the earth,
are set up by the rapidly opposing upper poleward current. The mean velocity of
this upper current in summer is sixty miles per hour, and in winter one hundred

and ten miles per hour. On the other hand, during the approach of an anticyclone,

attended by fine weather and westerly winds, these lake undulations become

extremely small, because the lower air moves in approximately the same direction

as the upper poleward current.

     7. The direct action of these air waves upon the surface of the lake is clearly
shown during the passage of a thunder shower. As an instance, on March. 8 last,

during the passage of several successive huge atmospheric ' billows,' the water rose

8A inches in ten minutes, then fell 10^ inches in filteen minutes, followed by the

IHphenomenal rise of  inches in fifteen minutes.

8. These records graphically explain the cause of those erroneously termed

' tidal waves ' which occur upon the lakes, and also tend to solve the problem

respecting the larger waves encountered at apparently regular intervals. From
information obtained from fishermen on Lakes Eiie, Ontario, and Huron a twenty-

minute interval appears to have been frequently observed between these waves.

     As these peculiar undulations occur upon all waters it is hoped the study of
them will become more universal, and the time not far distant when instruments

similar to those described will be adopted throughout the scientific world.

8. Progress of the Exploration of the Air with Kites at Blue Hill

     Observatory, Mass., U.S.A. By A. Lawrence Rotcii, S.B., A.M.^

      F.R.Met.Soc, Director.

   A preliminary report on the subject was presented to this Section at the-

Liverpool meeting; of the British Association, and, in consequence of the successful
results which had been obtained at Blue Hill, this method of exploring; the free
air was endorsed by the International Meteorological Conference which met in
Paris last September.

     Many improvements in the kites and apparatus have been effected during the
past year, and, through the aid afforded by a grant from the Hodgkins Fund of the

Smithsonian Institution, the first steam-reeling apparatus for kites has been con-

structed. Since August 1894, when an instrument recording continuously and
graphically its indication was for the first time lifted by kites, 130 records of

barometric pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity, or of wind velocity,.
have been obtained up to the extreme altitude of 8,740 feet above Blue Hill.
This height, which was attained last October, is believed to be the greatest to
which a meteorograph has been raised by kites (see 'Nature,' December 17, 1896).
Nine records have been obtained more than a mile above the hill at all seasons of
the year, both in fine and in stormy weather.

     The data have been discussed and are about to be published in the ' Annals of
the Harvard College Observatory.' They furnish some important facts concerning-
the changes of temperature, relative humidity and wind in the free air, under
varying atmospheric conditions, and constitute the most thorough exploration of

the lower mile of free air ever made in any manner. Since warm and cold waves
appear to commence in the upper air it seems probable that daily observations with

kites would aid in weather forecasting, and the experiment is to be tried by the
United States Weather Bureau at several stations. Meanwhile the investigation
is being continued at the Blue Hill Observatory, with the hope of obtaining data,
two or three miles above the earth, and kites are serving to supplement the-
measurements of the heights of clouds made by the methods prescribed by the
International Cloud Committee.

Bureau at Washington of the availability of kites for making daily observations,

in the free air.

    He then described and showed a full-sized model of the improved kites as nov»

employed by the Weather Bureau, and referred to methods of bridling the kite to
secure approximately constant pull upon the string under wide variations in the
wind force ; also to the use of a * safety line ' upon the kite, corresponding in
function to the well-known fusible plug in electrical circuits.

   A brief outline of the mechanics of the kite was given, and remarks were made

upon the flying of kites in tandem.
     In conclusion the results thus far attained were discussed.

Flache erzeugte Fleck macht daher Schwingungen, welche in einem rotirenden
Spiegel analysirt werden konnen. Wirken auf den Kathodenstrahl zwei unter
einem rechten Winkel gekreuzte Felder, so entstehen Lissajous'sche Curven,
welche gestatten Phasenverschiebungen der Felder in Folge von Selbstinduction,

entstehen musste, wenn der Kathodenstrahl ein beweglicher Stromleiter ware;

ob aber dieses Gebilde entsteht durch eine ausserordentlich rasche Rotation oder

ob es ruht, ist unentschieden. Von Interesse ist es, dass das Magnetfeld der Erde

            2. Note on an Electrical Oscillator. By Nicola Tesla.

     The instrument exhibited belongs to a novel class of electrical transformers, the
primary of whicli is operated by the oscillatory discharge of a condenser. The
above name seems, therefore, particularly appropriate.

     The condenser is charged from any suitable, direct or alternating, current

source.

    By observing the well-known conditions governing the oscillatory discharge of

the condenser, which have been established by Lord Kelvin, and selecting properly
the physical constants of the primary or " discharge circuit," extremely rapid oscilla-
tions in ^is circuit are obtained, which set up, by inductive action, corresponding
high-frequency current impulses in the secondary circuit.

     The fundamental disturbances in the primary circuit are produced either by

simply adjusting the quantities concerned, so that the average rate of supply of
energy to the condenser shall be inferior to the average rate of discharge, or else
positively-acting mechanical means, irrespective of such adjustment, are employed
to periodically open and close the circuit.

     The circuit connections in the instrument exhibited are indicated in a diagram,
while a photograph showed the actual arrangement of the parts in the instrument.

     Referring to these illustrations, the condenser is contained in a box, upon
which is mounted in front the circuit controller, consisting of spring contacts, and
a self-induction coil. The latter, designated as a '· charging coil," serves at the
same time to raise the pressure of the source to any value desired for charging
the condenser. This is an important practical advantage, as it enables the
capacity of the latter to be reduced, so that it need not be more than a few
per cent, of that otherwise required for an equivalent conversion of energy.
Besides, the smaller the capacity, the quicker is the oscillation, and the shorter need
be the high-tension secondary wire.

     The primary or discharge circuit surrounding the secondary coil or coils is
formed of a few turns of copper ribbon mounted on the top of the box behind the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  571

" charging coil," all connections being as short as possible, so as to reduce, as much

as it is practicable, both the resistance and self-induction of this circuit.

     On the front side of the box containing the condenser there are mounted two
binding posts for connection with the lines, two small fuses, and a reversing switch.
In addition two adjusting screws are provided for raising and lowering the iron

core within the charging coil as a convenient means for varying within consider-
able limits the current of supply, and regulating thereby the discharge of the
secondary circuit. In adjusting the core the left-hand screw should be unscrewed

 tirst, as it performs merely the function of a check-nut.

     The mode of operation may be explained in current language as follows :--
     At the start the spring contacts being closed and the condenser practically

short-circuited, a strong current passes through the " charging coil," attracting the

armature fastened to the lower spring, and separating the contacts. Upon this the

energy stored in this coil, assuming the form of a high-tension discharge, rushes
into the condenser, charging the same to a high potential. The current through

the coil now subsiding, the attraction exerted upon the armature ceases, the spring
reasserts itself and again closes the contacts. With the closing of the latter the

condenser is discharged through the primary, and simultaneously a strong current
from the source of supply again rushes through the charging coil, and energy is

stored for the next charge of the condenser, this process being repeated as often as

the spring opens and closes the contacts.

    By means of this simple arrangement certain advantages over ordinary coils

are secured, the chief being the absence of tine wire in the secondary, the quality

of the effects produced, and efficiency.
     The photograph, showing the instrument in action with two loops of cotton-

covered wire attached to the discharge rods, conveys an idea of the pressures
obtained. The outer wire loop was in the experiment only 22 inches in diameter,

to enable its being properly shown in the print, but it could have been much
larger, since two parallel wires, 15 feet long, may be stretched from the secondary

terminals of the instrument, and practically the entire space between them, 3^

--inches wide, is seen in the dark covered with fine streamers that is, a surface of
--over 4 square feet and yet the energy taken from the supply circuit during the

performance is less than 35 watts. It is practicable, by the use of the principle

described, to obtain sparks of 1 foot in length with an expenditure of energy of

less than 10 watts.

          3. An Electric Curve Tracer. By Professor E. B. Rosa.

     One of the most interesting and fruitful methods of investigation of alternate
current phenomena is the tracing of the forms and phases of current and electro-
motive force waves. But the practicability of this method of investigation and
testing has been seriously limited by the great labour of obtaining the curves, and
the insufficient accuracy of the curves when obtained. Although various methods
are employed for determining the quantities from which to plot the waves of
current and electromotive force, yet in nearly every case an instantaneous coutact-
maker is used, and the contact brush is advanced by hand, step by step, settings
being made on a graduated cii-cle. Headings are taken on a voltmeter, electro-
meter, or galvanometer, and subsequently points are plotted out on cross-section
paper, and a smooth curve drawn through them. Because of the great labour
involved, comparatively few points are usually found, and hence the curves are
only approximately determined. To reduce the labour and increase the speed of
working would enable a greater number of points to be determined, and so give
more faithful representations of current curves. This could be accomplished by
some arrangement that would do the most laborious part of the work mechani-

cally, and, if possible, automatically. Hence, if successive settings of the brush of

the contact-maker could be made quickly and easily, and the curve printed out
automatically, so as to eliminate the necessity of taking readings and plotting the
points, the thing would be done. It was to accomplish this end that I had an
--572 REPORT 1897.

instrument constructed last year in our college machine shop. The instrument
worked well and gave some very elegant results. But there appeared in its use
several practical defects which experience showed how to remedy, and this year I
have constructed a new instrument, which may be called an Electric Curve
Tracer, and which will now be briefly described.

     The instrument consists of three parts: (1) the Contact-Maker, (2) the
Measuring Selenoid, and (3) the Recording Cylinder. The Contact-Maker is
joined by a rod and flexible couplings to the shaft of the dynamo, which produces
the current to be delineated, or to a synchronous motor which is driven by that
current. Hence the shaft of the contact-maker, and with it a hard rubber disc

six inches in diameter, revolves with the speed of the armature of the alternator.

The brush which, once in every revolution, makes contact with a knife-edge let;
into the edge of the hard rubber disc, is carried by an arm which is advanced step
by step by a ratchet wheel and gearing. The pawl of the ratchet is actuated by
an electro-magnet, and the step of the brush is half of one degree for each tooth

of the ratchet wheel. Any number of teeth from one to six may be taken at each

step, according to the position of the stop. The current through the electro-
magnet, which advances the brush, is made by the operator at the measuring and
recording apparatus, which may be at a distance.

     The Measuring Solenoid consists of a single layer of insulated wire wound

                                                                     Fig. 1.

upon a hard rubber rod 80 centimeters in length ; along one element of this

Asolenoid the insulation is removed.  current from two or three storage cells

Apasses through the solenoid from     to B, and by means of a voltmeter and

A Brheostat the difference of potential between  is kept constant. This
                                       and

spiral has so much greater length of wire than a single wire, such as that on a

slide wire bridge, that it can maintain a much greater difference of potential, and

serves the purpose better than a single wire would do. Let the current to be

Wedelineated pass through the non-inductive resistance C D.  measure the instan-

Dtaneous difference of potential at the terminals of C by matching it against the

Aknown difference of potential of a portion of B. This is done by joining Q,
A Athe middle point of B to D, and P, a sliding contact on B, to C, through the

instantaneous contact-maker and a sensitive, dead-beat D'Arsonval galvanometer.

PWhen is so adjusted that there is no deflection of the galvanometer, the poten-

Dtial difference between C and is the same as that between P and Q, and the

Platter is proportional to the distance Q. If the current at the instants of con-

Ptact is from C to D, then the potential of C is higher than D, and will be on the

Q D Pleft of ; if the current is from
to C, is on the right of Q. In either case

the strength of the current is proportional to the difference of potential between

C and D, and therefore to the distance P Q. At each step of the brush contact is

made at a later instant in the period of the wave ; the current has a different

value, and hence P must be moved to keep the galvanometer deflection zero. The

Qspiral being of constant diameter, and uniformly wound, these distances P give
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.            573

accurate values of the current. Using these distances as ordinates, and the
corresponding angular positions of the brush on the revolving contact-maker as
abscissas, a curve of current can be plotted, its scale being, of course, determined

Dby the value of the constant resistance C through which the current passes,

and the value of the constant potential difference betw^een the ends of the

solenoid.

     But to eliminate the labour of taking scale readings and plotting the curves it

                                                                   Fig. 2.

Pis arranged to plot them out automatically as the successive settings of along
Athe solenoid are made.
                         pautagraph has one end fixed at P', and the other

Gattached to the sliding contact P. The bar E  of the pautagraph carries a

printing point F. As P is moved to and fro upon the Fsolenoid, travels to and

Afro along a b, parallel to B. And since P'/ is one-fifth of P'P, the excursions

Fof are one-fifth of those of P. When each setting of P has been made, the

printing point F is depressed by an electromagnet, and a dot is made upon a sheet

of cross-section paper underneath. Between the successive settings the paper is

advanced a step perpendicularly to a b. In this way a current curve is plotted to

Da known scale, and by repeating the process with other currents through C (as,

for example, the secondary current, due to the induction of the first one, or au

electromotive force current) several waves may be delineated on the same sheet,

each to a known scale, and their relative phases shown by their relative positions.

In order to advance the paper conveniently by equal steps it is wrapped upon

a cylinder, which is advanced step by step by a ratchet wheel and gearing, actuated

by an electromagnet, precisely as the contact-maker is operated. These two

electromagnets, and that on the pautagraph, are controlled by the same key, and

all work together. Closing the key causes the steel point F to be thrown down

upon a type-writer ribbon, which prints a point on the paper beneath ; it also

causes the armatures of the two driving magnets to be attracted, and the pawls to

slip back over one or more teeth of the ratchet, until the armatures strike their

respective stops. Breaking the circuit allows the printing point to be lifted by a

spring, and the armature of the driving magnets to be drawn back to their initial

positions by their springs. The two pawls at this time advance their respective

ratchets ; one advancing the brush of the contact-maker, and the other the

cylinder carrying the record sheet, ready for a second point. The sliding contact

AP is moved by means of a cord passing over pulleys at the ends of B, and wound

over a small drum underneath the solenoid, the drum being turned by means of a

large milled head. The operator turns this drum with one hand, and closes the

key with the other, keeping his eye constantly on the galvanometer scale. With

a quick, dead-beat galvanometer the settings are made very rapidly, and it is no

unusual performance to print off a curve at the rate of twenty or more points per

minute.

If the curve closely approximates to a sine curve, and there are no high

harmonics present, the points may be further apart, and the ratchet of the record-

ing cylinder advanced four or six teeth at a time. If there are upper harmonics.
574 REPORT-- 1897.

and one wishea a faithful representation of the curve, two teeth are taken at a
time, and 180 points plotted in one single wave-length, which extends half-wave
around the recording cylinder.

     If the generator is a two-pole machine, four teeth will be taken at one step on
the contact-maker and two on the recording cylinder. If it is a four-pole machine,
an equal number of teeth will he taken on each. If it is an eight-pole machine,

one tooth is taken on the contact-maker and two on the recording cylinder, and

so on. In each case the resulting curves will he drawn to the same horizontal

scale.

     Special attachments are provided for printing copies of original curves, for

--making curves of magnetisation and hysterisis curves, and also for taking power

curves in the latter case not by multiplying corresponding ordinates of current

and electromotive force curves, but plotting directly from the settings of the

contact piece P.

The accuracy of the work of the instrument is illustrated by curves, representing

the current flowing into a condenser from the secondary of a transformer (which
were exhibited). The capacity of the condenser for the second curve is double

that of the first, other circumstances being the same. The curves show a little
more than a wave length and a half of the fundamental, but the character of the

curves is determined by their upper harmonics, the natural period of the condenser-

transformer circuit being such as to amplify very small upper harmonics in the

electromotive force of the dynamo, which had a toothed armature. In the second

curve the period is larger (because the capacity is greater), and the free vibrations,
which are superposed on the fundamental, are accordingly fewer in number.
Comparing one half-wave with another, it is evident that the curve-tracer has
done its work faithfully. Without a large number of points in the space of one

wave we should fail to apprehend the true character of such curves. The instru-

ment lends itself to a great variety of purposes. One can study the actions and
reactions in dynamos and motors, of single and polyphase varieties ; in transformers

of all types, and of special devices in practical or abstract research. By means

of a two-part commutator on the shaft of the contact-maker the oscillating cur-

rents of condenser charges and discharges can be delineated, and the period

measured. Curves showing the rise and fall of current in inductive circuits when
the current is made and broken can be drawn, and the self-induction thereby

measured.

4. On the Use of the Interferometer in the Study of Electric Waves.
                   By G. F. Hull, University of Chicago.

An interferometer for electric waves, constructed after Michelson's form, -was

Aused to analyse electric radiation.  Branly receiver (small nails in oil) and

different forms of Righi's vibrators were used. The following conclusions were

arrived at :

     1. The interference curve depends on both vibrator and receiver, and the

influence of each of these varies.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  575

     2. The logarithmic decrement of the receiver is of the same order of magnitude

as that of the vibrator.

    3. The chief component of the radiation and the period of the receiver may be

determined by a number of interference curves.
     4. The receiver could be used to analyse the radiation, where the oscillations

are but slightly damped.
     5. The error in determining the wave-length and the index of refraction need

not exceed 1 per cent.

 5. An Instrument for Becording Rapidly Varying Potential Differences
                        and Currents.^ By W. Duddell.

    The methods and instruments generally employed for this purpose may be
divided into two classes, viz. ' contact or point methods ' and * continuous

methods.'

    This latter class may be subdivided according to the nature of the moving

part acted on by the varying current.
     The present instrument belongs to that division in which the moving part

consists of wires carrying the current to be measured, and in its present form was
first suggested by Blondel.

     The instrument consists essentially of a pair of phosphor bronze strips stretched
tight in a strong magnetic field, to the middle points of which a small mirror ia

fixed.

    The current flows up one strip and down the other, causing one to move forward
and the other to move back, and thus turning the mirror through a small angle.
The source of light used is an arc lamp and a system of lenses, the motion of the spot

being recorded on a falling photographic plate, or observed in a rotating mirror.
     The necessary damping is obtained by immersing the strips in oil and adjusting

the temperature until it is correct.

     In the instrument shown two pairs of strips and a fixed mirror were used, sO'
that both the current and P.D. curves, as well as the zero line, were traced on the
plate at the same time, thus giving, as well as the two curves, their phase ditl'erence
and the periodicity from the known velocity of the plate.

     The free periodic time of the strips and mirror is about ^^xr sec, and a current
of jJjj cm. amp. gives a deflection of r53 cm. at a screen distance of 136 cms.

     The chief advantages of the instrument are the low self-induction and resistance^

as well as the critical damping.

9. On the Relations between Arc Curves and Crater Ratios with Cored
                    Positive Carbons. By Hertua Ayrton.

    When an arc is burning between a solid negative carbon and a positive of given

diammeetteerr,, the P.D. between the carbons varies according as the positive carbon is
cored or solid

                                 ' Published in the Electrician. Sept. 10, 18J)7.
576 REPORT-- 1897

        When the Length of the Arc is kept Constant and the Current is varied.

     1. The P.D. is in all cases bigber -witli the solid than with the cored carbon.
     2. With a solid carbon the P.D. continually diminishes as the current increases
with a cored carbon the P.D. either diminishes much less than with a solid carbon,
or remains constant for all currents above a given value, or actually increases with
.the current after falling to a minimum.

                Current is kept Constant and the Length of the Arc is Varied.

      1. The P.D. is always higher with solid carbons than with a cored positive car-
ton, but the difference between the two diminishes as the arc increases in length.

     2. The rate of change of P.D. with change of length is constant witJi solid
carbons, but diminishes as the length of the arc increases with a cored positive

carbon.

      3. This rate of change becomes smaller and more nearly constant for all lengths

of arc as the value of the constant current increases.

     4. The P.D. corresponding with length of arc diminishes as the current in-
creases with solid carbons, but increases with the current with a cored positive

carbon.
      These differences can all be accounted for on the hypothesis that icith a given

solid negative carbon and a positive of a given diameter the P.D. required to send a
yiven current through afixed length of arc depends principally, if not entirely, on
the nature of the surface of the crater, being greater or less according as the carbon
of lohich this surface is composed is harder or softer.

     By the term ' area of the crater' is meant the area of the mouth of the crater, or,

etill more accurately, the plane area of that region of the end of the positive carbon
which is sharply cut off from the rest by its peculiar brilliance and whiteness. The
Jirea of the soft carbon in the surface of the crater is taken to be the projection on
the mouth of the crater of that area of the crater that is composed of soft carbon,
and the proportion of soft carbon in the surface of the crater is measured by the
ratio of the area of the soft carbon to the total area of the crater. This ratio for
each current and length of arc will be called its ' soft crater ratio.'

     The ratio of the area of the hard carbon in the surface of the crater to the area
of the crater will be called the 'hard crater ratio.'

                                             Arcs of Constant Length.

     The area of the crater is known to increase as the current increases. With a
·constant length of arc, therefore, when the current is very small the whole of the
crater will be in the core ; as the current increases some hard carbon will be em-

braced by the crater, and the P.D. will therefore, by the hypothesis, be higher than
if the whole crater were of soft carbon. The larger the current the greater will
Ibe the area of the crater, and consequently the greater will be the amount of hard
carbon in its surface ; there will be a tendency of the P.D. to rise on account of
this increasing amount of hard carbon in the crater, which will struggle with its
tendency to fall on account of the increase of the current. According as the one
or other of these tendencies gets the upper hand, or as they exactly counterbalance
one another, will the P.D. increase, diminish, or remain stationary as the cm-rent

increases.

                                                       Constant Currents.

     It has not hitherto been known how the area of the crater varied with the

length of the arc. Hence a very good way of testing the accuracy of my hypo-

thesis suggested itself. The hypothesis was used in conjunction with the curves
connecting P.D. with length of arc for constant currents, to determine what should
"be the form of the curves connecting the area of the crater with the length of the
arc when the current was constant. If these curves were the same as those obtained
from actual measurements of the crater, the presumption would be that the
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.                                                                 577

hypothesis was correct. The comparison was made with very satisfactory results,
-the form of the curves being exactly the same in both cases.

     From the hypothesis and the curves connecting P.D. and length of arc for
constant currents it was deduced that

     1. JVTien a coi-ed positive carbo7i is used and a constant current is Jlowing the

area of the crater must increase as the length of the arc increases.
     2. The change that takes place in the ratio of the soft carbon to the total amount

of carbon in the surface of the crater ivith a given change of length must diminish
as the arc increases in length.

     3. The change that takes place in the ratio of the soft carbon to the total amount
of carbon in the surface of the crater with a given change of length must be smaller,
and the rate of change must becmne more nearly constant for all lengths of arc as

the value of the constant current increases.

     Remembering that the ratio of the area of soft carbon to the area of the crater

Is called the ' soft crater ratio,' these three conditions may be put thus :

     1. With a cored positive carbon, and with a constant current flowing, the area

of the crater must increase, and consequently the soft crater ratio must diminish as

the length of the arc increases.

     2. The change of soft crater ratio with change of length must diminish as the

length of the arc increases.

     3. The change of soft crater ratio with change of length must be the smaller,
·and the rate of change must become the more nearly constant the larger the

current.

     To test the accuracy of these conclusions, and therefore of the hypothesis upon
-which they were founded, measurements of the crater, made on the enlarged image

of the arc in 1893, were used. It was found that straight line laws were obtained

in two ways : (1) by plotting the P.D. for each length of arc, with the correspond-

ing area of the crater with  various  constant  currents                                   (2)  by plotting the current
                                                                                        ;

with the corresponding area of the crater with various constant lengths of arc.

From these two sets of straight lines corrected areas of crater were obtained, from

which the laws connecting the area of the crater and the soft crater ratio with the

length of the arc could be seen more clearly than with the uncorrected areas of

crater.

These laws were exactly what had been predicted. It was found that with a

cored positive and solid negative carbon, and with a constant current flowing

1. The area of the crater did increase, and consequently the soft crater ratio

diminished as the length of the arc increased ; and
     2. The change of soft crater ratio with a given change of length did diminish

as the length of the arc increased ; and
     3. The change of soft crater ratio with a given change of length was smaller,

and the rate of change was more nearly constant the larger the current.

     From the parallel straight lines connecting the area of the crater with the

current for constant lengths of arc three facts were deduced, viz
     1. That with constant lengths of arc the area of the crater, minus a constant

depending on the length of the arc, is proportional to the current.
     2. That the change of area of crater with a given change of length of arc is

'Independent of the value of the current flowing.
      3. That the change of area of crater vrith. a given change of current is inde-

pendent of the length of the arc.

         10. On the Source of Luminosity in the Electric Arc.
                     By H. Crew and O. H. Basquin.

     Three possible causes of luminosity were considered, viz. heat alone, chemical
oction, the electric current. The problem set was to determine the parts which
thermal, chemical, and electric cause, respectively, plays in the electric arc.

1897.                                                                                           pp

     Chemical effects were practically excluded by working the arc in an air-tight
metallic hood, filled with a gas which exercised no chemical action upon the

electrodes. An air-tight glass window in this hood enabled the observer to

examine the arc either with the naked eye or with the spectroscope.
     To exclude the electric current for an instant, and to examine the arc imme-

diately afterwards, the following device was used :

   A high-speed, 100-volt, alternator was employed to feed the arc. But, in

series with the armature and the arc, were placed two interrupters, which cut out
either all the positive or all the negative parts of the alternating current. In

                                                                  Fig. 1.

either case the current was broken just as the current curve crossed the axis of X.
In case the positive currents were cut out, the break occurred at A, A.', A", &c.,

the make at B, B', &c., as indicated in the figure.

    By cutting the current off just as the curve crosses the axis, self-induction

effects are practically avoided.

The intervals of time indicated by the shaded portion of the current curve were

employed to photograph the arc or to examine it with the eye. This examination

was made through openings in a large steel disc of the form indicated in the figure.

Fig. 2.  This occulting screen and the two large interrupter rings were
         placed on a common shaft with the armature of the dynamo.

         The interrupter rings were insulated from the shaft ; each

         had two slate sectors keyed into it, and each carried two brushes

         set 90° apart.

         It was found that, in the case of the iron arc, in an atmos-

         phere of air, oxygen, coal gas, or hydrogen, there are two

         distinct luminosities having very different properties.

              Of these luminosities one is a cloud of light, strongly
         coloured with yellow, and floating at a distance of some milli-
         meters from the electrodes, one of which was an iron rod, the-

other a rotating iron disc.
      This is apparently the ' flame ' of the ordinary carbon arc.
     This yellow cloud persists from one one-hundredth to one two-hundredth of

a second after the current has been broken.
     The other luminosity is the blue sheet of light which most impresses the eye on

looking at the ordinary iron arc.
     This light disappears in less than one five-thousandth part of a second after the

current is cut off. One is certain that the interval during which the blue light
persists is, however, still less than this. For the actual instant at which the
current is shut off is not the instant at which the brush passes on to the slate
sector, but an instant later than this, on account of the spark which remains at

break of current.
     So that, after the arc is broken, practically the only light that remains is this

yellow cloud.

     The light from the red-hot iron poles, giving a continuous spectrum, is, oi

course, here not considered.

[Photographs of the two parts of the arc shown to the section.]

    On making the current the first light to appear is an intense blue right at the

point of contact of the two electrodes. The yellow cloud, the ' flame,' comes later.

We have succeeded in photographing the blue arc of one current before the yellow

cloud of a previous current had died out, thus obtaining the two kinds of arc on

one plate mth a single exposure.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION A.  579

     In hydrogen the luminosity is very much less than in any of the other gases
when the current has been shut off as long as one-thousandth of a second.

      In oxygen the floating cloud is very brilliant. In coal gas it is barely visible,
and of a decidedly reddish hue. In this case the interior of the hood is lined with

a deposit of carbon. Query, Is this red light due to carbon incandescent at the

moment of dissociation from the hydrogen ?
     The spectrum of the blue arc is the ordinary iron-arc spectrum.
     The spectrum of the yellow cloud which persists is also a linear spectrum of

iron ; but the distribution of intensities among the lines is very different indeed
from that of the ordinary u'on arc. The investigation of the difference between
these two spectra when separated in this way is a comparatively easy matter.

This investigation is already under way.

 11. On some JVeto Forms of Gas Batteries and a Neio Carbon-consuming
                         Battery} By Willard E. Case.

     In 1839 Grove announced his invention of the gas battery; he considered it the

most simple arrangement to produce electricity, but not a practical way to generate
electrical energy. He used platinum sponge or platinum black as the absorbent
to fiicilitate the combination of the gases. The following experimental determina-

tions by the author show, as far as they extend, that platinum or its compounds
are not necessary to produce the combination of the gases in the production of
electrical energy, so doing away with one of the most expensive drawbacks to the
gas battery. The experiments also prove that carbon is oxidised to CO.^ at
normal temperature without the application of heat, with the production of

electrical energy.

                                           The Chlorine- Carbon Cell,

   A porous carbon tube-electrode, into which chlorine gas was passed, opposed

to a carbon rod, which had been heated red hot, were placed in hydrochloric acid,

of specific gravity 1-10. An E.M.F. of from 0-50 to 0'64 vole was obtained,

depending on the condition of the carbons.

     The carbon electrodes, after being heated, were placed in distilled water. With
no chlorine gas passing through they had no difference of potential. When gas
was passed into the carbon tube, at slightly above atmospheric pressure, the
E.M.F. gradually increased to 0'44 of a volt at the end of twenty-six hours. On
short circuit, 0-04 of an ampere was obtained, but it dropped rapidly to 0-02. The
internal resistance was very high. The solution was analysed, and found to con-
tain hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide. The same experiment was repeated in
a dark case, to see if the action took place in the absence of light. The chlorine
gas was made in the dark and passed though the electrode. The electromotive

force gradually increased, as in the first case, showing that the action took place

in the dark.

   A carbon electrode, through which chlorine was passed, and a negative plati-

num electrode opposed to it, in dilute hydrochloric acid, gave 0'40 of a volt, but

the electromotive force did not hold up through the voltmeter circuit. Both
electrodes were covered with gas after short-circuiting, and the E.M.F. dropped

to 0-24 of a volt. On shaking the voltage jumped to 0-40.

   A negative carbon electrode was substituted for the negative platinum. It had

been heated red hot and was very porous, the surface soft and rough. The
E.M.F. reached 0-58 of a volt, and gave on short circuit 1-24 ampere, but
dropped slowly to 0-30. The negative carbon electrode was oxidised.

   A platinum electrode in a paper envelope was opposed to powdered carbon in

the bottom of a glass jar in hydrochloric acid, chlorine being passed into the solu-

tion near the platinum. An E.M.F. of 0-60 of a volt, and on short circuit

0-90 ampere, were obtained. Tiie current remained fairly steady. The surface
of each electrode was about forty-five square inches.

    A cell made up as above, but with graphite instead of carbon, gave 0'64 of a

volt, but dropped rapidly on short circuit, the graphite not oxidising fast enough
to give a steady current.

    A dense carbon rod opposed to powdered carbon gave 0-40 of a volt, and on

short circuit 0'20 of an ampere. The rod was encased in filter paper to protect it
from floating particles of powdered carbon, and the chlorine passed into the

 solution near it.

     Two small glass beakers with a carbon rod iu one and a platinum plate in

Uthe other, and containing hydrochloric acid, were connected by an inverted tube.

 When chlorine was passed into the vessel with the platinum, an E.M.F. of
0*48 volt was obtained. When chlorine was passed into the beaker containing

the carbon rod, an E.M.F. of 0-14 was obtained, but it dropped almost immedi-

ately to zero. When chlorine was passed into both beakers, no E.M.F. was

obtained.

     The chemical reaction of the chlorine-carbon cell was as follows

                                      H^O + CI , = 2nci + 0,

the oxygen of the decomposed water attacking the carbon, and hydrochloric acid
and carbon dioxide being formed.

Carbon Monoxide-Chlorine Cell.

Cell made as follows : a glass tube, 2'25-inch bore and G inches long, corked

at each end, with a porous tube, 1 inch outside diameter, passing through the

glass tube and corks, and corked at each end ; carbon rods and gas inlet and outlet

tubes let into each chamber, which were filled with dry animal charcoal previously

treated with hydrochloric acid. The porous tube was saturated with concentrated

hydrochloric acid. Chlorine gas was passed through the outer tube. An E.M.F.

ot 0'18 volt was obtained. When carbon monoxide gas was passed through the

Ainner tube the voltage increased to 0'33 volt.  slight increase of the pressure

of the gases increased the voltage. The glass tube became hot. This reaction

would produce carbon oxychloride.

Marsh Gas- Chlorine \Cell.

Two carbon tube electrodes, three-fourths of an inch in diameter and four inches

long, opposed to one another in a solution of hydrochloric acid, with chlorine

passed into one and marsh gas into the other, gave an E.M.F. between 0-60 and

A070 volt, varying with the condition of the carbon.       current of 0-70 ampere

was obtained on short circuit, but the cell rapidly polarised. Afterwards fresh

carbon electrodes, with the gases passing through them, were placed in distilled

water, and the E.M.F. gradually increased from 000 to 0-14 in twelve hours.
On testing the solution hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide were found to be

present. The chemical reaction of this cell is as follows

CII4 + 4CI2 + 2H2O = CO, + 8HC1.

The calculated E.M.F. of this cell is 0-65 volt.
     In these experiments it will be noted that platinum is not essential to the

reactions. _ Both electrodes iu each case can be carbon tubes or plates.
     In making these determinations of electromotive force and current, a West-on

direct-reading voltmeter and mil-ammeter were used. Resistance of voltmeter,
352 ohms, reading from 0-01 to 3-00 volts. The ammeter read from Q-Ol to
2'00 amperes.

12. On the Determination of the State of lonisation in Dilute Aqueous
    Solutions containing tioo Electrolytes. By Professor J. G. MacGregor,

     D.Sc, Dalhousie College^ Halifax, N.S.

    The object of this communication is to draw attention to the possibility of

determining, in some cases, what, according to the dissociation conception of
electrolytic conduction, the coefficients of ionisation must be in the case of two

electrolytes present in the same solution, the electrolytes either having, or not
having, one ion in common, but being such as undergo no chemical change other

than double decomposition.

When the two electrolytes (1 and 2) have one ion in common, they are the

only electrolytes present in the solution. For determining the lonisation co-

--efficients (a,, a,,) we have then the following equations ^ : (a) a^/^i = Oo/V^,
where Vj, V,, are the regional dilutions of 1 and 2, i.e. the quotients of the volumes

of the regions of the solution which may be imagined to be occupied by 1 and 2

respectively, by the numbers Nj and N^ of gramme-equivalents of these electro-

lytes present, the equation being obtained from the conditions of kinetic equili-

brium                                 {b) Nj Vi + N,, ¥2 = 1', obtained from  the equality of the volume (v) of the
                                   ;

solution to the sum of the volumes of the regions referred to ; (c) aj/Vi =/i (Vj)

and a^/Vn =/; (V,,), the functions/, and/^ being determined by means of measure-

ments of the conductivity of simple solutions, the concentrations of ions in the

regions occupied by the respective electrolytes being assumed to be the same as
Athey would be in simple solutions of the same dilution.
                                                                                                 mode of solving these

equations by a graphical process is described in the papers cited above.

     That the values of the lonisation coefficients obtained by solving these equations

are those which the dissociation theory demands is borne out by the fact that,
in the case of solutions containing NaCl and KCl (see papers cited above) or NaOl

and^ HCl, when these values are substituted in the expression of the dissocia-

tion theory for the conductivity of a complex solution, the calculated values agree

with those observed within a fraction of 1 per cent.

     The following results of the observations made on the above solutions, with
respect to the relation of the lonisation in such solutions to the concentration, may

be stated:-- (1) In the case of dilute solutions (containing no more than about 0-5

grm.-equiv. per litre of either electrolyte), the rate at which the common concen-

tration of ions increases with the concentration of either electrolyte is practically

constant                                    (2) for  solutions  of greater  concentration, this  rate  diminishes  as  the
                                         ;

concentration of the solution with respect to either electrolyte increases.

When the electrolytes, 1 and 2, added to water in forming the solution, have

no common ion, other two, 3 and 4, are formed by double decomposition, and there

are thus four present in the solution. For determining the lonisation coefficients,

--we have then the following equations ^ : (a) ai/V, = a^XY.^ -- "3/^3 = "i/^^f
and NiVj'NjV,, = N3V3-N.,V4, obtained from the conditions of equilibrium;

(6) N,V, + N2V;+ N3V3 + N4V4 = w, from the volume relation; (c) a,XY,=

/; (Vj)j Oj/Vj =_/,,(¥,,), &c., from the relation of concentration of ions to dilu-
 tion, the V's having the same signification as above; and (d) from the conser-

vation of mass,                                      ??i  and n^ being the numbers of grm.-equivalents of 1 and 2

added to water in forming tlie solution, Wi = ]S', +N3, r?v, = N2 + N^, N3 = N^.
The solution of these equations, even by the aid of a graphical process,
seems to require more accurate values of the conductivity of simple solutions
than -we possess. But with the measurements available, we may readily prepare

a solution having any desired concentration of ions, and therefore having one of
the electrolytes present with any desired degree of ionisation. For this purpose
draw curves for simple solutions of 1, 2, 3, 4, giving the relation of concentration
of ions to dilution. Read oif from these curves the dilutions, Vj, V,, &c., of simple

solutions of 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, having the desired common value of the con-

centration of ions. If simple solutions of these dilutions are mixed in proper pro-
portions as to volume, there will be no change of ionisation on mi.xing. To find
the proper proportions, select any arbitrary value, v^, of the volume of 4 which is

to be mixed with the others. It will contain N^ = y^/V^ grm.-equivalents of 4.
From equations (d) above we must have N3 = N4. Hence the volume of 3 to be
mixed with the others will be v^ = V3 w^/V^. Next select arbitrarily any value
of v.y Then from the second of equations {a) we have v^ = v^ v^/'v.^ = V3 v^-yV^ v,,.

The volumes of the simple solutions of dilutions Vj, V,,, V,, 'V^, which must be
mixed, in order to form a complex solution having the desired concentration of

ions, are thus known. The solution may therefore be prepared. Moreover, as the

concentrations of the simple solutions and the volumes of them which are mixed
are known, the numbers of grm.-equivalents of the four electrolytes present may
be determined ; and as the common concentration of ions and the dilutions are

known, the ionisation coefficients may be determined. The conductivity of the
solution may therefore be calculated.

     That the values of the ionisation coefficients obtained in this way are those
demanded by the dissociation theory is borne out in this case also by the agree-
ment between the observed values of the conductivity of solutions of the kind
under consideration and the values calculated by the aid of these coefficients.

Mr. E. H. Archibald, working in my laboratory, has recently both observed (by

Kohlrausch's method) and calculated the conductivities of solutions containing

NaCl and KoSO^, and therefore also KCl and Na2S0J^. I am indebted to him for

1. A71 Apparatus for Verifying the Law of Conservation of Energy in the
  Human Body. By Professor W. O. Atwater and Professor E. B.

    EosA.

    The authors undertook their investigation at the Wesleyan University in 1892,
under the patronage of the University and the Storrs Experiment Station of Con-
necticut. In 1894 the United States Department of Agriculture inaugurated an
investigation of the foods and nutrition of the people of the United States, and

appropriated some funds for the research. The investigation has been continued

for five years, during which time the apparatus has been gradually developed to a

comparatively high degree of perfection.

    The general plan of the work is to determine the potential energy of the food

«aten by the person under investigation, by burning samples in a bomb calorimeter

to  analyse other samples and determine   the chemical composition of  the                                        food                                                                                                                                                                                                            to

calorimeter, especially designed and constructed for this work, where he was her-

metically sealed, and where he lived for periods of from one to twelve days. The

calorimeter was 7 feet long, 6 feet 4 inches high, and 4 feet wide. Its walls were

double and made of sheet copper and sheet zinc, and this chamber was enclosed

in concentric wooden walls, to shield the calorimeter from change in temperature

vrithout.

    The two metal walls were maintained at exactly the same temperature, so

that no heat was gained or lost through the walls, and the heat generated

within was carried away by a stream of water flowing through a copper pipe,

called an ' absorber.' Tests of the calorimeter were made by passing an electric

current    through a known resistance, and  measuring the heat  generated                                         and also

heat actually evolved by the respiration calorimeter. These tests showed that

the calorimeter is a very accurate instrument.
     This investigation is followed up with studies in the metabolism of matter and

energy in the human body.

 2. The Bate of the Decrease of the Intensify of Shrill Sonnds with Time.

              By A. WiLMER Duff, Purdue University, Indiana.

      Stokes has investigated theoretically the effect of viscosity in dissipating the
energy of vibration of shrill sounds, and also, in another paper, the effect of radia-
tion Rayleigh has extended his method to thermal conduction, and Kirchhoff
has investigated the effect of both viscosity and conduction, arriving at results in
agreement with the investigations of Stokes and Ilayleigh, In the present Paper

the question is for the first itime approached experimentally.
     The distance at which eight very shrill whistles sounded simultaneously under

a definite pressure just become inaudible is observed, and also the distances at

which they become inaudible when sounded in pairs. From these observations

the modulus of decay of amplitude is found, and for the case of a note of vibration
frequency of 10,600 the modulus of decay turns out to be -66. Comparing this
result with the theoretical investigations, the effect of radiation only is deduced,
and hence a value of -1485 is found for the constant in Newton's lawof cooling in
the case of air. These seem to be the only values ever found experimentally for

the modulus of decay and for the Newtonian constant of radiation.

        3. A New Instrument for Measuring the Intensity of Sound.
                      By A. G. Webster and B. F. Sharpe.

     The instrument consists of a spherical resonator, to which is attached a thin-
glass diaphragm, the excursions of which are measui'ed by the displacements of
interference fringes in a Michelson interferometer. The diaphragm carries at its

centre a small plane mirror about 4 mm. square, which is made the movable plane

of the interferometer, there being besides two fixed glasses and one movable in a
slide by a slow-motion screw. The apparatus is solidly fastened to a bronze base,
and is completely enclosed by a felt-covered box, leaving exposed only the resonator
with a hole opposite the diaphragm. The apparatus is adjusted so that the fringes

Whenare parallel and vertical, using first monochromatic and then white light.

 a sound is made, the fringes become blurred, so as to disappear, and must accord-
ingly be observed stroboscopically. Accordingly for the source of sound is chosen
a tuning-fork electrically maintained, while the fringes, reduced by a horizontal
slit to a line of points moving horizontally, are observed by a small telescope
 whose objective is carried by the prong of a second independently maintained
 tuning-fork vibrating synchronously with the source of sound, the lens moving,
 vertically. The fringes are accordingly seen as inclined lines, the inclination of
 which is measured by a graduated circle and rotating cross-hair in the eyepiece.
The excursion is proportional to the tangent of the angular displacement. This
 was found more convenient than counting the number of fringes displaced.

      The chief difficulty after that of securing absolute freedom froui extraneous
 noises is in maintaining the constancy of the source of sound. This was finally
 accomplished by making the break of the fork which interrupted the circuit for the
 source proper a large mercury surface, the controlling fork being placed upon a
 solid pier, and boxed in, so as to emit no sound. The source proper was a fork
 mechanically connected to a diaphragm mounted upon a spherical resonator, all
 being boxed in except a circular orifice in the resonator, so that the sound pro-
ceeded from a definite point. This could be moved about the room without the

 intensity changing.

      Observations were made in the middle of the night. The following data wili
 give an idea of the constancy of the conditions :

                     w = width of one fringe in micrometer divisions.

                         A = vertical height of stroboscopic image.
                          a = angle of fringes with vertical.
                         I = intensity of sound.

                                                                By Peucival Lowell.

    In everj' astronomical observation the rays of light which give us our know-

--ledge of things beyond the earth have to traverse three media the air, the lens,

and the eye. Though much attention has been given to the lens, and not a little

to the observer, almost none has been paid to the atmosphere, which on investiga-

tion turns out to be the most important factor of the three.

     For the purpose of applying and studying this neglected and practically

unknown factor, the first work in which we owe to Professor W. II. Pickering at

Arequipa, the Lowell Observatory was put up at Flagstaif, Arizona. The practical

results on Mars, Venus, Mercury, Jupiter's Satellites, and Uranus were both sur-

prising to observers generally and revolutionary of previous ideas of these bodies.

Mr. Douglas then discovered that the cause of bad seeing could itself be seen,.

and that it was due to distorting refraction produced by waves of condensation and

rarefaction in the air currents, which waves could be rendered visible as shadow

bands crossing the field of view. He determined the size of these waves, their

respective refractive powers, and the kind, speed, direction, and height of tho

currents. He thus found (1) that the seeing depends upon the absence of certain

currents                                    (2)  that the                                          effectiveness of the  object glass depends                                                                                                  upon  the size    of

To minimise the harmful currents is, therefore, the object from a practical

point of view. To do this the locality must be as free as possible from-

moisture, since water vapour is an unsettling element, and be as little as possible

subject to change of any kind. These conditions are best satisfied by a large

oasis in the midst of a desert, which is the case at Flagstaff.

       10. On the Susceptibility of Diamagnetic and Weakly Magnetic
                           Substances. By A. P. Wills.

     In the paper the author describes in detail a new method, applicable in the

experimental study of the magnetic properties of those substances in which the
coefficient of magnetic susceptibility is very small, and either positive or negative.

   --The method is based upon the property which all bodies have to a greater or

less degree namely, that they experience a mechanical force when placed in a

non-homogeneous magnetic field. This force acts to impel the body towards
stronger or weaker parts of the field, according as the body is magnetic or

diamagnetic.

    By means of a large electromagnet a practically uniform field is obtained,

at least sufficiently uniform to suit the purpose to which it is put. The magnet
is so designed that the pole pieces face each other. They are prismatic in form,
and the surfaces are about 1| x 8 cm., and there is a space of about 1|^ cm. between
them. The long edges of the pole pieces are placed horizontally. The body to be
investigated is made in the form of a thin slab. The dimensions of the slab are
about i X 4| X 8 cm. It is suspended, by means of a long wire, from one end of
the beam of a delicate balance, and with the 4^ cm. edges horizontal and parallel
to the pole faces and the 8 cm. edges vertical. The vertical direction is called Z
the horizontal direction parallel to the pole faces Y, and that perpendicular to
the plane of these two X. The lower Z face of the slab is placed in the horizontal
plane of symmetry of the pole pieces.

     The conditions of symmetry show that there will be no mechanical force
acting upon the slab save in the Z direction. The balance serves to determine
this force, which is called P. Theoretical considerations show

                                   P = ''4'''(H=-H,=),

activity.

He reviews the arguments respecting periodicity in the cases of sun spots and

of waves of heat and cold, and seeks to establish, from the records of magnetic

observations at Toronto, beginning in 1841, that there is a periodicity in magnetic

disturbances of 27-24575 days, which the author thinks is the synodical rotation

period of the true body of the sun, with which the recurrences of sun spots, of

solar protuberances, of hot and cold waves upon the earth, and other phenomena

dependent on solar action must harmonise.

From thermal considerations Mr. Carlos Honors, of Montevideo, arrives at a

result almost identical with that of this paper.

tiyities of the constituents, taken in the proportions in which they occur in air
differed from that of air by being 0-35 per cent, too small. Similar experiments
made -with a mixture of hydrogen and helium gave the result that the sum of the
refractivities of these gases, taken separately, differed from that of the mixture by
no less than 3 per cent, in excess. It is thus probable that gases are not without
influence on each other, but that in some cases the refractivity is diminished, in
others increased by mixture.

into lateral pendular motion. He instanced the case of a differential D'Arsonval

galvanometer, of a moment-of-inertia apparatus designed by Professor Daiby, and
of an apparatus designed by himself for illustrating mechanically the transmission
of transverse vibrations and of Hertz waves, in which model the part corresponding
to the Hertz resonator (a metal ring) was hung by a trifilar suspension.

7. On a Besearch in Thermo-electricity hy means of a Platinum Besistance
    Pyrometer. By H. M. Tory, M.A., Lecturer in Mathematics and

     Demonstrator in Physics, McGill University, Montreal.

                   [Communicated by Prof. H. L. Callendah, M.A., F.R.S.]

     The paper is an account of some experiments carried on in the McDonald
Physics Building of McGill College, with a view to applying the electrical resist-
ance pyrometer to the phenomena of thermo-electricity.

     The method was suggested by Professor Callendar, whose work, with that of
Messrs. Griffiths, Heycock, and Neville, has fairly well established the formulas
for calculating temperature by this means.

     The object of the investigation was to give a more rigid verification of Tait'a

parabolic formula.

    The research, as conducted, naturally divides itself into three parts :--

     1. The study of the usual form of copper-iron junction.
     2. The study of a cast-iron wrought-iron junction. In conducting some experi-
ments on the cyclical variation in the cylinder wall of a steam-engine. Professor
Callendar found a couple of this type most suitable.

   A3. direct comparison of the electrical resistance pyrometer with the platinum-

platinum-rhodium couple.

In all cases the compensation method was used for measuring the E.M.F.,

the junction being balanced against a storage cell, which in turn was continuously

Abalanced against a Clark cell kept at constant temperature.  carefully calibrated

rheostat and a resistance box, both of the same material, were used.

The copper, cast-iron, and wrought-iron -were tinned together at one end and

heated in an oil bath, in which also was inserted the tube containing the pyro-

meter. The observations were taken only at perfectly steady temperatures. The

direct reading galvanometer, devised by Professor Oallendar for the purpose, was
Aused in taking temperatures with the pyrometer.
                                                             carefully calibrated resistance

box of the standard type was also used.

The platinum temperatures were calculated from the formula

The object being to show the relation between the experimental curve and Tait's

parabola, it is quite obvious that the ordinary method of plotting the temperature

A --and the E.M.F, is not sufficient. difference method similar to that above equa-
--tion (2) was therefore adopted. The values of t were taken as abscissas, and the

corresponding values i - ?c as ordinates, t^ denoting the couple temperature, where

-y|^ is the temperature coefficient.

The relation to the parabolic formula may be shown thus :

                             El = at + I3t- (Tait's formula)

                                       VVioo/ 100/,

where S is a constant depending on the nature of the metals. The value 5 was

calculated from the observed difference, t -- t,at 200°, With this value for 8 the

parabola was plotted, passing therefore through three points on the experimental

curve, those corresponding to 0°, 100°, and 200°. The accompanying curves show

the differences from this parabola plotted along the axes.

In order to compare the Le Chatelier couple directly with the resistance pyro-

meter, the couple and the pyrometer were placed in the same porcelain tube. The

couple was the usual form, a pure platinum wire coupled with another of platinum

containing 10 per cent, rhodium. The wire was obtained from Messrs. Johnson,

Matthey & Co. The junction was placed so as to be directly under the pyrometer

coil, from which it was separated by strips of mica.

The temperatures, as before, were taken only at steady points. These points

were obtained by varying the gas supply under a vessel containing molten tin, and

regular. The neutral point, calculated as before, is 917°, which lies entirely
beyond the limits of the experiments. The value of 8 is 5-765.

couple. The scale here for the ahscissas is just one-fifth that in the other two cases,
and that of the ordiuates one-tenth. The greatest difierence will be seen to be at

150°, the differences being much greater below the 500° point than above.

8. On a Simple Modification of the Board of Trade Form of the Standard
    Clark Cell. By H. L. Callendar, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of
     Physics, and H. T. Barxks, M.A.Sc, Demonstrator oj Physics, of

     McGill University, Montreal.

     The authors have been engaged for some years past in experiments on the
variation of E.M.F. of the Clark cell under the most exacting conditions of tem-
perature change. They have studied the behaviour of various types of the cell
and have recently devised a very simple form, in many respects closely resemblino-

that described in the Board of Trade Memorandum, but somevrhat easier to con-
struct, and also entirely free from diffusion-lag in the changes of its E.M.F.
consequent on the most sudden variations of temperature.

     The cell is set up in a test-tube, but the materials are tilled in the inverse of
the usual order. First zinc amalgam, to which connection is made by means of a
·wire sealed into a glass tube. Next a layer of crystals of zinc sulphate, followed
by a layer of paste of mercurous sulphate prepared in the usual manner, in which
is coiled a fine amalgamated platinum wire, which serves in place of the mercury.
The whole is sealed either with a cork and marine glue, or better hermetically, by

sealing the glass tube on to the platinum electrodes.

     With this method of construction, both the elements are always in contact

Hwith crystals, and there can be no diffusion-lag. The cells are at least equal to

the form in this respect, and are much easier to make, and more convenient to

use, especially for immersion in a water-bath.

     The same method of construction has also been applied with success to the
cadmium cell. These cells appear to be as reliable as the Clark cells at tempera-
tures above 10° C, but the E.M.F. is dependent upon the proportions of the amal-
gam. Below 10° C, there appear to be two possible rates of variation of the E.M.F.,
corresponding to different hydrates, as shown in a recent communication to the
Royal Society to be the case with the Clark cell between the temperatui-es ',iO°
and 50°,

                          By T, W. Edmondson.

     The object of the experiments described was to determine, if possible, the
relation existing between the spark-length and the potential at which the dis-
ruptive discharge takes place in air and a number of insulating oils, when the
electrodes used are spheres. The measurements in air wea-e made by direct
readings of a guard-ring electrometer and a spark micrometer, connected in parallel
with a Wimshurst machine.

     The curves for air, in which the ordinates represent potential differences, and
the abscissas the corresponding spark-lengths, are found to be hyperbolic and ai-e
represented by equations of the form

--592 REPORT 1897.

     In the case of the insulating oils it was found impracticahle to make direct
readino-s, on account of the dense deposit of carbon on the electrodes, which

materially altered the conditions of the discharge.

     The method of Macfarlane and Pierce was therefore adopted, and a pair of
spheres of 1 cm. diam. were used as a subsidiary electrometer, the results previously

obtained being used for the reduction of the results now obtained. At high

potentials it was found impossible to get a consistent set of readings, on account of

the violent agitation of the liquid, especially in the case of the lighter oils, like
kerosene, in which the convection effects were very pronounced.

     It was found that, while a smaller difference of potential is necessary to pro-
duce a discharge through a given distance for large spheres than for small ones,

when they are close together, for longer distances the air is dielectrically stronger
for large than for small spheres. For spark-lengths of more than 3 mm. the curves

are practically straight, and the dielectric strength is therefore constant.

     The values of the dielectric strength of air, at ordinary pressures, are aa follows :

     All of these values are considerably higher than that obtained by Macfarlane
for planes, viz. 23'8 kilovolts per cm.

     The results for the insulating oils are not as uniform as those for air, but the
same general characteristics were found, except in a few cases. In all cases the
curves for the spheres of 3 cm. diam. are fairly straight, and it would appear that

Macfarlane's conclusion that the dielectric strength of liquids is constant for plane

electrodes is warranted.

                        THVIiSDAY, AUGUST 19.

The President delivered the following Address :

       An Undiscovered Gas.

A SECTIONAL address to members of the British Association falls under one of

three heads. It may be historical, or actual, or prophetic ; it may refer to the
past, the present, or the future. In many cases, indeed in all, this classification
overlaps. Your former Presidents have given sometimes a historical introduction,

followed by an account of the actual state of some branch of our science, and,

though rarely, concluding with prophetic remarks. To those who have an aflFec-

tion for the past, the historical side appeals forcibly ; to the practical man, and to
the investigator engaged in research, the actual, perhaps, presents more charm

while to the general public, to whom novelty is often more of an attraction than

truth, the prophetic aspect excites most interest. In this address I must endeavour

to tickle all palates ; and perhaps I may be excused if I take this opportunity of

indulging in the dangerous luxury of prophecy, a luxury which the managers of

scientific journals do not often permit their readers to taste.

    The .subject of my remarks to-day is a new gas. I shall describe to you later

its curious properties ; but it would be unfair not to put you at once in possession of

--the knowledge of its moat remarkable property it has not yet been discovered.

As it is still unborn, it has not yet been named. The naming of a new element is

uo easy matter. For there are only twenty-six letters in our alphabet, and there

are already over seventy elements. To select a name expressible by a symbol
which has not already been claimed for one of the known elements is difficult, and
the difficulty is enhanced when it is at the same time required to select a name
which shall be descriptive of the properties (or want of properties) of the element.

    It is now my task to bring before you the evidence for the existence of this

undiscovered element.

     It was noticed by Dobereiner, as long ago as 1817, that certain elements could
be arranged in groups of three. The choice of the elements selected to form these
triads was made on account of their analogous properties, and on the sequence of
their atomic weights, which had at that time only recently been discovered. Thus
calcium, strontium, and barium formed such a group ; their oxides, lime, strontia,
and baryta are all easily slaked, combining with water to form soluble lime-water,
strontia-water, and baryta-water. Their sulphates are all sparingly soluble, and
resemblance had been noticed between their respective chlorides and between their
nitrates. Regularity was also displayed by their atomic weights. The numbers
then accepted were 20, 42"5 and 65 ; and the atomic weight of strontium, 42'5, is

1897.                                            QQ
594 REPORT-- 1897.

the arithmetical mean of those of the other two elements, for (65 + 20)/2 = 42-5.

The existence of other similar groups of three was pointed out by Dobereiner, and

such groups became known as ' Dobereiner's triads.'

Another method of classifying the elements, also depending on their atomic

weights, was suggested by Pottenkofer, and afterwards elaborated by Kremers,
Gladstone, and Cooke. It consisted in seeking for some expression which would

represent the differences between the atomic weights of certain allied elements.

Thus, the difference between the atomic weight of lithium, 7, and sodium, 2.3, is 16 ;
and between that of sodium and of potassium, 39, is also 16. The regularity is

not always so conspicuous; Dumas, in 1857, contrived a somewhat complicated

expression which, to some extent, exhibited regularity in the atomic weights of

fluorine, chlorine, bromine,  and iodine                                                    and also of  nitrogen, phosphorus,  arsenic,
                                                                                         ;

antimony and bismuth.

     The upshot of these efforts to discover regularity was that, in 1864, Mr. John
Newlands, having arranged the elements in eight groups, found that when pl.iced

in the order of their atomic weights, ' the eighth element, starting from a given one,

is a kind of repetition of the tirst, like the eighth note of an octave in music' To

this regularity he gave the name ' The Law of Octaves.'

     The development of this idea, as all chemists know, was due to the late

Professor Lothar Meyer, of Tiibingen. and to Professor MendeMeff', of St Peters-

burg. It is generally known as the * Periodic Law.' One of the simplest methods

of showing this arrangement is by means of a cylinder divided into eight segments

by lines drawn parallel to its axis ; a spiral line is then traced round the cylinder,

which will, of course, be cut by these lines eight times at each revolution. Holding

the cylinder vertically, the name and atomic weight of an element is written at

each intersection of the spiral with a vertical line, following the numerical order

of the atomic weights. It will be found, according to Lothar Meyer and Men-

deliSeff, that the elements grouped down each of the vertical lines form a natural

class; they possess similar properties, form similar compounds, and exhibit a

graded relationship between their densities, melting-points, and many of their

other properties. One of these vertical columns, however, diHers from the others,

inasmuch as on it there are three groups, each consisting of three elements with

approximately equal atomic weights. The elements in question are iron, cobalt,

and nickel; palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium; and platinum, iridium, and

osmium. There is apparently room for a fourth group of three elements in this

column, and it may be a fifth. And the discovery of such a group is not unlikely,

for when this table was first drawn up Professor Mendelileft" drew attention to

certain gaps, which have since been filled up by the discovery of gallium, ger-

manium, and others.

The discovery of argon at once raised the curiosity of Lord Rayleigh and

myself as to its position in this table. With a density of nearly 20, if a diatomic

gas, like oxygen and nitrogen, it would follow fluorine in the periodic table ; and
our first idea was that argon was probably a mixture of three gases, all of which

possessed nearly the same atomic weights, like iron, cobalt, and nickel. Indeed,
their names were suggested, on this supposition, with patriotic bias, as Anglium,

Scotium, and Hibernium ! But when the ratio of its specific heats had, at least

in our opinion, unmistakably shown that it was moleculavly monatomic, and not
diatomic, as at first conjectured, it was necessary to believe that its atomic weight

was 40, and not 20, and that it followed chlorine in the atomic table, and not
fluorine. But here arises a difficulty. The atomic weight of chlorine is 35-5, and

that of potassium, the next element in order in the table, is 39' 1 ; and that of

argon, 40, follows, and does not precede, that of potassium, as it might be expected

to do. It still remains possible that argon, instead of consisting wholly of

monatomic molecules, may contain a small percentage of diatomic molecules ; but

mythe evidence in favour of this supposition is, in                                                      opinion, far from strong.

Another possibility is that argon, as at first conjectured, may consist of a mixture

of more than one element; but, unless the atomic weight of one of the elements in

the supposed mixture is very high, say 82, the case is not bettered, for one of the
elements in the supposed trio would still have a higher atomic weight than
                               TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                  595

potassium. And very careful experiments, carried out by Dr. Norman Collie and

myself, on the fractional diffusion of argon, have disproved the existence of any

such element with high atomic weight in argon, and, indeed, have practically

demonstrated that urgon is a simple substance, and not a mixture.

The discovery of helium has thrown a new light on this subject. Helium, it

will be remembered, is evolved on heating certain minerals, notably those contain-

ing uranium ; although it appears to be contained in others in which uranium is

Dot present, except in traces. Among these minerals are cleveite, monazite,

fergusouite, and a host of similar complex mixtures, all containing rare elements,

such as niobium, tantalum, yttrium, cerium, &c. The spectrum of helium is

characterised by a remarkably brilliant yellow line, which had been observed as

long ago as 1868 by Professors Frauldand and Lockyer in the spectrum of the sun's

chromosphere, and named ' helium' at that early date.

The density of helium proved to be very close to 2-0, and, like argon, the ratio

of its specific heats showed that it, too, was a monatomic gas. Its atomic weight

therefore is identical with its molecular weight, viz., 4'0, and its place in the

periodic table is between hydrogen and lithium, the atomic weight of which

is 7-0.

The difference between the atomic weights of helium and argon is thus 36, or

Now40 -- 4.  there are several cases of such a difference. For instance, in the

group the first member of which is fluorine we have

These instances suffice to show that approximately the differences are 16 and 20
between consecutive members of the corresponding groups of elements. The total
diflerences between the extreme members of the short series mentioned are

         Manganese -- Fluorine                             3G

         --Titanium Carbon . . . . . . 3G 1

This is approximately the difference between the atomic weights of helium and

argon, 3'J.

     There should, therefore, be an undiscovered element between helium and argon,
with an atomic weight 16 units higher than that of helium, and 20 units lower

than that of argon, namely 20. And if this unknown element, like helium and

argon, should prove to consist of monatomic molecules, then its density should be

half its atomic weight, 10. And pushing the analogy still farther, it is to be

expected that this element should be as indifferent to union with other elements
as the two allied elements.

                                                                                 QQ2

My assistant, Mr. Morris Travers, has indefatigably aided me in a search for

this unknown gas. There is a proverb about looking for a needle in a haystack
modern science, with the aid of suitable magnetic appliances, would, if the seward
were sufficient, make short work of that proverbial needle. But here is a supposed
unknown gas, endowed no doubt with negative properties, and the whole world to

find it in. Still, the attempt had to be made.

   We --first directed our attention to th& sources of helium minerals. Almost

every mineral which we could obtain was heated in a vacuum, and the gas which

was evolved examined. The results are interesting. Most minerals give off gas

when heated, and the gas contains, as a rule, a considerable amount of hydrogen,

mixed with carbonic acid, questionable traces of nitrogen, and carbonic oxide.

Many of the minerals, in addition, gave helium, which proved to be widely dis-

-- --tributed, though only in minute proportions. One mineral malacone gave appre-

ciable quantities of argon ; and it is noteworthy that argon was not found except
in it (and, curiously, in much larger amount than helium), and in a specimen of
meteoric iron. Other specimens of meteoric iron were examined, but were found

to contain mainly hydrogen, with no trace of either argon, or helium. It is probable

that the sources of meteorites might be traced in this manner, and that each could

be relegated to its particular swarm.

    Among the minerals examined was one tc which our attention had been

directed by Professor Lockyer, named eliasite, from which he said that he haid

extracted a gas in which he had observed spectrum lines foreign to helium. He

was kind enough to furnish us with a specimen of this mineral, which is exceed-

ingly rare, but the sample which we tested contained nothing but undoubted

helium.

During a trip to Iceland in 1895, 1 collected some gas from the boiling springs

there ; it consisted, for the most part, of air, but contained somewhat move argon
than is usually dissolved when air is shaken with water. In the spring of 1896

Mr. Travers and I made a trip to the Pyrenees to collect gas from the mineral

springs of Oauterets, to which our attention had been directed by Dr. Bouchard,

Wewho pointed out that these gases are rich in helium.  examined a number

of samples from the various springs, and confirmed Dr. Bouchard's results, but

there was no sign of any unknown lines in the spectrum of these gases. Our quest

was in vain.

   We must now turn to another aspect of the subject. Shortly after the

discovery of helium, its spectrum was very carefully examined by Professors Runge

and Paschen, the renowned spectroscopists. The spectrum was photographed,

special attention being paid to the invisible portions, termed the ' ultra-violet ' and

' infra-red.' The lines thus registered were found to have a harmonic relation to

each other. They admitted of division into two sets, each complete in itself.

Now, a similar process had been applied to the spectrum of lithium and to that of

sodium, and the spectra of these elements gave only one series each. Hence^

Professors Runge and Paschen concluded that the gas, to which the provisional

name of helium had been given, was, in reality, a mixture of two gases, closely
resembling each other in properties. As we know no other elements with atomic

weights between those of hydrogen and lithium, there is no chemical evidence

either for or against this supposition. Professor Runge supposed that he had

obtained evidence of the separation of these imagined elements from each other by

means of diffusion ; but Mr. Travers and I pointed out that the same alteration of
spectrum, which was apparently produced by diffusion, could also be caused by

altering the pressure of the gas in the vacuum tube ; and shortly after Professor
Runge acknowledged his mistake.

     These considerations, however, made it desirable to subject helium to system-
atic diffusion, in the same way as argon had been tried. The experiments were-
carried out in the summer of 189G by Dr. Collie and myself. The result was

encouraging. It was found possible to separate helium into two portions of

different rates of diffusion, and consequently of different density by this means.

The limits of separation, however, were not very great. On the one hand, we

obtained gas of a density close on 2-0 ; and on the other, a sample of density 2'4
                       TRANSACTIO>'S ©F SECTION B.                          597

or thereabouts. Tke difEculty was increased by the curious behaviour, which we

have often had occasion to confirm, that helium possesses a rate of dilfusion too

rapid for its density. Thus, the density of the lightest portion of the diffused gas,

calculated from its rate of diffusion, was 1"874 ; but this corresponds to a real

density of about 2'0. After our paper, giving an account of these experiments,

had been published, a German investigator, Herr A. Hagenbach, repeated our

work and confirmed ©ur results.

The two samples of gas of dilTerent density differ also in other properties.

Different transparent substances differ in the rate at which they allow light to pass

through them. Thus, light travels through water at a much slower rate than

through air, and at a slower rate through air than through hydrogen. Now Lord

liayleigh found that helium offers less opposition to the passage of light than any

other substance does, and the heavier of the two portions into which helium had

been split ofi'ered more opposition than the lighter portion. And the retardation

of the light, unlike what has usually been observed, was nearly proportional to the

densities of the samples. The spectrum of these two samples did not differ in the

minutest particular ; therefore it did not appear quite out of the question to hazard

the speculation that the process of diflusion was instrumental, not necessarily in

separating two kinds of gas from each other, but actually in removing light

molecules of the same kind from heavy molecules. This idea is not new. It had

been advanced by Prof. Schiitzenberger (whose recent death all chemists have to

deplore), and later, by Mr. Crookes, that what we term the atxjmic weight of an

element is a mean ; that when we say that the atomic weight of oxygen is 1 6,
we merely state that the average atomic weight is 16; and it is not inconceivable

that a certain number of molecules have a weight somewhat higher than 32, while

a certain number have a lower weight.

   We therefore thought it necessary to test this question by direct experiment

with some known gas ; and we chose nitrogen, as a good material with which to
Atest the point.
                  much larger and more convenient apparatus for diffusing gases

was built by Mr. Travers and myself, and a set of systematic diffusions of nitrogen
was carried out. After thirty rounds, corresponding to 180 diffusions, the density

of the nitrogen was unaltered, and that of the portion which should have diffused

most slowly, had there been any difference in rate, was identical with that of the

most quickly diflusing portion i p., with that of the portion which passed first

through the porous plug. This att^empt, therefore, was unsuccessful ; but it was
worth caiTying out, for it is now certain that it is not possible to separate a gas of

undoubted chemical unity into portions of different density by diffusion. And

these experiments rendered it exceedingly improbable that the difference in density

of the two fractions of helium was due to separation of light molecules of helium

from heavy molecules.

The apparatus used for diffusion had a capacity of about two litres. It was

filled with helium, and the operation of diffusion was carried through thirty times.

WoThere were six reservoirs, each full of gas, and each was separated into  by

diffusion. To the heavier portion of one lot, the lighter portion of the next was

added, and in this manner all six reservoirs were successively passed through the

diffusion apparatus. This process was carried out thirty times, each of the six

reservoirs having had its gas diffused each time, thus involving 180 diffusions.

After this process, the density of the more quickly diffusing gas was reduced to

2-02, while that of the less quickly diffusing had increased to 2-27. The light

portion on re-diffusion hardly altered in density, while the heavier portion, when

divided into three portions by diffusion, showed a considerable difference in density

Abetween the first third and the last third.  similar set of operations was

carried out with a fresh quantity of helium, in order to accumulate enough gas to

obtain a sufficient quantity for a second series of diffusions. The more quickly

diffusing portions of both gases were mixed and rediffused. The density of the

lightestportion of these gases was 1'98 ; and after other 15 diffusions, the density

of the lightest portion had not decreased. The end had been reached ; it was not

possible to obtain a lighter portion by diffusion. The density of the main body

of this gas is therefore 1*98 ; and its refractivity, air being taken as unity, is
598 BEPORT--1897.

0"1245. The spectrum of this portion does not differ in any respect from the

usual spectrum of helium.

      A.S re-diffusion does not alter the density or the refractivity of this gas, it is

right to suppose that either one definite element has now been isolated ; or that

if there are more elements than one present, they possess the same, or very nearly

the same, density and refractivity. There may be a group of elements, say three,

like iron, cobalt, and nickel ; but there is no proof that this idea is correct, and

the simplicity of the spectrum would be an argument against such a supposition.

This substance, forming by far the larger part of the whole amount of the gas,

must, in the present state of our knowledge, be regarded as pure helium.

On the other hand, the heavier residue is easily altered in density by re-diffu-

sion, and this would imply that it consists of a small quantity of a heavy gas

mixed with a large quantity of the light gas. Repeated re-diffusion convinced us

that there was only a very small amount of the heavy gas present in the mixture.

The portion which contained the largest amount of heavy gas was found to have
the density 2-275, and its refractive index was found to be 0'1333. On re-dif-

fusing this portion of gas until only a trace sufficient to fill a Pllicker's tube was

left, and then examining the spectrum, no unknown lines could be detected, but,

on interposing a jar and spark gap, the well-known blue lines of argon became

visible ; and even without the jar the red lines of argon, and the two green groups

were distinctly visible. The amount of argon present, calculated from the density,

was 1'64 per cent., and from the refractivity 1'14 per cent. The conclusion had

therefore to be drawn that the heavy constituent of helium, as it comes off the

minerals containing it, is nothing new,, but, so far as can be made out, merely a

small amount of argon.

    If, then, there is a new gas in what is generally termed helium, it is mixed
with argon, and it must be present in extremely minute traces. As neither

helium nor argon has been induced to form compounds, there does not appear to

be any method, other than diffusion, for isolating such a gas, if it exi.sts, and that

method has failed in our hands to give any evidence of the existence of such a gas.

It by no means follows that the gas does not exist ; the onlj' conclusion to be
drawn is that we have not yet stumbled on the material which contains it. In

fact, the haystack is too large and the needle too inconspicuous. Reference to

the periodic table will show that between the elements aluminium and indium

there occurs gallium, a substance occurring only in the minutest amount on the

earth's surface                                                            and following silicon, and preceding tin, appears the element
                                                                        ;

germanium, a body which has as yet been recognised only in one of the rarest of

minerals, argyrodite. Now, the amount of helium in fergusonite, one of the

minerals which yields it in reasonable quantity, is only 33 parts by weight in

100,000 of the mineral ; and it is not improbable that some other mineral may
contain the new gas in even more minute proportion. If, however, it is accom-

panied in its still undiscovered source by argon and helium, it will be a work ot

extreme difficulty to effect a separation from these gases.

    In these remarks it has been assumed that the new gas will resemble argon

and helium in being indifi'erent to the action of reagents, and in iiot forming com-

pounds. This supposition is worth examining. In considering it, the analogy

with other elements is all that we have to guide us.
We Wehave already paid some attention to several triads of elements.
                                                                           have

seen that the differences in atomic weights between the elements fluorine and

manganese, oxygen and chromium, nitrogen and vanadium, carbon and titanium,

are in each case approximately the same as that between helium and argon, viz., 36.

If elements further back in the periodic table be examined, it is to be noticed that

the differences grow less, the smaller the atomic weights. Thus, between boron

and scandium, the diSerence is 33 ; between beryllium (glucinum) and calcium,

31 ; and between lithium and potassium, 32. At the same time, we may remark
that the elements grow liker each other, the lower the atomic weights. Now,
helium and argon are very like each other in physical properties. It may be

fairly concluded, I think, that in so far they justify their position. Moreover, the

pair of elements vyhich show the smallest difference between their atomic weights
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION B.                    599

is berylliiim and calcium ; tliere is a somewhat greater difference between litliium

and potassium. And it is in accordance with this fragment of regularity that

helium and argon show a greater difference. Then again, sodium, the middle
element of the lithium triad', is very similar in properties both to lithium and
potassium ; and we might, therefore, expect that the unknown element of the
helium series should closely resemble both helium and argon.

     Leaving now the consideration of the new element, let us turn our attention to

the more general question of the atomic weight of argon, and its anomalous posi-
tion in tlie periodic scheme of the elements. The apparent difficulty is this: The
atomic weight of argon is 40 ; it has no power to form compounds, and thus
possesses no valency ; it must follow chlorine in the periodic table, and precede
potassium ; but its atomic weight is greater than that of potassium, whereas it is
generally contended that the elements should follow each other in the order of their
atomic weights. If this contention is correct, argon should have an atomic weight

smaller than 4Q.

    Let us examine this contention. Taking the first row of elements, we have

              Li = 7,Be = 9-8,B = ll, C = 12,N = 14,O = 16,F = 19,.P = 20.

    The differences are
                                          2-8, 1-2, 1-0, 20, 2-0, 3 0, 1-0.

    It is obvious that they are irregular. The next row shows similar irregu-
larities. Thus

  A(? = 20), Na = 23, Mg = 24-3, Al = 27, Si = 28, P = 31, S = 32, CI = 355, = 40.

    And the differences

                                      3-0, 1-3, 2-7, 10, 30, 1-0, 3-5, 4-5.

    The same irregularity might be illustrated by a consideration of each succeed-
ing row. Between argon and the next in order, potassium, there is a difference of
-0-9; that is to say, argon has a higher atomic weight than potassium by_0'9
unit ; whereas it might be expected to have a lower one, seeing that potassium
follows argon in the table. Farther on in the table there is a similar discrepancy.
The row is as follows :

      Ag = 108, Cd = 112, In = 114, Sn = 119, Sb = 120-5, Te = 127-7, 1 = 127.

The differences are :

                       4-0, 2-0, 5-0, 1-5, 7-2, -0-7.

Here, again, there is a negative difference between tellurium and iodine. And

this apparent discrepancy has led to many and careful redeterminations of the

atomic weight of tellurium. Professor Brauner, indeed, has submitted tellurium

AHto methodical fractionation, with no positive results.  the recent determina-

tions of its atomic weight give practically the same number, 127-7.

Again, there have been almost innumerable attempts to reduce the differences

between the atomic weights to regularity, by contriving some formula which will

express the numbers which represent the atomic weights, with all their irregulari-

ties. Needless to say, such attempts have in no case been successful. Apparent

success is always attained at the expense of accuracy, and the numbers reproduced

are not those accepted as the true atomic weights. Such attempts, in my opinion,

are futile. Still, the human mind does not rest contented in merely chronicling

such an irregularity ; it strives to understand why such an irregularity should

exist. And, in connection with this, there are two matters which call for our con-

sideration. These are : Does some circumstance modify these ' combining propor-

tions ' which we term ' atomic weights ' ? And is there any reason to suppose that

we can modify them at our will ? Are they true ' constants of Nature,' unchange-

problems of physics and chemistry to solve this mystery. What the solution will

be is beyond my power of prophecy ; whether it is to be found in the influence of

some circumstance on the atomic weif^hts, hitherto regarded as among the most cer-

tional attraction are influenced by temperature, or by electrical charge, I cannot

tell. But that some means will ultimately be found of reconciling these apparent
discrepancies, 1 firmly believe. Such a reconciliation is necessary, whatever view

be taken of the nature of the universe and of its mode of action ; whatever units
we may choose to regard as fundamental among those which lie at our dis-

posal.

The following Paper and Ileports were read :

                         1. Reform in the Teaching of Chemistry.

By Professor W. W. Andrews, Mount Allison University, SackvUle, N.B.

The reform here proposed may be set forth under the following heads :

   A1. more complete reorganisation of our subject-matter, a diflferent order, a

more constant correlation of the results obtained by difierent methods, and a larger

use of the ideas of physics.

     2. Methods of research by means of simple apparatus, thereby economising

money, material, and time, and making laboratory hours more fruitful in results.

   A3. method of writing equations denoting changes in energy and state of

aggregation.

I. It goes without saying that any modern teaching makes large use of the

LawPeriodic   as the basis of classification.  In many excellent text-books this has

been done to a certain extent. "We should proceed farther in the same direction.

Mastery of a greater number of facts is possible, and the educational and culture

value of the study is increased.
     It is well to introduce the law as soon as the idea of a difference between the

reacting masses of the elements is made clear and some knowledge of acid and
alkaline properties has been attained, and to do so by arranging the elements in

linear order. Periodicity at once becomes evident, and a completion of the curves
shows that all belong to one system. Mendel^eS's second table comes by section-

ing this line. At first the periodicity should be shown in the case of one property
of the elements only, and gradually the periodic system built up. Table I., which
was exhibited to the Section, showed the periodicity of basic and acid properties

in a diagrammatic form.

    As in botany a plant, so in chemistry every element is to be studied as a repre-

sentative of its family. Eight elements so discussed and experimented with are

enough for an elementary course. The student should always be asked to reach
some results of his own to earn the right to use the work of others.

     Should we not begin with the well-known heavy metals, with their sensible
properties and verj' marked reactions, instead of the intangible, odourless, and
tasteless gases 0, H, N, and so forth ? It is easier to pass from them to the idea of
atomic mass. Gram atoms of the different metals can be kept for illustration
and experiment. To this order the cleanliness and simplicity of the plaster-of-

Paris method lend themselves admirably. Besides, this is the true historical

method.

    Later on in the work the gases and the laws of gases and solutions may be profit-

ably taken up. Indeed, study of the gases arises naturally from the experiments in

soon attract attention.

     Chemistry is rapidly becoming a branch of physics. Physical methods and

values may well be used, with this difference, that while in physics we deal with
sensible volumes and molar masses, in chemistry we deal with atomic masses and

volumes. It is very easy to pass from one to the other, as in atomic volume,

atomic heat, and similar values.

    When some atomic volumes have been computed and graphically illustrated as

in Table II., which was exhibited at the meeting, at once the students will be
ready to make certain deductions which future experiment will put to the test.
Those elements which exhibit large atomic volumes may be expected to be com-
paratively soft, light, fusible, volatile, soluble, poor conductors of heat and electricity,

chemically intense, exhibiting a constant valency, and are found to readily decom-
pose water, liberating either or H. Their compounds will be hard to reduce,
show great heats of formation, are white or light-coloured, easily soluble, and of
few types, e.g., Na, K, 01, Br, O, S, Ca, Sr, Ba. The elements which exhibit
small atomic volume will be the opposites in every particular ; for example, C'u,
Ag, Pb, Mn, Or, Fe, Ni, Co, &c. Table II. shows the effect of greater or smaller

attraction between like atoms. So much of chemical knowledge may be based on

the physical computations of specific gravity, united with the chemical idea of
reacting masses. The periodic variation of atomic volume should then be exhibited,
and the resulting chemical properties tested in the laboratory work. To prove or
disprove a theory or a law is as valuable an exercise in research methods as the

discovery of new truth. It has the advantage of giving some direction to the

student's search.

   We have in these physical values an explanation for the division of each family

into two groups, which, along with family likenesses, exhibit marked differences,

as Cu, Ag, and Au in Family I., and Zd, Cd, and Hg in Family II. The chemical

relations of the members of any family to each other may be illustrated by two
lines, coalescent at the top, but separating as we descend to the elements of greater

atomic mass.

     Dulong and Petit's law may be used for the computation of some atomic
masses, for if we have a few blocks of different metals, of masses in grams pro-

portional to their reacting masses, it can easily be found by experiment with small
calorimeters that they all have the same capacity for heat, and the value 6-4 has a
definite meaning, as the number of small calors or therms required to heat such
masses 1 degree. The idea of atomic heat becomes easily so clear and definite that

it may be tested in the laboratory and used in atomic mass determinations.
     The most striking physical property used in chemistry is that of colour. The

hint of any colour law at once awakens the spirit of research. It is easy so to
grade experiments that the class readily make their own deductions. Carnelley's

law may be stated in this form. Given the following chromatic scale,

                  Atomic Mass, Temperature, and Valency

                        Atomic Volume, and Hydration

    The reactions on gypsum tablets give many examples of this.
     The general condition is that condensation of matter tends to move the shades

toward the less refrangible end of the spectrum from white to black. Hydration

generally has the effect of dilution, and rise of temperature the same effect as con-
centration, as Ostwald has shown to be the case in aqueous solutions, and as is
found to be the case in solutions in borax and metaphosphoric acid.

     The question of valency is one troublesome to the student, chiefly on account of
the variation among the elements and variations in the behaviour of the one
element. This may be reduced to order, and variations in valency are seen to be

part of a system. The rise and fall of Taleucy in the linearly arranged elements
follows this form :

in general terms, therefore, the valency for the eight families is the same as the
number of the family. General formulae can be written for the chlorides, oxides,

Mand hydroxides, MC1,,, M^O,,, M(OH),,, where stands for any member of a family,

and n for the number of the family. The derivation of the ortho acids and salts,
the pyro and meta salts and acids, is shown in Table III., which exhibits the
ideal system of compounds which the elements tend to form. The gist of this is
not new ; but is not the whole system, exhibited en bloc, more easily comprehended
than as usually presented, and would not a chart of this form in the lecture-room
rand laboratory simpUfy the matter of naming compounds and reduce a chaos of

symbols and names into impressive order ?
     Isomorphism is another physical phenomenon easily shown and appreciated.

It is of value because it gives an optical demonstration of the fact that when
elements act with similar valency, they show other chemical likenesses, even when
they are widely separated in the natural classification, e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba and
dyad manganese aluminium, and triad chromium, &c. Tho table of isomorphism

By making use of the tinetic theory of solutions under the head of equilibrium

when the study of gases is entered upon, evaporation, diifusion, vapour and osmotic

pressure, solution pressure, dissociation, tension, and ionisation may be treated

together most advantageously. Clearer ideas are obtained, time is greatly econo-

mised, and living interest is added to the subject. Where chemistrj' is taken up

.subsequently to a course in experimental physics, or concurrently, the two courses

may be made to supplement each other. In the descriptions of a family and the

tabulation of value.s, the same principle of classification may be extended, and

graphical curves will prove abundantly useful. Dr. M. M. Pattisou Muir's articles in

' Watts's Dictionary ' on the groups of elements are fine examples of what I moan,

myand    plea is for a larger use of this method in elementary classes.

   --II. Simpler Apparatus for more fruitful Research Methods. The substitution

of plaster tablets for charcoal, as a blowpipe support, has made possible for elemen-
tary and high schools a clean and cheap method for studying a wide range of
chemical changes, without gas pipes and Bunsen burners, water pipes and pneu-

matic troughs, rubber and glass tubing, stills, retorts or sinks, gas generators, or

hoods. These need be at the hand of the teacher only. On an ordinary school
desk, with a two-cent blowpipe lamp as shown upon the table, a blowpipe,
some paraffin wax for fuel, three or four ounce and one half-ounce bottles for re-

agents, and a supply of tablets, all of which can be kept in a box the size of an
ordinary crayon box, experiments can be made testing the fusibility, volatility,
oxidisabilitj', and reducibility of the metals. The oxides, sulphides, chlorides,

bromides, and iodides may be formed, and their colours and volatility and solubility

noted.

     The effect of coloured ions in solutions at high temperatures can be observed iu
borax and meta-phosphoric glasses without any expenditure for platinum wire.
The quantity of chemical material needed is comparatively a negligible quantity.
Within three minutes after a class has entered the laboratory, they have reached
results and are recording their observations. In no other form of laboratory
work do the compelled acts of judgment follow each other so rapidly. Research

methods may be rigorously followed.
    The following problems may be illustrated and studied by means of simple

manipulations of this meagre apparatus : The changes which take place in a
burning match and the products of combustion ; the effect of mass action on
chemical affinity ; the energy changes which take place in fusion and volatilisa-

tion, and the effect of cold surfaces on the precipitation of sublimates ; and the
conditions of equilibrium between layers of heated gases, besides the formation of
a very large number of compounds and exhibition of their properties. All results

reached by the dry way should be correlated with analogous results reached in
the wet way and the corresponding equations written.

     All equations are better written for atomic quantities. The above equation
does not note any heat of dissociation of the gas, nor the heat used up in expansion
against atmospheric pressure. These also may be indicated.

     Practice in writing such equations leads to more thorough appreciation of the

conditions in which chemical changes take place. It is remarkable in how few

cases a work like Watts's ' Dictionary of Chemistry' gives all the numerical values
for the symbols used above. This method of writing equations is easily extended
to compounds.

     In the plaster-of-Paris method results are reached so rapidly, and the method
of procedure in different cases is so similar, that a rapid form of note-takino- is

allowable and necessary. By paragraphing in the following manner the note-books

are more easily e.xamined by the teacher, and permit of readier comparison of metal

           3. On tlui Chemistry and the Atomic Weight of Thorium,
                   By Professor Bohuslav Brauner, Prague.

   The author finds that the reaction -which forms the basis of the separation of
thorium from other Bare Earth Metals, is due to the formation of a new complex
salt containing for one molecule of thorium oxalate, two molecules of ammonium
oxalate, and four or seven molecules of water. The salt is decomposed by -water,
but it can be kept in solution by the presence of one additional molecule of

ammonium oxalate. He shows ho-w this behaviour may be used for the prepar-

ation of pure thorium salts. The thorium oxalate prepared in this -way was
analysed by determining the ratio of thorium oxide to oxalic acid (by means of
permanganate), and the number 232-5 (0 = 16) -was obtained. The author shows
that Meve's number, Th = 234-5, is too high, the oxalate being easily decomposed

(basic salt is formed) by the action of hot water.

4. The Atomic Weights of Nickel and Cobalt} By Professor Theodore
            W. Richards, A. S. Cushman, and G. P. Baxter.

    Four samples of the pure bromide of each metal -were made and analysed. Two

of the nickel preparations were freed from cobalt by ordinary processes, and two
were purified by Mond's process. Fractional crystallisation of the ammonia-
bromide was adopted as a means of further purification, after all known impuri-
ties had been removed ; and the fourth sample of nickel was also precipitated
fractionally by electrolysis. Each specimen was precipitated as hydroxide from

the ammonia-bromide by boiling its aqueous solution in a platinum dish, thus
insuring the absence of alkalies and silica. The hydroxide was ignited, the oxide

reduced, and the bromide formed by the action of bromine vapour at a red heat.

Sample I. was the least carefully treated. Sample IV. the most.
     In the case of the cobalt, similar precautions were taken. The first sample

was purified by fractional precipitation as the double nitrite with potassium ; the

second sample by successive conversions  into  a cobaltamine  compound                                             the third
                                                                                                                ;

by a combination of both of these methods ; and the fourth by the resublimation

of the third specimen.

     All the samples of both bromides were sublimed as anhydrous crystals in a
stream of hydrobromic acid gas ; the specific gravity of the nickel salt was found

to be 4-64, and that of the cobalt salt 4-91. The bromides were ignited, bottled,

and weighed by means of the Hichards-Parker drying apparatus ; - and having

been dissolved in water, they were decomposed by argentic nitrate. In the later

analyses, the weight of the silver taken, as well as of the argentic bromide

obtained, was determined.

       1. Demonstration oj the Preparation and Properties of Fluorine.

                             By Professor E. Meslans.

     M. Meslans, after some introductory remarks referring to the researches of M.

Moissan on the preparation of free fluorine, gave a demonstration of the properties
of fluorine, and showed experiments illustrating its action on various elements and
compounds.

    He carried out these experiments with the aid of a new apparatus, made

entirely of copper, except, of course, the lower ends of the electrodes, which, as

usual, consisted of platinum. After having remarked that M. Moissan was the
first to show that copper vessels may be employed in the preparation of fluorine, M.
Meslans went on to describe the apparatus which he had just used, and which was
now being utilised with the object of producing comparatively large amounts
of fluorine, and for experiments on the possible industrial application of the

element, which it is hoped may now become of easy attainment.

                           By Joim WADDEiiL, B.A., D.Sc.

     The paper is partly a discussion of data obtained by Gladstone and Hibbert
and by myself, and already published, and partly an account of a reinvestigation

of the points at issue,
     I have maintained that there is no great difference between the permeability of

lithium and sodium, and that it is hardly correct to say that lithium has next to no
absorbent action on the Rontgen rays.

     Beryllium and magnesium and boron and aluminium have been also compared
as to absorbent power and found to be nearly equal, so that among the elements
of low atomic weight (all below aluminium) there is no sudden or rapid rise of
absorbent action with atomic weight.

     Experiments intended to elucidate the peculiar granular appearance of coarse
powders are also described.

5. Continuation of Exp)eriments on Chemical Constitution and the Absorp-

 Xtion of Rays. By J. H. Gladstone, D.Sc, F.R.S., and W. Hibbert.

     In the work recorded last year the authors sometimes introduced an alu-
minium scale into their photographs for the purpose of giving quantitative coai-

Xparisons of the amount of absorption of rays due to various substances. They

have now endeavoured to estimate the absorption by means of a Lummer-Brodhun
photometer. The aluminium scale, when thus examined, showed that the rays

absorbed by different thicknesses varied nearly in a logarithmic ratio.

the comparison is so made that the amount of substance traversed by the rajs is

in the proportion of the chemical equivalents, the following was found to be tha

     Experiments made to determine whether an element has the same ahsorption
in the metallic and the combined condition showed that in the case of copper (and
perhaps other instances) the metal absorbed more than its oxides.

     The change of atomicity of a metal between one series of its salts and another
 does not seem to be followed by any clearly marked difference in absorption.

      In the case of carbon, the authors have been told by Sir William Crookes that
the absorption of colourless diamond and the black forms of carbon are alike. In
their own experiments it would appear that the absorption of carbon, when com-
bined with hydrogen in amyl hydride, turpentine, benzene, naphthalene, and
anthracene, differs little from that of charcoal or graphite, notwithstanding the-
addition of varying proportions of hydrogen, and the different manner of carbon
linking. But benzene appears to be about 15 per cent, less absorbent than the

others.

           By F. P. DuNNiNGTON, F.C.S., University of Virgitiia.

     In the ' American Journal of Science ' for December, 1891, the author published
an article under the above title, which presented estimations of titanic oxide in the

soil from many quarters of our globe. Since that date he had secured a number of

samples from portions of the earth not then represented. These include specimens

from Australia, New Zealand, Africa, South America, and (ten from) British

America ; also samples taken from a depth of nearly a mile beneath the earth's

surface.

    Determinations of each of these are now presented, showing a range of figures

from 'IS to 3'0 per cent, of the soil.

              9. Deliquescence and Florescence of certain Salts.

           By F. P. DuNNiNGTON, F.C.S., University of Virginia.

The affinity for water which results in deliquescence is considered as accom-

panied by the evolution of heat. The deliquescence of a solid is accompanied

with an alteration of temperature which is the algebraic sum of the heat evolved

by the chemical union of the body with water and of the cold produced through

the liquefaction of the solid.

   A series of determinations were made of the water absorbed from a moist

atmosphere by certain salts during a period of twelve weeks, from which are

selected the figures for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks.*

     One part of each of the anhydrous salts ultimately absorbed of water as

--follows: Lithium chloride, 16-5 parts; Calcium chloride, 7'4 parts; Calcium

47nitrate,  parts ;  Magnesium chloride, 9-3 parts ;        and Magnesium nitrate,

64 parts.

From which it is calculated that one molecule of each of these bodies respect-

ively has combined with: 36-8; 45-8; 43' 1; 49-2; and 527 molecules of water.

     It is proposed to seek to ascertain the limit of the absorption of water by a
salt by observation of the rise of temperature upon mixing a solution of the salt
with more water.

     Estimations were also made of the amounts of water lost in the efflorescence of

certain salts upon prolonged exposure to the atmosphere. Figures are given
showing the losses which took place after seven weeks' exposure of sodium car-
bonate, sodium sulphate, sodium phosphate, borax, ferrous sulphate, zinc sulphate,
«,nd copper sulphate. The sodium sulphate shortly became anhydrous.

  10. Some Notes on Concentrated Solutions of Lithium and other Salts}

                      By John Waddell, B.A., D.Sc, Ph.D.

     The paper is a description of some incorporation experiments, in which lithium
·choride, sulphate, and nitrate are compared with other chlorides, sulphates, and

nitrates.

     The work was undertaken because in some experiments, already described in
the * Chemical News,' it was found that lithium nitrate absorbed more water than
the calculated amount as compared with calcium nitrate. The experiments de-
scribed in these notes show that the phenomenon observed before was accidental,
as some chlorides are more absorbent than lithium chloride, and sodium nitrate, at
all events, is more absorbent than lithium nitrate.

         11. On the Formation of Crystals. By W. L. T. Addison.

                                    By E. C. C. Baly.

    The curious action of ozone on mercury has long been noticed. In some experi-
ments on ozone lately made by the author it was necessary to treat mercury with
large quantities of ozone, and he found that the change in the state of the mercury
is due to the formation of a paste. This paste consists of a mercurial solution of a
solid substance, which may be separated from the paste by filtration through
chamois leather. The solid is then obtained as a hard metallic substance, having
every appearance of an amalgam. This amalgam is a very stable compound at
ordinary temperatures, but, on heating, changes to the black oxide of mercury,
which, on further heating, gives mercury and the yellow modification of HgO.

The substance is not attacked to any extent by hot or cold HCl or HoSO^, but is

converted into HgO by HNO3.

     The author is at present engaged in investigating this substance with the view
of determining its composition.

       13. The Reduction of Bromic Acid and the Law of Mass Action.
   By James Wallace Walker, Ph.D., M.A., and Winifred Judson.

   Many chemical reactions take place so rapidly that an experimental determination

of the rate at which change is taking place is as yet an impossibility others are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

of such long duration that the difficulty of keeping the external conditions constant
during their whole course renders their accurate investigation also impossible ; but a

large number have already been examined in which the time required for a measur-
a,ble amount of change varies from seconds to weeks with the nature of the reaction,
and from a study of these the law connecting the mass of the substance with the
time required for its transformation has been deduced. It is called the Laiv of
Mass Action.

    To take the simplest case, when one molecule of one substance is being trans-

formed into one molecule of another substance, as expressed in the chemical equation

A = A', it is found tliat if tlie reaction proceeds entirely to an end, the velocity is

directly proportional to c, the concentration of A, But since all reactions of thia

nature do not go on at the same rate when their concentrations are the same,

another factor must be introduced which is distinctive for each reaction. The

Vvelocity is therefore = k.c, where A; is a constant for each separate reaction. It is

called the velocity constant. The concentration of c of course diminishes as the

Vreaction proceeds, and therefore the velocity also diminishes ; but if we start

with a known concentration a, and determine the amount x, which has been

changed after a definite interval of time t, the concentration will now be a -- x,

and the amount changed in the next very small interval of time dt is called dx,

and is proportional to the concentration at that point, so that the velocity is
-- = Z;(a-.r)
                                                              ;  x  of  course  varies   between        the  values     and a, so that the above

     This is the equation for a mono-molecular reaction, and it can be employed to

discover whether a particular reaction is mono-molecular or not. For this purpose
experiments are made with several different values of the initial concentration a,

and from each of these a large number of observations of x and its corresponding

time t are obtained. When these experimental values for a, x and t are substituted

in the equation

                                                                                         7 T,             a

                                                                                                 t            >

If the reaction be really mono-molecular they will all give the same value for k.
If they do not it is not a mono-molecular reaction.

  --When the reaction is bi-molecular for example,

                                  A + B = A' + B'

it is found that the velocity is proportional to the product of the concentrations cf

which shows that when two, or generally n, molecules of a substance take part in
the reaction, the concentration of that substance must be raised to the n"* power

in the expression for the velocity of the reaction, e.g., in the reaction

                                    7nA + «B = J?A' + jB'

                   V - A-Cj" c/ or p' = k(a - a;)"' (« - a-)",

on substituting the observed values of «, b, x, and t in the integrated form of this

mequation it can be found by trial and error what the correct values of and n are

which always give a constant value for k.

   A mono-molecular reaction ought to give a constant with the equation of the first

order, a bi-molecular with the equation of the second order, &c. Sometimes the

orders so found are in agreement with what we should expect from the chemical

equations, and sometimes they are not so, showing that the chemical equations do

not always represent fully the mechanism of a reaction. For example, we should

expect to find that both the inversion of cane sugar, in which one molecule of
sugar is changed into one of glucose and one of laevulose, and the change of ammo-

nium cyanate into urea

                             /NH,

                             NH.CNO = (JO         are reactions of the first order.

The determination of the reaction velocity shows in the manner above described

that this is true of the former, but that the latter is a reaction of the second

Weorder.  must therefore assume that the two ions of ammonium cyanate NH^ and

CNO react as two molecules.

Our object in this investigation was to determine the nature of the reaction

between bromic and hydrobromic acids. According to the chemical equation

5 HBr + HBrOj = 3 Ufi + 3 Br^ since there are in all 6 molecules on the left
--side of the equation, we should expect that only the equation
                                                                   =}i(a-xY

would give a constant value for 7c. This expectation is, however, not borne out

by the experimental results, they show that the reaction, whose velocity is being
Wemeasured, is only one of the second order instead of the sixth.
                                                                   must therefore

assume that the first stage of the reduction is expressed by the chemical equation

HBr + HBr03 = HBrO + HBrOj, and that these acids when formed are instantly

decomposed by the hydrobromic acid present, thus

           HBr + HBrO = H^O + Br^ and
          8 HBr + HBrOj = 2 H,0 + 2 Br^.

The reaction consists in the formation of bromine and water, and the experimental
method employed consists in titrating the liberated bromine by a standard solution of
sodium thiosulphate. In the first set of experiments the free bromic and hydro-
bromic acids were liberated from the solution of their salts by addition of a

definite large excess of sulphuric acid, the conditions being so arranged that its

concentration was the same in each experiment. The duration of an experiment
was noted from the time of addition of the sulphuric acid which started the
reaction. In the first series the solution was x^th normal with respect to KBr,
and ^^^jth normal with respect to /cBrOj and the mean value of h obtained from

Athe integrated form of ---^ = A; (5a 5a;) (a - x) was 0-00423.    second series of

experiments, in which the concentration of ZjBrOj was the same, but that of

KBr doubled, i.e., ^^ normal, gave as the mean value of It 0'00451 ; and when
the concentration of the KBrOg was also doubled the mean value of k was 0'00427.

These results are obtained by employing an equation of the second degree, so that

the reaction whose velocity is being measured must be looked upon as bi-molecular.

It consists in the production of HBrO and HBrO,, according to the equation
given above, viz., HBr + HBrO,, = HBrO + HBrO.,.

      This leads us to expect that the reaction which, in the presence of a large

-- --excess of sulphuric acid or of hydrogen ions is bi-molecular, in its absence is of a

higher order, probably tetra-molecular. Because, in the light of the ionic theory,

                             --+ -- --

the equation must be written thus 2H + Br + BrOj = HBrO + HBrO.,, bromous

and hypobromous acids being, from analogy with the corresponding chlorine com-

--pounds, very weak acids i.e. very slightly ionised. This expectation was fully

verified by an examination of the reaction between hydrobromic and bromic acids

in the absence of sulphuric acid.

   We performed two series of experiments, in the first of which the bromic acid
61G REPORT-- 1897.

was xitrt^ ^^^ ^^^ hydrobromic acid ^^^th normal, in the second ^"(jth and ^ijth

normal respectively. When the equation of the second order, viz.

was employed for calculation with these experimental results, it gave no approach
to a constant value for k ; but when they were substituted in the integrated form

-- --of = A --(a a;)* the equation of the 4th order--the first series gave a mean

value of 00113-^10*, and the second series 0-00119-=-10'. The agreement is as
close as could be expected from the experimental method.

      These experiments confirm the conclusion that the reduction of bromic acid
takes place in stages, the first of which consists in the formation of bromous and
hypobromous acids. It further shows that these acids, which have never been
isolated, are excessively unstable in presence of hydrobromic acid, and points to a

method for their preparation which we intend to investigate.

     The following Papers were read :

1. On the Coinjjosition of Canadian Virgin Soils} 7?y Frank T. Siiutt,

        M.A., F.I.C., F.C.S., Chemist, Dominion Experimental Farms.

     The soil investigations carried on in the laboratories of the Dominion Experi-
mental Farms at Ottawa have included the chemical and physical examination of
certain typical virgin (uncropped and unmanured) soils. The samples were carefully

collected in the various provinces of the Dominion, and may be regarded as types

or representatives of areas of fair uniformity and considerable magnitude.
     Data respecting all the soils analysed are not included in this Paper, and only

the more important elements of fertility of these here presented have been dis-
cussed. The majority of the samples considered are surface soils, but in a large
number of instances the results obtained upon their respective sub-soils have been

inserted.

     The exact value of an ordinary soil analysis in ascertaining the fertility or
productiveness of a soil is considered, and while it is admitted that hot hydro-
chloric acid (sp. gr. 1'115) dissolves larger amounts of mineral plant food than are
of immediate availability to crops, it is pointed out that a knowledge of the

' maximum ' amounts shows decisively deficiencies, if any exist, and thus indicates

lines for rational and economic treatment of the soil with fertilisers. Further,

it is held that soils possessing large ' maximum ' amounts will in all proba-

bility prove more fertile than those showing smaller percentages, the climatic
influences in both cases being equally favourable.

     The diagnosis of a soil as regards productiveness cannot be made from chemical

analysis alone, even if such includes a determination of the so-called ' available

plant food. The phy.sical condition of the soil, drainage, rainfall, mean tempera-
ture, sunshine, &c., are factors that must receive careful consideration.

     Pot or plot experiments with various fertilisers are at present the only means
of gaining reliable or accurate knowledge of a soil's needs, but the incentive given
by Dr. Dyer in 1894, in publishing his results by the 1 per cent, citric acid solution,
has resulted in many agricultural chemists on this continent directing their atten-
tion to this important subject, and the probabilities are that, ere long, laboratory
methods will be agreed upon for determining available plant food in soils.

ment Station, are stated, and deductions made from Canadian data given. The

--latter show that good agricultural soils possess usually between '25 per cent, and

·5 per cent, of potash less than 'IS indicating the need of potassic fertilisers:
phosphoric acid is usually between "15 per cent, and "25 per cent., but the adequacy
of the element depends largely on the amount of lime associated with it. In lime,

less than 1 per cent, in clay soils indicates that their productiveness will be in-
creased by an application of a calcareous fertiliser. Peaty soils have always

responded well to a dressing of lime. Richness in nitrogen invariably indicates,

in Canada, loams of excellent productiveness. The larger number of our good
soils contain between ·125 per cent, and '225 per cent, of nitrogen ; many, however,
reach "5 per cent., and some exceed 1-0 per cent. From the standpoint of chemical
composition the richest soils of the samples examined comprise those collected on
the prairies of the North-West and those of alluvial origin.

                                                      British Columbia.

     As far as our investigations have carried us, the soils of this province fall into
three well-marked groups : (a) Deltaic, as at the mouth of the Fraser and Pitt Rivers,
very rich in plant food ; (b) Valley soils, of alluvial origin and of more than average
fertility ; and (c) Bench and plateau soils at varying altitudes, frequently light and
sandy, ranging from very poor soils to those of medium fertility.

      Table I. presents data from twenty-nine samples, collected in the districts of

Vancouver Island, New Westminister, Yale and Cariboo. The amounts of plant

food and the chief physical character of these soils receive consideration, and
deductions are made therefrom as to their relative fertility.

                               North- West Territories and Manitoba.

     The prairie soils of these regions present considerable uniformity in character.
They are justly noted for their productiveness, for analysis has shown them to

contain, as a rule, large percentages of the essential constituents of plant food.

Especially are they rich in humus and nitrogen. The prevailing prairie soil is a
black or greyish-black loam, in which nitrification proceeds rapidly when the soil

is tilled.

     Attention is drawn to the fact that alkali soils are almost invariably found to
contain an abundant supply of plant food. Thorough drainage and irrigation
would convert them into fertile soils. Such methods, unfortunately, are not
always feasible.

      Table II. gives analytical data of eiglit typical surface soils from these pro-

vinces, those of a sample from the prairie soil of the Eed River Valley being dis-
cussed in detail. The results demonstrate clearly that it may be classed among the
richest of known soils.

                                                                  Ontario.

     Data are presented in Table III., obtained from soils collected in this district of
Muskoka only. These soils are characterised by a preponderance of sand, being
such as would be classed as light loams. Clay loams, however, are occasionally
met with. The chief deficiencies are in humus and nitrogen (frequently resulting
from destructive forest fires), and in lime. Speaking of them as a class, the Mus-
koka soils are scarcely heavy enough for wheat. Good yields of oats, potatoes,
and root and fodder crops generally, are, under a good system of culture, readily
obtained in favourable seasons.

                                       Quebec.

The analytical results of sand and clay loams obtained from widely difl^erent

areas in this province are contained in Table IV. Much variation, as might be

expected, in  composition  is  to  be  observed                                      but, though  some  show inadequate

quantities of certain elements for best results, all the surface samples come well
within the ascertained limits of fertility, and many of the soils are seen to
compare most favourably with those of recognised productiveness.

                                             The Maritime Provinces.

     The analyses of several typical soils in the Maritime Provinces are given in
Table V. Prominent among these is one from the Sackville Marsh, N.B., at the
head of the Bay of Fundy. The tides of this bay are phenomenally high, carrying

with them vast amounts of detritus. Large deposits of this so-called marsh mud

consequently form, and this material is highly prized by most farmers as an im-
prover, being applied at the rate of 100 to 200 loads per acre. Reclaimed marsb
lands are found to be exceedingly fertile.

     Particulars are presented of a typical soil from Prince Edward Island. It is
seen to be inferior in several particulars to many of our Western soils, and it would
seem, therefore, that this province, justly known as a fertile one, owes its reputa-

tion rather to good soil texture and favourable climatic conditions than to large
percentages of food constituents.

            Averages and Deductions.

     Table VI. shows the averages of the results from the soils examined, taken
province by province. The data, however, are only to be interpreted as represent-

ing the composition of soils of large areas in the respective provinces.

     General conclusions are drawn which indicate that in all the provinces large
tracts of untilled land exist that would rank with the fertile soils of other coun-
tries, and, further, it is shown that many Canadian soils are possessed of most
abundant stores of plant food, stores so vast as to allow of their most favourable
comparison with the richest soils of which we have any knowledge.

                6. Condensation Products of Aldehydes and Amides.

                       By Charles A. Kohn, Ph.D., B.Sc

     The products obtained originally by Roth by heating together benzaldehyde and
acetamide or other aliphalic amides, or benzaldehyde and benzamide, are only
formed in comparatively small quantity when the two substances are heated to
incipient boiling, very many recrystallisations being necessary in order to get the
resulting product pure, owing to the presence of by-products. After trying various
condensing agents it was found that by passing dry hydrochloric acid gas into a
boiling benzene solution of benzaldehyde and benzamide in the proportion of one
molecule of the former to two of the latter, a yield of 75 per cent, of the pure
product, which crystallises in long needles melting at 220°, is obtained. Analysis

confirms Roth's formula, the condensation taking place according to the equation

           C,H,.CHO + 2C6H,.CO.NH, = CcH,.CH(NH.CO.C,,H,), + H^O

                                                                          Benzylidene dibenzamide.

The reaction, however, when carried out under similar conditions in the case of

acetamide and benzaldehyde, yields the hydrochloride of acetyl-benzylidene-imide

or acetyl-benzalimide as a beautifully crystalline compound, which is decomposed

by all hydrolytic agents.

The reaction is best effected in a benzene solution containing equi-molecular

proportions of acetamide and benzaldehyde into which the dry hydrochloric acid gas

Ais passed.  yield of 70 per cent, of the hydrochloride is obtained, which begins

to melt with decomposition at 130° to 131°. Both analysis and the quantitive

decomposition of the substance by water point to the formula CyHgNO.HCl. Its

formation is represented as follows

             ail-.CHO + CIIj.CONH^ + HCl
                                          = C,H,,.CH : N.CO.CH3.HOI + H,0.

     It is decomposed by water according to the equation

                              aHj.CH : N.C0CH,.H01 + H,.0

                                     = CJLCHO + CH3.CONH,, + HCl.

      This substance, therefore, appears to be the acetyl derivative of the benzalimide
prepared by Busch, and presents similar conditions of instability to the latter. It is
not attacked by cold water at once, but if gently warmed, and then allowed to cool
immediately after solution has taken place, the analogous product to that obtained
with benzaldehyde and benzamide results, a body previously prepared by Roth. It

forms acicular needles, and melts at 233°. The change may be represented thus,

one molecule of aldehyde being separated :

               CcH-.CH : N.CO.CH3.HCI              '^T^T^'n^

             + CX-CH : N.CO.CH3.HCI

                                  = C,IL .CIIO + C,H,,.CII(NII.COCIl3)2 + 2HC1.

                                                                 Benzylidene diacetamide.

A good yield of this substance is obtained directly by passing dry hydrochloric

acid gas into a melted mixture of the two constituents in suitable proportions.

Analogous decompositions by alcohols   are  under  investigation                                                     also  the  con-

densation products of other aldehydes, ketones and allied bodies both with amides,

nitriles, thioamides and sulphamides.

By the action of sodium amide on benzaldehyde in benzene solution the sodium

salt of benzalimide is obtained as a voluminous white srelatinous precipitate,

which when dry forms an amorphous white powder, immediately decomposed by

water with evolution of ammonia.

The equations representing these reactions are :

             C«H5.CH0 + NaNH. =- C,H,.CH : N.Na + H.,0
             CgHj.CH : N.Na + 2H,,0 = Cell- .COH + NHg' + NaOH.

     Ketones react similarly. The properties of these bodies and the reaction with
hetonic and aldehydic bodies, as ·well as with simple ketones and aldehydes, are

being studied.

   A further object of the investigation is the preparation of the theoretically

possible stereo-isomers of these imido-compounds. In addition, the therapeutic

value of benzylidene-diacetamide and benzylidene-dibenz amide is being studied in
conjunction with Dr. A. Griinbaum.

7. A New Form of Bunsen Burner, By Hugh Marshall, D.Sc.

The ordinary form of Bunsen burner has several drawbacks. One of these,

which makes itself especially felt in a large practical class, is the liability of the central

gas jet to become choked by matters falling down the tube : fused beads of borax,

&c., are particularly troublesome in this way. "Various modifications were experi-

mented with, in order, if possible, to obtain a form of burner which would over-
come this difficulty. None of these were satisfactory until the expedient was

adopted of abolishing the central jet altogether and introducing the gas through

lateral openings. Burners on this principle were found to be superior to the old

ones in several ways.

The base consists of a star-shaped gun-metal tripod, with an opening and short

tube in the centre ; at one side of the opening, below the tube, is a small rectangu-

Alar block. This block carries the horizontal gas supply tube.  hole of suitable

diameter is drilled through the block from the end of the gas tube to the central

tube. This serves as a jet for the introduction of the gas. Into the central tube

is screwed a vertical brass tube of convenient length, as in an ordinary burner.

The new style of burner therefore differs from the old in having an inclined

lateral opening in place of a central gas jet ; in having the bottom of the tube

open right through to the bench, and in having no lateral air holes.

It is found that the flame can be turned down very low without requiring any

regulation of the air supply, and, so far as that is concerned, an ah" regulator is

almost superfluous. In order to obtain a luminous flame, however, a regulator is

fitted on the under side of the base. It consists simply of a pivoted diaphragm of

sheet brass, with an arm projecting beyond the base to admit of easy manipulation.

Further improvements are contemplated with regard to this part of the

mechanism, however.

   A considerable number of burners have been made on this plan, and have been

in use for several months. They work very satisfactorily.

considerable losses of gold occur. It has been generally believed that the losses
are due to volatilisation, although little direct evidence of this has been brought

glass tube was passed, kept cool by a current of cold water (hot and cold tube). The
alloys were treated for different periods of time up to one hour, at temperatures

between 500° and 1100° C, in currents of different gases, air, carbonic oxide,

hydrogen, and water gas (carbonic oxide and hydrogen in about equal volumes)
heing used in successive experiments.

     In each case the whole or a part of the tellurium was sublimed and condensed
on the cold tube, but the sublimates in only one case contained a trace of gold, in
the other cases the whole of the gold being found still to remain in the boat. The
exception was when air was used as the atmosphere, the oxide of tellurium con-
densed on the cold tube in that case being found to contain 0'03 per cent, of the

total gold originally present.

   A second series of experiments on a tellurium ore from Western Australia con-

taining over 1,000 oz. of gold per ton gave similar results.
     The heavy losses incurred in roasting tellurides appear to be due in reality to

liquation, the entectic of gold and tellurium having a very low melting point, so
that some of it passes through the mass and soaks into the furnace bottom at tem^
peratures below a red heat.

6, The Nitro-Alcohols.^ By Louis Henry, Professor of Chemistry iii the

                                       " University of Louvain.

The method of preparation used by the author consists in the condensation of

aldehydes with nitro-parafRns. The condensation takes place in the presence of

Awater and of an alkali.  noticeable disengagement of heat accompanies the

reaction. He found that the condensation of the nitro-paraflin -uith aldehyde is

dependent upon the presence of hydrogen atoms linked to the carbon atom holding

the nitro group, and it does not occur with the tertiary nitm-paraffins. The

capacity of condensation also varies with the number of hydrogen atoms existing

in the nitro-carbon chain. This capacity for condensation can be exercised either

completely or incompletely and gradually, replacing but one of the two hydrogen

atoms available at a time. The intensity of the reaction depend,- on the number

of hydrogen atoms and on the molecular weight not only of the aldehydes but of

the nitro-paraffins. It is greatest with formic aldehyde ; it is at its maximum

also in nitro-methane.

     All nitro-alcohols are colourless, and cannot be distilled at ordinary pressure
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

It also appears not to take place with the aromatic aldehydes, notably with benzoic

     In a paper published in the October number of the ' Journal of the American
Chemical Society,' entitled ' Some Extensions of the Plaster of Paris Method in Blow-
pipe Analysis,' the author gave some account of the development of this method since
Dr. Eugene Haanel first proposed this new support.- The new composition of the
tablets, the new easily prepared and portable reagents, and the reactions they yield
with the metals were there described. The author now gives some new applica-
tions of this support and some new reactions. The iodide coatings of the metals

are shown.

tablets so fortifies them that they form a substitute, not only for charcoal, but also

for platinum wire and bone ash. They resist the action of the fluxes, borax and

metaphosphoric acid, and instead of beads in platinum loops we may with advan-

tage produce coloured glassy films on the surface of the white tablets. Oxidation

and reduction take place very readily in these films. All degrees of saturation

may be observed at once. The colour changes due to change of temperature may

be more accurately observed on account of the slower rate of cooling.

     In assay work, if a fragment of a tablet be heated to redness for a few seconds

and then pulverised, we have a material which may be moulded into a smooth cupel

which does not blister, and which very readily absorbs the lead oxide in cupellation.

Potassium sulphocyanate, metallic iodine, potassium cyanide, potassium sul-

phide, and potassium cadmium cyanide are all easy to carry. With water they

easily dissolve, and therefore solutions may be prepared anywhere. In the labora-

tory more rapid and better work can be done with the solutions. Potassium sulpho-

cyanate is not always kept by the drugsrists, and its preparation by crystallisation

in the laboratory is tedious. The simplest way to prepare the iodine solution is to
mix fragments of potassium cyanide and sulphur, the latter a little in excess of

the molecular proportions, in a test tube and fuse together, adding water while yet

warm, and then adding metallic iodine to saturation. Dr Wirt Tassin, of Wash-

ington, uses a solid reagent made by fusing iodine and the sulphocyanate together

with a little sulphur, and then powdering. This, if stable, ought to prove very

satisfactory.

Here is a very effective portable blowpipe lamp which costs less than two

cents. It consists of an ordinary druggist's tin salve box, with a piece of tin

bent to form a wick-holder. The cover is bulged so as to shut down over the
wick. The fuel is paraffin wax or stearin. The flame is smokeless, very hot, and

with great reducing power and free from sulphur. Once filled, it burns for more
Athan an hour.
                test tube can be readily boiled over it. In private laboratories,

and in schools in towns, where the electric light has supplanted gas, and afield,

this httle piece of simple apparatus has proved itself very useful.

Some reactions, not hitherto published, are those obtained by using the tablets

as infusible filters. Films are obtained, for which I propose the name ' solution

films,' to distinguish them from the sublimation films.

If to a solution of a lead salt a little potassium sulphocyanate be added, a pre-

cipitate of lead sulphocyanate tends to form. When, however, no precipitate is

visible, if a drop be let fall on a tablet, instantly a bright-yellow spot is seen. The
delicacy of many tests may be greatly increased by making use of this property of

the tablets. It seems to be somewhat catalytic. Not only one, but as many ns

fifty or one hundred drops may fall upon the same spot, each drop deepening the

coloration. Various confirmatory tests by wet or dry methods may then be made.

The iodine solution shows a remarkable power of dissolving gold. Gold leaf

dropped on its surface almost instantly dissolves. If the solution containing gold

be dropped on a tablet and the spot touched with the blowpipe flame, a fine pink

film appears. It is better to add ammonium hydrate to the solution till de-

colorised. One drop of solution containing one part gold, in thirty thousand

will show a fine pink. Fifty drops will show gold present in one part in six hun-

dred thousand and one hundred drops, one part in one million of solution. The
test, therefore, may be made quantitative.

Platinum yields a slate-coloured film, chromium a film dark-green hot, and fine-

green cold Copper yields a purple film, which, treated with sulphuric acid, dis-

appears and darkens in oxidising flame. From some solutions the copper film is

black. If a copper solution be dropped on a tablet and heated vapours of hydro-

bromic acid be blown over it, the purplish-brown of cupric bromide will appear.

This will reveal copper, when present, one part in two million parts of solution.

Iron gives a brownish film, which sulphuric acid turns to Venetian red, and

other acids remove. 4 little metaphosphoric acid added to the solution will pre-

vent the formation of the film. Cobalt yields a pink film, which becomes, on

hydration, a beautiful blue, and more strongly heated a black, which a dj-op of

strong acid potassium sulphate removes.

     Nickel yields a pale-green film, which, dehydrated, becomes a brownish-yellow

and then a black. Ammonium hydrate turns the solution a fine blue.
    Nickel may be detected in the presence of cobalt. The solution will probably

be colourless, unless iron be present, when it will be amethystine. If a drop of

the iodine solution be added to the section of the tablet, wetted by the metallic
solution, and heated, the centre wiU be black, showing nickel, for in such circum-

stances the cobalt tends to leave a white centre, forming a black ring with

sometimes a blue ring separating it from the centre, outside that a brownish yellow
showing nickel, and farther out a spreading blue showing cobalt. The thio-
cyanate heated in the presence of an acid yields a yellow spot, which must be
distinguished from the nickel film. The salts experimented with were the nitrates

and sulphates, and when cobalt was six times as abundant as the nickel, the reac-

tions of the latter were well marked.

Manganese, vanadium, molybdenum, ruthenium, and osmium also yield solu-

tion films.

Potassium cadmium cyanide has been found to be a reagent which afibrds a

very delicate and ready test for sulphur even in the presence of selenium and

tellurium.

     Potassium sulphocyanate solution was added to a cadmium solution and
dropped on a tablet and heated, and the scarlet of hot cadmium sulphide showed
itself. Sixteen drops revealed the presence of cadmium in a ~- normal solution,

and this test was not interfered with by the presence of two hundred times as
much zinc.

Zinc in the cobalt test responded with great delicacy, but aluminium gave no

very delicate results, on account of the calcium reaction of the tablet itself.
     Another extension of this method is to the compounds of organic chemistry.
     Carbon gives a sooty coating which metaphosphoric and sulphuric acids in-

crease. Tars and asphalts give a black tinged with green.

The phenols with the same reagents yield a black edged with a pinkish red.

--Picric acid is the only exception found so far. It gives a yellow. The following

were among the phenols treated carbolic acid, pyrogallol, salicylic acid, oils of

coniine and wintergreen, Canada balsam, Burgundy pitch, resin, phenol phthalein,

hydroquinone, and creolin Many of the phenols when dropped on a tablet pre-

viously heated before the blowpipe show very brilliant and characteristic colours.

WeThe paraflins yield no red, but heavy sooty, films.      have therefore group

and individual tests.

Pkesideitt of the Section--Dk. G. M. Dawson, C.M.G., F.R.S.

                    THURSDAY, AUGUST 19.

The President delivered the following Addi-ess :

The nature and relations of the more ancient rocks of North America are problems

particularly Canadian, for these rocks in their typical and most easily read develop-

ment either constitute or border upon the continental Protaxis of the North. The

questions involved are, however, at the same time, perhaps more intimately con-

nected with a certain class of world-wide geological phenomena than any of those

relating to later formations, in which a greater degree of differentiation occurrecJ

Aas time advanced.  reasonably satisfactory classification of the crystalline rocks

beneath those designated as Palaeozoic was first worked out in the Canadian region

by Logan and bis colleagues, a classification of which the validity was soon after

generally recognised. The greatest known connected area of such rocks is em-

braced within the borders of Canada, and, if I mistake not, the further understand-

ing of the origin and character of these rocks is likely to depend very largely upon

work now in progress, or remaining to be accomplished here.

This being the case, it seems very appropriate to direct such remarks as I may

be privileged to make on the present occasion chiefly to these more ancient rocks,

and the subject is one which cannot fail to present itself in concrete form to the

visiting members of this Section. Personally I cannot claim to have engaged ia

extended or close investigations of these rocks, and there is little absolutely new

in what I can say in respect to them ; but work of the kind is still actively in

progress by members of the staff of the Geological Survey, and the classification

and discrimination of these older terranes present themselves to us daily as im-

portant subjects of consideration in connection with the mapping of vast areas

so that, if still admittedly imperfect in many respects, our knowledge of them

must be appraised, and, at least provisionally, employed in a practical way in order

to admit of the progress of the surveys in hand.

Although it is intended to speak chiefly of the distinctively pre-Cambrian rocks

of Canada, and more particularly of the crystalline schists, it will be necessary

also to allude to others, in regard to the systematic position of which dift'erences

of opinion exist. Of the Cambrian itself, as distinguished by organic remains,

little need be said, but it is essential to keep in touch with the palaeontologically

established landmarks on this side, if for no other reason than to enable us to

realise in some measure the vast lapse of time, constituting probably one of the

most important breaks in geological history, by which the Cambrian and its allied

rocks are separated from those of the Huronian and Laurentian systems.

In attempting to review so wide a subject and one upon which so much has already

been written, the chief difficulty is to determine how much may be legitimately

eiiminated -while still retaiuiiig the important features. This must be largely a

matter of individual judgment, and I can only hope to present what appear to me

to be the essential points, with special reference to the geology of Canada. The
useful object of any such review is, of course, to bring out what may now actually
he regarded as established respecting these older rocks, and in what direction the
most hopeful outlook exists for improving our knowledge of them. For this pur-
pose, the best mode of approaching the subject, in the first place, and up to a

certain point, is the historical one, and it will thus be desirable to recapitulate

briefly the first steps made in the classification of the crystalline schists in Canada.

This is the more appropriate, because of the substantial accuracy of these first

observations, and the fact that they have since been largely buried out of sight by

a copious controversial literature of later growth.

    Soon after the Geological Survey of Canada was begun, now more than fifty
years ago, Logan (who in the earlier years of tlie work may almost be said to

have alone constituted the staff") found himself confronted with the great areas of
crystalline rocks forming the continental Protaxis. The existing geological edifice

has been so largely the result of the past half century of work, that it is not now

easy to realise the elementary condition in which its foundations lay at that time.

It was then but ten years since Sedgwick and Murchison had given form to their

discoveries in regard to the Cambrian and Silurian, and a still shorter time since

tlie definitive publication of the classification of the Cambrian and the appearance

of the ' Silurian System,' while Hall, Emmons and others, working upon these

lines, were actively engaged in building up a similar classification of the Palaeozoic

rocks of the Eastern States of the American Union. The Silurian and Cambrian

had, in fact, but just been reclaimed from what Murchison speaks of as the 'vast

unclassified heaps of grey wacke ' or ' transition limestones.'

It would have been quite appropriate at this date to relegate all underlying and

more or less completely crystalline rocks to the * Primary,' or ' Primitive,' or

' Azoic,' but such a solution fortunately did not recommend itself to Logan.

It was along the Ottawa Valley, in 1845, that the rocks subsequently classed

under the Laurentian and Huronian systems were first examined in some detail.

In that year Logan met with and accurately described, severally, rocks which we

now refer to  (1)  The    Fundamental  Gneiss                                   (2)  The  Grenville  Series                               and  (.3)
                                                                             ;                                                         ;

The Huronian. lie speaks of the rocks of the first class as being in the main

syenitic gneisses ' of a highly crystalline quality, belonging to the order which, in

the nomenclature of Lyeli, is called metamorpliic instead of primary, as possessing

an aspect inducing a theoretic belief that they may be ancient sedimentary forma-

tions in an altered condition.' In what we now call the Grenville Series, he de-

scribes the association of crystalline limestones and interbedded gneisses, adding

that it appeared to be expedient to consider this mass as a separate metamorphic

jrroup, supposed to be newer than the last. Of the Huronian, the relations were

at that time left undetermined, although it is observed that its beds hold pebbles

of the underlying rocks, here the Fundamental Gneiss.

The following season was spent by Logan, and by his assistant Murray, on the

north shore of Lake Superior, Thunder Bay and its vicinity being one of the regions
especially examined. Without enumerating particular localities, it may be stated

that Logan there grouped the rocks met with as follows, beginning with the

lowest; the column added on the left giving the present nomenclature of the

several series defined :

Laurentian .                           Granite and syenite.

630 REPORT-- 181)7,

      It is not distinctly stated that No. 3 rests unconformably on the older rocks,
iDut the observation that granitic boulders were found in it, leads to the belief
that such unconformity was assumed. Murray, however, supposed the junction
as seen on the Kaministiquia to be conformable, and unites the first three subdivi-
sions, as above given, in one series.

     Logan further states, still referring to the same region, that the ' chloritic
slates [schists! at the summit of the older rocks on which the volcanic formations
rest unconformably, bear a strong resemblance to those met with on the upper
part of Lake Temiscaming on the Ottawa, and it appears probable that they will
be found to be identical.'

     It will thus be observed that the progress in classification made, up to this date
at least, entirely accords with the results of the latest investigations. The identity
of the rocks placed third in the table with those of the Upper Ottawa was
more than conjectured, and the existence of a great stratigraphical break at the

base of what is now known as the Animikie was clearly recognised. The several
formations were merely described. No specific names were given to them at this

time by Logan, and it is further stated that the age of the highest formations
(Animikie and Keweenawan) was in doubt, although some reason was found to
support Houghton's* view (or what was believed to be his view), that these
formations are lower than the Potsdam, or ' lowest fossiliferous formation.'

     In 1847 and 1848, investigations were continued along the north shore of Lake
Huron, of which the characteristic rocks are, it is stated, believed to form a single
.system. They are described as in part sedimentary (quartzites, conglomerates,^
&c.), and in part igneous (greenstones), the latter being both interposed between
the sedimentary beds and intrusive. The ' slates ' are particularly characterised
by Murray as often chloritic, epidotic, and micaceous, and would now, of course;^
be more specifically termed schists.

      Writing in 1849,- however, and later, in a communication presented to this
Association in 1851, Logan, although still recognising the manifest unconformity
at the base of the Animikie, speaks collectively of the ' Copper-bearing Ilocks ' of

Lake Superior and Huron, including imder this general term what are now known
as the fluronian, Animikie, and Keweenawan series, and adds that it is ' highly

probable ' that all these are approximately equivalent to each other, and to the
Cambrian of the British Islands.

     In the Report for 185:2-o3 (published 1854), the name Laurentian was adopted
for what had been previously designated merely as the ' metamorphic series,' and

in the geological sketch printed in Paris in connection with the Exhibition of
1855 (which follows next in order of publication), this system is stated to consist

almost exclusively of much altered and disturbed sedimentary beds. It is also,
however, made to include some recognised intrusives, such as granite and syenites,
forming parts of the mass, as well as the Labradorite rocks, which were after-
wards for a time named Upper Laurentian, and to which further allusion will
be made in the sequel. The name Laurentian is here therefore first employed

exactly in the sense of the term 'Basement Complex,' introduced long afterwards,
but under the distinct idea that most of the rocks are altered sediments, from
which certain intrusive masses were not clearly separable.

     In the same publication, the overlying series of Lakes Huron and Superior,
including the Iluronian proper, the Animikie and the Keweenawan, were collec-
tively spoken of as the 'Huronian or Cambrian system.' These rocks are
described as lying discordantly on the Laurentian, and as intervening between it
and the lowest known fossiliferous strata. There being no other recognised place

for such rocks in the scheme of the day, they are consequently supposed to-

represent the Lower Cambrian of Sedgwick.
     It is unnecessary to follow in order the investigations carried on for a number

of subsequent years, but reference may now be made to the ' Geology of Canada,'

of 1863, in which all previous results of the Survey to that date were collected and

systematlsed. In this volume, after stating that Hail's nomenclature of the

Paljeozoic rocks in the State of New York had been adopted unchanged for the

adjacent Canadian territory, 'in the interests of unity of plan for future
--researches,' Logan writes : * To the Azoic rocks no local names have yet been
--applied in any part of America except in Canada,' and adds :
                                                                    The names of the

Laureutian and Huronian systems or series, which we have been accustomed to

apply to them, are allowed to remain unchanged, particularly as they have been
recognised abroad, and have been made by other geologists a standard of com-

parison both in America and Europe.'
     In Chapter V. of this volume the ' Upper Copper-bearing Rocks of Lake

Superior ' are separately treated, and are recognised as comprising two groups

which are stated to overlie the Huronian unconformably. These groups are those

now known as the Animikie and Keweenawan.

     There can be no doubt about the classification intended at this time, and the

rocks are correctly laid down on the atlas pre])ared to accompany the volume, but

in consequence of an unfortunate error in the geographical description of the
distribution of the Huronian about Thunder Bay, that arose in 1846 and was

repeated in 1863, several later investigators have been led to regard the rocks of
the ' Upper Copper-bearing Series ' as those of Logan's typical Huronian, and to

suppose that when examining these rocks they were dealing with those intended

to be classed as Huronian. Irving, Winchell, and others have adopted this mistaken

view, which it is particularly necessary to refer to here, as it has been the chief
cause of all subsequent misapprehension in regard to the ' Original Huronian.' *

     The temporary grouping of the Huronian proper with the ' Upper Copper-

bearing Series ' (Animikie and Keweenawan), on the grounds already explained,

as ' Huronian or Cambrian,' together with the employment (proper enough at the
date) of the term ' .slates ' for rocks that would now be named schists, further

assisted in giving colour to the erroneous view just referred to.

In a second geological sketch of Canada, printed in Paris at the time of the

International Exhibition of 1867, the same classification is maintained, but to it

is added the Upper Laurentian or Labradorian. This sketch was actually written

by Hunt, but it was an official publication, correctly representing the views held

     ' As already stated, the relations of the principal rock-series of the vicinity of
Thunder Bay had been correctly outlined in 18i0, although the series had not at that
time been named. The Kaministiquia Kiver section had been examined by Murray,

who also correctly described the distribution of the series there, stating that the
' granite, syenite, gneiss, micaceous and chloritic schist ' (Laurentian and Huronian)

find their southern limit on a line running from the falls on that river to the ' head
of Thunder Bay,' while the ' Upper Slates (Animikie) rest upon them and occupy the

country between such a line and Lake Superior' {Ileport of Progress, 1846-47, p. 51).
In combining his own results with those of Murray, Logan describes the southern
line of the granite, gneiss, and chloritic slates as ' commencing in the vicinity of
Fort William,' or at the mouth of the Kaministiquia, although the falls, at which
this line had been determined by Murray, are some twenty miles up the river. Pro-
ceeding (pp. cit. p. 25) to describe the extent of the ' superior trappean formations '
(Animikie and Keweenawan), he then reverts to the line previously stated, making
these rocks to terminate locally where he had said the older rocks began. In
recasting the earlier observations for the volume of 1863 (no further work having

meanwhile been done at this place), Logan is thus naturally led to state that the

Huronian (i.e. the 'Chloritic Slates') occupies the coast east of the Ka^ninistiquia,
whereas this coast, for ten or eleven miles, is actually occupied by Animikie rocks.
Subsequent investigators, inspecting this coast-Une with the volume of 1863 as a

guide, very naturally thus assumed that they were examining Logan's 'typical

Huronian,' or a part of it. It is in consequence only of a too consistent adhesion to
this misunderstanding, that it has been found necessary to speak of an 'Upper
Huronian,' and refer to an ' inter-Huronian ' unconformity. The so-called Upper
Huronian is no part of the system as understood by the Canadian Survey. One

cannot fail to note, in reading much that has been written on this subject, that the

importance of the great unconformity at the base of the Animikie was realised only

after a new classification had been adopted, in which it bad practically been ignored.
632 REPORT--1897.

at that time, and may be accepted as Logan's last word on the subject. As thus

defined and established, he left the Laurentian and Huronian systems.
     In so far as the stratigraphical relations of the Laurentian, Huronian, and

'Upper Copper-bearing Series' are concerned (leaving out of consideration the
Labradorian), it is thus manifest that the conclusions originally formed from
actual study on the ground were those finally held by Logan. The reference for
a time of the Huronian proper and the ' Upper Copper-bearing Series ' together to
the Lower Cambrian, meant only that, as then understood, there was no other
systematic position recognised to which they could be assigned. That a great
unconformity existed between these two systems was never doubted, but for some
years Logan was not prepared to take the bold position of constituting a separate
Huronian system beneath the lowest Cambrian ; he was, on the contrary, anxious,
if possible, to bring the Canadian section within the lines established in the classic
region studied by Sedgwick and Murchison. The introduction of new systematic

terms was at that time considered somewhat seriously. When eventually com-

pelled to take this step (in 1857), he confined the name Huronian to rocks ante-
dating the great break at the base of the ' Upper Copper-bearing Series ' (Animikie),
embracing those first seen by him on the Upper Ottawa and on Lake Huron, with
their representatives elsewhere, under this new system.

     In so far as nomenclature goes, Logan thus certainly modified his original
application of the name Huronian ; it was not, however, as has been contended, to
create an ' extended Huronian,' but on the contrary to restrict the name to rocks
beneath the great unconformity at the base of the Animikie. The change was
necessitated by the progress of investigation and by the recognition of an upper

division of the ' Azoic,' beneath anything that could legitimately be classed as

Cambrian. It was made by the author himself, and involved no departure from
the law of priority or from any other acknowledged rule. In finally eliminating
these upper rocks from his Huronian system, he was no doubt influenced by
"Whitney's criticisms of 1857,* which were in part correct, although largely devoted
to the very conservative contention that all stratified rocks below the great break
were inseparable, and should be included in an ' Azoic System.' This influence
may be traced in an important paper, of but three pages, communicated to the
American Association for the Advancement of Science a few mouths later than the
date of that above referred to, in which, while the name Huronian is reaffirmed
for the rocks of Lake Huron and Lake Temiscaming, which are taken as typical of
the system, nothing further is said of those now known as Animikie and
Keweenawan.

     In the summary volume of 1863, to which allusion has already been made, the
existence of an Upper Laurentian, Labradorian or Norian Series was first tentatively

indicated in a supplementary chapter. It is unnecessary to follow here the history

of the rocks so classed, for the supposed series has not stood the test of later

discussion and re.search, due chiefly to Selwyn and Adams. The apparently
stratified rocks often included in it are now understood to be foliated eruptives.
The recognition achieved by this and by other more or less hypothetical series
about this time may be traced to the brilliant chemico-geological theories
advanced by Hunt, previous to the general acceptance of modern petrographical

methods.

     In a similar manner, and very justly so, Logan, as a field geologist, was in-
fluenced by the views held by Lyeil in the early editions of his ' Principles,' to
accept without reservation the foliation of crystalline rocks as indicative of original
bedding. This was, at the time of his early researches and thereafter for many years,
the accepted view, although Dana, in a paper read before the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science in 1843, had already held that the schistose
structure of gneiss and mica-slate was insufficient evidence of sedimentary origin

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and Darwin, a few years later, had published his ' Geological Observations,' includ-
ing a remarkable chapter on cleavage and foliation, in which he advocated a similar

view. No such doctrine, however, achieved general recognition until long after-

wards, while that class of facts remaining to be determined chiefly by the micro

 scope, whicb may be included under the term ' dynamic metamorphism,' were
 wholly unknown and unforeseen.

      In admitting that chemical, metamorphic, and uniformitarian hypotheses were
 thus given, in turn, undue weight, it is not to be assumed that the advances made
 under these hypotheses have been entirely lost ; it has been necessary only to retreat
 in part in each instance, in order to fall again into the more direct road.

      In late years, modern microscopical and chemical methods of research have

--been applied to the ancient crystalline schists of Canada the older work has been

 brought under review, and new districts have been entered upon with improved

 weapons. Here, as in other parts of the world, investigations of the kind are

 still in active progress ; finality has not been reached on many points, but the ex-
 planation of others has been found. One advance which deserves special mention

 is the recognition of the fact that a great part of the Huronian is essentially com-
 posed of contemporaneous volcanic material, effusive or fragmental. This was
 first clearly stated by Canadian geologists, but has only become generally admitted
 by degrees, in opposition to prevalent theories of metamorphism and cosmic

 chemistry.

     The first opportunity of studying these Archaean rocks in detail, under the new

 conditions, fell to Dr. A. C. Lawson, then on the staff of the Canadian Survey, in

the vicinity of the Lake of the Woods and elsewhere to the west of Lake Superior.

In that part of the Protaxis, the Laurentian appears to be represented only by the
Fundamental Gneiss, and the Huronian, by a series to which a local name
(Keewatin) was appropriately given,' but which is now Icnown to differ in no
essential respect from many other developments of the same system. The
 Huronian stands generally in compressed folds, and along the line of junction the
gneisses are related to it in the manner of an eruptive, penetrating its mass and
containing detached fragments from it. The same or very similar relations have
since been found to occur in many other places.

      Arguing from observations of the kind last mentioned, it was too hastily assumed
by some geologists that the Laurentian as a whole is essentially igneous, and later
in date than the Huronian. The conditions are, however, not such as to admit of

Wean unqualified belief of this kind, even in regard to the Fundamental Gneiss.

may go so far as to assume that these rocks (occupying as they do much the

larger part of the entire Protaxis) constitute a great ' batholitic ' mass of material
at one time wholly fluent ; but even on this hypothesis some primitive floor must
have existed upon which the Huronian and the similarly circumstanced Grenville
Series were laid down, and no such enormous substitution can have obtained as to
result in the replacement of the whole of this floor by exotic material.- It seems

much more probable that but limited tracts of the Fundamental Gneiss have
passed into a fluent condition when at great depths in the earth's crust, and
various arguments may be adduced in favour of a belief that the observed lines of
contact might be those along which such fusion would be most likely to occur.*
Moreover, the Huronian in many and v/idely separated localities is found to con-

tain water-rounded fragments of syenitic, granitic and gneissic rocks, forming

conglomerates, which may often be observed to pass into schists, but still plainly

indicate that, in these places at least, materials not unlike those of the Funda-
mental Gneiss and its associates were at the surface and subject to denudation.
Such materials cannot be regarded as parts of any primeval superficial crust of the
earth in an original condition. They represent crystalline rocks formed at great
depths, and under conditions similar, at least, to those under which the Funda-
mental Gneiss was produced. They imply a great pre-Huroniau denudation, and
show that the Huronian must have been deposited unconformably either upon the

     ' In the Archaean, local names are particularly useful, inasmuch as correlation
must proceed on lithological and stratigraphical data, more or less uncertain when
extended to wide areas, even in the case of the older and more homogeneous strata

of the earth's crust.

Fundamental Gneiss itself, or upon rocks occupying its position and very similar

to it in character. There can be no reasonable doubt that the mass of what now

constitutes the Fundamental Gneiss originally existed as the floor upon which the

Huronian was deposited.

The name Archaean has been adopted and employed by the Geological Survey

of Canada in the sense in which it was introduced (in 1874), and consistently

maintained by Dana i.e. to include all rocks below the great hiatus of which

evidence was first found in the Lake Superior region. The author of the name

never assented to its restricted application as proposed by Irving and followed by

Van Hise and others, and as a synonym for the Fundamental Gneiss or ' Base-

ment Complex ' it is not only unnecessary but is scarcely etymologically correct, if

we admit that a part of the ' Complex ' is of comparatively late date.

   We have reached a point at which we may ask what is now our conception of

these Archaean rocks in Canada, and more particularly in the great Protaxis, as

resulting from the most recent investigations of a critical kind. The reply may

be given briefly from the latest reports of those still at work on the problems

involved as follows :

The Laurentian comprises (1) the Fundamental Gneiss or Lower Laurentian

(also referred to as the Ottawa Gneiss or Trembling Mountain Gneiss in older

AnKeports), and (2) the Grenville Series.                                                  important part of the gneisses of the

GrenviUe Series has been shown by chemical analysis to be identical in composition

with ordinary Palaeozoic argillites, and they are interbedded with quartzites and

massive limestones, also evidently of aqueous origin, and in some places abounding in

graphite. These beds are, however, closely associated with other gneisses in which

orthoclase largely preponderates that have the composition of igneous rocks. The

Fundamental Gneiss consists chiefly, if not exclusively, of rocks of the last-named

class, the banding or foliation of which, though now generally parallel to that of

the Grenville Series, has probably been'produced mainly or entirely by movements

induced by pressure, in a mass originally diflering more or less in composition in

its difi'erent parts. The two series are sometimes separable on the ground locally,

but with difficulty                                                                        in other places they cannot be clearly  defined.*
                                                                                        ;

The Upper Laurentian, Labradorian, Norian or Anorthosite group, maintained

for a number of years on the evidence already mentioned, is found to consist

essentially of intrusive rocks, often foliated by pressure, later in age than the

Grenville Series, but in all probability pre-Palaeozoic.

The Ruronian comprises felspathic sandstone or greywacke more or less

tufaceous in origin, quartzites and arkoses passing into quartzose conglomerates

and breccia conglomerates, often with large fragments of many different varieties

of granite, syenite, &c., diorite, diabase, limestones, and shales or slates chang-

ing to phyllites in contact with the numerous associated igneous masses.

Over wide areas altered greenstones and their associated tuff's preponderate,

often with micaceous, chloritic, serlcitic and other schists, many of which ai'e

of pyroclastic origin, although some may represent ordinary aqueous deposits, and

all have been much affected by subsequent dynamic metamorphism.

The Huronian rocks have not yet been found in distinct relation to those of

the Grenville Series, but are generally in contact with the Fundamental Gneiss, in

the manner previously alluded to. Where not composed of volcanic material it

appears to be largely of a littoral character, while the Grenville Series seems

rather to indicate oceanic conditions.

    No reference has so far been made to the development of Archaean rocks, known

as the ' Hastings Series.' The rocks thus named occupy considerable tracts to the

south of the Ottawa Eiver, west of the City of Ottawa. They were originally

classed by Logan and Murray with the Grenville Series of the Laurentian, although

Murray soon after insisted on their peculiar features, and they came to be recog-

nised by the above geographical name during subsequent discussions as to their

systematic position, by the authors above referred to, and by Hunt, Venuor, and

Macfarlane. These rocks are particularly alluded to now, because later work

seems to show that both the Grenville Series and the Huronian are represented in

' Cf. Adams, Annual Jleport Geological Survey of Canada, 1895.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  635

the district-- in so far, at least, as litbological characters may be depended on.
They include a preponderance of thinly bedded limestones and dolomites, liner in

grain and usually less altered than those of the typical Grenville Series, associated
with conglomerates, breccias and slates still retaining complete evidence of their

clastic origin.

    It is in this Hastings region that careful investigation and mapping are now

in progress by several members of the Canadian Survey, with the prospect of
arriving at definite results respecting the relations of the Grenville Series and the
Huronian. It is too early to forecast what these results may be, for the question
is one which must be approached with an open mind ; but the work already com-
pleted by Messrs. Adams, Barlow, and Ells, appears to sustain the suggestion that

both series occur, and to indicate that they may there be so intimately connected

as to render their separation difficult. It must be borne in mind that, although
the relations of the Grenville Series and those of the recognised Huronian to the
Fundamental Gneiss are very similar, they characterise distinct tracts, to which
the Hastings district is to some extent geographically intermediate, although most

closely connected in this respect with the Grenville region.
     Reverting to the original classification of the Archaean of the Canadian Survey,

--as developed in the field by Logan and his assistants, we may now enquire In

how far does this agree with the results of later work above outlined ? In the

main, this classification still stands substantially unaltered, as the result of all

honest work carefully and skilfully executed must. The nomenclature adopted is
still applicable, although some of our conceptions in regard to the rocks included

under it have necessarily undergone more or less change.
     The Laurentian is still appropriately made to include both the Fundamental

Gneiss and the Grenville Series ; although at first both were supposed to represent
' metamorphic ' rocks, it was even then admitted (1855) that these embraced some
plutonic masses practically inseparable from them. Later investigations have
increased the importance of such plutonic constituents, while at the same time

demonstrating the originally supposed sedimentary origin of the characteristic
elements of the Grenville Series ; but the admission of so large a plutonic factor
necessarily invalidates in great measure the estimates of thickness based upon the

older reasoning, under which any parallelism of structure was accepted as evidence

of original bedding.

     Whatever views may be held as to the propriety of including rocks of the two

classes under a single name, the necessity of so doing remains, because of the
practical impossibility of separating them over any considerable area for the pur-
pose of delineation on the map. I^o advance in knowledge is marked in substi-
tuting for Laurentian, with its original concept of a stratified time-series, such a^

name as 'Basement Complex.' It may, indeed, yet prove that the homogeneity of

the Laurentian is greater than is at present supposed, for a mass of strata

that included ordinary sediments, arkoses, and contemporaneous volcanic deposits

of certain kinds, in which the arkose and volcanic constituents preponderated in
the lower beds, might, under metamorphism at great depths, produce just such a

combination as that of the Grenville Series and the Fundamental Gneiss, the latter
representing an aggregate result of the alteration of that part composed chiefly of

--volcanic material or of arkose in fact, under the conditions assumed, the lower

mass could not now well exist under any other form than that actually found in

the Fundamental Gneiss. In his address at the Nottingham Meeting of this-

Association, Teall has clearly pointed out that, in such cases, the chemical test
must necessarily fail, and that the character and association of the rocks them-

selves must be given a greater weight.

     The Huronian proper, under whatever local names it may be classed, still

remains a readily separable series of rocks, with peculiar characters, and econo-

mically important because of the occurrence in it of valuable minerals.

     The subsequently outlined Labradorian has been eliminated as a member of
the time-series, and the rocks of the so-called ' Hastings Group ' remain yet in a
doubtful position, but with the promise that they may afford a clue to the true

relations of the Grenville Series of the eastern and the Huronian of the western

province of the Protaxis.
G36 . REPORT-- 1897.

    To what extent the above subdivisions of the Archaean may be legitimately

employed in other parts of the continent, more or less remote from the Protaxis,

remains largely a question for future investigation. In the southern part of New

lirunswick, however, the resemblance of the Archsean to that of the typical region
is so close that there can be little risk of error in applying the same classificatory
li-ames to it. The Fundamental Gneiss is there in contact with a series comprising
crystalline limestones, quartzites, and gneissic rocks, precisely resembling those of
the Grenville Series. Later than this is a great mass of more or less highly altered
locks, chiefly of volcanic origin, comprising felsites, diorites, agglomerates, and
schists of various kinds, like those of the typical Huronian. The e.xistence of this
iipper group correlatively with that representing the Grenville Series, constitutes

au argument, so far as it goes, for the separateness of these two formations in the

general time-scale. All these Archaean rocks of New Brunswick are distinctly

unconformable beneath fossiliferous beds regarded by Matthew as older than

<'ambrian.
      In the Cordilleran region of Canada, again, a terrane is found lying uncon-

formably beneath the lowest rocks possibly referable to the Cambrian, evidently

Archfean, and with a very close general resemblance to the Grenville Series. To
this the local name Shuswap Series has been applied, and a thickness of at least

.'ijOOO feet has been determined for it in one locality. It consists of coarsely
crystalline marbles, sometimes spangled with graphite and mica, quartzites,
gneisses, often highlv calcareous or quartzose, mica schists, and hornblendic

j^neisses. With these is a much greater mass of gneissic and granitoid rocks, like

those of the Fundamental Gneiss of the Protaxis, and the resemblance extends to
the manner of association of the two . terranes, of which, however, the petro-
graphical details remain to be worked out.'

      While it is true that a resemblance in lithological character, like that existing
between the Grenville and Shuswap Series, far remote from each other geographi-

cally, may mean only that rocks of like composition have been subjected to a

similar metamorphism, both the series referred to are separated above by an un-
conformity from the lowest beds of the Palaeozoic, and there is thus sufficient
evidence to indicate at lea.st a probability of their proximate identity in the time-
«cale. In Scotland, an analogous series, and one apparently similarly circumstanced,
seems to occur in the rocks of Gairloch and Loch Carron.^

      Particular attention has been directed throughout to the southern part of the
continental Protaxis in Canada. In this region it happened that the Archrean
rocks and those resting upon them were originally studied under exceptionally
favourable conditions, for ever since the great revolution which succeeded
 Huronian time, the region is one which has remained almost stable. Selwyn and
N. II. Winchell Lave particularly insisted on the importance of the stratigraphical
 break which here defines the Archa?an above. It is not everywhere so well marked,
Cor in the Appalachian province and in the country to the south of the great lakes,
 in Wisconsin and Michigan, repeated subsequent earth-movements have flexed and
 ^jroken the older strata against the base of the table-land of the Protaxis. It is not
from these districts, subjected to more recent and frequent disturbance, that the

ruling facts of an earlier time may be most easily ascertained. Much careful and

conscientious work has been devoted to them, but it is largely, I believe, because
 of the attempt to apply, for purposes of general classification, the still unsettled
and ever-changing hypotheses derived from such more complicated tracts that so
much confusion has been introduced in regard to the Archaean and early Palaeozoic

 rocks.

      If the unconformity closing Archaean time in the vicinity of the Great Lakes
 bad been observed only in that region, it might be regarded as a relatively local
 phenomenon ; but subsequent observations, and more particularly those of the last
 few years, due to Bell, McConnell, Tyrrell, and Low, show that rocks evidently

of Lake Superior in general lithological character, recur in many places almost

througbout the whole vast area of the Protaxis, on both sides of Hudson Bay, and

northward to the Arctic Ocean, resting upon the Archaan rocks always in com-

plete discordance, and lying generally at low angles of inclination, although often

affected by great faults. The surface upon which these rocks have been deposited

is that of a denudation-plane of flowing outline, not differing in any essential

respect from that characterising parts of the same great plateau where there is no

evidence to show that any deposition of strata has occurred since Archtean time.

Mr. Low, indeed, finds reason to believe that even the great valleys by which the

Archfean plateau of Labi'ador is trenched had been cut out before the general

subsidence which enabled the laying down of Animikie rocks upon this plateau to

begin. The area over which these observations extend, thus in itself enables

us to affirm that the unconformity existing between the Animikie or Keweenawan

(as the case may be) and the Archasan is of the first order.' It may be comparesl

with that now known to occur between the Torridonian of Scotland and the under-

lyinff rocks there, and is evidenced by similar facts.

If the structural aspects of the Archaean rocks of the Protaxis are considered,

Wethe importance of this gap becomes still more apparent.        find long bands of

strata referable to the Huronian and Grenville Series, occupying synclinal troughs,,

more or less parallel to each other and to the foliation of the Fundamental Gneiss,

the strata, as well as the foliation, being in most cases at high angles, vertical, or

even reversed. This structure is precisely that which would be discovered if a

great mountain system, like that of the Alps, were to be truncated on a plane-

sufficiently low. Analogy thus leads to the belief that the Protaxis was originally,

as Uana has suggested, a region of Appalachian folding, differing only from

more modern examples of mountain regions of the same kind in its excessive width,

which is so great as to render it difficult to conceive that crustal movements oi

sufficient magnitude to produce it could have occurred at any one period. It is^

thus, perhaps, more probable that successive and nearly parallel flexures of th&

kind, separated by long intervals of rest, piled range upon range against the central

mass of the protaxial buttress subsequent to the Huronian period. In any case,

the rugged mountain region brought into existence when the corrugation still

evidenced by its remaining base occurred, was subsequently reduced by denudation

to the condition of an undulating table-land such as has been named a ' peneplain

--by W. M. Davis a surface approximating to a base-level of erosion. All this was

accomplished after the close of the Huronian period, and before that time at which

the first beds of the Animikie were laid down correlatively with a great subsidence.

It would be difficult to deny that the time thus occupied may not have been equal

in duration to that represented by the whole of the Palteozoic.

    If we approach this ruling unconformity from above, in the region of the-
Protaxis, we find the Animikie and Keweenawan rocks uncrystalline, except when

of volcanic origin, and resembling in their aspect the older Palaeozoic sedimeutS;,

but practically without characteristic organic remains, so fiir as known. In order

to bring ourselves into relation with the ascertained palajontological sequence, it is

necessary to go further afield, and in so doing we lose touch, more or less com-

pletely, with the stable conditions of the Archaean platform, and are forced to

apply indirectly such facts as it may be possible to ascertain in regions which

have suffered more recent and complicated disturbance. It is thus not turprising

that the taxonomic position of the Animikie and Keweenawan have been the sub-

ject of much controversy. It is not germane to the present discussion to enter at

any length into this question, nor into the value of the unconformity which appears

to exist between these two series. They have been classed collectively by Selwyn,

N. H. Winchell, and others as Lower Cambrian, and are provisionally mapped a»

such by the Canadian Survey. It is believed to be more in accordance with the-

general principles of geological induction to refer these rocks above the greati

unconformity to the Cambrian, for the time being at least, than to unite them

with the Huronian under any general term, or to erect a new system in which to

place them. In so doing it has been assumed that the Cambrian is the lowest

system of the Palreozoic, but of late years the position has been taken by gjood
authorities that the true base of the Cambrian is to be found at the Olenellus
zone- ard while it appears very probable that, when fossils are found in the
Animikie, they mav be referable to this zone, the adoption of such an apparently
arbitrary line certainly, for the time, must be considered as placing the Cambrian
reference of the beds in question in doubt; but it does not interfere with a belief

that if they should be found to be lower than Cambrian as thus defined, they may

at least be considered as still in all probability Palfeozoic.

     The definition of the horizon of Olenellus as that of the base of the Cambrian
IS a question almost entirely palseontological, into which it is not proposed here
to enter further than to point out that it is only partially justified by what is
known of North American geology. In the Atlantic province, and in the
Appalachian region, there appears to be a very general physical break at about

this stage, which it seems likely may correspond with the great unconformity at
the base of the Animikie ; but in the Rocky Mountain or Cordilleran region the

Olenellus zone has been found high up in a series of conformable and similar sedi-
ments coincidino- with no break, and from these lower sediments some organic
forms have been already recovered, but not such as to indicate any great diversity
in fauna from that of the recognised Cambrian. Similarly, in one part of eastern
Canada, Matthew has lately described a fauna contained in what he names the
Etcheminian group, regarded by him as earlier than the Olenellus zone, but still
Palajozoic. Recent discoveries of a like kind have been made in other parts of

the world, as in the Salt Range of India. These facts have only last year been
particularly referred to by Mr. Marr in his address to the Section.

     The general tendency of our advance in knowledge appears, in fact, to be in the
direction of extending the range of the Palaeozoic downward, whether under the
old name Cambrian, or under some other name applied to a new system defined,
or likely to be defined, by a characteristic fauna ; and under Cambrian or such new
system," if it be admitted, it is altogether probable that the Animikie and Kewee-

nawan rocks must eventually be included.
      In other words, the somewhat arbitrary and artificial definition of the Olenellus

2one as the base of the Cambrian, seems to be not only not of world-wide appli-
cation but not even of general applicability to North America ; while, as a base

for the Palffiozoic ^on, it is of still more doubtful value. In the Cambrian period,
·as well as in much later geological times, the American continent does not admit of

treatment as a single province, but is to be regarded rather as a continental barrier

--iDctween two great oceanic depressions, each more or less completely diflBrent and

self-contained in conditions and history that of the Atlantic and that of the

Pacific. On the Atlantic side the Olenellus zone is a fairly well-marked base for

the Cambrian ; on that of the Pacific it is found naturally to succeed a great
consecutive and conformable series of sediments, of which the more ancient

fauna is now only beginning to be known.
     In thus rapidly tracing out what appears to me to be the leading thread of the

liistory of the pre-Cambrian rocks of Canada, and in endeavouring to indicate the

present condition of their classification, and to vindicate the substantial accuracy of

the successive steps taken in its elaboration, many names and alternative systems

of arrano-ement proposed at different times, by more or less competent authorities,
have been passed without mention. This has been done either because such

names and classifications appear now to be unnecessary or unfounded, or because

they relate to more or less local subdivisions of the ruling systems which it is not
possible to consider in so brief a review. This has been particularly the case in
regard to the much-disputed region to the south of Lake Superior, out of which,
Tiowever after some decades of complicated and warring nomenclature, a classi-
fication trending back substantially to that originally established and here
advocated, is being evolved (albeit under strange names) by the close and skilful

stratigraphical work in progress there.

     It has also been my object, in so far as possible, by omitting special reference

to divergent views, to avoid a controversial attitude, particularly in respect to
 matters which are still in the arena of active discussion, and in regard to which
                      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                                    639

many points remain admittedly subject to modification or change of statement.
But in conclusion, and from the point of view of Canadian p^eology, it is necessarv

-- --to refer even at the risk of appearing controversial to the comparatively recent

attempt to introduce an ' Algonldan System,' under which it is proposed to include

all recognisable sedimentary formations below the Olevellus zone, assumed for this
purpose to be the base of the Cambrian. If in what has already been said I have

-- mybeen able correctly to represent the main facts of the case and it has been
--endeavour to do so it must be obvious that the adoption of such a ' system ' is a

retrograde step, wholly opposed, not only to the historical basis of progress in

classification, but also to the natural conditions upon which any taxonomic scheme
should be based. It not only detaches from the Palseozoic great masses of con-
formable and fossiliferous strata beneath an arbitrary plane, but it unites these,

under a common systematic name, with other vast series of rocks, now generally

in a crystalline condition, and includes, as a mere interlude, what, in the region
of the Protaxis at least, is one of the greatest gaps known to geological history.
In this region it is made to contain the Keweenawan, the Animikie, the Huronian,
and the Grenville Series, and that without in the least degree removing the diffi-

culty found in defining the base of the last-mentioned series. It thus practically

expunges the result of much good work, conducted along legitimate lines of
advance during many previous years, with only the more than doubtful advantage
of enabling the grouping together of many widely separated terranes in other dis-

tricts where the relations have not been even proximately ascertained. It is in

eifect, to my mind, to constitute for geology what was known to the scholastic

theologians of a former age as a Ihnbo, appropriate as the abode of unjudged souls
and unbaptized infants, that might well in this case be characterised as ' a limbo
large and broad.'

     It is not intended to deny that there may be ample room for the introduction
of a new system, or perhaps, indeed, of an entire Geological Mou, between the
Huronian, as we know it in Canada, and the lowest beds which may reasonably be

considered as attaching to the Cambrian, or even to the Palaeozoic as a whole.

On the contrary, what has already been said will, I think, show that in the region
of the Protaxis we might very reasonably speak of an' Algonkian hiatus,' weiif

elect so to call it. Elsewhere it will undoubtedly be possible, sooner or later, to

designate series of rocks laid down during the time represented only by orogenic
movements and vast denudation in the province here more particularly referred

to, but before any general systematic name is applied to such terranes they
should be defined, and that in such a way as to exclude systems already established

as the result of honest work.

     It seems very likely, for instance, that the Grand Canon Series, as last delimited

by Walcott, separateii by unconformities from the Tonto fJambrian above and the

probably Archaean rocks below, may be referable to such an intermediate system
                                                                                                    ;
but  here it  may be  noted, in  passing, that  the  attempt  to  apply  the  new
                                                                                   term

* Algonkian ' in this particular Western region, has led to the inclusion under that
name of a great unconformity below the Grand Canon Series, much resembling

the post-Huronian break in the Lake Superior district.

     For such unclassed rocks, wholly or in large part of sedimentary origin, the

Canadian Survey has simply employed the term pre-Cambrian, involving for'certain

regions a frank confession of ignorance beyond a certain point. Indefinite as such

a term is, it is believed to be more philosophical than to make an appearance of

knowledge not borne out in fact, by the application of any systematic name not

properly defined.

     Although it would be unsuitable, at the close of this address, to introduce the

old controversy respecting the Cambrian and Silurian, it may be noted that the

ethical conceptions and many of the principles involved in that discussion still

apply with undiminished value, and much of its literature may be re-read to-day

with advantage. More particularly I would allude to Sedgwick's inimitable and

now classic introduction to McCoy's 'Palaeozoic Fo.ssils,' one passage in which,

   1. Some Typical Sections in South-western Nova Scotia.

By L. W. Bailey, Ph.D., University of Neio Brunswick.

The sections figured and described in this paper are intended to represent, in

summarj'- form, the results of recent investigations, made under the direction of

the Geological Survey of Canada, into the geological structure of South-western

Nova Scotia.

     They are five in number, the first being in Queen's County, along the course of
the Port Medway River, showing the succession and foldings of the Cambrian

rocks in their ordinary form, together with their relations to the great granite
axis of the Province, and the occurrence of auriferous deposits. The second is in

Yarmouth County, exhibiting the rocks of the same system in a more meta-

morphosed condition, and showing also that the rocks about the city of Yarmouth,

formerly regarded as Archajan, are also a portion of the Cambrian system. The

third section is in Digby County, exhibiting the parallelism of the Cambrian suc-

Acession north of the granite axis, with the same on its southern side.  fourth

section, in Annapolis County, illustrates the relation to the Cambrian rocks, and to

the granite, of the fossiliferous and iron-bearing Eo-Devonian rocks of Bear River,

ANictau, and Torbrook.  fifth section may also be given, showing the structure

and relations of the stratified and igneous rocks, usually regarded as Triassic, of

the Annapolis Valley.

All the sections are diagrammatic, but based on actual surveys.

                                  2. Problems in Quebec Geology.

By R. W. Ells, LL.D., F.R.S.C, of the Geographical Survey of Canada.

This paper is a brief review of the geological work done in the province of

Quebec since the appearance of Dr. Bigsby's first paper on the geology of the

province in 1827. It contains a short statement of the conclusions arrived at from

time to time by the various workers in this field regarding the structure of the

rock formations east of the St. Lawrence, as well as of the Laurentian complex to

Athe north of that river.  summary of the latest views reached from the detailed

study of these areas during the last fifteen years, which has appeared in the last

volume of the Geological Survey's report, is also presented.

     In regard to the structure of the older crystallines north of the St. Lawrence

and Ottawa Rivers, it may be said that the opinion once held, that these rocks
were originally of sedimentary origin, has now been greatly modified. The
Laurentian rocks of Logan are now divided into two great groups. Of these, the
lower is essentially a gneiss formation, and may be styled, for the sake of distinction,

the Fundamental Gneiss. This is clearly older in point of time than the series of

crystalline limestones, quartzose grey gneisses, and quartzite with which they are

often so intimately associated as to render the determination of their true relations

in the field difficult, but which at other points are clearly situated above the lower

gneiss formation.
                                                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                     '641

These newer gneisses and limestones which have been staled by Logan the

* Grenville Series ' are, without doubt, tor the most part of sedimentary origin,

though they are invaded in all directions by masses of granite, greenstone, and

other I'orms of igneous rock. As for the Fundamental Gneiss, also once supposed

to l)e largely of sedimentary origin, it has been very conclusively demonstrated,

chiefly through the agency of the microscope, that this is for the most part at least

an altered igneous rock, and that the supposed bedding planes owe their existence

to other causes than those of sedimentation.

The original upper Laurentian division, which included the great area of the

Anorlhosite rocks, also supposed at one time to represent altered sedimentary

deposits, has been removed from the position it once occupied, since it has been

proved, both by the evidence in the field and in the laboratory, to be of igneous

origin and subsequent to the deposition of the limestone and quartzite series with

which it is associated, so that the Grenville Series, according to the earlier view as

to the succession of strata, may now be taken to represent the upper portion of the

liaurentian system.

It may also be assumed to represent the lowest division of the clastic or sedi-

mentary rocks in Canada. The relations of these to the rocks which have been

styled the ' Hastings Series ' in Ontario are such that they may, in part at least,

be regarded as portions of the same series which have been described in different

portions of the field under different names ; but whether these be regarded as

belonging to the Laurentian or Huronian systems is of small moment so long as

their true relationship to each other and to the underlying Fundamental Gneiss is

clearly understood.

To the east of the St. Lawrence the old dispute aslo the age of the fossiliferous

rocks near the city of Quebec, as well as of their relations to the crystalline schists

of the mountain area in the interior of the province, may now be considered as

satisfactorily settled. The former hypothesis by which the crystalline schists were

regarded as the equivalents, in point of time, of the fossiliferous sediments of the

St. Lawrence Valley has been clearly shown to be unfounded, and the schists of

the Sutton Mountain area are now assigned to the Huronian system, or are at

least beneath the lowest Cambrian of the district. The relative position of the

several divisions of the fossiliferous Quebec group has also been ascertained, and

it is now established that the Sillery division is situated stratigraphically beneath

the L(5vis, instead of being, as was at one time supposed, above it. As regards the

age of the several divisions of the Quebec group (fossiliferous) it may be said that

the L^vis is the apparent equivalent of the Calciterous formation, and that in its

upper portion it approaches the Chazy ; while the upper portion of the Sillery is

the apparent equivalent of the Potsdam Sandstone formation. Between the Upper

Sillery and the great mass of the rocks which have been referred to this division,

there is a fault of considerable magnitude, so that the lower portion of the Sillery

presumably includea rocks which have been elsewhere classed as Cambrian, and
these may extend as low as the Paradoxides zone or division of that system.

     The areas of black slate and limestone, which, in the General Report for 1863,
were regarded as beneath the crystalline schists, and referable to the Potsdam

formation, have been determined, on the evidence of the contained fossils, to be

much newer, and to be in fact the equivalents of the lower portion of the Trenton

formation                                          and to  this horizon  may also  now be  assigned  the  greater portion  of
                                                ;

the strata in the city of Quebec. Here, however, there are a number of anti-

clinal folds, and the presence of certain fossils, similar to those obtained from

the Levis beds, indicates that along some of these folds beds of that horizon may

be found. The same age may be assigned to the great extension of the black slates

find limestones which occur at intervals along the south shore of the St. Lawrence,

nearly to the extremity of the Gasp6 Peninsula, and which appear to dip beneath

the strata of the Sillery formation at many points.

    In regard to the use of the term Potsdam a distinction must now be made be-
tween the Potsdam formation and the Potsdam Sandstone. The latter has been

clearly proved in Canada to be the lower portion of the Calciferous formation, and

is not separable from it, while there is a manifest break between this and the

1897.                                                                                                     TT

lower beds, or the Cambrian proper. The term Potsdam formation in Canadian
geology was a comprehensive one like the term Cambrian, and like it included all
between the Calciferous formation and the Huronian. The indiscriminate use of
the terms has led to much confusion, and as the divisions of the Cambrian have
now been properly determined the expression Potsdam formation has practically
no meaning in Canadian geology.

               4. The Stratigraphic Succession in Jamaica.

By Robert T. Hill, Geologist, United States Geological Survey.^

This paper gives results of a series of stratigraphic, petrographic, and topo-

graphic studies made in the island in the years 1895, 1896, and lf<97, under the

auspices of Professor Alexander Agassiz, for the purpose of determining a typical

West Indian section which would serve as a basis for comparison with the other

West Indian localities.

The work of the officers of the British Survey and other previous observers was

taken as a basis and advanced by critical studies and correlations of other type

localities, and by observations upon the new exposures revealed in the recent

Ahighway and railway improvements.                                                                                                                                      new classification and nomenclature of

the rocks is proposed, and the sequence of the geologic events in Jamaica history

is outlined and interpreted. Petrographic data by Cross and palseontologic deter-

minations by Agassiz, Dall, Vaughan, and others are incorporated in the paper.

      5. Preliminary Notice of some Experiments on the Flow of Rocks.

By Frank D. Adams and John T. Nicolson, McGill University, Montreal.

These experiments aim at ascertaining whether it is possible, by subjecting

rocks artificially to pressure under the conditions which obtain in the deeper parts

of the earth's crust, to produce in them the deformation and cataclastic structures

exhibited by the folded rocks of the interior of mountain ranges or of the older

formations of the earth.

Three factors contribute toward bringing about the conditions to which rocks

are subjected in the deeper parts of the earth's crust: (1) Great pressure from

every direction                                                            (2)  high temperatures                                                                       (3)  action of percolating waters.  In the
                                                                        ;                                                                                            ;

present experiments the attempt has been made to reproduce only the first of these

conditions, in subsequent experiments the endeavour will be made to reproduce all

three of them.

The experiments have been made chiefly with pure Carrara marble. Columns

of the marble 2 centimetres, and 2^ centimetres in diameter, and about 4 centi-
metres in length, were very accurately turned and polished. Heavy wrought iron

tubes were then made, imitating the plan adopted in the construction of ordnance,

by rolling long strips of Swedish n-on around a bar of soft wrought iron and

welding the strips to the bar as they were rolled around it. The core of soft iron

composing the bar was then drilled out, leaving a tube of welded Swedish iron

6 millimetres thick, so constructed that the fibres of the iron run around the tube

instead of being parallel to its length. This tube was then very accurately fitted

on to the column of marble. This was accomplished by giving a very slight taper

to both the column and the interior of the tube, and so arranging it that the

marble would pass only about halfway into the tube when cold. The tube was

    ' By permission of Professor Agassiz, under whose auspices the researches were

made.
                                                                                     TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                              i-3

 then expanded by heating, so as to allow the marble to pass completely into it, and

leave about 3 centimetres of the tube free at either end. On allowinur the tube to
cool a perfect contact between the iron and marble was obtained, and it was no
longer possible to withdraw the latter. Any very slight failure to tit at any point,

if such a failure existed in any case, was rendered harmless by the fact that under a
comparatively low pressure the limestone is found to be sufficiently elastic not only

to fill up any such minute space, but even to stretch the tube, and, ou the pressure

being relieved, to contract again to its original form, so that it will drop out of
the tube which has been thus enlarged. Into either end of the tube containing

the small column an accurately fitting sliding steel plug was inserted, and by
means of these the marble was submitted to a pressure far above that which would
be sufficient to crush it if not so inclosed. The machine employed in obtaining
the pressure was so arranged that the pressure might be maintained for weeks, or
even months, if required. Under these circumstances the conditions of pressure to
which the marble is subjected are those in the ' zone of tiow ' of the earth's

--crust those, namely, of a pressure above that of its elastic limit, while

yet unable to break in the ordinarj^ manner owing to the tube which confines
it having a still higher elastic limit. Under the pressure, which was applied
gradually and in some cases continued for several weeks, the tube was found to
slowly bulge until a very marked enlargement of the portion surrounding the
marble had taken place. The tube was then cut through longitudinally by means
of a milling machine along two lines opposite one another.

     The marble within, however, was still firm, and held the respective sides of the
iron tube, now completely separated, so tightly together that it was impossible
without mechanical aids to tear these apart. By means of a wedge, however, they
could be separated, splitting the marble through longitudinally. The column in
one experiment was reduced from 40 millimetres to 21 millimetres in height. The
deformed marble differs from the original rock in having a dead white colour, the

glistening cleavage faces of calcite being no longer visible, and although not so

hard as the original rock, it is still firm and compact, and especially so when its
delormation has been carried out very slowly. No accurate measurements as to
its strength have yet been made, but it will withstand a sharp blow, and fragments

of it, weighing 10 grams, have been allowed to fall through a height of over
2A metres (8 feet) on to a wooden platform, from which it rebounded without

breaking. Thin sections of the deformed marble, when examined under the micro-
scope, show that the calcite individuals composing the rock have in many cases

been twisted and flattened, and in the majority of cases a very fine polysynthetic
pressure-twinning has been induced in them, with movement along gliding planes,
as well as several other structures seen in nature in highly deformed rocks.

     The experiments therefore show that limestone, even when dry and at ordinary
temperatures, does possess a certain degree of plasticity, and can be made to
' flow,' the movements set up developing many structures which are characteristic
of rocks which have been squeezed or folded in the deeper portions of our earth's

crust.

   IV. The drainage of both the Arkansas and Texas Carboniferous areas was
reversed about the end of Jurassic times, when orographic movements over South-
east Arkansas, Eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi submerp-ed the former
extension of the Appalachian watershed, and admitted the early Cretaceous sea
across the Palaeozoic land as far north as Southern Illinois.

     V. This depression was not a deep one (Hilgard^) and did not all occur at one
time, for there have been subsequent distiu'bances of a more or less similar nature
in the same region.

     VI. The evidences of this depressions are

     1. The reversed drainage of the Arkansas vallej'.
     2. The reversed drainage over the Carboniferous area of Central Texas.
     3. The submerged eastern end of the Ouachita uplift of Arkansas.
     4. The eastern slope of the peneplain of the Ouachita region.
     5. The direction of the faults and folds near the eastern exposure of the Lower
Coal Measures in Arkansas.
     6. The great fault thi-ough Texas near the Tertiary border having a down-throw
of 1,000 to 1,500 feet on the south and east side.
     7. Eruptive rocks accompanying the Texas fault and the Tertiary border
through that State and Arkansas to the Arkansas River.
     8. Hot springs near the same line.
     9. Faults in Alabama with a down-throw of 10,000 feet or more on the north-
west side.
     10. The thickness of the Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments over the depressed
area--from 4,000 to 10,000 feet.

     VII. The south-western or Central Texas end of the Appalachian land areas was
formerly covered by Cretaceous sediments, but it has since been uncovered by

erosion ; further east it is still concealed.

     VIII. The Carboniferous beds uncovered in Texas all belong to the Upper
Coal Measures, except at the edge of the synclinal trough ; it is inferred that a

greater thickness is still covered.

     IX. Tlie character of both the Silurian and Lower Coal Measures sediments of
the Ouachita uplift show that they came from the south, so that the land area
must have been in that direction during PalaBOZoic times.

     X. The sea occasionally invaded both the Arkansas and Texas synclinal troughs
during Coal Measures times, but coal-forming conditions obtained in the Texas
eyncline later than in Ihe Arkansas basin.

     XI. The Tertiary depression was probably more marked on the Arkansas than
on the Tennessee side of the embayment : this is suggested by the Cretaceous
border being concealed by thin Tertiary deposits in Arkansas, while in Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Alabama it is exposed in a broad belt.

         1 . A Group of Hypotheses hearing on Climatic Changes?-
 By T. C. Chamberlix, Professor of Geology in the University of Chicago.

   A computation of the several constituents of the atmosphere and of the rate at

which they are being consumed in the alteration of the surface rocks indicates that
in a comparatively few thousand years the carbonic acid of the air will be exhausted
if there is no compensating source of re-supply. The ocean contains about 18 times

aa much carbonic acid as the air, but even if this were all available the main-
tenance of conditions congenial to life would still be geologically short. Abroad

comparison between the atmospheres of the palaeozoic and the cainozoic times fails

to give clear proof of radical differences. The magnolia flora in North Greenland
in tertiary times indicates scarcely less wide distribution of warm climate than the

life of the same region in palreozoic times. The glaciation of India, Australia, and

South Africa at the close of the palaeozoic era is even more marvellous thau that nt

the close of the more recent era. The salt deposits of middle latitudes, especially

of Michigan and New York, imply as great aridity as we find at any time since.

The early life does not give clear proof of more carbonic acid in the air than the

later life. The tardiness of land life may be accounted for otherwise.

But the amount of carbonic acid taken from the air by carbon-bearing deposits

is estimated variously at 12,000 to 150,000 times that now in the air. At least

8,000 or 10,000 times the present amount of carbonic acid has quite certainly

beentakeu out since air-breathing life began. This forces the question whether all

this carbonic acid, or any major part of it, was ever in the air at any one time.

The alternative is to suppose the air to have been fed as well as robbed during

all the geological ages. The current view of a former vast, dense, hot and moist

atmosphere has, however, been derived more from theories of the earth's origin

and primitive state than from computation of the material removed from it. The

belief in the gaseous origin of the earth naturally carries with it the doctrine of a

primitive hot atmosphere. The belief in a molten condition naturally led also to

the view that the ocean was once all in the atmosphere. This does not, however,

rigorously follow. Much of the ocean may have been accumulated since, but I

venture to question both the primitive molten state and the inferences drawn from

it. There is still some ground to doubt the nebular hypothesis, and to entertain

some phase of the meteoroidal hypothesis, but even if the nebular theory be

followed as far as the separation of the earth-moon ring, a molten state of the

earth may not necessarily follow. The vast size, the tenuity and the high tempera-

ture of the supposed gaseous ring suggest its speedy cooling to the form of a ring

of discrete solid particles like the rings of Saturn. Moreover, a study of the

velocity of the gaseous molecules and the limitations of the power of celestial

bodies to hold them, makes it extremely doubtful whether such a ring could

control its own hot gases. The same line of study even makes it doubtful whether

a molten earth could hold to itself a vast vaporous atmosphere such as the ocean

would form. The great velocity of the gaseous molecules at the temperature of

a molten earth, and the reduction in the influence of gravity by the high centri-

fugal force, combine to render the case a somewhat critical one.

If the matter of the supposed earth-moon ring became cooled to solid particles

while in the ring form, or if the earth were formed by the collision of meteoroidal

matter, the temperature of the surface of the earth at any given time would depend

Aon the rate and violence of the infall.  cold earth is theoretically as possible as

a hot one. Eeasons may be assigned why the temperature was likely to be low.

   A sketch was given of the hypothetical growth of the earth by the ingathering

of the solid particles of the supposed earth-moon ring, in the course of which it

was shown that the peculiar constitution of such a body, when it reached the size

of the moon, would be favourable to explosive eruptions and liable to give rise to

craters like those of the moon. The internal heat necessary would come from the

self-condensation of the growing globe. Computations were cited to show that

this was adequate. The gases and vapours involved were attributed to atmospheric

material carried in by the ingathering particles. When the mass reached a size

large enough to hold an atmosphere, this size being probably about that of ]\Ier-

cury, or a little larger, it would pick up atmosphere from without and would hold

the gases and vapours emanating from within, and thus the atmosphere as an

envelope would begin. As soon as it acquired sufficient extent to retain the heat

of the sun, the modern phase of the history of the earth woidd begin, and in time

the conditions for the presence of life would be reached. This makes the intro-

duction of life possible at a very much earlier stage than the current hypotheses, and

gives ample time for the most strenuous demands of theoretical biology. The
646 EEPORT-- 1897.

sbrinkage of the earth gradually, owing to its owe gravity, would give a sufficient
amount of contraction to explain not only the phenomena of mountains and archjean

crumplings, but of plateaux, continents, and ocean basins. Computation shows that

the internal heat generated by the time the eai-tb reached its maturity would be

ample to explain the present internal heat, and account for much loss during

geological ages.

This is a departure from the common view of the history of the atmosphere in

supposing it to be<rin as a tenuous envelope, and be subject both to enrichment and

depletion during all its subsequent history. The supply from within is very imper-
fectly known. The air and ocean together are only about one-fiftieth of 1 percent,
of the earth's mass. The increase of the atmosphere from without is almost wholly

a matter ot conjecture'.

The emanations from within would doubtless be more abundant at times of

igneous extravasation and of the disruption of the crust than at other times, so

that the supplies to the atmosphere would vary according as the average of the.=e
conditions varied. The impoverishment of the atmosphere, particularly in respect

to its carbonic acid, was probably dependent very largely upon topographic states.

When the land was elevated the underground water-level was relatively deep beneath

the surface, and the penetration of aerated waters below was also deep, and the

alteration of the rocks went on relatively rapidly. "When the land was depressed
or cut down to an approximate base-level the underground water surface was

shallow, and the penetration of aerated waters below that was also shallow, and

the change of the rocks was slow. Whenever, therefore, the land on an average

stood high, the impoverishment of the atmosphere went on rapidly ; whenever it
was low, slowly. Combining this with the irregularities of supply, it appears

that enrichment and impoverishment would generally run together and give, on

the whole, a somewhat uniform atmosphere                                                                                                                                                                       but in the nature of the case the two
                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

were not strict;ly concurrent, and as a result at times there was enrichment, and at

times depletion of the atmosphere. From these it is held that great climatic

changes would arise. Scantiness of carbonic acid would be correlated with cold

temperatures, as maintained by Tyndall aud others. The great periods of cold

temperature should therefore follow at some distance the great periods of elevation

of the crust of the earth. The recent great glaciation followed at a notable in-

terval the great uplifts of the tertiary era. The great glaciation of India, Aus-

tralia, and South Africa came at about the time of the great disturbances closing

the palaeozoic era, but the precise relation cannot be positively stated. There

seem to be other correspondences between the laws here laid down and the great

climatic episodes of past geologic times.

Another source of atmospheric loss arises from the removal of carbonic acid by

plants, aud the failure of this to be returned by decay or the action of animals.

It is estimated that the present annual growth of vegetation is sufficient to con-

sume all the carbonic acid in the air in one hundred years if there were no return.

It is believed that cold temperature would check the decay of vegetation and pre-

vent, in part, the return of the carbon to the atmosphere, and this would tend to

impoverish it.

Tyndall suggested, fifty years ago, that the glacial periods might be due to

scantiness of carbonic acid in the atmosphere. Dr. Arrhenius has recently made

elaborate computations on the subject, and has reached the conclusion that the

removal of from 38 to 45 per cent, of the carbonic acid would bring on such a

glaciation as occurred in the ice age, and that an increase of two and a half to three

times the present carbonic acid would bring on a mild temperature, like that of

tertiary times. This view leaves the oscillations of the glaciation to be accounted

for. It is suggested that a rhythmical movement in the feeding and robbing of the

atmosphere would result from the action of the ocean and of the organic cycle.

The ocean, when cold, absorbs more carbonic acid than when warm, and hence,

instead of coming to the rescue of the atmosphere when robbed of its carbon

dioxide by the rocks, it was disposed to hold its carbonic acid, and perhaps even

turn robber itself. At the same time, the vegetation was less subject to decay,

and a smaller part of the carbon was returned to the air. By the combination of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.  G47

these agencies the impoverishment of the atmosphere was hastened, and the epoch

of cold precipitated.

     But when glaciation spread over the crystalline areas whose alterations were
the chief source of depletion, the abstraction of the carbonic acid was checked, and
if the supply continued, the re-enrichment would begin and warmth return. With
returning warmth the ocean would give up its carbonic acid more freely, and the

accumulated vegetable matter would decay, adding its contribution of carbonic
acid and accelerating the re-enrichment of the atmosphere. But when again the
ice disappeared and the ci-ystalline areas were exposed to alterations the depletion
would be renewed, and so the rhythmical movement would continue until the land

was lowered or the general conditions changed.

2. Distribution and Succession of the Pleistocene Ice Sheets of j\'ortheno

    United States. By T. C. Ciiambeelin, Professor of Geology in the

      University of Chicago.

     In this communication the author presented a synopsis of the leading events in
the history of the Pleistocene as determined from studies of Glacial deposits
throughout. Northern United States from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic
Coast, and from the mouth of the Ohio northward to the Canadian border. The
several ice sheets determined from their products were defined, and the extent of
each was indicated ; while the eti'ect of Glacial action on topographic configuration
and the geographic features of the country was developed.

    3. On the Glacial Formations of the Alps. By Professor A. Penck.'

     The former glaciation of the Alps resembled very much that of British Colum-
bia and Alaska of to-day. The valleys were tilled with glaciers, which poured into
the Piedmont region, forming here large ice-lobes. The borders of these ice-lobes

are formed by terminal moraines ; in the interior occur drumlins with a radial
direction, and depressions filled with water forming lakes, or with alluvial deposits
forming peat-mosses or gravel-flats.

     The glacial formations consist of true moraines and fluvioglacial deposits. Three
different formations of this kind can be distinguished, the older beingweathered below
the younger. Judging from the thickness of the decomposed parts, the relation of
the duration of the postglacial and the two interglacial epochs may be estimated as
1:4:6. The duration of the postglacial time cannot have been less than 20,000
years ; the duration of both interglacial epochs, therefore, appears to have exceeded
200,000 years ; the total length of the great ice age, with its glacial and interglacial
epochs was, judged by the deposits of the Po plain, 500,000 years. Interglacial

sections prove that in the interglacial epochs the glaciers retired to the remote

corners of the mountains. The loess is the characteristic formation of the Alpine
interglacial epochs. Its development is in favour of Baron v. Richthofen's teolian
hypothesis, for the loess is confined to ilie central European districts of the Alps,
and is wanting in the Mediterranean climate. But it is also probable that the
material of the loess is of fluvioglacial origin. The older glacial deposits of the
Alps have experienced a slight folding parallel to the strike of the Western Alps

                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

they describe a succession of synclines and anticlines.
     All Alpine lakes lie within the limits of the last glaciation ; their origin, how-

ever, is a very complex one. They are, in general, deformed valleys, deepened and
widened by the ice, and dammed by its moraines.

     The postglacial epoch appears short in comparison with the interglacial epochs,
and if there occurred times of readvance of the ice, which are probably indicated by
terminal moraines in the valleys, they were less than the three glacial epochs.

There is abundant evidence for the existence of man during the last glacial and

the last interglacial epoch ; its antiquity in Europe can be estimated as about
 150,000 years.

648 REPORT-- 1897.

          4. On the Asar of FMand. By P. Kropotkin.

    These observations on the Ssar, or eskers, of Finland were made in 1871.
Many researches have been made since by Finnish geologists ; but although the
glacial origin of the Ssar is now firmly established, their mode of formation in

connection with the ice-sheet still remains uncertain.

The chief point which appears in regard to the Ssar of Finland and Sweden is

that they follow the same lines as were followed by the ice-cap in its southward
and south-eastward movement. While taking no heed of important orographical

features, they take into account, like glacial striae, minor depressions and eleva-

tions, showing that the ice always followed the lines of least resistance.

    The main Swedish &ar descend from the highlands ; they spread next upon an

elevMted plain, 100 to 200 feet high ; then they descend to the Malar depression^
cross it. and finally creep over the hilly tracks in the south of Lake Malar.

     At the time of the author's visit to Sweden, the as of Upsala was cut through
its whole width at Upsala, for making a new road. It consists of a core, made up

of totally unstratified, unwashed, and unsorted gravel, composed of I'ound, angular,

and sub-angular stones, from a few inches to several feet in diameter, mixed with

sand and finest mud. This gravel is exactly similar to the bottom moraine in the-

neighbourhood, only containing a slightly greater proportion of limestone boulders

brought from Gefle. This core is covered with a mantle of washed, stratified, and

sorted gravels, sands (ripple-marks), and clays, with Baltic shells.

The Ssar of Finland, represented on an orographic map, all run N.W. to S.E.

One of them, the Pungaharju, was described, to show the orographic features of a
big Its. The Kangasala 8s, in West Finland, occupies a position which makes of it

a sister as to the Swedish S^ar on the western shore of the Gulf of Bothnia. It is

a typical as, ninety-five miles long (twenty-two miles explored). It has all the

characters of a longitudinal moraine, partly destroyed by the lakes and covered

with sands and gravels which were washed by water and were deposited on tlje

old shores of a lake which reached a higher level than is now reached by Lake

Piijane. The morainic core consists of a typical kross-stensgrus, in which immense

scratched boulders are scattered.

     Of later Finnish explorers, Wiik (1876), Gylling (1881), and Lederholm (1889)
consider it also as a moraine, modified by water in its superficial layers ; while

Berghell (1892) is inclined to consider it as the produce of a glacial river.

&The  of  Yvaskylii bears       the  same  character                                                                                                                                                                                                        while      along  the  Tammerfors-
                                                                                        ;

Helsingfors railway the Ss of Ryttila was found to have been largely digged out

as a ballast-pit. The washed and sorted gravel was taken away as ballast; but the

till (which gives bad ballast owing to its contents of fine glacial mud) was left

intact at the bottom, thus showing that the core of the Ss is of morainic origin.

The same was observed in the Ss at Dickursby.

The conclusions to be drawn from these facts, taken out of many others ob-
--Aserved by the author, are :
                                strict distinction must be made between the core of

an Ss and its mantla. They are of distinct origin. The latter is always due to

the action of water (rivers, lakes, or the sea), while the core, whenever access could

be found to it, was invariably of morainic origin. Always it was found to consist

of unwashed and unstratified till, and never of fluviatile deposits. This core is

often buried under a thick sheet of water-deposits, and occasionally it lies even

beneath the level of the surrounding plains. It must have the same origin as the

drumlins, horse-backs, cames, &c., which are elongated hillocks formed in the bottom

moraine, parallel to the motion of ice, and always accompany Ssar. From the

geological survey of Sweden it appears that the bi-asar (small tributaries of the

big Ssar) often are such drumlins {kross-asar)                                                                                                                                                                                                              and while  the  Rongedala Ss is  de-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

scribed as a ruUsten-as in its lower parts, it is represented as of morainic origin in

its upper parts.

    We cannot say yet in which way these morainic ridges were formed, whether

under, or within, or on the surface of, the ice-cap but the Ssar can safely be taken
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

the main Swedish Ssar and the Kangasala as were side morainic deposits of the lobes

of the ice-cap. But it is equally possible that similar morainic ridges may arisfr

under the ice-cap, or withia it.

    At any rate, it seems almost impossible to explain the formation of Ssar by river
action. The cores of the Kangasala and Yviiskyla Ssar, with their immense scratched
boulders, certainly have not been deposited bi/ rivers. Nor the unstratified, un-

washed, and unsorted core of the Upsala Ss. This latter, which runs from a level,
of 500 feet to 120 feet, next raises to a level of 207 feet, descends to Lake Malar
in the level of the sea, and creeps again to a level of 180 feet, cannot have been
made by a river. Even under the ice a river would mine its channel in the line of

least resistance (eastwards in this case), instead of running uphill. No river could,
moreover, have so steady a channel, a fenr hundred feet wide, as to make such a

ridge ; it would have changed its channel in the course of time in the ice as well,,

just as it does it in a rocky bed.

     The latest researches of Finnish geologists, showing the existence of two fron-
tal moraines of the ice-cap, nearly parallel to the northern shore of the Gulf of

Finland, and probably of a third I'urther north (about Kuopio) were next referred

to, as a parallel to the frontal moraines discovered in America.

5. T/ie Clicdk)/ Boulder-clay and the Glacial Phenomena of the Western-
    Midland Counties of England} B>j H. B. Woodward, F.R.S.

The general distribution of the Chalky Eoulder-clay is first stated, and its

limits in Southern and Western England defined. The author then deals with

certain phenomena of especial interest, such as the wide dispersal of the chalky

detritus in the drifts, the disturbance of the underlying strata, the occurrence of

large blocks or ' cakes ' of the local formations among the glacial deposits, and

the intercalation of sand and gravel with the boulder-clay.

In the West-Midland counties, the glacial phenomena of which have not yet

been thoroughly examined, there is a marginal area bordering tbe strongly

glaciated regions to the east and north-east. This has not been afl^ected by the

later stages of the Glacial period, as the Chalky Boulder-clay is succeeded by

modified drift in the form of valley gravels and loam, with the remains of

mammoth and associated fossils, which merge into the estuarine and marine

deposits of the Severn Valley. In sketching the probable southern and western

limits of the Chalky Boulder-clay in this region, the author remarks on tbe absence

of drift from certain elevated tracts a s indicating that the land-ice may have beea

locally arrested by them and divided into lobes and tongues which invaded the

lower ground. Previous to this glaciation the main features of the country seem

to have been aa at present, but there was no doubt a thick covering of

weathered rock and rubble on the surface, and this material would be readily

frozen into the base of a sedentary ice-sheet. In general the chief effect of the

ice has been to degrade the surface features rather than to efface them.

The glaciation does not seem to have affected the Cotteswold Hills, which are

flanked with thick accumulations of local rubble, explicable as the result of the

disintegration and redistribution of the surface layers during alternate frost and

thaw, as suggested by Witchell and  Lucy                          Edgehill  also  appears  locally to have
                                                               ;

arrested the land -ice.

Although the chalky ingredients of the Chalky Boulder-clay are present over-

wide areas, there is much local variation in the other material, according to the

nature of the underlying rocks. The new railway cuttings of the Midland branch

Railway east and west between Bourn and Saxby, and those of the Manchester,

Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway north and south between Catesby and Quaia-

ton Road, near Aylesbury, have furnished good examples of this variation.

If the weathered soil and subsoil were frozen into the sedentary ice, the dis-

turbance of the underlying rocks, of which many instances are cited, might be

produced during the movement and shearing of these basal layers. The debris

thus removed might rise by overthrusts into higher horizons in the ice, and ba

then carried forward and widely distributed and commingled with local detritus
during alternate recessions and re-advances of the ice-margin, the houlder-clay

feeing deposited, to a large extent, by the melting of the ice, as indicated many

years ago by J. G. Goodchild in his account of ice-work in Edenside.
     The degrading action of the ice has differed widely in different localities. It

is where this action has been most marlied, as around the Fenland border, that the
large transported masses of Secondary strata have been most frequently observed.

Among examples of such masses are the disturbed sheets of chalk of the Norfolk

Coast and Trowse, the huge mass at Roslyn Hole, Ely, and that at Catworth de-
scribed by Mr. A. C. G. Cameron. Other well-known examples are the masses of
Lincolnshire Limestone at Great Ponton, and the mass of Marlstone 200 yards
across at Beacon Hill, described by Professor Judd ; while recently Mr. C. Fox
Strangways has observed ' a mass of Lincolnshire Oolite at least 300 yards long
and 100 yards broad,' to the north-west of Melton Mowbray. All these occur iu
connection with the Chalky Boulder-clay.

     The author then draws attention to the singular absence of Jurassic outliers
along the western margin of the great Lincolnshire ' Cliff',' and he suggests that
these huge cakes and boulders wee, in some cases, dislodged from outliers which
had become frozen to the base of the ice-sheet and were then shifted to higher
levels along planes produced in the ice by its movement over an irregular surface.

The abundant chalky detritus was no doubt carried along minor planes of move-
ment in the ice, the chalk lumps being scored by fractured flint, and the material

being transported far and wide at higher levels in the ice than the bulk of the more
local material. In certain instances the soil frozen to the base of the ice-sheet was
little, if at all, moved, being overridden by subsequent ice-movements.

     The intercalation of sand and gravel with the Chalky Boulder-clay is, he thinks,
?3e8t explained as a marginal phenomenon produced at diflerent stages in the advance
find retreat of the ice-sheet. The author acknowledges his indebtedness to Messrs.
Chamberlin, Crosby, and Upham, whose studies have thrown so much light on
glacial phenomena.

                        6. Glacial a)id Interrjlacial Deposits at Toronto.

               By A. P. Coleman, Ph.D., Toronto University.

     The ravines of the river Don at Toronto and the lake cliffs of Scarborough

Heights, a few miles to the east, provide exceedingly interesting sections of the
·drift, from 100 to 350 feet in thickness, displaying three or more sheets of till and
a varying number of interglacial beds.

     The most important section, at Taylor's brickyard in the Don Valley, shows a
lowest till overlying Cambro-Silurian shale of Hudson River age. Upon this rest
18 feet of sand and clay, containing many uuios and other shells, as well as leaves
and pieces of wood. Some of the unios do not now live in Canadian waters, but
are found in the Mississippi ; and several species of trees now belonging to the
States to the south occur with them, indicating a climate decidedly warmer than
the present. Above this come stratified clay and sand, with a caribou horn and

remains of insects and plants belonging to a colder climate than the present. This
set of clays and sands is best shown at Scarborough, where the series rises 148 feet

above Lake Ontario, and contains many species of extinct beetles, as well as shell-
fish, mosses, and wood of hardy trees.

     A complicated middle till overlies these beds, which were deeply eroded before

the advance of the ice. Another less important fossil-bearing interglacial bed
occurs above the middle till at elevations up to 240 feet above the lake, and is
followed by a third till.

      Great changes in the level of the water occurred in connection with these

climatic changes, the lake being much lower than at present, before the first

glacial advance and after the first interglacial time.
      During the deposition of the middle till, and also while the last sheet of till was

 being deposited, the water stood from 250 to 300 feet above the jjresent level of
 the lake, which stands 247 feet above the aea.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.       Gol

     The retreat of the last ice sheet was followed by the Iroquois episode, leaving a

well-marked elevated beach.
     The length of time required for the first interglacial period is probably to be

estimated at thousands of years ; and during this time, at the beginning of which
the climate was very warm, the ice sheet of the Laurentide glacier must have com-

pletely disappeared.

     The correlation of the series of events described with those of the drift of the
United States and of Europe is difficult, but probably the chief iuterglacial period
corresponds to Geikie's Neudeckian, or the interval between the lowan and

Wisconsin glacial advances.

             7. On the Continental Elevation of the Glacial Epochs
                        By J. W. Spencer, Ph.D., F.G.S.

     At the last meeting of the British Association, held in Liverpool, Professor
Edward Hull presented a paper upon ' Another Possible Cause of the Glacial
Epoch,' in which the phenomena of the drowned valleys described by the present

writer in the ' Reconstruction of the Antillean Continent ' * are also accepted by
Professor Hull as due to river erosion, thus furnishing yardsticks for measuring

the recent elevation of the region.

     In that paper the writer described a large number of drowned valleys, often
extending from the mouths of the great modern rivers across the submarine
plateaus at various depths, reaching to even 12,000 feet or more. The writer now
submits evidence showing that similar drowned valleys and amphitheatres are
recognisable as far northward as Labrador, beyond which latitude surveys have
not been made.

     The submarine valleys radiating from the American Continent are no greater
than many observable upon the surface of the land, and are particularly comparable
to the valleys and canons traversing the plateaus of Mexico and the Western States
both in magnitude and in the declivity of the various steps which indicate the

pauses in the elevation of the land.

     Upon tracing northward the deposits occupying the great valleys, the writer

has found that glacial accumulations occur in New Jersey between the Lafayette

formation, which is the latest horizon dissected by the great valleys, provisionally
regarded as of late Pliocene age, and the Columbia formation, which is mid-Pleis-

tocene. From all these considerations the writer concludes that the eastern
portion of North America stood more than two miles above the sea during the

earUer Pleistocene epoch.

    From the occui-rence of certain fossils, and of many canons of recent date incising

the borders of the tablelands, it appears that the Mexican plateau was, at least
in part, depressed to near sea level during the times of the high elevation of the
eastern portion of the continent ; and that, with the subsidence of the eastern
region, the western side of the continent was elevated from 6,000 to 10,000 feet
or more. The separation of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is only of recent

date.

     The soundings in the eastern Atlantic have not always been along the lines
which show the best development of the submerged valleys, but the amphitheatres
and other valley-features in the subcoastal margin of Europe show some of the
phenomena of elevation, after studying their characteristics off the American coast.
While a submarine bridge exists between Europe and Greenland, there appears
to be no similar connection between Greenland and America. Under these
circumstances, the epochs of elevation on the two sides of the ALtlantic cannot bo
shown as simultaneous. On the other hand, it is suggested that the elevation upon
the two sides alternated similarly to the terrestrial waves between the eastern
region of America and Mexico.

     The theory of the Antillean ridge is strongly supported by the distribution of

certain mammals of that time over North and South America, as shown hy some

of Professor Cope's last worii, and by the occurrence of eliptics in Guadeloupe.
     If the physical phenomena be correctly interpreted, the changes of levels of

land and sea, and the dependent variations of currents, &c., seem to be sufficient

cause for the Glacial period, as advocated by Lyell and many others, while the

writer has only pointed out where changes have occurred.
     Since the epoch of great elevation there have been extensive subsidences iu

America, so that much of the region, where not actually submerged, stood near
sea level. The subsequent elevation has been unequal and most pronounced in the

mountain regions, as of New England, New York, &c., where tilted beaches,

deltas, and terraces occur on all sides of the high mountains in such locations as
would require the base levels of erosion to be reduced to near sea level, while the
subsequent rise of the land has lifted them to a height of at least 2,700 feet.

    Between the phenomena of great elevation and depression there are many
others not yet assigned to their proper places, which possibly accounts for

various explanations of the surface features.

8. The Champlain Submergence and Uplift, and their Relations to the
    Great Lakes and Niagara Falls. By Frank Bursley Taylor, of

     Fort Wayne, Indiana.

    There is much evidence that the disappearance of the Champlain submergence
was a recent event in geological time. The skeletons of whales and seals found

within the submerged ai'ea are not petrefactions, but bones ; its marine shells are

fresh in appearance. Many of the species iound live now in the Gulf of the
St. Lawrence. The river channels traversing the old sea bottom betray their
youth by many signs. Its soil shows less oxidation than that of the adjoining

unsubmerged drift area.

   A remarkable abandoned beach surrounds a large portion of the upper Great

Lakes. It leads to a low col at the east end of Lake Nipissing, and is hence
called the Nipissing beach and the lake which it bounded, and which was nearly

                                                                                                                                                 ;

coterminous with the present Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron, is called the
Nipissing Great Lake. It lies in a very even plane which diverges from the

present lake level at the rate of nearly seven inches to the mile in a direction

Nabout 27° E. Its maximum elevation is 110 to 115 feet above Lake Superior,

and this at Peninsular Harbour; at North Bay it is about 120 feet above

Georgian Bay. It meets the present surface of Lake Huron at points nearly

opposite the mouth of Saginaw Bay                                                                                                                                            of Lake Michigan near  Traverse  and Green

Bays, and of Lake Superior not far east from Duluth. Its plane projected would

pass about 25 feet under the present lake level at Duluth, 40 feet at Port Huron,

and 100 feet at Chicago.
     The land exposed between the Nipissing beach and the present water margin is

in some places a number of miles in width. It exhibits the same evidences of

newness as those found in the uplifted area of the Champlain submergence.

Shells found in it are iu a similar state of preservation. Kiver channels which
cross it are manifestly in the early stages of erosive work. Notable among these
is the Nipigon. The inference is strong that the Nipissing Great Lake period was

contemporaneous with the Champlain submergence, and that during that time the

upper Great Lakes had their outlet by way of the Nipissing pass and Ottawa

river.

If this is true there remained only the discharge of Lake Erie to occupy the

Niagara. This is at present about one-ninth of the total volume of the river.

As the work of this feeble stream we can account for the narrow and shallow

gorge of the Whirlpool rapids.
     The Champlain Uplift simultaneously uncovered the floor of the Champlain

sea, raised the Nipissing beach at the north-east and submerged it at the south-

west, closed the Nipissing outlet and opened that at Port Huron, turned the

entire discharge of the Great Lakes into the Niagara river, and inaugurated the

cutting of its upper great gorge. Taking the ascertained rate of recession of the

Horseshoe fall as the principal datum, the time occupied in that work may have

been from 5,000 to 10,000 years, which thus becomes the measure of the time
which has elapsed since the emergence of the Champlain area. The measure of
the duration of the Champlain submergence is the time occupied in the cutting of

the gorge of the Whirlpool rapids. No data exist for its statement in years that

would be more than a guess. Such merely conjectural estimate as can be based

on the action, or inaction, rather, of the American fall would lead to figures nob
less than twenty or twenty-five thousand years.

10. Drift Phenomena of Puget Sound and their Interpretation.

                             By Bayley Willis.

The area from which the facts for this discussion were collected is the Tacoma

quadrangle of the United States topographical survey, comprising the district east

and south of Seattle and Tacoma. The major topographic features are the

channels of the Sound and the strictly homologous valleys now fiUed with

alluvium. These divide, and in some instances surround, plateau-like elevations

composed of stratified and unstratified drift that rise about 500 feet above the sea.

On the slopes of the adjacent foot hills of the Cascade Range drift deposits

occur up to and beyond 1,700 feet above the sea. Various features of the Glacial-

derived topography have been traced out in detail, including characteristic till

surfaces, morainic zones, kames, and overwash plains. The distribution of these

features indicates that at least the latest Glacial advance was along the valleys and

channels of the Sound, and that glaciers rose above and overflowed the margins

of the plateaus. The materials of the drift are to a large extent granite, and bear
Aevidence of prolonged water transportation.
                                              distinct variety of till, containino-

numerous erratics of Tertiary volcanics, was found in localities to which it was

probably brouo-ht from the local centre of glaciation. Mount Rainier. The rela-

tion of these local Glacial deposits to the general drift indicates that the prevailing

drift phenomena were due to glaciers which penetrated from the north as far south

as the foot hills of Mount Rainier, 30 miles south-east of Tacoma.

The detailed examination of the various features of the drift suggests the

hypothesis that the channels of the Sound are the hollows remaining after

repeated Glacial occupation of a wide valley formerly diversified by the valleys

and ridges of pre- Glacial topography. In the course of repeated Glacial advance

and retreat the earlier divides were built upon and transformed into plateau-likt'

eminences of Glacial drift, whereas the occupation of the valleys by Glacial ice,

particularly in the stagnant stages of retreat, prevented their being permanently

filled ; with the final retreat of the ice the molds of glaciers remained as the

channels of the Sound. This hypothesis is to be contrasted with that of erosion

due to repeated uplift and subsidence.

                          By Professor C. H. Hitchcock.

     The ice-sheet of eastern North America had its gathering grounds in the
Laurentian highlands, east of Hudson's Bay. Glaciers flowed from it in all
directions. Perhaps the most conspicuous discharge was to the south through

the Cliamplain and Hudson valleys to a point eighty miles out to sea. The study
of the striae shows a series directed southerly through the lowest line of this
depression, nowhere much elevated above the sea-level.

     On the west the striae point S.W., and stones have been transported in the

same direction. Thus fragments of Potsdam sandstone are strewed over the
Adirondack mountains even to their very summits, as proved in 1896 by the

writer. All through middle New York and into Pennsylvania, boulders of the
Adirondack granites may be seen.

     On the east of the central line the striae point S.E. on the summits of all the
Green and White mountains, and boulders from the N.W. have everywhere been

carried up to and beyond these summits. Laurentian boulders are found in

northern Vermont and New Hampshire, and, in one place at least, over the height

of land into Maine.

     On examining this area it seems to be a broad lobe, with striae diverging from
the central line, much like the barbs of a feather from the central shaft.

     Studies of the Erie, Michigan, and Superior lobes show a similar arrangement
of striiB, but the lobes themselves are more acuminate.

     This southern lobe is remarkable for its movement from a plain near the sea-

level over the highest mountains in New England and New York, 6,000 and

5,000 feet.

     The terminal moraines of this great glacial lobe correspond to the two sets of
striae, being rudely at right angles to the direction of the movement in both cases.

Those of central New York run meridionally, and then follow down the west side
of the Hudson valley. Those in New England are parallel to the margin in the

outer portions, and those in N. H. and Vt. run more nearly N.E. and S.W.
     As portrayed on the map, the line of junction between this southern lobe and

the one coming from Lake Ontario is near Salamanca, N.Y. An angle is made

there, which is the most northern part of the unglaciated country outside of the
limits traversed by the ice known in the United States.

     The moraines of the Ontario lobe are arranged in parallel looped lines, and
those in the immediate vicinity of Toronto belong to this series.

     If this great lobe had its origin in the Laurentian hills, it is difficult to under-

stand how the ice can have been accumulated at a lower level sufficiently abun-
dantly to move over a higher level, probably three thousand feet. It is easy to
see how the Ontario lobe could have made its way, as the greater altitude of the

rim of the basin in Ohio is comparatively slight.
     The fact that the area of the southern lobe is greater than that of any other,

reminds one of the map of the Great Baltic glacier given us by Professor James

Geikie.

           13. The pre-Glacial Decay of Bocks in Eastern Canada.

By Robert Chalmers, F.G.S.A., of the Geological Survey of Canada,

     Although the question of the subaerial decay of rocks has been before geologists

for many years, it does not appear to have received much attention in glaciated
countries. One reason of this may be the prominence given to the action of

Pleistocene ice in the production of the superficial deposits, the origin of the

boulder clay, moraines, kames, &c., being apparently quite readily explained by

such action, while the sedentary beds beneath, due to rock decay, are often so

thin and fragmentary that they seem to have been overlooked. It is, nevertheless,,

becoming more and more evident in the detailed study of the superficial deposits

that the materials of rock decay, from which all others have been derived, form a

very important constituent of the series.

     In Eastern Canada a wide field for tbe study of the products of rock decay

exists, in which, so far, but few workers have been found. Sir J. W. Dawson

described beds of this kind occurring at Les Eboulements, Quebec, where Utica

slates have been changed to a great depth into a sort of clay.' Dr. T. Sterrj'

Hunt also observed instances of the similar decomposition of rocks in the vicinity
of Montreal, especially at Rigaud Mountain." The writer has been investigating

phenomena of this kind since 1884. and has noted beds of decayed rock beneath

the boulder clay in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and in

South-Eastern Quebec, while in the JMagdalen Islands the whole of the superficial

deposits consist of rock debris, some portions of which are, however, more or less

stratified by marine and atmospheric action, no glaciation having taken place

there.

In the present paper the question of rock decay during the geological ages

which preceded the Tertiary is not considered.

Beds of decomposed rock of variable thickness and more or less modified occur

wherever the surface of the rocks has not been abraded by Pleistocene ice, though

the evidence of ice action may be present and boulder clay often found overlying

them. In South-Eastern Quebec the hilly, broken country along the northern

slopes of the Notre Dame range appears to have protected these in some measure

from glacial erosion, and hence they occur in thick sheets in certain places,,

especially in river valleys. The stratified and indigenous pre-Glacial beds met

with in the valley of the Chaudiere, for example, taken together, are not les&

than 45 feet thick. In New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island

the glaciation has been comparatively light in many districts, and consequently

remnants of these materials are found there also, though iu a greatly denuded

state.

   A general section of these beds, as recognised in Eastern Canada, may be given,

showing briefly in descending order their character and sequence as noted in

--different places beneath tbe boulder clay : (1) Transported and stratified water-

worn gravel with beds of fine sand and clay. (2) Coarse, stratified gravels, usually

yellow and oxidised, the materials wholly local. (3) Sedentary rotted rock,

passing into solid rock beneath.

     Certain portions of the region, as, for example, the eastern extremity of the

Gaspe Peninsula, the Magdalen Islands, and some localities in Prince Edward

Island, exhibit no abrasion from Pleistocene ice, and the surface, therefore, presents

nearly the same appearance as it probably did in the later Tertiary period.  -VJ

The mineralogical character and consistency of the decayed rock materials are,

of course, different upon each geological formation, varying from coarse and

angular, upon the older crystallines, to clay, with scaly fragments in districts-

occupied with slates, and changing into sand and gravel where sandstones prevail.
     The products of rock decay as observed beneath the boulder clay are, therefore,

of two kinds, indigenous and modified, the latter thickest in the ancient river

valleys, but often eroded, or entirely swept away by the rivers since the Glacial
period in clearing out their channels anew. From the facts at hand it is evident
that a mantle of these materials of variable thickness must have occupied the

vsrhole region in the later Tertiary period, however, and that denudation from the
Pleistocene ice and fluviatile action before and since has left only remnants of it
to the present day.

      In reference to the precise age of these beds in Eastern Canada, no evidence

seemw yet to be available. At the western base of the Green Mountains, near
Brandon, Vermont, certain beds were discovered many years ago closely resembling
those of the Chaudiere valley of pre-Glacial date. Lequereux, who studied the
vegetable remains which they contained, referred them to the Miocene.*

     The manner in which the rocks decompose and yield these indigenous products
is a question which requires fuller treatment than can be accorded to it in this

--paper. Decomposition seems, however, to be mainly of two kinds mechanical and

chemical. The most important is doubtless that due to precipitation and to the
action of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere. Changes of temperature have also
tad a very great influence, especially in Eastern Canada, producing contraction
and expansion of the rocks, and thus causing numerous joints and fissures into
-which water and disintegrating agents would find access. Decomposition cannot,
towever, have proceeded at as rapid a rate in this country as in tropical regions.
The mantling of the earth's surface with snow and the freezing up of the super-
ficial deposits for five or six months every year would have a conservative effect,
and check the action of the disintegrating forces.

     The general aspect of the dry land in Eastern Canada previous to the Glacial
period must have been nearly similar to that of the region south of the glaciated
2one in North America, though the superficial beds may not, for the reasons stated
above, have been as deep. The facts show, however, that rock decay has been in
progress for long ages in this country as in other parts of the earth, though
apparently with diminished eifect.

him. It relates to the genera Cryptozoon of Hall, Archceozooti of Matthew, and

their structures, and have been found in beds ranging from the Lower Cambrian
downward. They all seem to be animal forms of low and generalised structure,
and probably Protozoa. The specimens referred to can be seen in the Peter
Pedpath Museum of McQill University, Montreal.

  2. Note on a Fish Tooth from the Ujyper Arisaig series of Nova Scotia.
                                 By J. F. Whiteaves.

     The only indication of the existence of vertebrate animals in the Silurian rocks
of Canada, that has yet been recorded, is a single specimen of a Pteraspidian fish

discovered by Dr. G. F. Matthew in the Nerepis hills of southern New Brunswick

in 1886. This specimen, which consists of the rostrum, the lateral cornua, the
·dorsal and ventral scutes, and some other plates of the anterior armature of the

                                          * Geology of Canada, 1863, p. 929.
       TRANSACTION'S OF SECTION C.                         657

 fish, was subsequently described by its discoverer as the type of a new genus,
 under the name Diplasjns Acadica, though Mr. A. Smith Woodward claims that

 it should be referred to Lankester's genus Cyathaspis.

     However this may be, in the Museum of the Geological Survey at Ottawa

 there is a well-preserved fish tooth from the Upper Arisaig series at McDonald's

 Brook, near Arisaig, N.S., collected by Mr. T. C. Weston in 1869. On the

evidence of large numbers of other kinds of fossils, the upper portion of the
 * Arisaig series ' is still held to be of about the same age as the Lower Helderberg

group of the State of New York and the Ludlow group of England, but no

Devonian rocks are known to exist at jMcDonald's Brook.
      The tooth itself, which is not quite perfect at either end, is about eleven

millimetres in height, by about five in breadth at the base. It is conical, slightly
curved, and somewhat compressed, the outline of a transverse section a little
 below the mid-height being elliptical. It is entirely covered with a thin coat of
·enamel, which is finely and longitudinally striated.

     Judging by its external characters, this specimen seems to be what is usually
·called a dendrodont tooth, and therefore probably that of a crossopterygian, per-
haps allied to Holoptychius, though its fore and aft edges are not trenchant. Only
·one specimen of it has been obtained, so that no thin sections of it have been made,
to show its microscopical structure. As it does not seem referable to any known

species, it may be convenient to call it provisionally Dendrodus Arisaigensis.

     If the limestones from which this tooth was collected are, as there is every

reason to believe that they are, of Silurian age, a second species can be added to
the vertebrate fauna of that system in Canada ; but if not, the tooth is still of

interest as indicating the possible existence of Devonian rocks at a locality where
£uch rocks have not previously been recognised.

      3. On some, new or hitherto little known Palceozoic Formations in
            North-Eastern America. By H. M. Ami, M.A., F.G.S.

     Leaving out of consideration the Cambrian formations of the north-east part of
America, which have received careful attention at the hands of Dr. G. F. Matthew
and the late Mr. E. Billings, the author discusses the little-known formations or

faunas of Ordovician (Cambro-Silurian) age of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

This is followed by an attempt to subdivide the Silurian formations of the Acadian
provinces according to faunas, and by a correlation of these faunas with similar or
homotaxial faunas in Northern Europe.

     The subdivisions of the Devonian system are then considered, and their faunal
relations in the district in question, as well as to areas more to the south and west,

in the State of New York and in Ontario.

     The paper closes with a synoptical view of the phases which characterised the
Carboniferous period of North-Eastem America, a subject of special interest from
an economic as well as from a scientific standpoint.

       4. Some Characteristic Genera of the Cambrian.

           By G. F. Matthew, LL.D., D.Sc, F.R.S.C.

     The paper gives in brief the history and use of several generic names and the

distribution of certain species to which they have been applied. These genera
have an important bearing on the antiquity of the Oleuellus Fauna Bathyuriscus,
Meek, known as a Middle Cambrian genus in Montana and Nevada, occurs in the
OleneUus Fauna of Eastern North America, It is nearly allied to the following

genus--Bolickotnetopus, Angelin, of the Upper Paradoxides Beds of Sweden, is
found in beds of similar age in Eastern Canada. With it is associated Dorypyge,
Dames ( = Olenoides in part of Walcott), which is a Middle Cambrian genus in
Montana, and is found also in the Olenellus Fauna of Eastern North America.

Microdiscics, a genus of small trilobites, extending in Eastern Canada up to the

Upper Paradoxides Beds, is found in tbe Olenellus Fauna. Agnosttis has a peculiar
de-velopment in the Upper Paradoxides Beds in the appearance at that horizon of
the section Lmvigati; the Brevifrontes also abound there. These two sections

appear to be present in the fauna with Olenellus.

     If we accept the view that there has been a regular development of the faunas
through Cambrian time, it is difficult to understand how Olenellus can be at the
base of the Cambrian succession and yet found in company with so many genera and
sub-genera which are known members of the Middle Cambrian fauna, or that of
the Upper Paradoxides Beds. Olenellus has not yet been found below the Para-

doxides Beds, and the evidence adduced indicates that it extended above rather
than below this part of the Cambrian system.

               Par Mgr. J.-C. K. Laflamme, de VUniversite Laval.

     II s'agit d'un eboulement arriv6 sur la riviere Ste-Anne, province de Quebec,

en avril 1894. Le cours de cette riviere, dans la partie dont il est ici question,
se divise en deux sections bien distinctes. Dans chacune la riviere coulait, avant
I'eboulis, dans un terrain d'alluvion, oii elle avait creus(5 de longs et nombreux
m^andres. La section d'amont etait peu profonde, mais I'autre, plac^e pres de

I'embouchure dans le St-Laurent, 6tait tres profonde et k courant tres faible.
Entre ces deux parties, la riviere traverse une formation calcaire (Trenton), dans
laquelle elle a creus^, en certains endroits, une gorge tres profonde qui existe encore,

mais meme la oii la gorge n'existe pas, le courant est tres rapide.

    Un eboulis de plusieurs millions de pieds cubes s'est produit tout a coup dans

la section sup(5rieure. L'ancien lit de la riviere a completement dispar-.i. Elle
coule maintenant sur de nouveaux bancs d'argile mis a nu, dans lesquels elle se

creuse un chemin. La masse de terre de I'eboulement a et6 transport^e a 10 miiles

de distance pres de I'embouchure, comblant ainsi en partie le cheiial profond qui
existait la auparavant, augmentant par consequent la vitesse du courant et
provoquant en cet endroit des ^boulements riverains, lesquels se contiuuent encore

et ont d6ja emport^ des surfaces considerables de terres cultivees. On a du faire
des travaux tres dispendieux pour sauver le pont du Pacifique, qui ^tait menac6
par cette alteration du regime de la partie inf^rieure de la riviere, et le dernier mot

n'est pas encore dit, Cette riviere va mettre des ann6es avant de retrouver sa

tranquillity primitive.

2. On the Relations and Structure of certain Granites and associated Arkoses
    on Lake Temiscaming, Caiuida. By A. E. Barlow, M.A., and W. F.

      Ferrier, B.A.Sc, Geological Survey of Canada.

     The rocks to which the following facts relate outcrop on both the eastern and
western shores of Lake Temiscaming immediately north of the ' Old Fort ' Narrows
on the upper Ottawa river, the deep channel of which forms the boundary line
between the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.

    On the eastern side of the lake the granite forms a strip along the shore half a

mile wide, and extending from a point three-quarters of a mile north of The Narrows

on which is situated the now abandoned Fort Temiscaming, a fur-trading post be-
longing to the Hudson Bay Company, to the steamboat wharf near the village of
Bale des Peres. It also constitutes the rocky promontory known as Wine Point

to the west of Bale des Peres, extending inland in a north-easterly direction for

about one mile and a quarter. On the western side of the lake the first outcrop is

noticed about half a mile west of ' The Narrows,' continuing along the shore for
about four miles as far as Paradis Point, and varying in breadth from half a mile
to one mile. The whole area thus underlaid by the granite is approximately about

six square miles.
     Macroscopically the fresh rock is a rather coarse, though very uniformly even

grained aggi-egate of felspar, quartz, and a dark coloured mica, probably biotite.
Felspar is by far the most abundant constituent, and the abundance of red oxide
of iron disseminated through all the cracks and fissures of this mineral gives to
the rock its beautiful deep flesh-red colour. The quartz is, as usual, allotriomor-
phic, but a decided tendency is noticed to segregate in more or less rounded areas
or individuals which, especially on surfaces worn and polished as a result of glacial
action, gives to the rock a porphyritic or pseudo-conglomeratic appearance ; a fact

first made note of by Sir William Logan in 1844 on his manuscript map of this

portion of the Ottawa river.
     The microscope shows the rock to be composed essentially of orthoclase, micro-

cline, plagioclase (oligoclase ?), quartz, and biotite almost completely altered to
chlorite. The microline has evidently Ijeen derived from orthoclase as a result of

pressure, and all the gradations of this change may be noted, from the ' moire

structure ' characteristic of the imperfectly or only partially developed mineral, to

the fine and typical ' cross-hatched structure ' peculiar to this mineral. The fel-
spar shows only incipient alteration to sericite, and scales and flakes of this mineral

are developed especially abundantly in the central portion of the individuals, leaving
a comparatively fresh periphery almost altogether free from such decomposition
products.

     The arkose with which this granite is associated and surrounded is a beautiful

pale or sea-green quartzite or grit, passing occasionally into a conglomerate, the

pebbles of which are chiefly grey and red quartz with occasional intermixed frag-
ments of a halleflinta-like rock.

     Under the microscope the finer-grained matrix appears to be almost wholly
composed of pale yellowish-green sericite in the form of minute scales and flakes,
although occasional individuals are macroscopically apparent. Most of this sericite
has originated from the decomposition in situ of felspar originally present, and
irregular portions or areas of the unaltered felspar may be occasionally detected.

     The line of junction between this granite and arkose shows a gradual and dis-

                                                                            uu2

tinct passage outward or upward from the granite mass. The series of thin sections

examined, as well as the hand specimens themselves, show every stage in the pro-

cess, which has heen carefully studied.

In the first place, as a result of dynamic action, the orthoclase is converted

into microcline with the incipient development of sericite, which gradually

increases iu those specimens where the greatest perfection of the ' cross-hatched '

microcline structure is reached. In these the individuals of quartz and felspar

have undergone rather extensive fracturing, hut with little or no movement apart

of the fragments. This breaking up of the original larger individuals is, as usual,

much more apparent in the quartz than in the felspar, and beautiful examples of

' strain-shadows ' may frequently be seen in those quartz areas which have not
Ayielded altogether to the pressure.
                                         further stage in the process is reached

when the sericitisation of the felspar has proceeded so far as to permit of the

' shoving apart ' of the fragments by the various forces which have acted in

bringing about the degradation of the whole rock mass. This gradual decom-

position of the felspar and movement of the rock constituents can be perfectly

traced in the series of thin sections examined until the rock cannot be distinguished

from an ordinary arkose, while the arrangement on the large scale, and the more

or less parallel alignment of rounded and waterworn quartzose fragments amply

testify to the final assortment and rearrangement of the disintegrated material as

a result of ordinary sedimentation.

The relations between this granite and arkose are of rather unusual scientific

interest, showing, as they do, the pre-Huronian existence of a basement or rtoor

upon which these sediments were laid down, and which in this portion at least

has escaped the movements to which the Laurentian gneisses have been subjected.

The granite is also somewhat different, both in composition and appearance, from

the granites and gneisses classified as Laurentian, and which are so frequently

referred to as the Fundamental Gneiss or Basement Complex, although during

recent years the assumption implied in these terms has been considerably weakened

·by the fact that the contact between such rocks and the associated elastics is,

wherever examined, one of intrusion. On the other hand, the composition of the

Huronian strata furnishes indubitable evidence of a pre-existing basement or floor

essentially granitic in composition, while the abundance of red granite pebbles and

fragments, which are so pre-eminently abundant in the breccio-conglomerate

lying at the base of the Huronian system, are very similar in composition and

appearance to the granite described above. This granite is, therefore, regarded

by the authors as the only instance at present known in which the material com-

posing the Huronian elastics can be clearly and directly traced, both macroscopi-

cally and microscopically, to the original source from which it has been derived.

       4. On some Nickeliferous Magnetites.'^ By Willet G. Miller.

    An examination has recently been made of the ore from some of the larger

·deposits of titaniferous magnetite in eastern Ontario. These magnetites have all
been found to be nickeliferous, the amount of nickel (and cobalt) present in some
being over 0-8 per cent. The non-titaniferous magnetites of the district have so
far as examined been found not to contain nickel.

     The titanium-nickel holding magnetites are considered to be of igneous origin,
while the other magnetites of the district are thought to be of aqueous or
mechanical origin.

     The fact that iron produced from titaniferous ores is of a very high quality
may have some connection with the occurrence of nickel in these ores. The

    A' short paper on this subject will appear in the next Annual Ecj)ort of the

Ontario Bureau of Mines, Toronto.
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION C.                            661

superior quality of sucli iron has been thought by some metallurgists to be due to

the presence of titanium in it.

     Even a very small percentage of nickel in an iron ore would be of value if the

nickel could be extracted along with the iron in smelting, as the resulting alloy
might be used directly in the production of nickel-steel.

     There is reason to believe that magnetites will be found containing a higher
percentage of nickel than those already examined, just as some of the Canadian
pyrrhotites, which are also considered to be of igneous origin, contain amounts of

nickel which make them valuable as ores, while others contain the metal in lesser

amounts.

5. Differentiation in Igneous Magmas as a result of Progressive
        Crystallisation. By J. J. H. Teall, M.A^ F.R.S.

Crystal building in an originally homogeneous igneous magma necessarily

produces differentiation into portions of different chemical composition, a fact the

importance of which was first impressed upon the author sixteen years ago in study-

ing the andesitic lavas and their associated quartz porphyry dykes in the Cheviot

district.

As is well known. Professor Eosenbusch has classified the common constituents

of igneous rocks into (1) the ores and accessory constituents (including magnetite,

&c.), (2) the ferro-magnesian constituents, (3) the felspathic constituents, (4) free

silica, and has maintained that members of group (1) are the first to form in the

process of crystallisation, and that while there are irregularities of order between
members of group (2) as compared with those of group (3), yet the members of
these groups separate out inter se in the order of increasing acidity. This order of

crystallisations has been emphasised by many writers, though it has also been

clearly recognised that the law is not constant in different magmas and under

diflerent conditions. The object of the present communication is to call attention

to what is at least an important exception to this law.

    Among an extensive series of rocks and fossils collected by the Jackson-

Harmsworth expedition in Franz Josef Land, recently examined by the author and
Mr. E. T. Newton, are many basalts essentially composed of labradorite, augite, and

interstitial matter, in which labradorite formed first, then augite, and last of all

the interstitial matter either with or without further differentiation. The main

interest of these rocks lies in the composition and relations of the interstitial

matter. This is occasionally present as a deep brown glass, but more often is

represented either by palagonite or by a turbid and more or less doubly refracting

substance crowded with skeleton-crystals of magnetite. In many specimens it is

only in this form that magnetite occurs, the labradorite and augite being free from

inclusions of this mineral. These facts prove that magnetite may belong to a very
late stage of consolidation, and that progressive crystallisation may lead to a con-

centration of iron oxides in the mother liquor.

The palagonite has undoubtedly been formed by the hydration of a deep brown

Anglass.   analysis was made of it with the following results :

           Loss on ignition
662 REPORT-- 1897.

In the second column the water is neglected and the percentage composition of
the remaining substances indicated. The analysis confirms the view that a great

concentration of iron oxide has taken place, and suggests the further conclusion

that there has been a concentration of magnesia and a reduction of the lime, silica,
and alumina, thus agreeing with the residts of the microscopic examination.

     Several observers are quoted by the author as having established the fact that

magnetite is not always one of the earliest minerals to form, and in basalts of the

Franz Josef Land type there is clear evidence that a basic magma may consolidate
without any separation of this mineral, although the mother-liquor may contain

30 per cent, of iron oxides.

Brogger, Vogt, and others have observed a tendency in certain dykes for the

molecular groups, of which the first-formed mmerals are built to migrate towards

the cooling margins.                                                                                The cases examined are mostly those                                 of intermediate rocks,
                                                                                                 _

in which the basic minerals are the first to form, so that the margins are more basic

than the central parts. But it appears probable that cases occur in which the

opposite is true. If the magma of the Franz Josef Land basalts had cooled slowly
in a fissure, we should expect to find the central portion of the dyke richer in iron

oxide than the margin. Professor Lawson has described two basic dykes from the

Eainy Lake region where this is actually the case, and a more striking illustration

is seen in the Taberg iron-ore mass, described by Sjogren and Tornebohm, where

the marginal portion of an eruptive mass about one square kilometre in area is formed

of olivine-hyperite containing only small quantities of magnetite and olivine,

which passes mward by gradual stages into a magnetite-olivinite without plagioclase.

In conclusion, it is asked whether the metallic iron which occurs as interstitial

matter in some of the Greenland basalts may not have been formed by the reduc-

tion, by included organic matter, of the iron oxides previously concentrated by

progressive crystallisation.

6. The Glaciation of North-Central Canada. By J. B. Tyrrell.

In the region immediately west of Hudson Bay the earliest glaciation, of which

any traces were recognised, flowed outwards from a gathering-ground which lay

north or north-west of Doobaunt Lake. Subsequently this gathering-ground

moved south-eastward, until it centred over the country between Doobaunt and

Yath-kyed Lakes. From one or other of these centres the ice seems, to the writer,

to have flowed westward and south-westward to within a short distance of the

base of the Rocky Mountains                                                                                                                  southward, for more  than  1,600 miles to the States
                                                                                                                                          ;

of Iowa and Illinois                                                                                eastward into the basin of Hudson Bay ;                             and northward into
                                                                                              ;

the Arctic Ocean.

    No evidence M^as discovered of any great elevation of this central area in

Glacial, or immediately pre-Glacial, times, and, in the absence of such evidence, it
would seem not improbable that the land then stood at about the same height
above the sea as it stands at present. In this case the moisture giving rise to

the immense precipitation of snow would have been derived from the adjacent
waters of Hudson Bay and the Arctic Ocean.

     The name Keewatin glacier has been applied to this central continental ice-

sheet. In general character it appears to have been somewhat similar to the great
glacier of North-Western Europe, with a centre lying near the sea-coast, a steep
and short slope seaward, and a very much longer and more gentle slope towards

the interior of the continent. But there was this difierence between the two, that
the centre of the latter was over a high rocky country, from which the ice naturally
flowed outwards towards the surrounding lower country; while the centre of
the former was over what is now, and was probably also then, a low-lying plain,
on which the snow accumulated to such depths as to cause it to flow over country

very considerably higher.

     After the Keewatin glacier had reached its full extent, it began gradually to

decrease in size. As it disappeared from the Northern States, and the North-West

Territories of Canada, it left a series of moraines, many of which can be readily
traced across the unwooded country, as ridges of rounded stony hiUs. "UTiile

retiring down gradually descending slopes, many temporary extra-Glacial lakes

were formed in front of it, and were drained one after another as it retired to still
lower country. Before it had withdrawn from the Winnipeg basin, it was joined
by an advancing glacier from the east, and in front of the two, Lake Agassiz, one
of the largest of the extra-Glacial lakes, was formed.

     In its final stages the general gathering-ground of the Keewatin glacier seems
to have moved still farther eastward, or nearer to the coast of Hudson Bay, and
to have broken into several separate centres, one of which lay over the country
south-east of Yath-kyed Lake, while another was probably located north of the
head of Chesterfield Inlet.

     After the retirement of the Keewatin glacier the land in the vicinity of
Hudson Bay stood from 600 to 600 feet below its present level, and gradually rose

to its present height.

           7. The Geological Horizons of some Nova Scotia Minerals.

                         By E. Gilpin, Jr., LL.D., F.R.S.C.

    The principal geological horizons of Nova Scotia are the typically developed
divisions of the Carboniferous, followed by interrupted representations of the
succeeding divisions down to measures referred by the Geological Survey to the

Laurentian.

     The Carboniferous aifords copper, coal, iron, manganese, bary tes, galena, gypsum,
grindstone and building stone. The Devonian and Silurian are noted for beds of
magnetite and hematite, principally in the Oriskany and Clinton horizons

respectively.

     The Cambro-Silurian (Longmynd) in one section contains extensive deposits of
auriferous quartz worked to some extent.

     The Laurentian exposed in Cape Breton has as yet received little attention
from a mineralogical point, but is known to contain gold, copper, iron ore, mica,

graphite, marble, &c.

The following Papers and Reports were read :

1. On the Possible Identity of Bennettites, Williamsonia, and Zamites gigas.
                  By A. C. Seward, M.A., F.G.S., Cambridge.

The author brings forward evidence in support of the organic connection

tetween Williamsonia and the Cycadean fronds known as Zamites gigas, L. and H.,

and in favour of the close relationship, if not identity, of Carruthers' genera

Bennettites and Williamsonia.

In the earliest descriptions of the Jurassic inflorescence known as Williamsonia

"Williamson and other authors regarded the genus as the fructification of the .plant

which bore the leaves known as Zamites gigas. In 1875 Saporta expressed himself

strongly against the generally accepted view as to the union of Williamsonia and

AZamites.  recent examination of a series of specimens in the Paris Natural

History Museum and elsewhere has convinced the author that Williamsonia and

Zamites gigas are parts of the same plant.

Evidence has been previously brought forward of the practical identity of

Williamsonia and Bennettites. More recently acquired information leads to the

conclusion that we are now familiar, not only with the nature of the Bennettitian

type of inflorescence, but also with the character of the fronds which were, in some

instances, associated with this Jurassic fructification.

In view of the facts before us, it is advisable that the generic name Williamsonia

should be substituted for the provisional and comprehensive term Zamites as the

more suitable generic name of Lindley and Button's species Zamites gigas.

2. Glacial Geology of Western Neiv York.^

  By Herman LeRoy Fairchild, B.Sc.

    The glacial and glacio-lacustrine phenomena of Western New York are

remarkable for range and variety as well as for their excellent and typical develop-
ment. The relation of the stratigraphy, topography and altitude of the area, with
the effects of static waters and the retreating ice sheet have produced various,
interesting features. The retreatal moraines lie in two systems, conforming to
the ice bodies in the Erie and the Ontario basins. Drumlins are displayed in
profusion and of great variety. They are mostly of elongated form, and support
the theory of their origin as constructional forms of the ground moraine. Eskers
are few, but of typical character, while kames are well developed, some of the
kame areas being of great extent and mass.

The pre-Laurentian glacial waters have left an interesting series of well-developed

shore lines. These belong to the stages known as Lake Warren and Lake L-oquois
Aand the .intermediate falling waters.
                                        differential post-glacial uplift of the

region has produced deformation of the shore lines. The remarkable series of

parallel valleys holding the several lakes known collectively as the ' Finger ' lakes

produced a lobina: of the retreating ice front, a localising of the moraines, and

other significant modifications of the several phenomena.
     The paper was especially intended to give the non-American glacialists a brief

--general view of the various phenomena of the interesting region. The topics,

briefly treated, are as follows : Physical features, ice invasion, glacial deposits,

glacio-aqueous deposits, glacial lakes, morainal lakes, channels of glacial drainage,

post-glacial stream erosion.

           4. Earth Strains and Structure. By O. H. HowARTH.

    If we consider the case of any small suspended body subjected to external forces
and maintained in its position and motion by the resultant of those forces as we
can observe them, it is safe to draw at least parallel conclusions in the case of the

earth as to similar efl'ects on an extended scale. It cannot follow that because, in

the case of a planetary body revolving in its orbit, we have to regard those forces

as enormously greater in degree, and their action as extended over enormously

greater periods of time, we must therefore attribute their results to a class of
mechanical principles of which we have no cognisance. And amongst the causes
whose operation we find recorded in the structure of our earth, there seems obvious

reason to assume that the main feature, and by far the most potent, is the constant
variation in the balance of external strains to which such a body is subjected. If,
as has been admitted by several authorities, these forces bear any part at all in the
operations of planet-moulding, surely it follows that it must be immeasurably the
greatest. That they operate often silently and in a manner only observable to us
by indirect means, is a necessary consequence of our limited powers of perception.

   --Yet it is surprising to note how large a number of visible effects seismic,
--volcanic and structural seem to be clearly accounted for if we apply on the

greater scale of creation those conceptions of dynamic action which we derive

from the smaller. It is because these vast developments of force are continually
balancing and counteracting each other, and hence create no general cataclysm,

that the continuity of their action may escape our observation. But if we realise

proportitmately the tremendous pressures and the no less tremendous relaxa-

tions of pressure under which this ceaseless ' kneading ' action proceeds, we must

see that the parallel results obtained in a small-scale experiment, however

inexact the imitation may be in detail, offer a comparison by no means so

imaginary as may be thought at first sight. Such forces, exerted under lilie

conditions upon the mass of the earth, ever struggling, as it were, for
supremacy, and meeting with all the varying resistances due to widely differing
qualities of material, are necessarily sources of an enormous generation of heat
wherever a readjustment of that material, even to the slightest extent, ensues.

If we conceive such a movement of compressed matter upon itself at a depth of,

say, two or three miles within the substance of the earth, a development of heat
must occur which, on the release of the strain, will result in the fusion of those

particles around large areas of disturbance.

    Amongst the many indications of such actions, instances can be quoted where
the maxima and minima of chronic volcanic eruption are demonstrably concurrent
with those of the tidal strain. In the same manner we can trace to this constant
variation of strains many of the more permanent evidences in geological structure,

--such as the formation of fissure veins and the lamination of igneous rocks

process wholly distinct from that of sedimentary strata deposited by the action of
fluctuating currents of water. The columnar structure of basaltic rocks caused

by a gradual release from compressive strain acting equally in all directions may

also be illustrated by a small scale experiment.

6. On the Structure and Origin of certain Rocks of the Laurentian System.
   By Frank D. Adams, Ph.D., F.R.S.C., McGill University, Montreal.

     The paper presents the results of recent and somewhat extended studies of
several areas of the Laurentian of Canada, and deals more particularly with the
origin of certain members of this system as indicated by their structure or com-
position. While it is impossible in the present state of our knowledge to arrive at
any definite conclusions concerning the origin of many, or perhaps even of the
majority, of the rocks composing the Laurentian, the origin of certain members of
the system can be determined. Some of these, although now possessing a more or
less distinct and even highly pronounced foliation or stratiform appearance, can be
proved to be igneous or intrusive rocks, while it can be shown that others are of

aqueous origin.

     To the former class belong the anorthosites and many of the orthoclase
gneisses. These rocks, although frequently distinctly foliated, can in many places-

be traced into perfectly massive varieties, and form great intrusions, interrupting-
and cutting off" the older members of the system. The foliation and stratiform
appearance which led the older geologists to class them as altered sediments is due-
to movements induced by pressure, and they show protoclastic or cataclastic
structure in great perfection.

     To the aqueous rocks, on the other hand, belong the crystalhne limestones and
certain gneisses usuaUy associated with them. These rocks not only differ in
structure from those above referred to, but have a chemical composition not
possessed by any igneous rock. The cataclastic structures are very subordinate,
and the rocks are characterised by a very extensive recrystallisation, accompanied
by the development of new minerals.

     It may therefore be said, without going beyond that which the facts warrant,,
that there are in the Laurentian at least two distinct sets of foliated rocks. One

of these, comprising the limestones, some quartzites, and certain garnetiferous or
sillimanite gneisses, represents, in all probability, highly altered and extremely
666 REPORT--1897.

andient sediments. The other set, intimately associated with these, is of igneous
origin, and comprises numerous and very extensive intrusions, both acid and basic
in character, -which were probably injected at widely separated times. Those
masses which were first intruded, and have been subjected to all the subsequent
squeezing and metamorphism, are now represented by well-defined and apparently
interstratified augen-gneisses and granulites ; others, intruded at later periods,
though showing the effects of pressure, retain more or less of their massive
character ; while still others, which have been injected since all movements ceased,
are recognised by all as undoubted igneous intrusions.

                            Section D.--ZOOLOGY.

        --Peesident of the Section Professor L. C. Miale, F.R.S.

                            THURSDAY, AUGUST 19.

     The President delivered the following Address :

It has long been my conviction that we study animals too much as dead things.

We name them, arrange them according to our notions of their likeness or

unlikeness, and record their distribution. Then perhaps we are satisfied, forgetting
that we could do as much with minerals or remarkable boulders. Of late years
we have attempted something more ; we now teach every student of Zoology to

dissect animals and to attend to their development. This is, I believe, a solid and

lasting improvement; we owe it largely to Huxley, though it is but a revival of
the method of Dollinger, who may be judged by the eminence of his pupils and
by the direct testimony of Baer to have been one of the very greatest of biological
teachers. But the animals set before the young zoologist are all dead ; it is much

if they are not pickled as well. When he studies their development, he works

chiefly or altogether upon continuous sections, embryos mounted in balsam, and

wax models. He is rarely encouraged to observe live tadpoles or third-day chicks
with beating liearts. As for what Gilbert White calls the life and conversation of
animals, how they defend themselves, feed, and make love, this is commonly passed

over as a matter of curious but not very important information ; it is not reputed
scientific, or at least not eminently scientific.

    Why do we study animals at all ? Some of us merely want to gain practical

skill before attempting to master the structure of the human body ; others hope to
qualify themselves to answer the questions of geologists and farmers ; a very few

wish to satisfy their natural curiosity about the creatures which they find in the
wood, the field, or the sea. But surely our chief reason for studying animals ought

to be that we would know more of life, of the modes of growth of individuals and

races, of the causes of decay and extinction, of the adaptation of living organisms to

their surroundings. Some of us even aspire to know in outline the course of life
upon the earth, and to learn, or, failing that, to conjecture, how life originated.
Our own life is the thing of all others which interests us most deeply, but every-
thing interests us which throws even a faint and reflected light upon human life.

Perhaps the professor of Zoology is prudent in keeping so close as he does to the
facts of structure, and in shunning the very attempt to interpret, but while he wins

safety he loses his hold upon our attention. Morphology is very well ; it may be
exact ; it may prevent or expose serious errors. But Morphology is not an end in

 itself. Like the systems of Zoology, or the records of distribution, it draws
whatever interest it possesses from that life which creates organs and adaptations.

To know more of life is an aim as nearly ultimate and self-explanatory as any
purpose that man can entertain.

      Can the study of life be made truly scientific ? Is it not too vast, too inacces-
sible to human faculties ? If we venture into this alluring field of inquiry, shall
668 REPORT--1897.

we gain results of permanent value, or shall we bring back nothing better than

unverified speculations and curious but unrelated facts ?

The scientific career of Charles Darwin is, I think, a sufficient answer to such

doubts. I do not lay it down as an article of the scientific faith that Darwin's
theories are to be taken as true ; we shall refute any or all of them as soon as we
know how ; but it is a great thing that he raised so many questions which were well
worth raising. He set all scientific minds fermenting, and not only Zoology and

Botany, but Palaeontology, History, and even Philology bear some mark of his

activity. Whether his main conclusions are in the end received, modified, or

rejected, the effect of his work cannot be undone. Darwin was a bit of a sports-
man and a good deal of a geologist ; he was a fair anatomist and a working

systematist ; he keenly appreciated the value of exact knowledge of distribution.

I hardly know of any aspect of natural history, except synonymy, of which he

spoke with contempt. But he chiefly studied animals and plants as living beings.

They were to him not so much objects to be stuck through with pins, or pickled,

Heor dried, or labelled, as things to be watched in action.  studied their diffi-

culties, and recorded their little triumphs of adaptation with an admiring smile.

"We owe as many discoveries to his sympathy with living nature as to his exact-

ness or his candour, though these too were illustrious. It is not good to idolise

even our greatest men, but we should try to profit by their example. I think that

a young student, anxious to be useful but doubtful of his powers, may feel sure

that he is not wasting his time if he is collecting or verifying facts which would

have helped Darwin.

Zoologists may justify their favourite studies on the ground that to know the

structure and activities of a variety of animals enlarges our sense of the possi-

bilities of life. Surely it must be good for the student of Human Physiology, to

take one specialist as an example of the rest, that he should know of many ways in

which the same functions can be discharged Let him learn that there are animals

(star-fishes) whose nervous system lies on the outside of the body, and that in

other animals it is generally to be found there during some stage of development

that there are animals whose circulation reverses its direction at frequent intervals

either throughout life (Tunicata) or at a particular crisis (insects at the time of

pupation) ; that there are animals with eyes on the back (Oncidiura, Scorpion),

on the shell (some Chitonidse), on limbs or limb-like appendages, in the brain-

cavity, or on the edge of a protective fold of skin ; that there are not only eyes of

many kinds with lenses, but eyes on the principle of the pin-hole camera without

lens at all (Nautilus) and of every lower grade down to mere pigment-spots ; that
auditory organs may be borne upon the legs (insects) or the tail (Mysis) ; that
they may be deeply sunk in the body, and yet have no inlet for the vibrations of

the sonorous medium (many aquatic animals). It is well that he should know of

animals with two tails (Oercaria of Gasterostomum) or with two bodies per-

manently united (Diplozoon) ; of animals developed within a larva which lives for

a considerable time after the adult has detached itself (some star-fishes and

Nemertines) ; of animals which lay two (Daphnia) or three kinds of eggs (Rotifera)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

of eggs which regularly produce two (Lumbricus trapezoides) or even eight

embryos apiece (Praopus') ; of males which live parasitically upon the female

(Cirripedes), or even undergo their transformations, as many as eighteen at a time

in her gullet (Bonellia) ; of male animals which are mere bags of sperm-cells (some

Rotifera, some Ixodes, parasitic Copepods) and of female animals which are mere

bags of eggs (Sacculina, Entoconcha). The more the naturalist knows of such

strange deviations from the familiar course of things, the better will he be prepared

to reason about what he sees, and the safer will he be against the perversions of

hasty conjecture.

If a wide knowledge of animals is a gain to Physiology and every other

branch of Biology, what opportunities are lost by our ignorance of the early stages

of so many animals ! They are often as unlike to the adult in structure and

function as if tliey belonged to different genera, or even to different families.

Zoologists have made the wildest mistakes in classifying larvre whose subsequent
history was at the time unknown. The naturalist who devotes himself to life-

Ahistories shares the advantage of the naturalist who explores a new continent.

wealth of new forms is opened out before him. Though Swammerdam, Reaumur,
De Geer, Vaughan Thompson, Johannes Miiller and a crowd of less famous
naturalists have gone before us, so much remains to be done that no zealous

inquirer can fail to discover plenty of untouched subjects in any wood, thicket,

brook or sea.

    Whoever may attempt this kind of work will find many difficulties and many
aids. He will of course find abundant exercise for all the anatomy and physiology
that he can command. He will need the systems of descriptive Zoology, and will
often be glad of the help of professed systematists. The work cannot be well
done until it is exactly known what animal is being studied. For want of this
knowledge, hardly attainable 150 years ago, Edaumur sometimes tells us curious
things which we can neither verify nor 'correct ; at times we really do not know
what animal he had before him. The student of life-histories will find a use for

physics and chemistry, if he is so lucky as to remember any. Skill in drawing is

valuable, perhaps indispensable.

     If by chance I should be addressing any young naturalist who thinks of attend-
in"' to life-histories, I would beg him to study his animals alive and under natural
conditions. To pop everything into alcohol and make out the names at home is

the method of the collector, but life-histories are not studied in this way. It is

often indispensable to isolate an animal, and lor this purpose a very small habita-

tion is sometimes to be preferred. The tea-cup aquarium, for instance, is often better
than the tank. But we must also watch an animal's behaviour under altogether
natural circumstances, and this is one among many reasons for choosing our subject
from the animals which are locally common. Let us be slow to enter into con-
 troversies. After they have been hotly pursued for some time, it generally turns

out that the disputants have been using words in different senses. Discussion is
 excellent, controversy usually barren. Yet not always ; the Darwinian controversy
 was heated, and nevertheless eminently productive ; all turns upon the temper of

the men concerned, and the solidity of the question at issue. One more hint to
young students. Perhaps no one ever carried through a serious bit of work without
in some stage or other longing to drop it. There comes a time when the first
 impulse is spent, and difficulties appear which escaped notice at first. Then most
 men lose hope. That is the time to show that we are a little better than most
men. I remember as a young man drawing much comfort from the advice of a

 colleague, now an eminent chemist, to whom I had explained my difficulties and

 fears. All that he said was : ' Keep at it,' and I found that nothing more was

 wanted.

     I greatly believe in the value of association. It is good that two men should

 look at every doubtful structure and criticise every interpretation. It is often

 good that two talents should enter into partnership, such as a talent for description
 and a talent for drawing. It is often good that an experienced investigator should
 choose the subject and direct the course of work, and that he should be helped by

 a junior, who can work, but cannot guide. It seems to me that friendly criticism
 before publication is often a means of preventing avoidable mistakes. I am sorry

 that there should be any kind of prejudice against co-operation, or that it should

 be taken to be a sign of weakness. There are, I believe, very few men who are
 so strong as not to be the better for help. One difficulty would be removed if

 known authors were more generous in .acknowledging the help of their assistants.
 They ought not to be slow to admit a real helper to such honour as there may be

 in joint-authorship.

     Among the most important helps to the student of life-histories must be
 mentioned the zoological stations now maintained by most of the great nations.

 The parent of all these, the great zoological station at Naples, celebrated its
 twenty-fifth anniversary last April, so that the whole movement belongs to our

 own generation. How would Spallanzani and Vaughan Thompson and Johannes
--670 REPORT 1897.

Miiller have rejoiced to see such facilities for the close investigation of the animal

life of the sea ! The English-speaking nations have taken their fair share of the
splendid work done at Naples, and it is pleasant to remember that Darwin sub-

scribed to the first fund, while the British Association, the University of Cambridge

and the Smithsonian Institution have maintained their own tables at the station.
The material support thus given is small when compared with the subsidies of the
German Government, and not worth mention beside the heroic sacrifices of the

Director, Dr. Anton Dohrn, but as proofs of lively interest in a purely scientific
enterprise they have their value. Marine stations have now multiplied to such a
point that a bare enumeration of them would be tedious. Fresh-water biological

stations are also growing in number. Forel set an excellent example by his in-
vestigation of the physical and biological phenomena of the Lake of Geneva. Dr.
Anton Fritsch of Prag followed with his movable station. There is a well-
equipped station at Plon among the lakes of Holstein, and a small one on the

Miiggelsee near Berlin. The active station of Illinois is known to me only by the

excellent publications which it has begun to issue. France, Switzerland, Sweden

and Finland all have their fresh-water biological stations, and I hope that England

will not long remain indifierent to so promising a sphere of investigation.

    Biological work may answer many useful purposes. It may be helpful to in-

dustry and public health. Of late years the entomologist has risen into sudden

importance Dy the vigorous steps taken to discourage injurious insects. I have

even known a zoological expert summoned before a court of law in order to say
whether or not a sword-fish can sink a ship. I would not on any account run

down the practical applications of Biology, but I believe that the first duty of the

biologist is to make science, and that science is made by putting and answering

Wequestions.  are too easily drawn off" from this, which is our main business, by

self-imposed occupations, of which we can often say nothing better than that they

do no harm except to the man who undertakes them. There are, for example, a

wood many lists of species which are compiled without any clear scientific object.

We have a better prospect of working to good purpose when we try to answer

definite questions. I propose to spend what time remains in putting and answering

as well as I can a few of the questions which occur to any naturalist who occupies

--himself with life-histories. Even a partial answer even a mistaken answer is

better than the blank indifference of the collector, who records and records, but

never thinks about his facts.                         do some animals undergo

  -- WhyThe first question that I will put is this :

transformation while others do not ? It has long been noticed - that as a rule

fresh-water and terrestrial animals do not go through transformation, while their

marine allies do. Let us take half-a-dozen examples of each :

         Fluviatile or terrestrial.                       Marine.
        Without transformation.               With transfonnation.
Crayfish.                            Crab.
                                     Polygordius.
Earthworm.                           Doris, ^olis.
                                     Oyster.
Helix.                               Most Hydrozoa.
Cyclas.                              &c.

Hydra.

&c.

We get a glimmer of light upon this characteristic difference when we remark

that in fresh-water and terrestrial species the eggs are often larger than in the
Aallied marine forms.
                       large egg favours embryonic as opposed to larval develop-

ment. An embryo which is formed within a large Qg^ may feed long upon the

food laid up for it, and continue its development to a late stage before hatching.

But if there is little or no yolk in the egg, the embryo will turn out early to shift

for itself. It will be born as a larva, provided with provisional organs suited to

its small size and weakness. Large eggs are naturally fewer than small ones.

' To this list may now be added the University of Oxford.

Does the size depend on the number, or the number on the size ? To answer in

a word, I believe that the size generally depends on the number, and that the

number is mainly determined by the risks to which the species are exposed. At

least so many eggs will in general be produced as can maintain the numbers of

the species in spite of losses, and there is some reason to believe that in fresh waters

the risks are less than in the shallow seas or at the surface of the ocean. ^ In most

parts of the world the fresh waters are of small size, and much cut up. Every

river-basin forms a separate territory. Isolation, like every other kind of artificial

restriction, discourages competition, and impedes the spread of successful competi-

tors. In the shallow seas or at the surface of the ocean conquering forms have a

free course ; iu lakes and rivers they are soon checked by physical barriers.

   A large proportion of animals are armour-clad, and move about with some

difficulty when they have attained their full size. The dispersal of the species is

therefore in these cases efiected by small and active larvae. Marine animals (whether

littoral or pelagic) commonly produce vast numbers of locomotive larvae, which

Aeasily travel to a distance. Floating is easy, and swimming not very difficult.

very slightly built and immature larva can move about by cilia, or take advantage
of currents, and a numerous brood may be dispersed far and wide while they are

mere hollow sacs, without mouth, nerves or sense-organs. Afterwards they wiE

settle down, and begin to feed. In fresh waters armour is as common, for all that

I know, as in the sea, but locomotive larvae are rare." There is no space for eflec-

tive migration. Even a heavy-armoured and slow-moving crustacean or pond-

snail can cross a river or lake, and to save days or hours is unimportant. In rivers,

as Sollas has pointed out, free-swimming larvae would be subject to a special risk,

that of being swept out to sea. This circumstance may have been influential, but

the diminished motive for migration is probably more important. At least an

occasional transport to a new area is indispensable to most freshwater organisms,

and very unexpected modes of dispersal are sometimes employed, not regularly in

each generation, but at long intervals, as opportunity ofiers.

Early migration by land is nearly always out of the question. Walking, and

still more flying, are difficult exercises, which call for muscles of complex arrange-

Ament and a hard skeleton.                           very small animal, turned out to shift for itself on

land, would in most cases perish without a struggle. There might be just a

chance for it, if it could resist superficial drying, and were small enough to be

blown about by the wind (Infusoria, Rotifera, and certain minute Crustacea), or

if it were born in a wet pasture, like some parasitic worms.

   We can define two policies between which a species can make its choice. It

may produce a vast number of eggs, which will then be pretty sure to be small

and ill-furnished with yolk. The young will hatch out early, long before their

development is complete, and must migrate at once in search of food. They will,

especially if the adult is slow-moving or sedentary, be furnished with simple and

temporary organs of locomotion, and will generally be utterly unlike the parent.
The majority will perish early, but one here and there will survive to carry on

the race.

Or the parent may produce a few eggs at a time, stock them well with yolk,

     ' Indications are given by the survival in fresh waters of declining groups, e.g..
Ganoid Fishes, which, when dominant, maintained themselves in the sea ; and by the

not uncommon case of marine animals which enter rivers to spawn. I do not at-
tempt to count among these indications the supposed geological antiquity of fluvia-

tile as compared with marine animals. Some marine genera are extremely ancient

(Lingula, Nucula, Trigonia, Nautilus) ; a perfectly fair comparison is almost impos-

sible                         and great persistence  does  not necessarily imply freedom  from risks.  In the
                           ;

Mollusca, which afford a good opportunity of testing the effect of habitat upon the
number of the eggs, marine species seem to produce more eggs as a rule than fluvia-

tile, and these many more than terrestrial species.

- Dreyssensia and Cordylophora are examples of animals which seem to have

quite recently become adapted to fresh-water life, and have not yet lost their loco-

motive larvae. Many instances could be quoted of marine forms which have become

fluviatile. The converse is, I believe, comparatively rare.

and pei-liaps watch over tliem, or even hatch thero within her own hody. The
young will in such cases complete their development as embryos, and when

hatched, will resemhle the parent in everything but size.

    Which policy is adopted will largely depend upon the number of the family
and the capital at command. There are animals which are like well-to-do people,
who provide their children with food, clothes, schooling, and pocket-money.
Their fortunate offspring grow at ease, and are not driven to premature exercise of

their limbs or wits. Others are like starving families, which send the children,

long before their growth is completed, to hawk matches or newspapers in the

streets.

    In Biology we have no sooner laid down a principle than we begin to think of

exceptions. The exceptions may be apparent only ; they may, when fully under-

stood, confirm instead of disturbing the general principle. But this rarely

happens unless the principle is a sound one.  Exwptio  probat  regzdam                                    it  is  the

exception which tests the rule, to give a new application to an old maxim.

Parasites form one group of exceptions to our rule. Whether they pass their

free stages in air, water or earth, whether their hosts are marine, fluviatile or

terrestrial, they are subject to strange transformations, which may be repeated

several times in the same life-history. The change from one host to another is

often a crisis of difficulty ; many fail to accomplish it ; those which succeed do so
iDy means of some highly peculiar organ or instinct, which may be dropped as

quickly as it is assumed. The chances of failure often preponderate to such an

extent that an enormous number of eggs must be liberated. Even a brief para-

sitism may produce a visible effect upon the life-history. The young Unio or

Anodon attaches itself for a short time to some fish or tadpole. To this temporary

parasitism is due, as I suppose, the great number of eggs produced, and a degree of

metamorphosis, unusual in a fresh-water moUusk.

The Cephalopoda, which are wholly marine, and the Vertebrates, whatever

their habitat, very rarely exhibit anything which can be called transformation.

Some few cases of Vertebrate transformation will be discussed later. Cephalopods

and Vertebrates are large, strong, quick-witted animals, able to move fast, and

quite equal in many cases to the defence of themselves and their families. They
often produce few young at a time, and take care of them (there are many

examples to the contrary among Cephalopods and Fishes). They are generally

able to dispense with armour, which would have indirectly I'avoured trans-

formation.

     Echinoderms, which are all marine, develop with metamorphosis. There is
an interesting exception in the Echinoderms with marsupial development, which

develop directly, and give an excellent ilhistration of the efi'ect of parental care.
     Insects, which as terrestrial animals should lay a few large eggs, and develop

directly, furnish the most familiar and striking of all transformations. I have
already discussed this case at greater length than is possible just now.* I have

pointed out that the less specialised insect-larvfe, e.g. those of Orthoptera, make a
close approach to some wingless adult insects, such as the Thysanura, as well as
to certain Myriopods. Fritz Miiller seems to me to be right in saying that the
larvae of non-metamorphic insects come nearer than any winged insect to primi-
tive Tracheates. The transformation of the Bee, Moth, or Blow-fly is transacted

after the stage in which the normal Tracheate structure is attained, and I look

upon it as a peculiar adzdt transformation, having little in common with the

transformations of Echinoderms, Mollusks, or Crustaceans.

     In the same way I believe that some Amphibia have acquired an adrilt trans-

formation. Frogs and toads, having already as tadpoles attained the full develop-
ment of the more primitive Amphibia, change to lung-breathing, tailless,
land-traversing animals, able to wander from the place of their birth, to seek
out mates from other families, and to lay eggs in new sites.

     IMedusre furnish a third example of adult transformation, which seems to find
its explanation in the sedentary habit of the polyp, which probably nearly
approaches the primitive adult stage. But here the case is further complicated,

for the polyp still proceeds from a planula, ·whicli is eminently adapted for loco-
Wemotion, though perhaps withm a narrower range.
                                                  have two migratory stages

in the life-history. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The planula,

from its small size, is less liable to be devoured, or stranded, or dashed to pieces,

but it cannot travel far ; the medusa may cross wide seas, but it is easily captured

and is often cast up upon a beach in countless multitudes.

Adult transformation may be recognised by its occurrence after the normal

structure of the group has been acquired, and also by its special motive, which is

egg-laying and all that pertains to it ; the special motive of larval transformation

is dispersal for food.

    The reproduction of the common Eel has been a mystery ever since the days of
Aristotle, though a small part of the story was made out even in ancient times.
It was long ago ascertained that the Eel, which seeks its food in rivers, descends
to the sea in autumn or early winter, and that it never spawns, nor even becomes
mature in fresh waters. The Eels which descend to the sea never return, but
young eels or Elvers come up from the sea in spring, millions at a time. The

Elvers have been seen to travel along the bank of a river in a continuous band or

eel-rope, which has been known to glide upwards for fifteen days together. It

was of course concluded that spawning and early development took place in the

sea during the interval between the autumn and spring migration, but no certain

information came to hand till 1896. Meanwhile this gap in our knowledge was a

perplexity, almost a reproach to zoologists. The partially-known migration of the
WeEel could not be harmonised with the ordinary rule of migratory fishes.
                                                                           tried

to explain the passage of marine fishes into rivers at spawning time by the supposi-
tion (a true supposition, as I think) that the river is less crowded than the
shallow seas, and therefore a region in which competition is less severe. The river

is to some migratory fishes what the tundras of Siberia are to some migratory bird.i,

places comparatively free from dangerous enemies, and therefore fit for the rearing &f

the helpless young. But the Eel broke the rule, and cast doubt upon the explanation.

The Salmon, Sturgeon and Lamprey feed and grow in the sea, and enter rivers to

spawn. The Eel feeds and grows in rivers, but enters the sea to spawn. What

possible explanation could meet cases thus diametrically opposite ?

This was the state of matters when Grassi undertook to tell us that part of the

Whenhistory of the Eel which is transacted in the sea.      it leaves the river, it

makes its way to very deep water, and there undergoes a change. The eyes

enlarge, and become circular instead of elliptical ; the pectoral fins and the border

of the gill-cover turn black ; the reproductive organs, only to be discovered by

microscopic search before this time, enlarge. The Eels, thus altered in appearance

and structure, lay their eggs in water of not less than 250 fathoms' depth. The

upper limit of the spawning-ground is nearly three times as far from sea-level as

the 100-fathom line which we arbitrarily quote as the point at which the deep sea
begins. The eggs, which are large for a fish (2'7 mm. diam.), float but do not

rise.  The young which issue from them are quite unlike the Eels of our rivers
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

they are tape-like, transparent, colourless, devoid of red blood and armed with

Apeculiar teeth.  number of difi'erent kinds of such fishes had been previously

known to the naturalist as Leptocephali. Giinther had conjectured that they were

abnormal larvie, incapable of further development. Grassi has, however, suc-

ceeded in proving that one of these Leptocephali (L. brevirostris) is simply a

larval Eel ; others are larvae of Congers and various Mursenoid fishes. He has

with infinite pains compared a number of Leptocephali, and co-ordinated their

stages, making out some particularly important ones by the direct observation of

live specimens.

    You will not unnaturally ask how Grassi or anybody else can tell what goes

on in the sea at a depth of over 250 fathoms. His inquiries were carried on at

Messina, where the local circumstances are very fortunate. Strong currents now

and then boil up in the narrow strait, sweeping to the surface eggs, larvae, and a

multitude of other objects which at ordinary seasons lie undisturbed in the tran-
quil depths. Further information has been got by dredging, and also by opening

the body of a sun-fish (Orthagoriscus mola), which at certain times of the year is

       1897.                                                         XX

taken at the surface, and is always found to contain a numter of Leptocepliali.

When a Leptocephalus has completed its first stage of growth, it ceases to feed,

loses bulk, and develops pigment on the surface of the body. At the same time

the larval teeth are cast, and the larval skeleton is replaced. Then the fish begins

to feed again, comes to the surface, enters the mouth of a river, and, if caught, is
immediately recognised as an Elver or yoimg Eel. It is now a year old, and about

two inches long.
     This history suggests a question. Are the depths of the sea free from severe

competition ? The darkness, which must be nearly or altogether complete,
Aexcludes more than the bare possibility of vegetation.
                                                         scanty subsistence for

animals is provided by the slowly decomposing remains of surface-life. When the

dredge is sunk so low, which does not often happen, it may bring up now and

then a peculiar and specially modified inhabitant of the dark and silent abyss.

There cannot, we should think, be more than the feeblest competition where living

things are so few, and the mode of life so restricted. Going a step further, we

might predict that deep-sea animals would lay few eggs at a time, and that these

would develop directly i.e. without transformation. The risk of general reason-

ing about the afi'airs of living things is so great that we shall hold our conjectures

cheap unless they are confirmed by positive evidence. Happily this can be sup-
plied. The voyage of the ' Challenger ' has yielded proof that the number of

species diminishes with increasing depth, and that below .300 fathoms living things

are few indeed.^ Dr. John Murray gives us the result of careful elaboration of all
the facts now accessible, and tells us that the majority of the abyssal species

develop directly .-

   We seem therefore to have some ground for believing that the depths of the

sea resemble the fresh waters in being comparatively free from enemies dangerous
to larvse. The Eel finds a safe nursery in the depths, and visits them for the same

reason that leads some other fishes to enter rivers. It may be that the depths of

the sea are safer than rivers, in something like the same degree and for the same

reasons that rivers are safer than shallow seas. But we must be careful not to go

--too fast. It may turn out that deep recesses in the shallower seas holes of
--limited extent in the sea-bottom enjoy an immunity from dangerous enemies not

ehared by the great and continuous ocean-floor.^

After this short review of the facts I come to the conclusion that the general

rule which connects the presence or absence of transformation with habitat is well-

founded, but that it is apt to be modified and even reversed by highly special

circumstances. The efiect of habitat may for instance be overruled by parasitism,

parental care, a high degree of organisation, or even by a particular trick in egg-
laying. The direct action of the medium is probably of little consequence. Thus

the difference between fresh and salt water is chiefly important because it prevents

most species from passing suddenly from one to the other. But the abyssal and

the flu\'iatile faunas have much in common, as also have the littoral and the

pelagic faunas. Relative density and continuity of population seem to be of vital

importance, and it is chiefly these that act upon the life-history.

In Zoology, as in History, Biography, and many other studies, the most inter-

esting part of the work is only to be enjoyed by those who look into the details.

To learn merely from text -books is notoriously dull. The text-book has its uses,

but, like other digests and abridgments, it can never inspire enthusiasm. It is

the same with most lectures. Suppose that the subject is that well-worn topic,

the Alternation of Generations. The name recalls to many of us some class-room
of our youth, the Cfudely coloured pictures of unlikely animals which hung on
the walls, and the dispirited class, trying to write down from the lecture the irre-
ducible minimum which passes a candidate. The lecturer defines his terms and

narrative, which gives no fact with its natural circumstances, but mashes the

whole into pemmican ? What student goes away with the thought that it would be

good and pleasant to add to the heap of known facts ? The heap seems needlessly
big already. And yet every item in that dull mass was once deeply interesting,
moving all naturalists and many who were not naturalists to wonder and delight.
The Alternation of Generations worked upon men's minds in its day like Swam-

merdam's discovery of the butterfly within the caterpillar, or Trembley's discovery

of the budding Hydra, which when cut in two made two new animals, or Bonnet's

discovery that an Aphis could bring forth living young without having ever met

another individual of its ov/n species. All these wonders of nature have now
been condensed into glue. But we can at any time rouse in the minds of our
students some little of the old interest, if we will only tell the tale as it was told

for the first time.

    Adalbert Chamisso, who was in his time court-page, soldier, painter, traveller,

poet, novelist, and botanist, was the son of a French nobleman. When he was

nine years old, he and all the rest of the family were driven out of France by the

French Revolution. Chamisso was educated anyhow, and tried many occupations
before he settled down to Botany and light literature. In 1815 he embarked with
Eschscholtz on the Russian voyage round the world commanded by Kotzebue.

The two naturalists (for Chamisso is careful to associate Eschscholtz with himself,

and even to give him priority) discovered a highly curious fact concerning the
Salpse, gelatinous Tunicates which swim at the surface of the sea, sometimes in
countless numbers. There are two forms in the same species, which diifer in

anatomical structure, but especially in this, that one is solitary, the other compo-

site, consisting of many animals united into a chain which may be yards long.

Chamisso and Eschscholtz ascertained that the solitary form produces the chain-
form by internal budding, while the chain-form is made up of hermaphrodite animals

which reproduce by fertilised eggs.* There is thus, to use Chamisso's own words,

* an alternation of generations. ... It is as if a caterpillar brought forth a

butterfly, and then the butterfly a caterpillar.' Here the phrase bring forth is
applied to two very difi'erent processes, viz. sexual reproduction and budding.

Chamisso's phrase, ' alternation of generations,' is not exact. Huxley would sub-

stitute alternation of generation with geimnation, and if for shortness we use the
old term, it must be with this new meaning. Subsequent investigation, besides
adding many anatomical details, has confirmed one interesting particular in

Chamisso's account, viz. that the embryo of Salpa is nourished by a vascular
placenta.- The same voyage yielded also the discovery of Appendicularia, a

)ermanent Tunicate tadpole, and the first tadpole found in any Tunicate.
    Some ten years after the publication of Chamisso's alternation of generations

:n Salpa, a second example was found in a common jelly-fish (Aurelia). Not
a few Hydrozoa had by this time been named, and shortly characterised.
Some were polyps, resembling the Hydra of our ponds, but usually united into

permanent colonies ; others were medusfe, bell-shaped animals which swim free in

 lie upper waters of the sea. It was already suspected that both polyps and
iiedusaa had a common structural plan, and more than one naturalist had come

 ery near to knowing that medusae may be the sexual individuals of polyp-

·olonies.

    This was the state of matters when an undergratuate in Theology of the
'University of Christiania, named Michael Sars, discovered and described two new
 'ilyps, to which he gave the names, now familiar to every zoologist, of Scyphis-

 ima and Strobila. In the following year (1830) Sars settled at Kinn, near

    ' Brooks maintains that the solitary Salpa, which is female, produces a chain of
nales by budding, and lays an egg in each. These eggs are fertilised while the
·hain is still immature, and develop into females (solitary Salpaj). The truth of
liis account must be determined by specialists.

Bergen, as parish priest, and betook himself to the lifelong study of the animals of

the Norwegian seas. He soon found out that his Scyphistoma was merely an

earlier stage of his Strobila. Scyphistoma has a Hydra-like body, less than half

an inch long, and drawn out into a great number of immensely long tentacles.
It buds laterally like a Hydra, sending out stolons or runners, which bear new-
polyps, and separate before long, the polyps becoming independent animals. In
the midst of the tentacles of the scyphistoma is a prominence which bears the
mouth. This grows upwards into a tall column, the strobila, which is supported

below by the scyphistoma. When the strobila is well nourished it divides into

transverse slices, which at length detach themselves, and swim away.' These are

the Ephyrae, which had been found in the sea before Sars' time, and were then

counted as a particular kind of adult medusae. They are small, flat discs with
Aeight lobes or arms, all notched at the extremity.
                                                     pile of ephyrae is produced

mby the transverse constriction and division of the strobila  a fashion which

reminds us of the rapid production of the animals in a Noah's ark by the slicing

of a piece of wood of suitable sectional figure. It was thus ascertained that the

scyphistoma, strobila, and ephyra are successive stages of one animal, but for a

time no one could say where the scyphistoma came from, nor what the ephyra
turned to. At length Sars, aided by the anatomical researches of Ehrenberg and

Siebold, was able to clear up the whole story. The ephyra is gradually converted!
by increase of size and change of form into an Aurelia, a common jelly-fish which
swarms during the summer in European seas. The Aurelia is of two sexes, and

the eggs of the female give rise to ciliated embryos, which had been seen before
Sars' time, but wrongly interpreted as parasites or diminutive males. These
ciliated embryos, called planulae, swim about for a time, and then settle down a»

polyps (scyphistomata). There is thus a stage in which Aurelia divides without

any true reproductive process, and another stage in which it produces fertile eggsi.
There is alternation of generations in Aurelia as well as in Salpa, and Sars was

glad to fortify by a fresh example the observations of Chamisso, on which doubts

had been cast.
     It was not long before the alternation of generations was recognised in Hydro-

medusae also, and then the ordinary Hydrozoan colony was seen to consist of at
least two kinds of polyps, one sexual, the other merely nutrient, both being formed
by the budding of a single polyp. The sexual polyp, or medusa, either swims awaj
or remains attached to the colony, producing at length fertilised eggs, which yield
planulae, and these in turn the polyps which found new colonies.

Those of us who are called upon to tell this story in our regular course of

teaching should not forget to produce our scyphistoma, strobila and ephyra; the

interest is gi-eatly enhanced if they are shown alive. It is not hard to maintain a
flourishing marine aquarium even in an inland town, and a scyphistoma may be

kept alive in an aquarium for years, budding out its strobila every spring.
     Alternation of generations, when first announced, was taken to be a thing

mysterious and unique. Chamisso brought in the name, and explained that he
meant by it a metamorphosis accomplished by successive generations, the form of

the animal changing not in the course of an individual life, but from generation to
generation (fonna per generationes, neqiutquam in prole seu indwiduo, midata).

Sars adopted Gbamisso's name and definition. Steenstrup a little later collected
and discussed all the examples which he could discover, throwing in a number

which have had to be removed again, as not fairly comparable with the life-

histories of Salpa and Aurelia. He emphasised the alternation of budding with

egg-production, and the unlikeness in form of the asexual and sexual stages Like

Chamisso, he carefully distingiushed between development with metamorphosis

tend to divide transversely or to bud axially, while broad animals tend to divide
longitudinally or to bud laterally. The question has been raised more than once
whether the division of the strobila is not really a case of budding. Leuckart shows

that budding and fission cannot be separated by any deOnition ; they pass insensibly

into one another. ( Waffner's Handh. d. Physiol., art. ' Zeugung.')

and alternation of generations. All three naturalists, Chamisso, Sars and Steen-

strup, laid stress on this point. In an insect, they would have said, there is de-
velopment with metamorphosis. The same animal passes from larva to pupa, and
from pupa to imago. In Aurelia or Salpa, however, the animal which lays eggs

is not the animal which buds, but its progeny. The cycle of the life-history

includes two generations and many individuals.

This view has spread very widely, and if we were to judge by what is com-

monly taught, 1 think that we should recognise this as the doctrine now prevalent.

myIt is however, in  opinion, far inferior as an explanation of the facts to that

adopted by Leuckart, Carpenter and Huxley, who regard the whole cycle, from

egg to egg, as one life-history. Huxley and Carpenter, differing in this from

Leuckart, do not shrink from calling the whole product of the egg an animal,

ven though it consists of a multitude of creatures which move about and seek

their food in complete independence of one another. Rather than ignore the unity

of the life-history of Aurelia or Salpa, they would adopt the most paradoxical
language. This attitude was forced upon them by the comparative method. They

I'efused to study Aurelia, for example, as an animal apart ; it had its near and its

remoter relatives. Among these is the fresh-water Hydra, which develops with-

out transformation, buds off other Hydras when food is plentiful, and at length

becomes sexually mature. Budding is here a mere episode, which may be brought

in or left out, according to circumstances. The same individual polyp which buds

iifterwards produces eggs. The life-history of Salpa cannot be traced with equal

facility to a simple beginning, for it presents points of difficulty, on which the

learned differ. In the Polychtet Worms, however, we find a beautiful gradation

Weleading up to alternation of generations.  begin with gradual addition of new

segments and increasing specialisation of the two ends of the body, the fore end

becoming non-reproductive, and the hinder end reproductive. Then we reach a

stage (Syllis) in which the reproductive half breaks off from the fore part, and

forms (after separation) a new head, while the fore part adds new segments behind.
In Autolytus the new head forms before separation, and many worms may cohere

for a time, forming a long chain with heads at intervals. In Myrianida the worms

Webreak up first, and afterwards become sexually mature.  should gather from

these cases that alternation of generations may arise by the introduction of a
budding-stage into a development with transformation. The polyp or worm buds

while young and lays eggs at a later time. The separation of the two processes of

reproduction often becomes complete, each being restricted to its own place in the

life-history. As a rule the worm or polyp will bud while its structure is uncom-

plicated by reproductive organs. It is easy to propagate some plants by cutting

one of the leaves into sections, and making every section root itself, and grow into

a new plant ; but we can seldom do the same thing with a flower. There may

therefore be a distinct advantage to particular animals and plants in dividing the

life-history into two stages, an earlier budding, and a later egg-laying stage.

     The advantage to be drawn from budding is easily seen in those animals which
find it hard to gain access to a favourable site. Thus a Taenia ^ is very lucky when

it establishes itself in the intestine. Once there, it goes on budding indefinitely.

It is harder to trace the advantage in the case of many polyps, though some

(Cunina, &c.) admit of the same explanation as Taenia. There are yet other cases

(some Worms, Salpse, &c.) in which our ignorance of the conditions of life renders

a satisfactory explanation impossible at present.

The budded forms often differ in structure from the budding forms which

produce them, and many writers and teachers make this difference part of tho

·definition of alternation of generations. I think that Leuckart has suggested a

probable explanation in his essay of 1851,* which is still thoroughly profitable

reading. He attributes the peculiarities of the larva mainly to tlie circumstance

that it is turned out at an early age to shift for itself. In the budded forms there

is no such necessity. The parent has established itself on a good site which com-

mands a sufficiency of food. Until it has done this, it does not bud at all.

distant town. The budded forms, reared at the cost of the parent, may therefore

omit the early larval stages at least, and go on at once to a later or even to the

final stage. Thus the head of Taenia, when it has fixed itself in the intestine, pro-

duces sexual segments ; the redia of Distomum produces cercariaj or more redise,

omitting the locomotive embrj'o ; the scyphistoma produces ephyrte. The saving

of time must often be great, and the days saved are days of harvest. Think how

much a tree would lose if in the height of summer it were unable to bud, and

could only propagate by seeds. If the budded forms are sexual, while the budding-

forms are not, there is an obvious explanation of the difterence in form. Even

where there is no such fundamental difterence in function, the circumstances of

early life are very different, and may well produce an unhkeness upon which
Natural Selection may found a division of labour.

    No one who tries to trace origins can rest satisfied with Steenstrup's account
of alternation of generations. He makes no effort to show how it came about.

Instead of considering alternation of generations as a peculiar case of development

with metamorphosis, complicated by asexual reproduction, ^ he considers asexual

reproduction as a peculiar case of alternation of generations.- He ignores all the

facts which show that the alternation may have been gradually attained, an

omission which is only excusable when we note that his treatise is dated 1842.

He asserts dogmatically that there is no transition from metamorphosis to alterna-

tion of generations.

    It is impossible to think much on this subject without falling into diflSculties

over the word generation. For my own part I believe that such words as genera-

tion, individiml, organ, larva, adult cannot be used quite consistently in dealing"

with a long series of animals whose life-histories vary gradually and without end.

Ordinary language, which was devised to meet the familiar and comparatively

simple course of development of man and the domestic animals, is not always-

appropriate to lower forms, with complex and unusual histories. If we are
resolved at all hazards to make our language precise and uniform, we either fall

into contradictions, or else use words in unnatural senses.

Certain recent discussions render it necessary to point out that there can be no

alternation of generations without increase by budding. If a single larva produces

a single sexual animal, as when a pluteus changes to an Echinus, there is develop-

ment with transformation, but not alternation of generations.

     It is, I think, of importance to be able to resolve so peculiar a phenomenon as
alternation of generations into processes which are known to occur separately, and

which may have arisen imperceptibly, becoming gradually emphasised by the

steady action of the conditions of life. Every startling novelty that can thus be

explained extends the application of that principle which underlies the theory of

--Natural Selection I mean the principle that a small force acting steadily through

a long time may produce changes of almost any magnitude.

The Hydrozoa yield innumerable and varied examples of development with

transformation and also of budding. They yield also the most admirable examples

which all the members are pretty much alike, but we soon advance to differentiation

apply to every case. In Hydra, for instance, there is an ill-defined alternation of
generations, but no metamorphosis.

kind of swimming bell; defensive polyps (which may be either batteries of nettling
cells or covering organs) ; and reproductive individuals. As the individuals become

subordinated to the colony, and lose essential parts of the primitive structure, thej'^

pass insensibly into organs.

     The life-histories of Invertebrates abound in complications and paradoxes.

Thus Eucharis, one of the Ctenophors, becomes sexually mature as a larva, but

only in warm weather. This happens just after hatching, when the animal is of

microscopic size. Then the sexual organs degenerate, the larva, which has already

reproduced its kind, grows to full size, undergoes transformation, and at length

becomes sexually mature a second time.* There is often a strikmg difference

between the early stages of animals which are closely related, or a strong adap-

tive resemblance between animals which are of very remote blood-relationship.

In the Hydrozoa similar polyps may produce very different medusae, and dissimilar

polyps medus£e that can hardly be distinguished. There are insects so like in

their adult state that they can only be distinguished by minute characters, such as the

form and arrangement of the hairs on the legs, and yet the larvae may be con-

spicuously different.' Annelids and Echinoderms yield fresh examples of the same

thing. In Lepidoptera and Saw-flies the larvte are very similar, but the winged

Newinsects quite different.^  stages may be added in one species, while closely

allied species remain unaffected. In Cunina and the Diphyidse we get combina-

tions which strain the inventive powers of naturalists even to name. Natural

Selection seems to act upon the various stages of certain life-histories almost as it

acts upon species.

But the history is not always one of growing complexity. Sometimes for

example a well-established medusa-stage is dropped. First it ceases to free itself,

then the tentacles and marginal sense-organs disappear, then the mouth closes. In

the fresh-water Cordylophora the medusa is replaced by a stalked sac filled with

reproductive elements or embryos. The Lucernarise present a single stage which

seems to be polyp and medusa in one. Hydra has no medusa. It is not always
clear whether such Hydrozoa as these are primitive or reduced. Even the hydroid
polyp, the central stage in the normal Hydrozoan life-history, may be suppressed,

and certain medusae in both of the chief groups develop direct from the egg or

planula (Pelagia, Geryonia, ^gina, Oceania). There is no stage common to all
Hydrozoa except the egg. The same thing may be said of the Tunicates.

     The life-history of many Arthropods is to all appearance quite simple. There

emerges from the egg a spider, scorpion, or centipede (in most Chilopoda) which

merely grows bigger and bigger till it is adult. But if, as in most Crustacea, the

circumstances of the species call for a migratory stage, such a stage will be added.

In certain Decapod Crustacea (Penseus, Leucifer) a nauplius and as many as five
other stages may intervene before the final or adult stage. Some of these
larval stages are common to a great many Crustacea, but none, as we now

think, belong to the original phylogeny. If a resting or a winged stage is

wanted, it is supplied just as easily, witness the holometabolic insects. Here

again, so far as we know, there is nothing absolutely new.'' The stages which
seem new are merely exaggerations for special pui-poses of sections of the life-

history, which were originally marked out by nothing more important than

a change of skin and a swelling out of the body. Let us not suppose for a

moment that it is a law of insect-development that there should be larva, pupa,

and imago, or that it is a law of Crustacean development that there should be six

--distinct stages between the egg and the adult. Any of these stages may be

dropped, if it proves useless either totally suppressed, or telescoped, so to speak,

into the embryonic development. Lost stages are indicated by the embryonic
moults of some centipedes and spiders, Limulus, many Crustacea, and Podura.
The parthenogenetic reproduction of some immature insects, such as Miastor,
shows a tendency to suppress later stages. Perhaps the wingless Thysanura are
additional examples, but here, as in the case of Hydra and Lucernaria, we do not
certainly know whether they are primitive or reduced. It seems to be easy to add
new stages, when circumstances (and especially parasitism) call for them. Meloe,
Sitaris, andEpicauta are well-known examples. In some Ephemeiidse the moults,
which are potential stages, become very numerous, but as a curious exception to a

very general rule, the last moult of all, which is usually so important, may be
practically suppressed. The fly of an Ephemera may mate, lay eggs, and die,

while still enveloped in its last larval skin.

    Among the many cases of what one is inclined to call rapid adaptation to

circumstances (the chief indications of rapidity being the very partial and isolated
occurrence of remarkable adaptive characters) are those which Giard ' has collected

Aand compared, and which he refers to a process called by him Pcecilogouy.

number of very different animals - produce according to habitat, or season, or some
other condition closely related to nutrition, eggs of more than one sort, which
differ in the quantity of nourishment which they contain and in the degree of
transformation which the issuing larva is destined to undergo. The analogy with
the summer and winter eggs of Daphnia, &c. cannot escape notice, and Giard
connects with all these the psedogeuesis of Miastor and Chironomus, and many
cases of heterogony. For our immediate purpose it is sufficient to remark that the
reproductive processes and the course of development are as liable to vary for
motives of expediency as the form of a leg or fin. The supposed constancy (the
necessary constancy according to some naturalists) of the embryonic stages
throughout large groups, would not be hard to break down, if it were to be again
asserted. Probably the doctrine is now totally abandoned ; it belongs to that
phase of zoological knowledge in which Meckel could declare that every higher
animal passes in the course of its development through a series of stages which are
typified by adult animals of lower grade, and when an extreme partisan, far
inferior to Meckel both in experience and caution, could affirm that the human
embryo omits no single lower stage.

    The tadpole-larva, which is common in lower Vertebrates and their allies,

Weshows the influence of adaptation as strongly as any larva that we know.

may describe the tadpole as a long-tailed Chordate, which breathes by gills and

has a suctorial mouth-disc, at least during some part of its existence. It is a cheap

form of larva, when reduced to its lowest terms, requiring neither hard skeleton,
nor limbs, nor neck, yet it can move fast in water by means of its sculling tail.
Such a tadpole appears in many life-histories, and plays many parts. The tadpole
is the characteristic Tunicate larva, and in this group commonly ends by losing its
tail, and becoming fixed for life. But Salpa, which is motile when adult, has lost

its tadpole. Appendicularia has lost the normal adult stage if it ever had one, and
its tadpole becomes sexually mature. The same thing seems to have happened to
many Amphibia, whose tadpoles acquire legs, become sexually mature, and consti-
tute the normal adult stage. The Lamprey, as Balfour and others have recognised,

is another kind of sexually mature tadpole. Thus the tadpole may act as larva to
a sea-squirt, fish (Acipenser, Lepidosteus, Amia), or frog; it may also constitute

the only remaining stage in the free life-history.

     The lower and smaller animals seem to show beyond others the prevalence of
adaptive features. They offer visible contrivances of infinite variety, while they
are remarkable for the readiness with which new stages are assumed or old ones
dropped, and for their Protean changes of forms, which are so bewildering that

many Worms, for instance, cannot as yet be placed at all, while many larvre give
no clue to their parentage. These lower and smaller animals show beyond others
a tendency to multiply rapidly, and to break away from one another in an early
stage. The tendency is so strong in the microscopic Protozoa that it enters into

the definition of the group. Fission, budding, alternation of generations, and
spore-formation (as in Gregarina) are ultimately due to the same tendency.

    Weak animals are almost inevitably driven to scatter, and to make up by their

insignificance, their invisibility, and their powers of evasion for the lack of power
to resist. It is a great thing to a Hydrozoan colony that if one polyp is bitten off",
others remain, that no enemy can possibly devour all the medusae liberated from

one colony, or all the planulae liberated from one medusa. Low organisation gives

very special facilities for extreme division. There are animals and plants which

multiply greatly as a consequence of being torn to pieces or chopped small. (Chigoe,

some Fungi, &c.)
     Small animals are usually short-lived. Many complete their life-history in a

few weeks. Those which last for so long as a year are often driven, like annual
plants, to adapt every detail of their existence to the changing seasons. The
naturalist who explores the surface waters of the sea with a tow-net soon learns

that the time of year determines the presence or absence of particular larvse. It

is probably as important to an Aurelia as to a butterfly that it should tide over the

storms of winter by means of a sedentary and well-protected stage. Any one who
keeps scyphistoma in an aquarium will remark how small it is, how it creeps
into crevices or the hollows of dead shells. But when the depth of winter is past,

it pushes out its strobila, which in spring liberates ephyrse. These rapidly enlarge,
and by August have grown from microscopic discs to jelly-fishes a foot across.

     The intelligence of many small animals is very low. They go on doing the
thing that they have been used to do, the thing that has commended itself to the
experience of many generations. They are governed by routine, by that inherited
and unconscious power of response to external stimulus, which we call instinct.
But there are some notable exceptions. Of all small animals, insects seem to show

the greatest flexibility of intelligence.

     There is one large group of animals which is in striking contrast to nearly all
the rest. Vertebrates, and especially the higher Vertebrates, are usually big and
strong. They rely upon skill, courage, or some other product of high organisa-

tions, rather than upon numbers and fertility. Vertebrates swallow many other

animals, together with their living parasites, but are rarely swallowed alive or

fresh by Invertebrates. This fact of nature has led to many consequences, among
others to this, that many parasites which pass their earlier stages in the bodies of

Invertebrates only attain sexual maturity in a Vertebrate host. The complexity
of the structure of a Vertebrate precludes the possibility of multiplication by

breaking-up or budding, and they multiply only by egg-laying or strictly analogous

processes. The higher Vertebrates live so long that the accidents of a par-
ticular j'ear or a particular season are not of vital importance. Hence seasonal

transformation is almost unknown ; the quadruped or bird rtiay choose the warm
months for rearing the family, or celebrate the pairing season by getting a new

suit of feathers, or grow a thicker coat against the cold of winter, but that is all.

No Vertebrates perish regularly at the approach of winter, leaving only batches

of eggs to renew the species in spring, nor is their structure profoundly modified
by the events of the calendar (the frog is a partial exception). One minor cause

of transformation, which affects the life history f many polyps, worms and insects,

is thus removed. Vertebrates often take care of their young, and the higher

Vertebrates bring forth few at a time. For this reason among others they rarely
afi'ord examples of free larvse. Such Vertebrate larvse as we do find, conform to
the Vertebrate type. It is often impossible to predict what adult will develop
from an Invertebrate larva, but no one could hesitate to rank an Ammocoetes, a
Leptocephalus, or a tadpole among the Vertebrates.

      It accords with this strength and mastery that Vertebrates, and especially the
higher Vertebrates, should be more stable, more conservative, less experimental

than other animals. They retain ancient structures long after they have ceased to

be useful. The gill-clefts, gill-arclies, and branchial circulation are good examples.
Though not functional in Sauropsida and Mammalia, they never fail to appear in
the course of the development. Yet the Sauropsida and the Mamma,lia are posi-
tively known to go back to the earliest secondary and late palpeozoic times. Ever
since the beginning of the secondary period at least, every reptile, bird, and

mammal has continued to pass through a stage vs^hich seems obviously piscine, and

of which no plausible explanation has ever been offered, except that remote pro-
genitors of these animals were iishes. Could not Natural Selection, one is tempted

to ask, have straightened the course of development during lapses of time so vast,
and have found out less roundabout ways of shaping the tongue-bone and the

ossicles of the ear ? Either it costs nothing at all to pursue the old route, or it

costs nothing which a higlier Vertebrate will ever miss. The second alternative

seems to me the more likely. The Sauropsida and Mammalia, in comparison with

other animals, are particularly well oft", and like wealthy housekeepers, they do not

care what becomes of the scraps. It is, I fancy, difl'erent with many fishes, which
show by their numerous eggs, the occasional presence of peculiar immature stages,

and some other slight hints, that their life is a hard one.

    The presence in the developing reptile, bird, or mammal of piscine structures

which are no longer useful has been ascribed to a principle called Recapitulation,

and Haeckel lays it down as a fundamental biogenetical law that the development

of the individual is an abbreviated recapitulation of the development of the race.

--If I had time to discuss the Recapitulation Theory, I should begin by granting

much that the Recapitulationist demands for instance, that certain facts in the
development of animals have an historical significance, and cannot be explained by

mere adaptation to present circumstances ; further, that adaptations tend to be

inherited  at  corresponding  phases  both  in  the  ontogeny  and    the  phylogeny.                                             I  am

from him when he says that ' each animal is compelled to discover its parentage in

its own develop^ient,' that 'every animal in its own development repeats this

proof of the theory depends chiefly on its universal applicability to all animals,

whether high or low in the zoological scale, and to all        their  parts  and  organs,'                                                I

feel persuaded that, if this is really so, the Recapitulation Theory will never be

proved at all. The development, so far as it has yet been traced, of a Hydra,

Peripatus, Beetle, Pond-mussel, Squid, Amphioxus, Chick or Mammal tells us

very little indeed of the history of the races to which they belong. Development

tells us something, I admit, and that something is welcome, but it gives no

answer at all to most of the questions that we put. The development of a

Mammal, for instance, brings to light what I take to be clear proof of a piscine

stage ; but the stage or stages immediately previous can only be vaguely desciibed

as Vertebrate, and when we go back further still, all resemblance to particular
adult animals is lost. The best facts of the Recapitulationist are striking and

valuable, but they are much rarer than the thorough-going Recapitulationist

phylogeny in the development of the individual. Whenever any biologist brings
the word must into his statement of the operations of living nature, I look out to

see whether he will not shortly fall into trouble.

    This hasty review of animal transformations reminds me how great is the part

of adaptation in nature. To many naturalists the study of adaptations is the

popular and superficial side of things ; that which they take to be truly scientific

is some kind of index-making. But we should recognise tliat comparatively
modern adaptations may be of vital importance to the species, and particularly
 luminous to the student because at times they show us nature at work.

     I am accustomed to refer such adaptations to the process of Natural Selection,

though if any one claimed to explain them by another process, I should, for present

purposes, cheerfully adopt a more neutral phrase. There are, I believe, no limits to be

assigned to the action of Natural Selection upon living plants and animals.

Natural Selection can act upon the egg, the embryo, the larva, and the resting

pupa, as well as upon the adult capable of propagation. It can even influence the

race through individuals which are not in the line of descent at all, such as adults
past bearing or the neuters of a colony. The distinction between historical and

adaptive, palingenetic and coenogenetic, is relative only, a difi'erence not of kind

but of degree. All features are adaptive, but they may be adapted to a past rather
than to a present state of things ; they may be ancient, and deeply impressed upon

the organisation of the class.

      In Biology facts without thought are nothing; thought without facts is

nothing ; thought applied to concrete facts may come to something when time has
sorted out what is true from what is merely plausible. The Reports of this
Association will be preserved here and there in great libraries till a date when the

biological speculations of 1897 are as extinct as the Ptolemaic Astronomy. If

many years hence some one should turn over the old volumes, and light upon this
long-forgotten address, I hope that he will give me credit for having seen what was
coming. Except where the urgent need of brevity has for the moment been too
much for scientific caution, I trust that he will find nothing that is dogmatic or

over-confident in my remarks.

                     By Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn.

     The famous skeleton of Phenacodus, belonging to the Cope Collection, which

came into the possession of the American Museum of Natural History in 1895, has

been entirely freed from the matrix and remounted in such a manner that every
part can be removed for study. This remounting gives quite a different conception
of the animal from that presented in the original mounting, as illustrated before

the Section in an enlarged photograph of the fossil skeleton and a wax model

by Charles Knight. Phenacodus is digitigrade as the tapir. Its proportions are
very peculiar and widely different from those of any modern ungulate, consisting
of an extremely small head, short neck, short fore-limbs, long hind-limbs,
powerful hind-quarters and tail, and upwardly arched back. Phenacodus is not
ancestral to any of the modern Ungulata because its ancestor Euprotogonia is
similarly specialised, although found in the basal Eocene. These animals, how-
ever, give us a picture of the true ancestral ungulate type and forcibly demon-
strate the derivation of the hoofed from the clawed animals. The model of
Phenacodus shows its many points of likeness to the general build of the Creodonta
or ancient Carnivora.

2. On Skeletons and Restorations of Tertiary Mammalia.
         By Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn.

This paper, illustrated by numerous photographs of the mounted skeletons and

of Charles Knight's restorations, set forth the special methods instituted by the

author in the American Museum of Natural History. The field work which

began six years ago is planned as a complete /«Mwa/ survey oi the ancient Tertiary

lakes, the Eocene and Oligocene being now nearly complete, and future work

extending into the Miocene and Pliocene and back into the Mesozoic. Careful

records of horizontal distribution of species are preserved and numerous new
faunal subdivisions have already been clearly defined. Two other features of the

field work are the extremely skilful and thorough methods of collection and the

efforts made to secure complete skeletons suitable for mounting, the ultimate object

being to secure and exhibit every stage in the development of the more important

types. Ten complete skeletons have already been mounted as follows : Protoro-

hippus, Hyrachyus, Palceosyops, Titanotherium, Phenacodus, Coryphodon, Acera-

iherium, Metamynodon, representing the ungulates ; Patriofelis and Hoplophoneus,

representing the unguicidates. The special features of the museum work are the

immediate cataloguing of the collections, which now include upwards of 10,000

individuals, and their division into a study and exhibition series, both of which are

readily accessible to investigators. The mounting of the skeletons vastly increases

their interest to the general public. Each skeleton, as exhibited, will be accom-

panied by a model representing its former muscular proportions and by a large

coloured restoration giving an idea of its appearance when alive, its habits and

Aenvironment.  double set of labels will also be adopted, separating the popular

from the purely scientific information. The methods of field collection are

popularised by means of large coloured transparent photographs hung in the

windows, taken in the field especially for this purpose.

        4. The Amblyopsidce, the Blind Fish of America.

                      By Dr. C. H. Eigenmann.

The underground regions of North America are inhabited by a number of

blind aquatic vertebrates.

These are TypMomolge from Texas, Typhlotriton from Missouri, Gronias

nigrilahris from Pennsylvania, Amblyopsis spelceus from Kentucky aud Indiana,

Typhliehthys subterraneus from Kentucky, Alabama, and Indiana, and an

undescribed species, Typhliehthys rosce, from Missouri.

   A considerable area of South Central Indiana is drained entirely by imder-

ground streams in which Amblyopsis is abundant.

It has the general appearance of skinned catfish, is well balanced in the water,

and has broad fins.

The chief points of interest in Amblyopsis are the eyes, the skin, and the

tactile organs. Since, however, all the published accounts concerning this fish are

more or less worthless, some other points of interest may be mentioned.

Amblyopsis has been recorded as a surface feeder, but it secures its food at the

bottom. Its abundant tactile organs about the head enable it to exactly locate a
Acrawling or moving object if a short distance from its head.

Aaway.
        young one reared in the light was able invariably to perceive the direc-

tion a rod was approaching it, and to swim intelligently away.

Although the eyes are entirely incapable of receiving impressions, the fish reacts

negatively to light. This reaction is not caused by any particular colour of the

spectrum. It is not a matter of heliotropism, for the direction of the light has-

nothing to do with the reaction.

    The eye in the adult has no connection with the brain. The lens is composed
of a few inconspicuous cells. The vitreous humour is gone, and the eye, in conse-

quence of the absence of a hyaloid, vitreous body, and practically the total absence

of a lens, has collapsed, so that the ganglionic layer forms a solid core of cells. The
inner reticular layer is well developed. The layers outside of this to the external
limiting membrane have been reduced to a layer of cells about two deep. The pig-
ment has in some of the best eyes retained its normal thickness. Cones are pre-
sent. The sclera is represented by one or more cartilaginous masses.

     In the number and arrangement of the tactile organs it is not materially difierent
from Chologuster, which can certainly see.

     The steps of degeneration can be followed by comparing the eyes of Zygonectes,
Chologaster, Typhlogobius, and Amblyopsis. The lens is the last to be affected, but
when it once begins it degenerates very rapidly, disappearing in some cases during
the life time of an individual, e g., Typhlogobius.

     Amblyopsis is universally considered as viviparous. This it is not. The female
lays the eggs under her own gill-covers, which are very wide. Here the young-

are reared through their larval stages. When the female at this time is handled

the young will squirm out. This fact has given rise to the supposition that the

fish is viviparous.

     The absence of pigment causes the blood to give Amblyopsis a yellowish tint itt

the thinner parts, such as the fins, while in the thicker parts the colour is pink.

Pigment cells are abundant in the larva, and are not at all rare in the skin of

the adult, but they contain little pigment.

It is a matter of general observation that the pigment diminishes in the absence
686 REPORT--1897.

Aof ligbt in many fishes.  striking instance is the lower side of flatfishes. It is

also known that Proteus, when exposed to the light, hecomes dark (Oshorn), and

that the lower side of a flounder, if exposed to the light, may become pigmented

(Cunningham).

     Now, since pigmentation cannot be of any selective value in dark places, the

disappearance of pigment cannot be attributed to natural selection ; nor can the
matter of economy have given selection a chance to remove the pigment. Is the

lack of pigment, then, a characteristic reacquired with each individual ? It is not,

for in a yoimg fish kept for ten months in the light the absence of pigment was

as marked as in the adult.

   We apparently have here an acquired characteristic, the depigmented condi-

tion of the chromatophores hereditarily established.

                                 5. The Origin of the Mainmalia.

                    By Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn.

     The Tertiary and Recent placental^ have been divided by the author into Cen-

eutheria and Meseutheria.
     The former include the higher types, progressive and specialised, mainly during

the Eocene and Oligocene periods. The latter include the lower types, persistent
and primitive, specialised mainly during the Mesozoic period, and with the excep-
tion of the Lemaroidea, Insectivora, and Ganodonta, dying out early in the Ter-

tiary. Among these Meseutheria are included the Creodonta, Tillodontia, Insec-

tivora, Lemuroidea, Condylarthra, and Amblypoda. The most distinctive feature

of their evolution is the retarded brain development, the inertia or persistence of

many primitive characters lost among the Oeneutheria, as well as the fact that they

appear substantially in their fully specialised form in the base of the Eocene, and

are thus distinctively the Mesozoic placentals. The known upper Cretaceous
mammals are substantially of the same Eocene Meseuthere type, and contain also
certain Multituberculata (which may be regarded as Prototheria) and possibly also

certain marsupials.

     The Lower Cretaceous or Upper Jurassic (Purbeck) Mammalia embrace also Mul-

tituberculates (? Prototheria), Triconodonts (Metatheria), and Insectivora primitiva

(Meseutheria). The latter may have given rise to the later Meseutheria, and thus

indirectly to the Ceneutheria, although no absolute links are as yet established
connecting the Ceneutheria with the Meseutheria, and the latter are even more

primitive than the known forms of Metatheria or Marsupialia.
    The combined characters of the three above-mentioned types of Jurassic mam-

mals led the author in 1891 to the conclusion that the Hypotheria or Promam-
malia would be found to possess a heterodont dentition, consisting of I. 4, C. 1,
P. 4-5, M. 8. Also that all the Mammalia, multituberculate as well as trituber-
culate, would be found to be originally derived from a trituberculate type of molar

dentition.

     In the meantime Baur has shown that Cope's Pehjcosauria, a division of the
Theromorpha, which Cope believed to be ancestral to the mammals, must be en-
tirely removed from this position. The discoveries of Seeley in the Permian of
South Africa (Karoo Beds) show that the Theriodontia possess most of the charac-

ters which we may expect to find in the ancestors of the Mammalia, mingled with
many distinctively reptilian characters. Among these Theriodonts the herbivorous
division, or Gomphodontia, presents many analogies to the Multituberculata, while

the carnivorous Cynodontia are similarly analogous both to the Protodonta (Os-
born) of the American Triassic and to the Triconodonta, or ancestral tritubercu-
lates, the specialised dental formula agreeing closely with that postulated for the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.  G87

Hypotheria. The Goinpliodontia, however, with the exception of Tritylodon,
show a marked trituhercular pattern in their superior molars (especially Diade-
modon mastacus) and tend to confirm the author's hypothesis that the multituber-

culates are of trituhercular origin.

     The general conclusion is that the Theriodontia stand nearer the ancestral
mammalia Prototheria, Metatheria, and Meseutheria than any other known division

of the Reptilia.

   6. Description of Sjjecimens of Sea-trout, Caplin, and Sturgeon from
          Hudson Bay. By Professor Edward E. Prince, Ottawa.

     The author referred to the special interests attaching to specimens illustrative
of the fish fauna of Hudson Bay, the faunistic resources of which are almost wholly
unknown.

     Distinguished explorers like Dr. E. Bell, Mr. J. Burr Tyrrell, Mr. A. P. Lowe,
and others, chiefly members of the statt' of the Geological Survey of Canada, have
gathered information regarding the fish in the remote northern areas referred to

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

their special work, of a geological and geographical character, prevented systematic
zoological investigations. The specimens described by the author were placed in
his hands by Dr. Bell and Mr. Lowe.

     The salmon-trout from Ungava Bay is the Salmo Hearnii, originally described

in Franklin's first journal. It is really a Salvelinus, and is no doubt the Salve-
Jinus alpinus stagnalis of Jordan and Evermann. It must be noted, however, that
the Salmo stagncdis of Fabricius (1780), inhabiting small lakes in Greenland, is
non-migratory. If it be non-migratory, or if it does migrate to the sea, and then
becomes, as is stated, of a plain silvery colour, the specimen under review is not

identical with it. At any rate, the present specimen, taken, as Mr. Lowe states, on
the east coast of Hudson Bay to the north of Cape Jones, and very abundant in
the streams entering Ungava Bay and along the northern coast of Labrador, is

characterised by the three features mentioned below. First, it is migratory and
captured in vast numbers in tidal waters in Ungava Bay and other localities.

Secondly, it exhibits large disc-like spots of a pale flesh tint, rather larger than a
pea in circumference, and extending from the shoulder to the tail, and slightly above
the lateral line. Thirdly, the scales are exceedingly small, somewhat deeply im-
bedded in the integument, and numbering at least 250 along the lateral line.

     The typical alpinus (Sailling) exhibits about 200 scales along the lateral line,
has twelve rays in the anal fin, and shows a white anterior margin on the paired

fins. In these three points the present specimen differs, nor is it like Salvelinus
alipes, which has twelve or thirteen rays in the first dorsal fin, 126 scales in the
lateral line, according to Dr. Suckley. Giinther regards S. alipes as identical with

S. stagnalis. It may be added that the present specimen has the following fin-ray

--formula : P. 14, D. lo, V. 11, A. 10, the fins are plain, the dorsum of a dark

olive green tint, and the tail truncate or very slightly forked. The weight is from
3 lb. to 18 lb. The specimen of caplin is a somewhat diminutive dried example,
but a careful examination showed that it differed in no respect from the caplin
(Mallotus villosus) which abounds in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The presence of
caplin in Hudson Bay might be taken as an indication that cod occur there. It

is the favourite food of the cod at certain seasons.

     The specimen of sturgeon from Hudson Bay is Aeipenser sturio, L., though the

specimen is very young, less than six inches in length, and the external features

are known to change materially with the attainment of maturity. In young
.sturgeon the snout, as a ride, is long and attenuated, the body slender, the enamel

plates highly developed, and the spines prominent and hooked. This example has :
dorsal plates 14, lateral 35, ventral 11 ; and the fin-rays are : dorsal fin 36, anal 20.
These details in other species are as follows :

          9. Theories of Mimicry as illustrated by African Butterflies.
/)*y Edward B. Poulton, i/. J., F.li.S., Hope Professor of Zoology, Oxford.

    H. W. Bates, in his epoch-making paper ('Trans. Linn. Soc.,' vol. xxiii.

1862), first gave an intelligible theory of mimicry, and accounted for the superficial

resemblances which had been known for so long by supposing that the most
dominant, well-defended, and conspicuous forms in a country become the models
towards which natural selection leads many of the weaker hard-pressed species
in the same locality. The material on which Bates' theory was formed was con-

fined to tropical America, and his generalisation remained incomplete until it

could be applied to the other great tropical regions. This want, however, was
soon supplied by A. R. Wallace for the East ( ' Trans. Linn. Soc.,' vol. xxv. 1866),
and by Roland Trimen for Africa ( * Trans. Linn. Soc.,' vol. xxvi. 1870).

  --In Bates' original paper a certain class of facts frequently mentioned and
--abundantly illustrated cannot be explained under his theory of mimicry. This is

the strong resemblance which is apt to exist between the dominant forms them-
selves, and which is as minute and as remarkable as the resemblance of the weaker
for the stronger species. Bates pointed out that this was unsolved by his theory,
and both he and Wallace were compelled to suggest the direct action of some
unknown local influence as the possible cause. There the matter rested until

Fritz Miiller, in a paper published in ' Kosmos ' for May 1879, suggested an explana-

tion, viz., that the dominant forms gain an advantage by this resemblance, inasmuch

as it facilitates the education of their enemies by giving them fewer patterns to
learn. The necessary waste of life by which the education of young birds, &c., is
brought about is here divided between the various species of a closely convergent
group, instead of being contributed by each member independently. The chief
sub-families of butterflies which in tropical America appear to be specially dis-

tasteful to insect-eating animals, and which are specially mimicked by others, are
the Danaince, Ithomiince, JfeliconiiKP, and Acraince. Of these the second and
third are confined to this part of the world. The resemblances which Fritz Miiller
explained are those which occur very commonly between the Danain(e,Itho)mmee,
Heliconina, and less commonly the Acraince of any locality. In order to complete
this theory it was necessary to test its application in other parts of the world.

     In the East the butterflies which take the place of the four above-named sub-
families belong almost exclusively to the Danaintx, the Acr<ei7i(e being represented
by very few species. The DanairKe are, however, extremely rich in species, and
F. Moore first pointed out in ' Proc. Zool. Soc.,' 1883, p. 201, that there is the same
relationship between the species of this dominant group that obtains between those
of tropical America. Not only do Danainm of very difl'erent genera closely re-
semble each other, but there is often a strong likeness between the species belonging

--to the two chief divisions of the sub-family the Danaina and Euploeina. As in

America, these resemblances are always between the species of the same locality.
      While, however, Muller's theory received full confirmation from the facts observed

in India and the tropical East generally, no attempt has been made until now to

apply it to the African lepidopterous fauna. I have therefore examined this
fauna from the Miillerian standpoint, and find that in it too the same relationships
can be traced.

     The dominant distasteful groups of Africa are the AcreBitKB, which have their
metropolis here, and the Danaince. The latter are chiefly represented by the
species of the peculiar African genus Amauris, and by the abundant and wide-
spread Danais \Limnas) chrysippus. I first looked for evidence of convergence
between the Acrmna: and Limiias chrysippus, and soon found what appeared to
be evident traces of it. Such species as Planema esebria (certain forms of), Acrcra

petrcea (female), A. oppidia, and, above all, A. encedon {lycia) bear a considerable

1897.  YY
 G90 REPORT-- 1897.

 resemblance to L. chrysippus, inasmuch as all of them possess a dark tip to the
 fore wing crossed by a white bar, as in the Danaine butterfly. Looking at the
 near allies of these species and at the Acvaintp as a whole, we may feel confident
  that this black-and-white tip is not an ancestral character of the group, but a
  comparatively recent modification. Again, the fact that this character is some-
  times more strongly developed in, and sometimes confined to, the female sex agrees
  with the corresponding relationships in other parts of the world, and furthermore

  supports the conclusion as to the recent acquisition of the markings.

       Convergence between the Acradna; and Danaiiuc of the genus Aniauris was

 next looked for and many examples found. Thus Acra-a johjistoni of East Central

  Africa certainly suggests the appearance of one of the cchen'a group, such as

 A. hanninf/tonii, found in the same locality; while in West Africa Acrcca lycoa
 resembles the black-and-white AmaurU danwdes and A. ecjialca. Similar resem-
 blances in the West are to be seen between the large black-and-white females of
 the numerous species of the Acrseine genus rianenia and other Acrteas in the
 same locality, such as A. carmeiitis (female) &nd A. jodutta (female), while tin-
 species referred to, of both Acraeine genera, bear some considerable resemblance to
 an abundant West African black-and-white Danaine Amavris ninvius. Similar
 relationships occur in the Soutb-East, where Acrseas, such as Planema eseltvia

 (white form of female) and P. aganice bear considerable resemblance to the abun-
 dant black-and-white Danaines Amauris ochlea and A. dominicmius.

      It was of great interest to prove that the members of these convergent groups

 occur, not onlj' in the same place, but at the same time. Mr. Guy A. K. Marsliall
 has kindly done this work, sending me several groups captured at one place in a
 single day. At Malvern, near Durban, Natal, on March 6, and again on JIarch

 30, 1897, he captured Limnas chrysippus and several species of Acraa, with the

 black-and-white tip to the wing. On March 27 he captured, in the same locality,

 the black-and-white Planemas (Acircinre) P. esebn'a and P. aganice, together with
 an abundant black-and-white Neptis {N, ayatha) and a closely similar day-flying
 moth, Nyctimeris apicalis. It is very probable that these latter forms do not
 mimick in the Batesian sense, but are themselves specially defended and fall into a

 Miillerian group. Mr. INIarsliall did not, on that day, capture any of the black-
 and-white Danaince. Mr. D. Chaplin, however, on April 5, 1896, obtained at
 Berea, a suburb of Durban, Aniauris ochlea and Planema aganice, as well as
Limnas chrysippus, with two species of convergent Acrreas {A. encedon and A.

petrcea). Mr. F. D. Godman and Mr. 0. Salvin have kindly presented these
 specimens to the Hope Collection at Oxford.

     I think it must be admitted that tliere is now strong evidence for the same

 convergence between specially protected abundant African species from the same
locality as that which is already well known in the tropical East and in tropical

America. Various degrees of perfection exist, and it is in every way probable
that the resemblance of some members to the standard of their group is not of

long standing, and will improve in the future.
      Other facts in the colouring of African Lepidoptera also support this interpret-

ation. Thus certain LycainidcE of the genera Pentila and Ala-na are known to

--fly very slowly, and in the case of the latter to feign death when captured cha-

racteristics of unpalatable forms. While they thus difi'er in habits from Lyctenids
generally, they also differ entirely in their appearance, which rather suggests that
of an Acrcea. The same is true of moths belonging to many groups, and perhaps
of the abundant butterflies of the genus Byblia. Similarly the large group of
Lepidoptera, which has for its centre the abundant day-flying moths of the genus
Aletis, appears to be moulded upon the colouring and pattern of Limnas chry-
sippus, differing only in an even greater conspicuousness, due to the white spots or
rings on the black body, and the highly developed black-and-white border to the
hind wing. It is probable that the common species of the genus Euphepdra, which
form some of the most conspicuous members of this group, are themselves specially
protected. To take one more example, certain species of the Pierine genus Mylothris
are rendered specially conspicuous by the interrupted black border to the hind

Awings, the interruptions extending along the hind margin of the fore wangs.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION D.                                        691

white butterfly witli such a bordei* becomes an extremely conspicuous object, and
this appearance of Mylothrig is mimicked, more or less perfectly, by species from
a number of Pierine genera, such as Nepherojiia, Belenois, Callosune, &c. This is
usually explained as an example of true Batesian mimicry, but it is, perhaps, more
probable that the Tievina are very largely a specially protected group, many of
the genera of which, so to speak, combine their advertisements, and thus share
between them the loss of life which must necessarily ensue during the education

of each generation of their enemies.

     I think sufficient evidence has been brought forward to show that the theory
of mimicry, or rather of common warning (synaposematic) colours, which will
always be associated with the name of Fritz Miiller, may claim abundant examples
in Africa as well as in the other parts of the world in which it has already been
proved to hold.

Protective Mimicry as Evidence for the Validiti/ of the Theory of Natural

    Selection. By Edward B. Poultox, M.A., F.R.S., Hope Professor of

      Zoology, Oxford.

Several suggestions have been put forward to account for the superficial

resemblances between animals, especially insects, occupying the same geographical

area. It has been suggested, and indeed strongly maintained, that food, climate,

or some other chemical or physical influence of the locali+v may have supplied
the cause. On the other hand, many naturalists consider that the facts cannot be

interpreted by any of these suggested causes, and only receive an intelligible and

probalile explanation in the theory of natural selection. This theory supposes

that the resemblance is advantageous in the struggle for existence, the weaker

forms being shielded by their resemblance to the stroug and well-defended species

(mimicry of H. W. Bates), or the latter gaining by a resemblance which enables

-- --their local enemies more easily and thus with a smaller waste of life to recognise

and avoid them (mimicry of Fritz Midler). The present paper directs attention

to certain facts commonly associated with mimetic resemblance which receive a

ready explanation upon the theory of natural selection as the efficient cause, but,

on the other hand, constitute a serious difficulty in the way of any other theories

as yet brought forward.

Natural selection, as is well tnown, acts upon «?^^/ variations, whatever they

may be, which are in the advantageous direction, and are at the same time not
injurious in themselves. When the end to be gained (in this case the attainment
of a superficial resemblance) is common to a variety of distantly related species
possessing entirely different constitutional tendencies, we may feel confident that

an approach brought about by natural selection will be by extremely diverse paths

of variation. Under natural selection we might predict that such a common end

would be reached by great diversity of means, while under the other hypotheses
mentioned above a result of the kind is inexplicable. Hence the facts of the case

should act as a convenient test between these rival suggestions.

WeFirst as to colour.    know but little of the chemical nature of the pigments

--made use of in mimetic resemblance. One case, however, has been investigated

by Gowland Hopkins viz., the bright tints by which certain S. American Pivrince
have come to resemble Heliconince and Ithomiince in the same locality. Gowland

Hopkins has shown that these close resemblances in colour and pattern are

produced by pigments which are characteristic of the PieritKP, and of an entirely

different chemical nature from those of their models.

Another very interesting case is that of resemblance to ants. Ants arc

mimicked more or less closely by a great variety of insects and by spiders. In
                         TRANSACTION'S OF SECTION I).                                 693

some cases we find the resemblance brought about by actual alterations in the
shape of the body (spiders and many insects), which is modified into a superficial

--resemblance to the Ilymenopteron. In an Acridian Myrmecophana fallax the

shape of an ant is, as it were, painted in black pigment upon the body of the

insect, which is elsewhere light in colour and, as it is believed, inconspicuous in

--the natural environment. In a certain group of Homoptera the Membracidae

some of the S. American species closely resemble ants. The Membracidre are

characterised by an enormous growth from the dorsal part of the first thoracic

segment (pronotum), which spreads backwards and covers the insect like a shield.

In these insects the form of an ant is moulded in the shield beneath which the

unmodified body of the insect is concealed. These facts are only explicable by

.·supposing that some great advantage is to be gained by resembling an ant, and

tbat very different species have attained this end, each by the accumulation of

those variations which were rendered possible by its peculiar ancestral history and

present constitution--in other words, by the theory of natural selection.

   A more elaborate case, which I have recently investigated, is afforded by a

-- --large group of tropical American Lepidoptera moths as well as butterflies which

closely resemble certain common wide-spread species of the Ithomiine genera

Methona and Thijridia. The appearance thus produced con.sists of a transparent

ground with a black border to both wings, the fore wing being also divided by

--black transverse bars into three transparent areas the hind wing usually into

two. From a comparison with other species of the various families, &c., not

altered in this direction, we know that the transparent wings are not ancestral.

When we investigate the manner in which transparency has been attained, it is
found to be by difierent methods in the different constituents of the group. Among

the numerous genera of Ithomiinre {Methona, Thyridia, Dircenna, Eutresis, Ithmnia,

&c.) the result has been attained by the reduction of the scales to a very minute

size, so that they hardly interfere with the passage of light. This reduction

affects the two kinds of scales which alternate with each other in the rows upon

the wings of this sub-family, a common result being {e.g., in Methona and Thyridia)

·the alteration of the more slender scales into hairs, and of the broader ones into

minute bifid structures, still retaining scale-lilie proportions in spite of their

extremely small size. In others, again, the two kinds of scales are reduced

respectively to simple and Y-shaped hairs, which regularly alternate along the

rows. In the Danainas proper, represented by the genus Ituna, the transparency

is chiefly due to the great diminution in the number of the scales, and those
which remain are neither much reduced in size nor altered in shape. In the

Pierince, renreseuted in this group by only a single species, Dismorphia orise, the

scales are greatly reduced in size, but are neither greatly altered in shape nor

diminished in numbers.

Hence in these three sub-families of butterflies transparency is attained in

three  different  ways,  viz.  (1)  by  reduction  in  size  and  simplification  in  shape
                                                                                                                       ;

(2) by reduction in number ; and (3) by reduction in size alone.

When we examine the moths which fall into the group, we find a ranch

greater difference in the methods, corresponding to the wider divergence in

aflinity. In the several species of the genus Castnia the scales lose their pigment,

although undiminished in size, while they are at the same time set vertically upon

the wing, so that light can freely pass between their rows. In the widely sepa-

5'ated genus llyelosia the arrangement is nearly the same, except that the vertical

scales are much attenuated. In the genus Anthomyza, which furnishes the group

with many species, the scales retain the normal size, shape, and overlap, but

become so completely transparent that the light freely passes through them.

In all the numei-ous coiwtituents of this large group of Lepidoptera a very close

resemblance has been produced by entirely difierent methods ; a result which, it

has been argued above, is only consistent with the view that natural selection

alone, among all the explanations which have been suggested, has been the cause

of the observed phenomena.

I owe to the Irindness of Mr. Godman and Mr. Salvin the opportunity of

studying all the butterflies of this large transparent-winged group, while Mr.

2. Economic Entomology in the United States. By L. O. Howard, Ph.D.

      The author described, with some detail, the successive steps in the development
of the science of economic entomology in America, and showed that the necessity
for work against injurious insects is much greater iu America than in Europe.

He stated that about sixty persons are now officially engaged in this work in the

United States, and that their salaries amount to about 9(3,000 dollars. Of these
sixty persons thirty-three are attached to the State Agricultural Experiment

AStations and seventeen to the Department of Agriculture at Washington.

that done in the Department at Washington being described at length.

3. On some remains of a Sepia-like Cuttle-fish from the Loiver Cretaceotts
            rocks of the South Saskatchewan. By J. F. Wiiiteaves.

      In 1889 four rather remarkable fossils, which probably represent the dorsal

side of theinternal shell, or sepiostaire, of a new species of an apparently new genus

closely allied to Sepia, were collected by jMr. T. C. Weston, of the Geological
Survey of Canada, from the Montana or Pierre-Fox Hills formation of the Later
North American Cretaceous at the South Saskatchewan, opposite the mouth of
Swift Current Creek.

     Each of these fossils is imperfect posteriorily, and not a trace of the mucro is
preserved in any of them. The most perfect of the four is about six inclies and a

quarter in length bj- about three inches and a quarter in its maximum breadth.

It is elliptical or elliptic-ovate in outline, slightly convex, but marked with five
narrow, acute, but not very prominent longitudinal ridges, with rather distant
faint depressions or shallow grooves between them. One of these ridges is median,
but the two lateral ones on each side are slightly divergent, and a bilateral sym-
metrj' is very obvious.

   A considerable portion of the surface of each of these fossils is obscured by a

blackish and apparently bituminous substance, so that it is difficult to trace any of
the lines of growth continuously, though they are remarkably well preserved in
patches. Near the lateral margins the incremental strire are simply concentric,
but in the median region (wheif^ they are fine, extremely numerous and densely'
crowded) each one is produced anteriorly into an angular and acutely pointed lobe,

with its apex upon the summit of the median ridge. From this fact it may be in-
ferred that the anterior margin of the dorsal side of the shell was pointed in the
middle when perfect.

     So far as the writer has been able to ascertain, there is no known genus of
Sepiidse, fossil or recent, to which these fossils can be satisfactorily referred. They

bear, no doubt, a certain general resemblance to the internal shells of Sepia itsell";
but in the sepiostaires of all the recent species of that genus which the writer has
been able to examine the radii of the dor,sal surface are broad, flattened, and almost

obsolete. As already suggested, they seem to indicate a new genus and species of
Sepiida3, for which the name Actinosepia CuJiadensis may not be inappropriate.

In any case these specimens, if correctly interpreted, are the first well-marked re-
mains of sepiostaires that have been found in a fossil state in Canada.

         4. The Statistics of Bees. By Professor F. Y. Edgeworth.

     Applying to bees one of the methods which he applied to wasps last year, the
author has found for the species Bombus hortorum that a voyage, from and back
to the nest, made in the later aiternoou, lasts on an average from thirty to thirty-
five minutes. For hive-bees the corresponding length of time appears to be less
than ten minutes.

5. The Aj)j)earance of the Army Worm in the Provhice of Ontario during
                  1896. By Professor J. Hoyes Panton, M.A.

The author gives in tliis paper the results of his observations iipon the army

worm (Leucania unipuncta) during tho summer of 1^90, -when it appeared lu
large numbers throughout Ontiuio. As it infested the fields at the Ontario Agri-

cultural College, he was favourably situated to collect much valuable information.

A sketch accompanving the paper showed very distinctly the infested districts--
A.39 counties and 118 townships.  number of experiments were conducted to

ascertain the principal food plants of this insect. The results showed that its food

is largely restricted to the GraminecB, and that it will not feed upon plants from

the Lc/uminoscb and other orders unless pressed by hunger. When no food was
given in twenty-four hours the insects began to devour one another. Many natural

enemies were found to prey upon this caterpillar, insectivorous birds, toads, pre-
daceous beeMes, and parasitic flies. The Tachina fly {Nemorma leiccanim) was one

of the principal insect foes that kept it in check.

     Beneath a windrow of green oats sprinkled with Paris green (a pound to
75 gallons of water) thousands of dead caterpillars lay. This was spread along the

irround so as to stop their march into the adjoining iield.
     Several artificial remedies were referred to, the chief being to plough a furrow

with its perj^endicular side next the field to be protected, or a ditch may be dug in

the same position. Holes dug at intervals of 10 to 15 feet in the furrow or ditch
will be useful in catching the worms which fail to climb the sides and wander

aimlessly along the furrow. The worms collected in the furrow or ditch may be

destroyed as follows :-- (a) Ploughing a furrow so as to bury them ; {h) sprinkling

coal oil upon them ; (c) scattering straw over them and firing it ; (d) dragging a

heavy pole along the ditch.

1. On the Plankton collected continuously during a traverse of the Atlantic
         in August 1897.1 By Professor W. A. Herdmax, F.B.S.

     Through the kindness of the owners and of the captain of the Allan liner
' Parisian,' I was enabled to run sea-water through four silk tow-nets of djfi'erent de-
^Tees of fineness continuously day and night during the voyage from Liverpool to
Quebec. I used two nets (a coarser inside a finer) on the port side, tied to a tap

through which about 3,600 gallons ran in twelve hours. On the starboard side the

--two nets were attached to an overflow pipe, delivering about 21,600 gallons in

the twelve hours six times as much as on the otlier side. The nets were

emptied and the contents examined morning and evening, so that each gathering
was approximately twelve hours' catch, and each day, and each night, of the voyage

was represented by a gathering. The water was taken in from the sea about

AH14 feet below the surface.                                                                                                                                        the material collected was rapidly examined

with the microscope while in the fresh condition, and was then preserved in solu-

tions of formaline or alcohol for future detailed study.

The fauna of the area traversed may, from the preliminary examination of the

material, be divided into four sections :

--I. The British Coast fauna through the Irish Sea and round the north coast

of Ireland.

II. The Oceanic North Atlantic fauna, including Globigerinu, Radiolaria, and

other characteristic forms.

III. The Labrador Current fauna, with quantities of large northern Copepoda

and Amphipoda.

  --IV. The North American Coast fauna somewhat like that of the first section.

      [Further details in regard to the characteristic forms in the various gatherings

were given at the meeting ; but that preliminary account will now be replaced bv

the fuller description of the material to be published shortly.]

     This method of collecting samples of the surface fauna in any required quantitv
per day or hour from an ocean liner going at full speed was first practised, I
believe, by Dr. John Murray, of Edinburgh. The method is .simple, etfective, and
inexpensive. It requires no complicated apparatus, there is no difficulty in the
manipulation, and no trouble to speak of need be given to any of the ship's com-

pany. It is not even necessary that the naturalist should himself go the voyaoe.
The ship's surgeon or any other officer interested in science can readily carr}' out
the work ; and so, at very slight expense, series of gatherings can be obtained across
the great oceans in every direction traversed by passenger or cargo steamers.

  --Addendum. During the return voyage, at the end of September, the same

process was repeated ; but in addition to the four nets used previously a fifth was
tied periodically over the tap in the bath-room, and the sea-water was allowed to

How through it for stated periods. This gave intermittent gatherino-s for com-

parison with those taken continuously. The bath-room gatherings simply showed
small samples of the fuller (twelve-hour) day or night gatherings.

2. Tlie Determinants for the 2Iajor Classification of Fish-like Vertebrates.

                          By Professor Theodore Gill.

    There is much difference of opinion still respecting the limits of the branch of
vertebrates or chordata as well as the classes which compose it. Those which in
the present state of our knowledge, seem to belong to it are the Tunicates

Leptocardians, Marsipobranchs, Ostracophores, Selachians, Teleostomes (Pisces),

Amphibians, Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals. The least widely separated of all are
the Reptiles and Birds, and if they are retained as distinct classes the others should
also be retained. The division into Ichthyopsida, Sauropsida, and Mammalia fails
to express the natural relations of the constituent classes. These relations may
be exhibited in the following genealogical diagram :

     The gaps between the lower classes are very great. The least differences
Ijetween the Selachians and Teleostomes are manifest in the Xenacanthini and
Dipnoi of the Palaeozoic ; the least between the Teleostomes and Amphibians in
The Crossopterygians and Stegoceplials. The differences between the Amphibians
and Reptiles are minimised in the Palaeozoic. From a generalised stock of the later
Palaeozoic or earlier Mesozoic the Mammals were doubtless derived.

           3. On the Derivation of the Pectoral Member in Terrestrial
                    Vertebrates. By Professor Theodore Gill.

      All attempts at the homologisation of the chiropterygium or anterior limb of
the pentadactyle or terrestrial vertebrate with the ichthyopterygium or pectoral
fin have been more or less unsatisfactory. The most important hint seems to be
furnished by Pohjpterus. Attention was called to the homologies by the author in
his Arrangement of the families of Fishes (1872) and the Standard (or Riverside)
Natural History. Similar conclusions have since been reached by others. The

<;hief objection to the derivation of the chiropterygium from the pectoral member

of such "a form as Polypterns is that at present no extinct representatives are
known. Probably future research will reveal such, as the genus belongs to a very
archaic type, and has numerous not very distantly related precursors in the past.
The homologies in question are justified by the facts of individual development of
the fore-limb in the Reptiles and Mammals.

8. On the Ilcematozoon Infections in Birds. By W. G. MacCallum, B.A.

   -- --Several varieties of birds crows, owls, sparrows, blackbirds, &c. have been

found infected with organisms resembling the malarial organisms of man. These,
like the malarial parasites, develop within the red corpuscles, transforming the
haemoglobin into pigment granules. They reproduce by segmentation, although
this process does not occur simultaneously for great groups of individuals, so as to
make the length of the cycle of development easy of determination, as is the case
in the malarial parasites. The young hyaline forms are not actively motile.

    Two types of organism are recognised. In one (the Proteosoma of Labbe)

the irregularly shaped body is situated at one end of the nucleated red corpuscle,
displacing the nucleus toward the opposite end. This form segments in the peri-
pheral circulation. In the other type, which corresponds to the Ilalteridium of
Labbe, the body of the organism is elongated and curved about the nucleus of the
corpuscle. Segmenting forms are found in the bone marrow, but not in the circu-
lating blood. There is in this type a certain variation in form in different hosts.
698 EEFOET-- 1897.

     Flagellation is readily oljserved in both forms, the organism in freshly prepared
slides being seen to burst from the corpuscle and almost immediately throw out
flagella. Other organisms extruded from the corpuscle degenerate without

flagellation.

     The tissues of these birds show characteristic changes, resulting from the
destruction of blood corpuscles and the deposition of pigment. The spleen and
liver are the organs most markedly affected, the pigment being taken up along
 with infected corpuscles, shrunken parasites, and other debris by large niakro-
phages, wliich probably originate from endothelial cells. These occur in the
capillaries and small vessels in these organs. The endothelial cells still attached
to the vessel wall are also sometimes SNvollen and crowded with pigment, &c. In

the spleen the large endothelial cells of the pulp bands take on the characters of
makrophages. The leucocytes are only exceptionally xjhagocytic.

     The pigment is partly formed by the organisms, partly the result of the
breaking down of the biemoglobin set free in the blood on tlie rupture of the
corpuscle, and there are corresponding variations in its colour.

     The other organs, including the bone marrow, are in general very slightly
affected. Certain foci of necrosis which occur in vai-ious organs have not as yet been
definitely associated with the presence of these organisms.

         9. The Post-embryonic Development o/" Aspidogaster conchicola.

                              By Joseph Stafford, Ph.D.

      The author, after mentioning the ways in which this animal differs in form,
 structure, development, and life history from other Trematodes, and the conse-
 quent difficulties in classifying it, gave a brief sketch of the origin of the embryo,
 and then turned in detail to the life of the young animal after it leaves the e^§,
 during all the time it is undergoing a change in form and developing new organs

 until it reaches sexual maturity.

      Its morphological transformations were represented by eight drawings made to
 the same scale, and its anatomical structure was represented by a few transverse
 sections of each stage. The first of these is the just liberated embryo, which now
 begins to live a free life, and is accordingly, following the suggestion of Brown,
 called a Miracidium. The lengths of the animal at these different periods are
 0'16, 0-33, 0-45, 0'8, 1, 1'2, r5 mm. The change in external form was described,
 and then the origin and change in structure of each organ until it has reached
 maturity were discussed.

Tlip President delivered the following address :

NVe meet this year in exceptional circumstances. Tliirteen years ago the British

Association met for the first time in a portion of the Empire beyond the
limits of the British Islands. During these thirteen years much has happened of

the greatest interest to geographers, and if I attempted to review the progress
which has been made during these years progress in the exploration of the globe,

-- --progress iu geographical research, progress in geographical education I could not

hope to do it to any purpose in the short time during which it would be right for

a president to monopolise the attention of the Section. But we have, at the same

time, reached another stage in our history which naturally leads us to take stock

Weof our progress in the past.  have all of us been celebrating the 60th year of

the glorious reign of the Sovereign, of whose vast dominions Canada and the United

Kingdom form integral parts. The progress made daring that period iu our own

department of science has been immense ; it would take volumes to tell what
has been done for the exploration of the globe. The great continent of

Africa has practically been discovered, for sixty years ago almost all but its rim

was a blank. In 1837 enormous areas in North America were unexplored, and
much of the interior of South America was unknown. In all parts of Asia vast
additions have been made to our knowledge ; the maps of the interior of that
continent were, sixty years ago, of the most diagrammatic character. The

Australian interior was nearly as great a blank as that of Africa ; New Zealand

had not even been annexed. Need I remind you of the great progress which has-
been made during the period both in the North and South Polar areas, culminating

in the magnificent achievement of Dr. Nausen? It was just sixty years ago that
the great Antarctic expedition under Sir James Ross was being organised

.<ince that, alas, little or nothing has been done to follow up his work. Sixty years

ago the science of Oceanographj', even the term, did not exist ; it is the creation

of the Victorian era, and may be said almost to have had its origin in the voyage
of the ' Challenger,' which added a new domain to our science and opened up

inexhaustible fields of research. I have thought then that the most useful and

most manageable thing to do on the present occasion will be to indicate briefly

what, in my estimation, are some of the problems which geography has to attack

in the future, only taking such glances at the past as will enable us to do this

intelligibly.

It has been customary for the occupants of this chair to try to define the

field of geography, and on occasions, in somewhiit too apologetic language, to

justify its existence as a section of n. scieutific association. I do not think this 1&
700 REPORT-- 1897.

any longer necessary. Even in England and America, during the last thirteen

years, geography has done work enough to prove that she has a mission which no

other department of research can fulfil. I say thirteen years, because that not

only carries us back to the last Canadian meeting of the British Association, but

to the year when the Eoyal Geographical Society undertook an inquiry into the

position of geography at home and abroad, mainly Avith a view to the improve-

ment of geographical education in England. During that time a good deal has
been written as to the held and scope of geography, and a good many definitions

given. But we really did not require to go to Germany to teach us as to the field

and functions of geography. Sixty years ago, the then President of the Hoyal

Geographical Society, Mr. William R. Hamilton, delivered the first presidential

address ever given at that Societj^, and his conception of the field and aims of

geography was as exalted and comprehensive as the most exacting German

geographer could wish. It is too long to quote here.'

     It would be difficult to improve upon Mr. Hamilton's definition, and it shows

that a correct conception of the wide and important field of geography is no new
thing in England. He proceeded to indicate what remained to be done in

the field of exploration, and I commend his address to anyone desirous of forming

a conception of the vast progress that has been made since it was delivered,

sixty years ago. Since I am dealing with definitions, I may be permitted

to quote that given by one so severely scientific as General Sir R. Strachey

in a course of lectures which he gave at the University of Cambridge in 1888, in

connection with the establishment of a lecturership in Geography in that University.

* The aim of geographical science,' he says, 'is to investigate and delineate the

various features of the earth                                                                                                             to study the  distribution                      of land  and sea, the con-
                                                                                                                                       ;

figuration and relief of tlie surface, position on the globe, and so forth, facts

which determine the existing condition of various parts of the earth, or wliich

indicate former conditions and to ascertain the relations that exist between
                                                                                                                                                      ;

these features and all that is observed on the earth. ... I claim for geography,'

Sir 11. Strachey says, a' place among the natural sciences as supplying the

needful medium through which to obtain a connected and consistent conception of

the earth and what is on it.' He gives a list of the various matters which,

in his conception, it is the business of geography to deal with, and they are

varied and important -enough to satisfy the demands of the most exacting.

' These are,' he says, ' the studies through which scientific geography will lead

you, teaching you to view the earth in its entirety, bringing together the great

variety of objects seen upon it, investigating their connection, and exploring their

causes; and so combining and harmonising the lessons of all the sciences whicli

supply the key to the secrets of Nature.' -

I think we may briefly define geography as the science of the topographical

·distribution of the great features of the earth's surface and of all that it sustains

mineral, vegetable, and animal, including man himself. In fact, man is the ulti-

mate term in the geographical problem, the final object of which is to investigate

the correlation between humanity aud its geographical environment.

I may be pardoned for dwelling at some length on the function and field of

geography. It is a subject that has been occupying the attention of geographers

in England for some years, and it may not be without interest to our colleagues

on this side of the Atlantic to know the conclusions which we have come to.

Moreover, it seems necessary to arrive at some clear conception on the matter,

with a view to the researches of the future. I say that the subject has been

occupying our attention  in England                                                                                                       for some      time                          it  has done so,  I may say, as
                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

a result of the inquiry by myself on the part of the Royal Geographical Society

to which I have referred. The object of that inquiry was mainly to collect in-
formation as to the position of geography in education at home and abroad. The

report which I presented to the Society attracted some attention, and whether as

a result of that or not it is hardly for me to say, but certainly since that inquiry

some twelve years ap-o the position of geography in England has considerably

improved both in education and as a field for research. Better methods have been

introduced in our schools ; a much wider scope has been given to the subject ; in

many quarters teachers have shown themselves anxious to be guided in the right

direction ; and, above all, both Oxford and Cambridge at length consented to

Athe establishment of lectureships in geography.                                     school of young geographers

has grown up, consisting of men who have had a thorough university training in

science and letters, and who are devoting themselves to the various branches of

geography as a speciality. In this way the arid old text-books and characterless

maps are being supplanted by others that will bear comparison with tlie best pro-

ductions of Germany. Photography and lantern slides illustrating special geogra-

phical features are coming into use in schools ; and in other directions appliances

Afor use in education are being multiplied and improved.                                           British geographical

literature is growing up, and if, as I hope, the progress be maintained, we

shall be able to hold our own 'm geography with any country. The interest in the

subject has been extended by the foundation of geographical societies in various

large centres ; whereas thirteen years ago the only geogi'aphical society was

that of London, there are now similar societies in Manchester, Newcastle, Liver-

pool, and Edinburgh, the last with branches in Glasgow, Dundee, and Aberdeen.

If this progressive movement is maintained, as there is every reason to hope it will

be, the scientific and educational aspects of geography in Britain will be more

nearly on a par with exploration in which our country has so long lield the lead.

In the United States I found that the position of the subject in education was

not much more satisfactory than it was in England. Since then there is reason

to believe considerable progress has been made. One of the best text-books on

physical geography, Hinman's 'Eclectic Physical Geographj',' is of American

origin                                while in the States, as in England, a  school  of scientific  geographers  has
                                   ;

arisen which bids fair to give the subject a high place in that country. I fear,

from what I can learn, that the position in Canada is not as satisfactory as it ought to

be. It seems to me, then, that one of the great problems which geographers have

to face in the future is the place which this subject is to hold in education, both

Weas a body of information and as a discipline.                                      have been making progress,

and if we persevere with intelligence and firmness, and maintain the subject at

the highest standard as a field of research, there can be little doubt of our success.

There is a prevalent belief that geographers have nothing more to learn in Europe,

that that old continent has been thoroughly explored. It is true that nearly every

country in Europe has been, or is being, trigonometrically surveyed. Except some

parts of the Balkan Peninsula and North of Russia, the topography of the continent

has been accurately mapped on scales and by methods sufficient at least for the pur-

--poses of the geographer. Yet there are districts in the Balkan Peninsula for
--example, Albania which are as vaguely known as Central Africa. But it is a delu-

sion to think that because a country has been fully mapped the occupation of the

geographer is gone. It is only when a region at large is adequately mapped that

the work of geographical research begins. The student, with a satisfactory map of a

definite district as his guide, will find on the spot abundant occupation in working

out its geographical details, the changes which have taken place in its topogi'aphy,

and the bearing of its varied features upon its history, its inhabitants, its indus-

tries. This kind of worlc has been in progress in Germany for over ten years,,

inider the auspices of the Central Commission for the Scientific Geography

(Landeskunde) of Germany, with its seat at Stuttgart. Under the collective title

of ' Forschungen zur Deutschen Landes- und Volkskunde,' a long series of mono-

graphs by specialists has been published, dealing in minute detail with one or

more aspects of a limited district. Thus we have such memoirs as ' The Plain of

the Upper Rhine and its Neighbouring Mountains,' by Dr. Richard Lepsius ; ' The

Towns of the North German Plain in relation to the Configuration of the Ground,'

Orometric-Anthropogeographical Study,' by Dr. J. Burgkhardt ; ' The Thurin"-ian

inexhaustible field for scientific geography in its most comprehensive sense, a series

of problems which may take generations to work out. In a less systematic way
we have similar monographs by French geographers. One or two attempts, mainly
by teachers, have been made in England to do similar work, but the impression

generally produced is that the authors have not been well equipped for the task.

I am glad to say that in England the Royal Geographical Society has initiated a
movement for working out in a systematic fashion what one may call the regional

geography of the British Islands on the basis of the one-inch maps of the

Ordnance Survey. It is a strange thing that the geography of the Mother Country

has never yet been systematically worked out.

Taking the sheets of the Ordnance Survey map as a basis, it is proposed that

each district should be thoroughly investigated, and a complete memoir of moderate

dimensions systematicall}' compiled to accompany the sheet, in the same way that
each sheet of the Geological Survey map has its printed text. It is a stupendous
undertaking that would involve many years' work, and the results of which
·when complete would fill many volumes. But it is worth doing; it would

furnish the material for an exact and trustworthy account of the geography of

Britain on any scale, and would be invaluable to the historian, as well as to others

dealing with subjects having any relation to the past and present geography of the
land. The librarian of the Society, Dr. H. R. Mill, has begun operations on a
limited area in Sussex. "When he has completed this initial memoir, it will be for

the Society to decide whether it can continue the enterprise, or whether it will

succeed in persuading the Government to take the matter up. I refer to work of

this kind mainly to indicate what, in my conception, are some of the problems of

the future which geography has to face, even in fully surveyed countries. Even

were the enterprise referred to carried out, there would be room enough for special

researches in particular districts.

But while there is an inexhaustible field in the future for geographical work in

the direction I have indicated, there is no doubt that much still remains to be done
in the way of exploring the unknown, or little known, regions of the globe. Let

us briefly refer to the problems remaining to be solved in this direction. Turning

to the continent of Asia, we find that immense progress has been made during the

--past sixty years. In the presidential address given sixty years ago, already

referred to, Mr. Hamilton says of Asia: ' "\Ve have only a very general kuow"-

ledge of the geographical character of the Burman, Chinese, and Japan empires

the innumerable islands of the latter are still, except occasionally, inaccessible to

European navigators. Geographers hardly venture on the most "loose description

of Tibet, Mongolia, or Chinese Tartary, Slam, and Cochin China.' Since then the

survey of India, one of the greatest enterprises undertaken by any State, has been

completed, and is being rapidly extended over Burma. But I need not remind you

in detail of the vast changes that have taken place in Asia during these years, and

the immense additions that have been made to our knowledge of its geography.

Exploring activity in Asia is not likely to cease, though it is not to be expected

that its Inhospitable centre will ever be so carefully mapped as have been the

mountains of Switzerland.

     The most important desiderata, so far as pioneer exploration in Asia is con-
cerned, may be said to be confined to two regions.' In Southern and Central

Arabia there are tracts which are entirely unexplored. It is probable that this

unexplored region is in the main a sandy desert. At the same time it is, in the

south at least, iringed by a border of mountains whose slopes are capable of rich

cultivation, and whose summits the late Mr. Theodore Bent found, on his last and

    ' For part of what follows with reference to Asia, I am indebted to a valuable
Memorandum on the subject drawn up by the late Mr. Ney Elias.

fatal journey, to be covered with snow. In exploration, as iu other directions, it

--is the unexpected that happens ; and if any traveller cared to face the difficulties

physical, pohtical, and religious which might be met with iu Southern and Central

Arabia, he might be able to tell the world a surprising story.

The other region iu Asia where real pioneer work still remains to be done is

Tibet and the mountainous districts bordering it on the north and east. Lines of

exploration have in recent years beeu run across Tibet by Russian explorers like

Prejevalsky, by Rockhill, Prince Henry of Orleans and Bonvalot, by Bower, Littledale,
Wellby, and Malcolm. From the results obtained by these explorers we have formed

a fair idea of this, the most extensive, the liighest, and the most inhospitable plateau

Ain the world.  few more lines run in well-selected directions would probablj-

supply geography with nearly all she wants to learn about such a region, though

more minute exploration would probably furnish interesting details as to its

geological history.

The region lying to the north of the Himalayan range and to the south of the

parallel of Lhasa is almost a blank on the map, and there is ample room here for

the enterprising pioneer. The forbidden city of Lhasa is at present the goal of
several adventurers, though as a matter of fact we cannot have much to learn in

addition to what has been revealed in the interesting narrative of the native Indian

traveller, Chandra Das. The magnificent mountain region on the north and east

of Tibet furnishes a splendid field for the enterprising explorer. Mrs. Bishop

recently approached it from the east, through Sze-chuen, and her description of the

romantic scenery and the interesting non-Mongolian inhabitants leaves us with

a strong desire to learn more. On the south-east of Tibet is the remarkable moun-

tEunous region, consisting of a series of lofty parallel chains, through which run

the upper waters of the Yangtse, the Mekong, the Salwin, and the Irawady. This

last-named river, recent exploration has shown, probably does not reacli far into

the range. But it will be seen by a glance at a map that the upper waters of the

other rivers are carried far into the heart of the mountains. But these upper river

courses are entirely conjectural and have given rise to much controversy. There
is plenty of work here for the explorer, though the difficulties, physical and

political, are great.

But besides these great unexplored regions, there are many blanks to be filled

up in other parts of Asia, and regions which, though known in a general wav,
would well repay careful examination. There is the mountain track between the

upper Zarafshan river and the middle course of the Sarkhab tributary of the Oxus,

and the country lying between that and the Oxus. There is the great Takla-

Makan desert in Chinese or Eastern Turkistan, part of which has recently been

explored by Russian expeditions and by that young and indefatigable Swedish

traveller. Dr. Sven Hedin. It is now one of the most forbidding deserts tn be

found anywhere, but it deserves careful examination, as there are evidences of its
once having been inhabited, and that at no veiy remote period. It is almost

surrounded by the Tarim, and on its eastern edge lies Lob-nor, the remarkable

changes in which have been the subject of recent investigation. As readers of

Dr. IS^anseu's ' Voyage of the Fram ' will remember, the Siberian Coast is most

imperfectly  mapped                                          of  course, it is a difficult task, but  it  is one to which
                                                          ;

the Russian Government ought to be equal. China has on paper the appear-

ance of being fairly well mapped ; but as a matter of fact our knowIed"-e of its

mountain ranges and of its great river courses is to a large extent extremely

vague. All this awaits careful survey. In North-eastern Manchuria and in many

parts of Mongolia there are still blanks to be filled up and mountain and river

--systems to be surveyed. In the Malay Peninsula and in the great array of islands

in the east and south-east of Asia Sumatra, Borneo, the Philippines inuch work
still remains to be done. Thus for the coming century there will be abundance
of work for explorers in Asia, and plenty of material to occupy the attention of

our geographical societies.

    Coming to the map of Africa, we find the most marvellous transformation

during the last sixty years, and mainly during the last forty years, dating from
Livingstone's memorable journey across the continent. Though the north of^Africu

was the home of one of the oldest civihsations, and though on the shores of the

Mediterranean, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans were at work for

centuries, it has only been within the memory of many of us that the centre of the

continent, from the Sahara to the confines of Cape Colony, has ceased to be an

unexplored blank. This blank has been filled up with bewildering rapidity. Great

rivers and lakes and mountains have been laid down in their main features, and the

whole continent, with a few unimportant exceptions, has been parcelled out among*

the Powers of Europe. But much still remains to be done ere we can form an

adequate conception of what is in some respects the most interesting and the most

intractable of the continents. Many curious problems still remain to be solved.

The pioneer work of exploration has  to  a  large  extent  been  accomplished                                                      lines
                                                                                                                                ;

have been run in all directions ; the main features have been blocked out. But

between these lines the broad meshes remain to be filled in, and to do this will

require many years of careful exploration. However, there still remain one or two>

regions that afford scope for the adventurous pioneer.

To the south of Abyssinia and to the west and north-west of Lake Rudolf, on

to the Upper Nile, is a region of considerable extent, which is still practically

unknown. Again, in the Western Sahara there is an extensive area, inhabited

mainly by the intractable Tuaregs, into which no one has been able to penetrate,

and of which our knowledge is extremely scanty. Even in the Central Sahara

there are great areas which have not been traversed, while in the Libyan desert

much remains to be done. These regions are of interest almost solely from the

geographical and geological standpoints. But they deserve careful investigation,

not only that we may ascertain their actual present condition, but in order, also,
that we may try to discover some clues to the past history of this interesting

continent. Still, it must be said that the great features of the continent have-

been so fully mapped during the last half century that what is required now is

mainly the filling-in of the details. This is a process that requires many hands

and special qualifications. All over the continent there are regions which will

repay special investigation. Quite recently an English traveller, Mr. Cowper,

found not far from the Tripoli coast miles of magnificent ruins and much to correct

on our maps. If only the obstructiveness of the Turkish officials could be over-

come, there is a rich harvest for anyone who will go to work with patience and

intelligence. Even the interior of Morocco, and especially the Atlas Mountains,

are but little known. The French, both in Tunis and Algeria, are extending our

knowledge southwards. All the Powers who have taken part in the scramble for

Africa are doing much to acquire a knowledge of their territories. Germany,

especially, deserves praise for the persistent zeal with which she has carried out

the exploration of her immense territories in East and West Africa. The men

she sends out are unusually well qualified for the work, capable not simply of

making a running survey as they proceed, and taking notes on country and

people, but of rendering a substantial account of the geology, the fauna, the flora,

and the economic conditions. Both in the French and the British spheres good

work is also being done, and the map of Africa being gradually filled up. But

what we especially want now are men of the type of Dr. J. W. Gregory, whose

book on the Great Rift Valley is one of the most valuable contributions to African

geography ever made. If men of this stamp would settle down in regions like
that of Mount Ruwenzori, or Lake Rudolf, or the region about Lakes Bangweolo

and Tanganyika, or in the Atlas, or in many other regions that could be named,

the gains to scientific geography, as well as to the economical interests of Africa,

would be great. An example of work of this kind is seen in the discoveries made

by a young biologist trained in geographical observation, Mr. Moore, on Lake

Tanganyika. There he found a fauna which seems to afford a key to the past history of

the centre of the continent, a fauna which, Mr. Moore maintains, is essentially of a salt-

water type. Mr. Moore, I believe, is inclined to maintain that the ancient connection

of this part of Africa with the ocean was not by the west, as Joseph Thomson surmised,

but by the north, through the  Great Rift Valley of Dr.  Gregory                                     and  he strongly
                                                                                                  ;

advocates the careful examination of Lake Rudolf as the crucial te.st of his theory.

It is to be hoped that he, or someone equally competent, will have an opportunity
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.      705

of caiTyiug out an investigation likely to provide results of the highest import-

ance.

     But there are other special problems connected with this, the most backward
and the most repellent of continents, which demand serious investigation, problems

essentially geographical. One of the most important of these, from the point of

view of the development of Africa, is the problem of acclimatisation. The matter

is of such prime importance that a committee of the Association has been at work

for some years collecting data as to the climate of Tropical Africa. In a general

way we know that that climate is hot and the rainfall scanty ; indeed, even the

geographers of the Ancient World believed that Central Africa was uninhabitable

on account of its heat. But science requires more than generalities, and therefore

we look forward to the exact results which are being collected by the Committee

Wereferred to with much hope.  can only go to work experimentally until we

kttow precisely what we have to deal with. It will help us greatly to solve the

problem of acclimatisation when we have the exact factors that go to constitute

the climate of Tropical Africa. At present there is no doubt that the weight of

--competent opinion that is, the opinion of those who have had actual experience

of African climate, and of those who have made a special study of the effects of

--that climate on the human constitution is that though white men, if they take

due precautions, may live and do certain kinds of work in Tropical Africa, it will

never be possible to colonise that part of the world with people from the temperate

rone. This is the lesson taught by generations of experience of Europeans in
India. So far, also, sad experience has shown that white people cannot hope to
settle in Central Africa as they have settled in Canada and the United States

and in Australia, and make it a nursery and a home for new generations.

Even in such favourable situations as Blantyre, a lofty region on the south of

Lake Nyasa, children cannot be reared beyond a certain age ; they must be sent

home to England, otherwise they will degenerate physically and morally. No

country can ever become the true home of a people if the children have to be sent
away to be reared. Still, it is true our experience in Africa is limited. It has

been maintained that it might be possible to adapt Europeans to Tropical Africa
by a gradual process of migration. Transplant Southern Europeans to North

Africa ; after a generation or two remove their progeny further south, and so on,

edging the succeeding generation further and further into the heart of the conti-

-- --nent. The experiment a long one it would be might be tried ; but it is to be

feared that the ultimate result would be a race deprived of all those characteristics

which have made Europe what it is. An able young Italian physician, Dr. Samboa,

has recently faced this important problem, and has not hesitated to come to con-

clusions quite opposed to those generally accepted. His position is that it has

taken us centuries in Europe to discover our hidden enemies, the microbes of the
various diseases to which Northern humanity is a prey, and to meet them and

coiiquer them. In Africa we have a totally different set of enemies to meet, from
lions and snakes down to the invisible organisms that produce those forms of
Hemalaria, anaemia, and other diseases characteristic of tropical countxies.

admits that these are more or less due to heat, to the nature of the soil, and other

tropical conditions, but that if once we knew their precise nature and modes of
working we should be in a position to meet them and conquer them. It may be

so, but this is a result that could only be reached after generations of experience

and investigation ; and even Dr. Sambon admits that the ultimate product of
European acclimatisation in Africa would be something quite different from the

European progenitors. What is wanted is a series of carefully-conducted experi-

ments. I have referred to the Blantyre highlands ; in British East Africa there

are plateaus of much greater altitude, and in other parts of Central Africa there
are large areas of 4,000 feet and over above sea-level. The world may become so
full that we may be forced to try to utilise these lofty tropical regions as homes for
white people when Canada and Australia and the United States become over-popu-

iated. As one of my predecessors in this chair (Mr. Ravenstein) tried to show at the

Leeds Meeting some years ago, the population of the world will have more than

doubled in a century, and about 180 years hence will have quadrupled. At any rate,

here is a proLlem of prime importance for the geographer of the coming century to

attack ; with so many energetic and intelligent white men all over Africa, it should

not be difficult to obtain the data which might help towards its solution.

     I have dwelt thus long on Africa, because it will really be one of the great

geographical problems of the coming century. Had it been as suitable as America

or Australia, we may be sure it would not have remained so long neglected and

despised by the European peoples as it has done. Unfortunately for Africa, just

as it had been circumnavigated, and just as Europeans were beginning to settle upon

its central portion and trying to make their way into the interior, Columbus and Cabot

discovered a new world, a world as well adapted as Europe for the energies of the

white races. That discovery postponed the legitimate development of Africa for

four centuries. Nothing could be more marked than the progress which America has

made since its re-discovery 400 years ago, and the stagnation of Africa which has

been known to Europe since long before the beginning of history. During these 400

years North America at least has been very thoroughly explored. The two great

nations which divide North America between them have their Government sui'veys,

which are rapidly mapping the whole continent and investigating its geology,

physical geography, and its natural resources. I need hardly tell an audience like

this of the admirable work done by the Survey of Canada under Sir William Logan,

Dr. Selwyn, and his successor, Dr. George Dawson ; nor should it be for-

gotten that under the Lands Department much excellent topographical work

has been carried out by Captain Deville and his predecessors. Still, though much

has been done, much remains to be done. There are large areas which have not as

yet even been roughly mapped. "Within quite recent years we have had new regions

opened up to us by the work of Dawson and Ogilvie on the Yukon, by Dr. Bell in the

region to the south of Hudson's Bay, by the brothers Tyrrell in the Barren Lands on

the west of the same bay, by O'Sullivan beyond the sources of the Ottawa, and by

Low in Labrador. But it is not so long since that Dr. Dawson, in reviewing what

remains to be done in the Dominion in the way of even pioneer exploration, pointed

out that something like a million square miles still remained to be mapped. Apart

from the uninhabitable regions in the north, there are, as Dr. Dawson pointed out,

considerable areas which might be turned to profitable agricultural and mining

account of which we know little, such areas as these which have been recently

mapped on the south of Hudson's Bay by Dr. Bell, and beyond the Ottawa by

.Mr. O'Sullivan. Although the Eastern and the Western Provinces have been

very fully surveyed, there is a considerable area between the two lying between

Lake Superior and Hudson's Bay which seems to have been so far almost

Auntouched.  very great deal has been done for the survey of the i-'wera and lakes

of Canada. I need hardly say that in Canada, as elsewhere in America, there

--is ample scope for the study of many problems in physical geography past and

present glaciation and the work of glaciers, the origua and regime of lake basins,

the erosion of river-beds, the oscillation of coast-lines. Happily, both in Canada

and the United States there are many men competent and eager to work out pro-

blems of this class, and in the Reports of the various surveys, the Transactions of

American learned Societies, in scientific periodicals, in separate publications, a

wealth of data has already been accumulated of immense value to the geographer.

Every geologist and geographer knows the important work which has been

accomplished by the various surveys of the United States, as well as by the various

State Surveys. ' The United States Coast Survey has been at work for more than
half a century, mapping not only the coast but all the navigable rivers. The Lake

Survey has been doing a similar service for the shores of the great lakes of North

America. But it is the work of the Geological Survey which is best known to

--geographers a survey which is really topographical as well as geological, and

which, under such men as Hayden, King, and Powell, has produced a series of

magnificent maps, diagrams and memoirs, of the highest scientific value and in-

terest. Recently this survey has been placed on a more systematic basis ; so that

now a scheme for the topographical survey of the whole of the territory of the

United States is being carried out. Extensive areas in various parts of the States

have been already surve5"ed on different scales. It is to be hoped that in the future,
                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  707

as in the past, tlie able men who are employed on this survey work will have oppor-

tunities of working out the physiography of particular districts, the past and present

geography of which is of advancing scientitic interest. Of the complete exploration

and mapping of the North American continent we need have no apprehension ; it

is only a question of time, and it is to be hoped that neither of the Governments

responsible will allow political exigencies to interfere with what is really a work

of national importance.

It is when we come to Central and South America that we find ample room

for the unofficial explorer.' In Mexico and the Central American States

there are considerable areas of which we have little or only the vaguest knowledge.
Jn South America there is really more room now for the pioneer explorer than

there is in Central Africa. In recent years the Argentine Republic has shown a

laudable zeal in exploring and mapping its immense territories, while a certain

amount of good work has also been done by Brazil and Chili. Most of our

knowledge of South America is due to the enterprise of European and North

American explorers. Along the great river courses our knowledge is fairly satis-

factory, but the immense areas, often densely clad with forests, lying between the

rivers are almost entirely unknown. In Patagonia, though a good deal has re-

cently been done by the Argentine Government, still in the country between Punta

Arenas and the Rio Negro, we have much to learn ; while on the west coast range

with its innumerable ijord-like inlets, its islands and peninsulas, there is a fine

field for the geologist and physical geographer. Indeed, throughout the whole

range of the Andes systematic exploration is wanted, exploration of the character

of the excellent work accomplished by AYhymper in the region around Chimborazo

There is an enormous area lying to the east of the Northern Andes, and including

tlieir eastern slopes, embracing the eastern half of Ecuador and Colombia, Southern

"\'enezuela, and much of the country lying between that and Northern Bolivia,

including many of the upper tributaries of the Amazon and Orinoko, of which our

knowledge is of the scantiest. Even the country lying between the Rio Negro

and the Atlantic is but little known. There are other great areas, in Brazil and

in the Northern Chaco, which have only been partially described, such as the

region whence the streams forming the Tapajos and the Paraguay take their rise,

Ain Mato Grosso.  survey and detailed geographical and topographical descrip-

tion of the whole basin of Lake Titicaca is a desideratum. In short, in South

America there is a wider and richer field for exploration than in any other con-

tinent. But no mere rush through these little-known regions will suffice. The

explorer must be able not only to use his sextant and his theodolite, his compass,

and his chronometer. Any expeditions entering these regions ought to be able to

bring back satisfactory information on the geology of the country traversed, and

of its fainia and flora, past and present ; already the revelations which have been
made of the past geography of South America, and of the life that flourished there

in former epochs, are of the highest interest. Moreover, we have here the remains

of extinct civilisations to deal with, and although much has been done in this
direction, much remains to be done, and in the extensive region already referred

to, the physique, the traditions, and the customs of the natives will repay careful

investigation.

    The southern continent of Australia is in the hands of men of the same origin as
those who have developed to such a wonderful extent the resources of Canada and

the United States, and therefore we look for equally satisfactory results so far as

the characteristics of that contiuent permit. The five colonies which divide among
them the three million square miles of the continent have each of them efficient
Government surveys, which are rapidly mapping their features and investigating

their geology. But Australia has a trying economic problem to solve. In none

of the Colonies is the water-supply quite adequate ; in all are stretches of desert

country of greater or less extent. The centre and western half of the continent is
covered by a desert more waterless and more repellent than even the Sahara ; so

    ' I am indebted for much of the information relative to South America to a
valuable Memorandum by Sir Clements R. Markham and Colonel G. E. Church.

far as our present knowledge goes one-third of the continent is uninhabitable.
This desert area has been crossed by explorers, at the expense of great sufferings,
in various directions, each with the same dreary tale of almost featureless sandy
desert, covered here and there with Spinifex and scrub, worse than useless. There
are hundreds of thousands of square miles still unknown, but there is no reason to
believe that these areas possess any features that differ essentially from those
Vfhich have been found along the routes that have been explored. There have
been one or two well-equipped scientific expeditions in recent years that have col-
lected valuable data with regard to the physical characteristics, the geology and
biology of the continent ; and it is in this direction that geography should look

for the richest results in the future. There remains much to be done before we

can arrive at satisfactory conclusions as to the physical history of what is in some
respects the most remarkable land area on the globe. Though the surface water

supply is so scanty there is reason to believe that underneath the surface there
is an immense store of water. In one or two places in Australia, especially in

Western Queensland, and in New South Wales, this supply has been tapped with

satisfactory results ; millions of gallons a day have been obtained by sinking wells.
Whether irrigation can ever be introduced on an extensive scale into Australia
depends upon the extent and accessibility of the underground water-supply, and

that is one of the geographical problems of the future in Australia. New Zealand

has been fairly well surveyed, though a good deal remains to be done before
its magnificent mountain and glacier system is completely known. In the great

island of New Guinea both the British and the Germansare opening up the interiors

of their territories to our knowledge, but the western and much larger portion of

the island presents a large field for any explorer -who cares to venture into its

interior.

The marvellous .success which has attended Dr. Nansen's daring adventure into

tbe Arctic seas has revived a widespread interest in Polar exploration. Nansen

--may be said to have almost solved the North Polar problem so far, at least, as

the Old World side of the Pole is concerned. That some one will reach the Pole

at no distant date is certain ; Nansen has shown the way, and the legitimate

curiosity of humanity will not rest satisfied till the goal be reached. But Arctic

exploration does not end with the attainment of the Pole, Europe has done her

share on her own side of the Pole ; what about the side which forms the Hinter-

land of North America, and specially of Canada ? To the north of Europe and

Asia we have the scattered groups of islands Spitsbergen, Franz Josef Land,

Novaya Zemlya, and the New Siberian Islands. To the north of America we have

an immense archipelago, the actual extent of which is unknown. Nansen and

other Arctic authorities maintain that the next thing to be done is to complete

exploration on the American side, to attempt to do for that half of the North

Polar region what Nansen has done for the other half. It may be that the

islands which fringe the northern shores of the New World are continued far to

the north ; if so they would form convenient stages for the work of a well-equipped

expedition. It may be that they do not go much farther than we find them on

our maps. Whatever be the case it is important, in the interests of science, that

this section of the Polar area be examined ; that as high a latitude as possible be

attained ; that soundings be made to discover whether the deep ocean extends all

round the Pole. It is stated that the gallant Lieutenant Peary has organised

a scheme of exploring this area which would take several years to accomplish.

Let us hope that he will be able to carry out his scheme. Meantime, should

Canada look on with indifference ? She has attained the standing of a great and

prosperous nation. She has shown the most commendable zeal in the exploration

of her own immense territory. She has her educational, scientific, and literary

institutions  which  will  compare  favourably  with  those  of other  countries                                              her
                                                                                                                           ;

Press is of a high order, and she has made the beginnings of a literature and au art

of her own. In these respects she is walking in the steps of the Mother Country.

But has Canada not reached a stage when she is in a position to follow tht^
maternal example still further .^ What has more contributed to render the name

of Great Britain illustrious than those great enterprises which for centuries she
lias sent out from her own shores, not a few of them solely in the interests of
science? Such enterprises elevate a nation and form its glory and its pride.
Surely Canada has ambitions beyond mere material prosperity, and what better

beginning conld be made than the equipment of an expedition for the exploration
of the seas that lie between her and the Pole ? I venture to throw out these
suggestions for the consideration of those who have at heart the honour and

glory of the great Canadian Dominion.
     Not only has an interest in Arctic exploration been revived, but in Europe at

least an even greater interest has grown up in the exploration of the region around

the opposite pole of the earth of which our knowledge is so scanty. Since

Sir James C. Boss's expedition, which was sent out in the year 1839, almost
Wenothing has been done for Antarctic research.
                                                   have here to deal with

conditions difiFerent from those which surround the North Pole. Instead of an

almost landless ocean, it is believed by those who have given special attention

to the subject that a continent about the size of Australia covers the south

polar region. But we don't know for certain, and surely, in the interests of our

science, it is time we had a fairly adequate idea of what are the real conditions.

We want to know what is the extent of that land, what are its glacial conditions,

what is the character of its geology, what evidence exists as to its physical and
Webiological conditions in past ages ?
                                        know there is one lofty, active volcano

are there any others ? Moreover, the science of terrestrial magnetism is seriously

impeded in its progress because the data in this department from the Antarctic are

so scanty. The seas around this continent require to be investigated both as to

Wetheir depth, their temperature, and their life.  have here, in short, the most

extensive unexplored area on the surface of the globe. For the last three or

four years the Royal Geographical Society, backed by other British societies, have

been attempting to move the Home Government to eqtiip an adequate expedition to

complete the work begun by Ross sixty years ago, and to supplement the great work of

the ' Challenger.' But though sympathy has been expressed for Antarctic exploration,

and though vague promises have been given of support, the Government is afraid

to enter upon an enterprise which might involve the services of a few naval officers

Weand men.  need not criticise this attitude. But the Royal Geographical

Society has determined not to let the matter rest here. It is now seeking to

obtain the support of public-spirited men for an Antarctic expedition under its

own auspices. It is felt that Antarctic exploration is peculiarly the work of

England, and that if an expedition is undertaken, it will receive substantial support

from the great Australasian Colonies, which have so much to gain from a know-

ledge of the physical condition of a region lying at their own doors, and probably

having a serious influence on their climatological conditions. Here, then, is one of

the greatest geographical problems of the future, the solution of which should be

entered upon without further delay. It may be mentioned that a small and well-

equipped Belgian expedition has already started, mainly to carry out deep-sea

research around the South Polar area, and that strenuous efforts are being made in

Germany to obtain the funds for an expedition on a much larger scale.

But our science has to deal not only with the lands of  the globe                                               its  sphere  is
                                                                                                             ;

the whole of the surface of the earth, and all that is thereon, so far at least as dis-

tribution is concerned. The department of Oceanography is a comparatively new

creation ; indeed, it may be said to have come definitely into being with the famous

voj'age of the ' Challenger.' There had been expeditions for ocean investigation

before that, but on a very limited scale. It has only been through the results obtained

by the ' Challenger,' supplemented by those of expeditions that have examined more

limited areas, that we have been able to obtain an approximate conception of the

--conditions which prevail throughout the various ocean depths conditions of move-
Wement, of temperature, of salinity, of life.
                                               have only a general idea of the

contours of the ocean-bed, and of the composition of the sediment which covers

that bed. The extent of the knowledge thus acquired maybe gauged from the fact

--that it occupies a considerable space in the fifty quarto volumes the ' Challenger
--Publications ' which it took Dr. John Murray twenty years to bring out. But

that great imdertakiiig lias only, as it were, laid down the general features of tlu'

oceanic world. There is plenty of room for further research in this direction. Our

own surveying ships, which are constantly at work all over the world, do a certain

amount of oceanic work, apart from mere surveying of coasts, and islands, and

shoals. In 1895 one of these found in the South Pacific soundings deeper by .50U

fathoms than the deepest on record, that found twenty years earlier by the

* Tuscarora ' to the north-east of Japan. The deepest of these new soundings was

5,155 fathoms. In the interests of science, as well as of cable-laying, it is

desirable that our surveying ships should be encouraged to carry out work of tbis

kind more systematically than they do at present. This could siu'ely be arranged

We.without interfering with their regular work.  want many more observations

than we now have, not only on ocean depths, but on the nature of the ocean-bed,

before we can have a satisfactory map of this hidden portion of the earth's surface,

and form satisfactory conclusions as to the past relations of the ocean-bed with

what is now dry land. I believe the position maintained by geologists, that from

the remote period when the great folds of the earth were formed the present

relations between the great laud-masses and the great oceans have been essentially

the same ; that there have no doubt been great changes, but that these have been

within such limits as not to materially affect their relations as a whole. This is a

problem which further oceanic research would go a long way to elucidate. That

striking changes are going on at the present day, and have been going on within

the human period, cannot be doubted. Some coast-lines are rising ; others are

falling. Professor John Milne, our great authority on Seismology, has collected

an extremely interesting series of data, as to the curious changes that have taken

place in the ocean-bed since telegraphic cables have been laid down. The

frequent breakages of cables have led to the examination of the sub-oceanic

ground on which they have been laid, and it is found that slides and sinkings

have occurred, in some cases amounting to hundreds of fathoms. These, it is im-

portant to note, are on the slopes of the Continental Margin, or, as it is called, the

Continental Shelf, as, for example, off the coast of Chili. It is there, where the

earth's crust is pecuUarly in a state of unstable equiUbrium, that we might expect

to find such movements; and therefore soundings along the Continental Margins,

at intervals of say five years, might furnish science with data that might be turned

to good account.

As an example of what may be doite by a single individual to elucidate the

present and past, relations between land and sea, may I refer to an able paper in

the ' Geographical Journal ' of Maj', 1897, by Mr. T. P. Gulliver, a pupil of Professor

Davis, of Harvard, himself one of the foremost of our scientific geographers ? Mr.

Gulliver has made a special study on the spot, and with the help of good topo-

graphical and geological maps, of Dungeness Foreland on the south-east coast of

Kent, Mr. Gulliver takes this for his subject, and works out with great care the his-

tory of the changing coast-line here, and in connection with that the origin and

changes of the English Channel. This is the kind of work that well-trained geo-

graphical students might imdertake. It is work to be encouraged, not only for

the results to be obtained, but as one species of practical geographical training in

the field, and as a reply to those who maintain that geography is mere book- work,

and has no problems to solve. Professor Davis himself has given an example of

similar practical work in his elaborate paper on ' The Development of Certain

English Rivers ' in the ' Geographical Journal ' for February, 1895 (vol. v. p. 127),

and in many other publications.

Another important problem to attack, and that in the near future, is that of

Oceanic Islands. I say in the near future, because it is to be feared that very

few islands now remain unmodified by contact with Europeans. Not only have

the natives been affected, both in physique and in customs, but the introduction of

European plants and animals has to a greater or less extent modified the native

fauna and flora. Dr. John Murray, of the ' Challenger,' has set a good example in
this direction by sending a young official from the Natural History Museum

to Christmas Island, in the Indian Ocean, one of the few untouched islands
TKANSACTIOXS OF SECTION E.  711

that remain, lying far away from any otlier land, to ilie suutli-east of the

Reelings.

    What islands are to the ocean, lakes are to the land. It is only recently that

these interesting geographical features have received the attention they deserve.
Dr. Murray has for some time been engaged in investigating the physical con-

ditions of some of the remarkable lakes in the West of Scotland. Some three

years ago my friend and colleague Dr. Mill carried out a very careful survey of the

English lakes, under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society. His sound-
ings, his observatious of the lake conditions, of the features on the margins of and

around the lakes, when combined with the investigati<in of the r(5gime of the rivers
and the physical geography of the surrounding country, conducted by such accom-

plished geologists as INIr. Marr, afford the materials for an extremely interesting

study in the geographical history of the district. On the Continent, again, men

like Professor Penck, of A'ienna, have been giving special attention to lakes, that

accomplished geographer's monograph on Lake Constance, based on the work of
the five States bordering its .shores, being a model -work of its kind. But the

father of Limnology, as this branch of geography is called, is undoubtedly Pro-

fessor Forel, of Geneva, who for many years has been investigating the conditions
of that classical lake, and who is now publishing the results of his research. Dr.

Forel's paper on ' Limnology : a Branch of Geography,' and the discussion which
follows in the Eeport of the last International Geographical Congress, affords a
very fair idea in short space of the kind of work to be done by this branch of the
science. In France, again, M. Delebecque is devoting himself to a similar line
of research ; in Germany tile, Halbfass, and others ; Eichter in Austria, and the

Balaton Commission in Hungary. I may also here refer appropriately to Mr.

Israel C. Russell's able work, published in Boston in 1895, on 'The Lakes of
North America,' in which the author uses these lakes as a text for a discourse on
the origin of lake basins and the part played by lakes in the changes studied by
dynamic geolog}-. One of the best examples of an exhaustive study of a lake basin
will be found in the magnificent monograph on Lake Bonneville, by Mr. G. K.
Gilbert, and that on Lake Lahontan by Mr. Israel Cook Russell, published by the
United States Geological Survey ; the former is indeed a complete history of the
great basin, the largest of the interior drainage areas of the North American
continent. In the publications of the various Surveys of the United States as
well as in the official reports of the Canadian Lake Surveys, a vast amount of

material exists for any one interested in the study of lakes; in addition, the
elaborate special Reports on the great lakes by the Hydrographic Department.

Indeed, North America presents an exceptionally favourable field for limnological
investigation ; if carried out on a systematic method the results could not but be

of great scientific interest.
      Rivers are of not less geographical interest than lakes, and these have also

recently been the subject of special investigation by physical geographers. I have
already referred to Professor Davis's study of a special English river system. The
work in the English Lake District by Mr. Marr, spoken of in connection with
Dr. Mill's investigations, was mainly on the hydrology of the region. Both in
Germany and in Russia special attention is being given to this subject, while in
 America there is an enormous literature on the Mississippi alone, mainly, no doubt,
from the practical standpoint, while the result of much valuable work on the

 St. Lawrence is buried in Canadian official publications.

    But time does not admit of my going farther. I might have pointed out the

wide and vastly interesting field presented by what the Germans call Anthropo-

 geography, dealing with the interrelations between humanity and its geographical

environment. Geography, Mr. Mackinder has said, is the physical basis of history;

it is, indeed, the physical basis of all human activity, and from that standpoint

the field for geographical research is unbounded. But I can only hint at this. I
have endeavoured to indicate what are some of the leading geographical problems

of the future, first in order to show at this somewhat critical epoch how very
much yet remains to be done, how many important lines of inquiry are open to the
    712 REPORT-- 1897.

    geographical student, and that the possibilities of our science- are, lilce those- of

    Myother departments of research, inexhaustible.   aim has also been to indicate

    by actual examples what, in the conception of British geographers at least, is the
Wefield of our subject.
                         need not trouble greatly about any precise definition so

long as there is such a choice of work for the energies of the geographer. I trust

I have been, to some extent at least, successful in the double obiect which I have

had in view in this opening address in a country which presents so splendid a field

to the practical geographer.

    The following Papers and Report were read r

1. Kafiristan and the Kafirs. By Sir George Scott Robetrtson, K. C.S.I.

    The paper began with general remarks upon the geogi-aphical position of

Kafiristan--the origin of the name, which means the Land of the Infidel ^.)ar e.r-

cellence, according to Muhammedan conceptions. Attention was then drawn to the

dissimilarity this country bears to India in climate, vegetation, and in phvsical

characteristics. Kafiristan was described as a highland region with a fairh:

equable temperature, in spite of great summer heat and heavy snowfall accompanied

by severe cold in the winter. It is made up of an intricate network of mountain

spurs and ridges, without roads, unless hillside tracks, impassable for horses, and

even for dogs lu many places, may be so termed. The limited cultivable area is

fairly productive. The scenery varies from tiny sloping fields and orchards, from

luxurious tangles of wild vines and pomegranates to magnificent pine forests,

according to altitude, but invariably includes a large view of profitless hillside and

rock. Some of the higher elevations, where villages are to be found, are strangely

bleak and inhospitable, and the people have a hard struggle to live. Of the inhabit-
ants many interesting details were given, while their manaers and habits were

illustrated by a numerous series of lantern slides, made from photographs and

drawings. In feature the Kafirs are distinctly Aryan. They seem to be brave

after the fashion of the North American Iiadians, shunning for the most part

the open combat, and relying chiefly upon ambushes, night attacks, and surprises.
Of course the poorness of their weapons compels these modes of warfare. For

the rest, their cupidity, jealousy of one another, and proneness to quarrel make
them diflrcult folk to live amongst. Their political organisation is feeble, each,

valley being the home of a particular tribe, and sometimes of more than one.
Many diflerent languages and dialects are spoken, and internecine strife was rarelv

intermitted. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Amir of Kabul made an easv

conquest of Kafiristan as soon as the disturbances all along the border in 1890

AVbid!;ui"l?           strong enough to fight  for a  balance of power   against  the redoubtable
              R'^a^htm^an. Although no one     could  say whether the
                                                                        Afghan    conquest would

be permanent or not, it seemed fairly certain that the Kafir change of religion from

paganism to Islam, which has now been enforced, would remain. The alteration

could not be for the worse. On the other hand the position and morals of the
women, both deplorable, would be improved, the traflic in children as slaves would

cease, the endless bloodshed on this frontier might be stopped. Nevertheless the

old wild, picturesque lile of the Kafirs, terrible and cruel as it was in many respects,
was full of the elements of romance. It gave forth, at times, bright instances of

bravery, devotion, and personal sacrifice. No one could reflect, without sorrow,

on the substitution of self-righteousness, spiritual pride, and austerity, too often

hypocritical, for an ancient faith which, degraded as it was, taught its votaries to
be masterful and free.

                          By E. Delmar Morgan, F.R.C.S.

in  /1(8?9o5k"a^n  paper recent Russian investigations in Novaia Zemlia  are summarised.
                   expedition commanded by M. Cheruyshefi" visited this  island continent
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  1-1 o

and passed two months in the southern island, crossing it for the first time from

west to east.
     The views of von ]^)aer and other earlier explorers that Novaia Zemlia is

geologically connected with the Pai-hoi are correct only as regards the southern
part and Yaigats ; the northern part of the southern island, including hoth sides of
Matotchkin Strait, show a north-westerly strike of the strata, therefore conform-

able, not with the Pai-hoi, but with the Ural.
     The folding process in Novaia Zemlia coincided with the Palaeozoic epoch, and

from that time denudation forces have been at work. In this way the system of

cross valleys has been developed and the well-known ^latotchkin shar formed.
     The glacial period in Europe was contemporaneous with that of Novaia Zemlia.

This was followed by its submergence beneath the ocean, together with vast tracts
of Northern Europe, Asia, and America. This submergence reduced the extent of
the glaciers in the north or mountainous region, entii-ely obliterating them in the
south, while the formation of deltas dates from the same period.

    Novaia Zemlia is now undergoing a new process of glaciation, which will

convert it into an icy wilderness.

      4. Sea Temj^eratures Nortli of Spitsbergen. By B. Leigh Smith.

    The author in his schooner yacht ' Samson ' left Grimsby on May 16, 1871, with
the object of following the Gulf Stream northward. On June 15 he left Tromsci,

landed on Bear Island on the 30th, and cruised along the west and north coasts of
Spitsbergen, until the middle of September. In 1872 and 1873 these expeditions
were repeated, and numerous observations of temperature were made by means of
a Miller-Casella thermometer. The result was to prove for the first time the

undoubted existence of warm water beneath the cold surface layer. These facts,
although communicated to ' Petermann's Mitteilungen ' and to Professor Mohn by

the author's Norwegian sailing master, have not until this year been published
by him.

                               FRIDAY, AUGUST 20.

   --The following Papers and Report were read:

1. Scientific Gaography for Schools. By Richard E. Dodge, Professor of

                 Geography, Teachers' College, Neiv York City, U.S.A.

     This paper is a plea for the assistance of g-eographers in the improvement of
geography teaching in America, and particularly the United States. It open^;
with a general statement of the present condition of geography teaching and of
the lines of weakness. The aim of geography teaching being to make the pupils
able to gain geographic information for themselves as well as to train their minds

<ind store them with useful facts, the question arises as to how this aim is to he
secured. The writer pleads for scientitic geography based on a knowledge of the
home conditions. He urges that problems in geography be early introduced in
the school work, that the pupils may be trained, not only in observation and
inference, but in the proving of their inferences. He describes the work in

geography done by pupils of eight and nine years of age at the Teachers' College,

New York City, the work being carried on by teachers not speciallj' trained in

geography.
     In no study can scientific training be introduced as early as in geography, and

the value is inestimable. The need of the improvement is very apparent, and
scientific men should aid in the work. "

     Assistance can be given by publications of such a character and in such a place

that the teachers may come in contact with them and gain from them. There is

great need of lectures, and excursions for teachers under the care of scientific

geographers. Geographical appliances are in many cases poor and scanty. The

.aid of the scientitic geographer is needed in carrying out and elaborating in other
parts of the world the excellent plan of the Geographical Association of Great

Britain.

     There is also a great need of more publications showing the relation of geography
to history and culture, such publications being particularly applied to the needs of

teachers.

     In these and other ways scientific men can, if they will, assist the teachers to a
great extent. The writer urges the co-operation of all iu this important work.

      3. Forestry in India. By Lieut.-Col. Fred. Bailey, late R.E.

     In early times the greater part of India was covered with forest, but the land
not cleared for cultivation was, for the most part, denuded by over-cutting and
over-grazing with burning. If denudation has not afl'ected the climate gene-
rall}-, it has without doubt resulted in the drying up of .springs and streams
rising within the areas deprived of the shelter of a crop of trees; and this is a
serious matter in connection with the question of irrigation by canals led from
rivers which are not snow-fed, as well as in localities where damage has resulted
Jrom the formation of ravines and torrents. The permanence of the supply of
timber and other forest produce for the use of the native population and for State

purposes has also been endangered.

    When the Government wished to take action its powei's were found to he

uncertain, for the destructive usages of the people had come to be regarded as
inalienable rights ; and it was necessary to pass a special Forest Law, which, among

other things, provided for the formation of reserved forests, after a full inquiry

had been made into claims, and for the regulation of proved rights within limit.'=
which would not endanger the permanent maintenance of the forests. The work
of ' settlement ' is now approaching completion in several provinces.
           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                    715

     In order to secure the forests from over-fellino:, aud to ensure that all

work done may tend towards the production of the larg-est quantity of wood of

the kind most desired, working plans are a necessity; and considerable progress
has been made in their preparation. During the drj^- weather the forests l^ecome
extremely inflammable, aud vast areas have been annually burnt over from time
immemorial, with the result that the crop is reduced to the poorest possible
condition, or enth'ely destroyed. Measures have been taken to meet this great

evil, and large areas are now successfally protected.
     The controlUng staff' of the Forest Department is trained in England, but the

candidates follow a course of practical instruction in Continental State forests.

The native executive officers are trained at the Imperial Forest School at Dehra
Dun.

    What has been done could not have been accomplished by private enterprise.

The Government has set an example which has been followed by several of the

more important Native States. Much more remains to be done, but forest con-

servancy in India has reached a stage at which its steady progress cannot be

arrested.

           4. A Scheme of Geogra2)hical Classification.
           By Hugh Egbert Mill, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

A classification of any branch of knowledge is necessary for the purpose of

recording the several contributions of specialists, and the following scheme of

geogTaphical classification has been worked out practically during the elaboration

of a subject catalogue of geographical literature. The essential primary' division

is into general and special geography. The former, which might equally well be

termed pure or abstract geography, includes all general considerations which do not

depend upon particidar places; the latter reduces itself to an index of positions.

It would be served most completely by employing latitudes and longitudes ; but

practically political subdivisions must be used.

The first principle in the classification of each great division is to group together

facts of approximately the same order ; thus, e.g., we might take the continent as the

first order of classification in the second division, the country as the second, and

the province and county as the third and fourth. It would be fatal to the logical

completeness of any scheme to mix up the three orders in one category. The

number of orders to be adopted would depend to some extent on the detail

Arequired, but practically four would suffice, and in many cases three.  con-

venient notation would facilitate classification, and one is suggested in the paper

whereby the various orders are distinguished by letters of diflerent type and by

numerals.

        5. On the Distribution of Detritus by the Sea.
       By Vaughan Cornish, M.Sc, F.R.G.S., F.C.S.

The object of this investigation is to explain the processes which distribute the

detritus that enters the sea at its margin. The processes can be deduced from the
observed mode of occurrence of terrigenous materials on the foreshore and on the

sea bottom, from the mode of occurrence of the rocks, from the motions of sea

water, from the circumstances of attrition, from the behaviour of dust, and from'

the motions of individual pebbles and grains of sand.

The author deals in considerable detail with the motions of water due to tides

and waves, and the transporting effects of these motions.

It is shown that the transport of fine mud downhill from the coast seawards is

not due to the action of gravity.

Shoals and beaches (persisting structures of changing material) are dealt with

in a manner similar to that employed by the author in the study of sand dunes

(' Geographical Journal,' March 1897).

It is shown that the usual reasoning from the behaviour of individual pebbles-

and sand grains to the behaviour of beaches is vitiated by the neglect to take

account of the fact that the variation in the proportion of the ingredients greatly

exceeds the variation in the mobility of the individuals.

The paper, which will appear in e.vtenso in the 'Geographical Journal,' com-

prises the following: heads : viz.. The Motions of the Sea, Mud Flats of the Deep

Sea, The Sifting of Sand from Shingle, The Formation of a Shingle Beach, The-

Origin of the Ridge and Furrow Structure of a Shingle Ness, The Grading of

Beach Material (under which heading the case of the Chesil Beach is discussed},

Sandy  Beaches,  The  Origin  of the  ' Low                                      and  ' Ball '  of  a  Sandy  Shore,  The

                 6. On certain Submarine Geolorjical Changes.
                         By John Milne, F.R.S., F.G.S.

     This communication was largely an epitome of a lengthy paper on ' Suboceanic
Changes' published in the July and August numbers of the 'Geographical
Journal.' To this, however, a few new but important observations were

added.

    The author pointed out that the general result of denudation on the land was
to bring materials to a lower level, and by gradually wearing away excrescences
like mountain heights to render such forms more stable. Beneath the sea these

materials are accumulated in slopes, which, being formed largely under the

influence of gravity, are unstable. As the deposits grow, from time to time facial
slidings take place from weight alone, and from the escape of fresh water from
subterranean springs. The most important cause of submarine landslides are the
TItANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.  717

shakings accompanying submarine earthquakes, these disturhances resulting in

«ffects at least equal to, but probably greater than, those we see produced upon the
land. Observations conducted over many years have shown that earthquakes,

which are announcements that adjustments in strain or isostasy of rock masses are

in progress, are much more frequent along the submerged slopes of the con-

tinental plateau than they are on land, which leads to the conclusion that the
districts of greatest secular movements on the surface of our planet are to be found
beneath the ocean. The best evidence for these facts is furnished by submarine

cables.

      Besides interruptions due to waves, the borings of teredo, and other operations

in shallow water, we have a class of interruptions at comparatively great depths,

in some instances exceeding 2,000 fathoms. In almost all these instances, which

·do not occur in the flat plains of ocean beds, but along the edge of submarine
banks and the edges of the submerged continental frontier, the cables are
apparently buried by the sliding downwards of large bodies of materials from

kigher levels. The result of this is that it has often happened that two or three
cables, 10 or 15 miles apart, have been destroyed simultaneously. Many examples
were given where an earthquake, more or less severe, has been felt on land, and
at the same moment a cable has been broken. In some instances when this has
·occurred, an impulse has been given which has thrown an ocean like the Pacific
iuto a state of agitation for a period of one or two days.

    When these submarine disturbances have been great the resultant earth

movement has been such that, with suitable instruments, it might be recorded at
any point upon the surface of the globe.

      The most remarkable observations connected with submarine earthquakes are,
however, those which have resulted in changes of depth up to at least 200 fathoms
over considerable areas. To study these submarine dislocations, and to determine
whether cables have been interrupted by artificial operations such as accompany
war, or by natural means, horizontal pendulums which will record the unfelt
movements of the earth's crust should be established round the shores of all our
continents and on oceanic islands. The importance of these observations to our
colonies must be apparent.

      Another set of phenomena which promise to throw light upon the fluctuations
in the enormous strains within the rocky envelope of our planet, which sometimes
culminate in fractures, 100 or more miles in length, are the records of magneto-
meters. The effect of torsional and other strains on the magnetic conditions of

iron and nickel is well known, and it may reasonably be supposed that kindred
eff'ects may be induced by strain in rock-masses. At all events, at three magnetic

stations on the coast of Japan, commencing in one case a week, and in another
about two weeks, before the great earthquakes of 1896 in that country, the instru-
ments showed marked but abnormal movements, these being greatest at the

station nearest to the seismic foci. They reached a maximum some hours before

the shocks took place, after which unusual displacements ceased.

     Should future observations confirm that which is here noted, we shall then

have at our disposal another method of gaining information of changes in opera-
tions, the scene of which is hidden from our view not only by the oceans but by
the solid rock.

            7. The Congo and the Cape of Good Hope, 1482 to 1488.

                                £y E. G. Ravenstein.

     The discovery of the Congo and of the Cape of Good Hope constitutes two of
the most interesting episodes in the history of geographical exploration. Apart
from the legends on Behaim's globe, which must be accepted with caution, not a
single original report by one of those who took part in these voyages has reached

us, and hence the information given even in the best accredited histories of geo-
graphical exploration is erroneous in several important particulars. Recently,
however, the inscriptions upon some of the columns set up by the early Portuguese
navigators have been deciphered ; several ancient manuscript maps have become
718 REPORT--1897.

 available, and even one or .two contemporary documents bearing upon tbe subject
 have seen the light. This enables us to give a more trustworthy account of these

 early voyages.

    When King Alfonso died in 1481 the whole of the western coast of Africa, as

far as Cape Catherine, had been discovered. King John, his successor, entered
heart and soul into the business of exploration so successfully carried on by his
 ancestors. In 1483 (and not 1484) he despatched Diogo Cao on his first voyage,
 which led to the discovery of the Congo and of the coast to the south of that river
 as far as lat. 13° 27' S. After his return, on April 14, 1484, the explorer wa.^
knighted, and figures of the two columns which he had erected were introduced

into the coat of arms which was granted him. He set out again almost imme-

 diately, and succeeded in revealing the coast as far as Cape Cross in lat. 21° 53' S.
 If a legend on Germano's old chart can be trusted, he never returned from this
expedition, but died near the last column erected by him. Martin Behaim claims
to have commanded one of the ships of this expedition ; and although it is possible
that he was a member of it, he certainly did not play the important part as captain
or ' cosmographer ' which he claimed. His reputation is based upon a globe the
manufacture of which he superintended at the request of the town council of his
native town, Nurnberg (14U2), and a passage in Barros' ' Asia,' which mentions
him as a member of a board of mathematicians, instituted by King John to devise
a method of determining latitudes by means of meridian altitudes of the sun. This,
however, is all a myth. Long before the time of Behaim, and even before Regio-
montanus, his alleged teacher, such tables had been prepared by Zacuto, a learned
Spanish Jew, and these tables, as also the astrolabe, were in use among Portuguese
mariners long before Behaim first came to Lisbon, in 1484, and there is no reason
to assume that Behaim ever took an interest in scientific work. His globe shows
that he was thoroughly incompetent, for in laying down the part of the coast
which he claims to have personally visited he errs to the extent of 24 degrees in

latitude.

     In 1486 an expedition from Benin brought news that there resided, at a con-
siderable distance in the interior, a powerful Christian king, who was at once
identified with ' Prester John ' of Abyssinia. King John forthwith despatched two
expeditions, both of which started in 1487, the one, including Paiva and Covilhao,
by land, the other, under Bartholomew Bias, by sea. Covilhao reached India,
journeyed along the east coast of Africa as far south as Sofala, and ultimately
entered Prester John's country. Bias doubled the Cape of Good Hope, probably.
at the beginning of 1488, and followed the coast as far as tbe Great Fish River,
when his crews insisted upon being taken home. Thus the possibility of reaching
India by sailing all round Africa had been demonstrated, and the realisation of the
far-reaching plans of Henry the Navigator only became a question of time.

     This paper begins with a summarj^ slcetch of tlie history of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey since its creation in 1S07, and proceeds to describe the
development and improvement of methods, as -well as the extension of the work
from the bays and harbours of the middle Atlantic slope to all portions of the
American coast. The methods, purposes, and results of the transcontinental
triaugulation are set forth, together with leading features of the work in the
measurement of gravity for the purpose of determining the figure of the earth and
controlling the detailed surveys. The precise determination of latitudes and
longitudes is also described, and the methods and extent of mapping are indicated.
Reference is made also to the preparation of the coast pilots and to the deter-

4. The Coastal Plain of Maim. By Professor William Moekis Davis.

     Southern Maine is bordered by a narrow and irregular coastal plain, dissected
by numerous small valleys. It is ordinarily the case that coastal plains are limited
by sub-parallel lines marking the former and present shore line of the region, as
may be seen in the typical example that skirts the eastern margin of the Deccan
in India. But the coastal plain of Maine has a most irregular inner and outer
boundary, and its surface is interrupted here and there hj ridges and hills of
rugged rocky surface, similar to that of the oldland further inland. The inner
boimdary or former shore line is irregular, because it marks the edge of a parti)'
submerged hilly region at the time the clayey strata of the plain were accumu-
lating. The outer boundary is irregular, because the period of submergence and
deposit did not endure long enough to produce a smooth sea-bottom ; hence, when
the plain was revealed by elevation, the new shore line was little less ragged than
the old shore line, and time enough has not yet passed for its simplification, even
l)y the strong Atlantic waves. The streams and rivers, extended from the oldland
across the plain, have incised valleys along their consequent courses. Thus the
siU'face of the plain is to-day of moderate inequality of form. At many points the
streams have cut down their channels upon buried ledges, and thus falls are
developed. In coastal plains of simpler form such falls occur only near the inner

border of the phain here they may occur close to the outer border, and this is no
                                                                                                           ;

Bear sea transportation.

     Although of small area and modest relief, the coastal plain of Maine between
the oldland behind it and the sea in front exercises a manifest control on the
distribution and occupation of the people. The irregular shore line afibrds many
harbours ; here fishermen and boatbuilders are found. The numerous waterfalls
define the sites of manufacturing villages and cities. The smoother parts of the

plain are occupied by farmers, who utilise the adjacent ridges and hills of the old-

land for pasture and woodland. The oldland itself, unless well sheeted with glacial
drift, is rugged and inhospitable, and the sad little farms in occasional clearings
there are in marked contrast to the thrifty and well-to-do houses and barns on the

plain itself,

   6. The Barren Lands of Canada. By 3. B. Tyrrell, M.A., B.Sc.

     The 'Barren Lands,' or more properly the Northern Plains and Prairies of
Canada, cover an area of about 400,000 square miles between the Mackenzie River
and Hudson Bay, extending from the coast line of the Arctic Ocean down to the
general northern limit of the forest. On the west coast of Hudson Bay they reach
southward to north latitude 59°, and thence their southern boundary extends in a

north-westerly direction, roughly at right angles to the magnetic meridian, to

within a short distance of the mouth of the Mackenzie Tiiver, crossing the Kazan at
Ennadai Lake, the Telzoa River at Boyd Lake, and keeping some distance back
from the shore of Great Slave Lake.

      In general character the country is a vast undulating, stony plain, thinly
covered with short grass, while rounded rocky hills rise here and there through
the stony clay. It can be divided into two fairly distinct portions, viz., the
* Coastal Plain,' which rose from beneath the ocean in post-Glacial times, and tlie
' Interior Upland," with a somewhat more pronounced topography, just as it was
left at the close of the Glacial epoch.

     The whole country slopes gently towards the north-east, and the three main
streams which drain it have a more or less parallel course in that direction. These
streams are the Back or Great Fish River, with a total length of 650 miles ; the
Telzoa or Doobaunt River, with a length of 750 miles; and the Kazan River, with
a length of about 490 miles.

     The author showed illustrations, drawn from photographs, exemplifying the
general character of the country, its herds of reindeer, and its native inhabitants.

        7. Geofp'aphic Work of the United States Geographical Survey.

               By Charles V. Walcott, Director of the Survey.

     The paper begins with the summary sketch of geographic surveys in the

United States prior to the organisation of the United States Geographical Survey
in 1879, and then sets forth the methods and progress of the geographic surveys
conducted by this bureau. The surveys are designed for mapping on scales of
1 : 02,500 and 1 : 125,000 ; and the work is drawn and engraved on copper in the
office of the survey ; the mapping is in sheets, each covering a quarter of a square
degree for the larger scale and one-sixteenth of a square degree for the smaller
scale, and each is engraved on three copper plates for printing in three colours
black for the projection and culture, &c., blue for the hydrography, and brown for
the hypsography or vertical relief (which is expressed in contours). The purpose
of these maps is to form a basis for the geographical surveys and the general
geological maps of the United States, which it is the primary function of the survey
to execute. The geographic surveys have already extended over about 760,000

square miles, and are represented on nearly a thousand map sheets. The author

proceeds finally to point out some of the various uses of the survey and resulting

facts in addition to the purely geologic applications.

       8. The Topograpliical Worh of the Geological Survey of Canada.

                                      By J. White.

     This paper treats of the topographical work of the Geographical Survey from

its inception in 1841 to the present time.

     In the absence of anything hke a general geodetic survey of the Dominion the
Geological Survey, as the only organisation charged with the mapping of the
country as a whole, has been forced to undertake extensive surveys and explora-

tions.

    The operations in the field may be divided under two heads :

     1. The reconnoissance and exploratory surveys of the unexplored and the less
accessible areas of Northern and Western Canada.

     2. The detailed surveys, for mapping on regular scales, of the more accessible
and the settled portions.

9. The United States Daily Weather Survey. By Professor Willis L.

        Moore, LL.D., Director of the United States Weather Bureau.

  It is the  purpose of  this paper to present a summary sketch of the work  of the

^

AVeather Bureau in ascertaining the various features controlling climate in the

United States and in adjacent territory. To this end the growth of the bureau is

sketched and the methods pursued in various stations and offices, extending from

the Pacific to the Atlantic, are described. Special note is made of recent extensions

in the service into Mexico on the south-west and Canada on the north, and plans

for extending the work into the West Indies are developed. Special attention is

given also to the recent improvement in forecasting through the use of kites, by

which the condition of the air is determined at altitudes of one to two miles above

the land surface.

--The following Papers were read :

1. The Economic Geography of Rhodesia. By F. C. Selous.

     The author traces the history of the British occupation of South Africa, and
goes on to discuss the economic geography of the country, mainly with regard to

agriculture.

     The form of the land, an elevated plateau, insures a generally healthful climate,
and avoids the most serious drawback to European colonisation in tropical Africa.
Fever is still common in many parts, but may be confidently expected to disappear
in the more elevated regions when the land is cultivated and the swamps are
drained. The superior healthiness of Western Matabeleland is attributed to the fact

that for sixty years the land has been cultivated by a relatively dense population.

     With regard to agriculture and cattle-rearing, the present visitation of rinder-
pest IS an epidemic, and not the usual condition of the country. Locusts, which
have recently wrought much damage to crops, come periodically, but in ordinary

times Rhodesia is healthy for cattle and fertile for grain. Irrigation will achieve

much in many parts of the country. There may never be a great export of agri-

cultural produce, but Ehodesia bids fair to be self-supporting and to supply the
whole population_ drawn into the country by its mineral wealth.

     Details are given in the paper drawn from the author's residence in South

Africa for twenty-five years.

     3. On the Direction of Lines of Structure in Eurasia.
                        By Prince Kropotkin.

The aim of this paper is to put in evidence the importance of certain directions

which prevail in the main lines of orientation of plateaus and chains of mountains

in Asia and Europe. The very important part played by erosion and denudation

in the shaping of  the orographical  features of  the  continents  is  well knovrn                                                           but
                                                                                                                                          ;

even after that agency has been fully taken into account, we find in Eurasia two

main directions which are followed by the chains of mountains and the plateaus

namely, from S.W. to N.E., and from N.W. to S.E., or rather from N.W. by W.

to S.E. by E.

     In Asia, the prevalence of these two directions is quite evident. Of the two

--great plateaus which make the backbone of Asia the Asia Minor plateau and
--the great plateau of East Asia one runs N.W. to S.E., and the other runs S.W.

to N.E, The border ridges of these plateaus, as well as the ridges which are

situated on the plateaus, and the Alpine tracts which fringe them all follow the

one or the other direction. And the better the orography of Central Asia is

known the more distinctly these two directions appear on our maps.

The broad features of the orography of East Asia which were mapped out by

the author in 1876 were extended by Petermann to the south-western parts of

Central Asia, and were embodied into his map of Asia for Stieler's Atlas. They
seem now to be pretty generally accepted. The Stanovoi Khrebet, which ran W.

to E.on our older maps, has disappeared; the high plateau with its lower terrace

and the Great Khingan bordering that lower terrace, as well as the series of

parallel ridges running N.E., parallel to it, which he ventured to indicate then, are

by this time figured on most of our maps. It may be said that the investiga-

tions which were made within the last twenty-five years further and further

confirmed this conception of East Asia's orography. The Nan Shan system, the

Altyn-tagh, and the several chains of the Kuen-lun ; the mountain ridges of the

Darvaz ; the high chains of the Khan-Ten-a^ri system ; the Great or Ek-tag Altai
and the mountain ridges on the middle Hoang-ho, which all were traced twenty

years ago in all directions, take now on modern maps the orientations S.W. or
N.E., or N.AV. to S.E. And we see more and more distinctly appearing on the

--maps of Asia that immense plateau extremely similar to the great plateau of
--Western North America, though directed N.W. instead of N.E. which divides

Asia into two parts, entirely differing from each other in their climate, vegetation,

and all general geographical characters ; so much so that the vegetation on the
S.E. slope of the great plateau (Amur region) is much more like to the vegetation

of British Columbia than to the vegetation of West Siberia.

Professor Mushketoft"s researches in the Tian Shan have revealed another fact

of very great importance : namely, that the upheavals running towards the N.E.

are the oldest ones (Archaean or Palseozoic), while those chains of mountains

--which run S.E. to N.W. are more recent that is, belong to the Mesozoic times.

In Europe the same two directions have the same prevalence. Tlie Urals

appear now to consist of upheavals, or rather of mountains and plateau slopes

running alternately N.E. and N.W. The leading feature of Scandinavia's oro-

Ngraphy are : lines of high plateaus running E. into the peninsula of Kola, and

a lower terrace running also N.E., from Scania to Finland. In Russia the

dominant feature (altered here and there by erosion) is the central plateau, which

runs from the Carpathians to the Middle Urals, all physical and even economical

features of the country (fertility of the soil, crops, &c.) being subordinated to this

leading feature. In Caucasia and Asia Minor the plateau which stretches from

West Armenia to Daghestan (S.W. to N.E.) and the main chain running N.W.

to S.E. are the dominant features.

In Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, and Macedonia the N.W. direction prevails,

while the north-eastern prevails in the Alps. In the Pyrenees we find (as in the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION E.                                  723

Urals) a complex: of two chains running N.W. in the centre (Schrader's ^lap), and
two chains running N.E. on both ends of the main massif; while the Sierras de
Estrella, de Gata, de Gredos, and Guadarrama, and the chains of Sierra Morena of
Murcia and Granada assume the N.E. direction. The central plateau of France

and the mountains of Scotland are again instances in point.

     Of course these two directions are not exclusive. The eastern Tian Shan

some mountains of Minusinsk, and, may be, the Balkans are instances of the W. to

E. direction, and faint traces of meridional upheavals (which may continue even now
to be going on) may be indicated. Chains en echelon (Spain, North Asia) must also

be mentioned ; as also curved border ridges grown on the edges of plateaus, espe-

cially along the N.W. border of the high plateaus of Asia, where the deepest

depressions lie at its borders (southern shore of Caspian, Lake Baikal). Various

causes may contribute to produce this growth of mountains along the edo-es of

plateaus, especially if these chains have originated at a period when the

plateaus were continents surrounded by the ocean.

   --The fact that the two great plateaus of Asia and North America the two

--oldest backbones of the two continents converge towards Behring Strait, in the

same way as at the present time the continents have their narrow extremities

pointing towards the South Pole, deserves a special attention. This fact may be

one more confirmation of the hypotheses which look for general telluric, or even

perhaps cosmical causes in order to explain the origin of mountains altoo-ether.

                  4. PotamoJogij as a Branch of Physical Geographij.

                     By Professor Albrecht Penck, Vienna.

     The paper shows the necessity of a profound study of rivers as a department of

physical geography, equivalent to oceanography and limnology. This branch may

be called potamoloffy. It can be treated under five different heads

     1. The physics of running water.

     '2. The bulk of water and its fluctuations.
     3. The action of water on its bed.

     4. The distribution of rivers on the earth.

     o. The rivers as a scene of organic life.

     The author points out that the physics of running water are not known to such
a degi-ee that a formula for the mean velocity could be established, the existing
ones being in general incorrect. He farther gives an account of some new results
obtained by him concerning the bulk of water of Central European rivers and its

relation to precipitation; he expresses the wish that measurements of the quantity
of water of the larger rivers should be undertaken, and that the results of gauo-e-
observations should be published in a regular way, as are the results of meteoro-

logical observations. He proves the necessity of studying the movement of river
gravels, and of publishing maps of river-bottoms. He shows that there is still a

want of exact knowledge of the magnitude of river-basins and river-lengths of
European and North American rivers, and refers to some difficulties in determinino-

those quantities. As to rivers which by climatic causes are not constantly

running, he agrees that extreme values of their catchment basins and lengths
should be determined. AVhile acknowledging what had been already done for the
study of rivers for practical purposes (irrigation, floods, navigation), he holds that

much remains to be done in order to establish a scientific potamology.

         8. Mexico Felix and Mexico Deserta. By O. H. Howarth.

     Tlie physical structure of tlie region comprised in the Mexican Republic, viz.^
that of a high plateau of some 550,000 square miles in area, fringed by a narrow

--belt of low-lying lands on either coast, has led to its being usually described

imder three climatic divisions the Tierra Caiiente, or Hot Lands, the Tien-a
Templada, or Temperate Lands, and the Tierra Fria, or Cold Lands. For practical
purposes such a description can hardly be said to afford any strict geographical
definition, inasmuch as the climatic conditions of any particular locality are not

dependent only on temperature, but also on altitude, rainfall, evaporation, forest
growth, proximity of ocean waters, and other modifying causes, all of which
operate in varyiog degrees at difiBrent latitudes. Omitting the coast levels, which
are essentially tropical in character, though not wholly within the tropical-
limits, and the higher mountain ranges of the interior, it is to be observed tliat the

general characteristics of that portion of Central America are still subject to much

misapprehension in the minds of those unacquainted with Mexico. Regarding-

the conditions of human life and prosperity, it occurs to me that the general

distinction into ' Mexico Felix ' and ' Mexico Deserta ' is somewhat more to the
purpose ; and it will be seen that those conditions haye little to do with mere

--temperature by itself still less with actual latitude.

     From a breadth of some 1,200 miles at the United States frontier, on about the

30th parallel, the continent narrows gradually throughout its south-easterly trend
to one of only 120 miles at the Isthmus of Tehuautepec, widening again at the
borders of Guatemala, some 14 degrees further south, before it contracts finally

to a 45-mile strip at Panama. From the general altitude of 3,000 to 4,000

feet, extending through the south of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (U.S.A.),

there is a further gradual rise beyond the course of the Rio Grande, and a
general level of 5,000 feet and upwards is maintained for 1,200 miles, until, south
of the city of Mexico, it declines again by a series of terraces to under 2,000 feet,
mounting up once more in the States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chiapas. Yet the

mean temperatures and evaporation are considerably higher, and the rainfall lower,
in the northern portion of this tract than in the south, which is commonly supposed
to belong to the torrid regions of the earth. While the mean temperature during-
last year in the city of Mexico was slightly under 60° (Fahr.) that of Monterey, in
the State of Nuevo Leon, was over 74° ; whereas at the city of Oaxaca, 300 miles
further south than Mexico City, and at 2,000 feet less elevation, it was no more
than 67°. The northern States of Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Nuevo Leon preserve
largely the characteristics of Nevada and Arizona, comprising vast arid plains of
sage-brush, mosquite, and cactus, intersected by treeless mountain ranges, and
forming a zone between the regions of winter and summer rains upon which the
latter intrude but sparsely and only in occasional seasons. Hence it is that in the
southern States of North America the higher rainfall, together with the altitude and
approximation of the oceans, has developed a climate both healthier and mor&
equable, and a vegetation which in the north is only found in patches or amongst

the heights of the coast ranges.

     Perhaps the evidences of this peculiarity which possess the most direct interest
for us are those bearing upon the population of these southern regions in remote
ages, the study of which is rapidly leading us to assign to them an antiquity at
least as preat as any of which tlie world holds any record.

                                    (With Lantern Illustrations.)

     In view of the prominent place now taken by photography in tlie work of all

travellers it is necessary to urge the importance of taking pictures which are
geographically as well as photographically ' good.' Such pictures must be truth-
ful and representative, the utmost care being taken to avoid distortion, to supply
some indication of scale, and to bring out the characteristic features. General
views comprehending a coi'siderable area are desirable for showing types of land-
forms or sites of towns. Pictures on a larger scale are desirable for showing the
detail of special features, such as varieties of architecture, means of transport, or
agricultural processes related to certain geographical conditions. As far as possible
·every geographical picture should sliow something distinctly illustrative of a natural
feature or a local condition peculiar to the place where it was made, or at least
characteristic of it. The handsomest house in a village, the rarest foreign tree in
·a park, or the prettiest view in a district, represents the sort of subject most often
photographed, and they are precisely those of least geographical value. The
paper was illustrated by numerous lantern views of typical scenery, people, and

processes of geographical significance.

  . 3. Geographical Wall-jnctures. By Professor Albrecht Penck.

     Geographical education needs means of representation. The student should not
liave only the knowledge of facts, he must be enabled to represent to himself the
features of the earth's surface. There cannot be any doubt that lantern slides
afford a very good means for helping to get such clear representations as are needed,

but, on the other hand, other means of geographical representation may not be

neglected. The projections of lantern slides are of a mere temporary character,
·excellently fitted to illustrate the spoken word, but education needs also means for
impressing deeply the most important features of the earth's surface into the minds

·of the students.

     At Vienna we use for this purpose with the greatest advantage the geographical
pictures issued by the establishment of Edward Hobsel. These are printed in

·different oil-colours, the size of each being 32 : 2-4 inches. The whole collection
·embraces now thirty-seven pictures (the price of each being 4s. = ,^1.00) ; the greater
part (twenty-three) indeed represent European features, but more than one-third
represent sceneries of other continents, and six give American views. The high,
educational value of the collection concerns the morphology of the earth. Five

[pictures represent different types of vegetation forms, the tropical virgin forest,

as well as the Hungarian steppes; nine the forms of the highest mountain ranges
in Europe, North America, and Asia, with their glaciers ; four show the different
.actions of water ; seven pictures illustrate the formation of valleys and the whole
cycle of land-destruction ; four show volcanoes in different parts of the world ; eight

represent types of coastal formation,

     The Hobsel collection of the geographical character pictures is now completed

'by a set of geographical city pictures of larger size. The pictures of London,
 Paris, and Vienna have already appeared. There is also a very good collection of
 historical wall-pictures edited by the establishment of Hobsel. The collection
·embraces sixty-two sheets, executed after drawings of Professor Langl.

4. Geogra'phy in the University. By Professor William Morris Davis.

Geography is inherently of sufRcient interest, importance, and disciplinary

value to deserve a place in the university on an equal footing with history.

Without such recognition the scientific development of the subject must languish,

Aas -would that of any other subject not represented in higher education.  full

--development of geography as a university study requires due attention to its two

parts the physical environment of man on the one side and his way of responding-

to environment on the other side. After due preparation on these fundamental

subjects, the geography of continental or other areas may be taken up.
    Two advantageous results may be expected from the full recognition of

geography as a university subject. The first is an advance in the status of

geography in the lower schools, where it is now too often in an xmfortunately

degraded condition. The second is a more thorough and scientific record of

travellers' observations, which are now too often merely personal narratives of

adventure, with little of serious geographical matter.

                    THURSDAY, AUGUST 19,

     In the absence of the President the following Address was read by the Hon. Sir

C. W, Fremantle:--

In the selection of the subject on which I propose to offer, according to custom, a
few remarks to-day, I have been influenced by the wish to choose one which is

not only of present importance, but such that it may provide occasion for the

discussion of the advance which economic study has made, and of the methods

whereby that advance has been achieved. The position of the Labour Question

in modern thought and its economic treatment is a matterwell worth attention

from these various points of view. In addition, its consideration cannot fail

to throw light on the connection which exists between the economic growth of _a
country and the main developments of Economics as a study. Whatever their

view of the subject itself, few will deny the curiously emphatic position occupied

by Labour and the various questions relating to it and its conditions at the present
day. Illustrations present themselves on many sides. Evidence may be adduced

from almost all quarters of literature, even from those seemingly unlikely. To the

novel writer and the novel reader working-class life has formed a continent almost

as newly discovered as that sighted by Columbus and others, or rather by others
and Columbus, in the fifteenth century ; and even when the novelist is chastened
into unnecessary discretion and distant allusiveness in his description of detail and

habits by the fear, perhaps the unnecessary fear, that his audience is less ignorant

than himself, Labour Problems and Labour Difficulties brood like a nightmare in

his mind and leave their mark on his pages. It is the same in other literature,
where they reign in almost undivided monopoly. The ' working man ' button-holes

the reader in the library and at the news-stall, and stays beside him in the very

discomforting guise of a problem when he sits by the fireside in the evening. And

Onas in literature so in life, as in life so in public discussion.  all sides there is

the same feature. In all directions there has grown up the same tacit habit of

regarding each question as hardly worth discussion till it has passed the pre-

liminary test not only of its efl'ect on the position of the working class, but of the

view they are likely to take of it ; rightly, no doubt, inasmuch as it implies the
consideration of their interests, often neglected in the past ; wrongly when con-

strued into the conclusion that all measures or changes which they resent are

Anecessarily evil.  similar tendency is shown in recent economic literature,

and particularly in that of the past quarter of a century, which treats of the con-

ditions and remuneration of manual labour with force just as undeniable as the

length of the chapters and the number of the books devoted to the subject. \Vhat

may be termed the bias of economic studies is very evident. Just as at one time
728 REPORT-- 1897.

the balance of trade and commercial relations with foreign countries, and at

another currency schemes and currency iniquities, pervaded the atmosphere, so now

Labour and the Labour Question, and writer after writer struggles beneath its

fascination, helpless in his efforts to avoid its introduction in every part of his

work, suitable or unsuitable. Like the reference to the head of a departed

Enghsh monarch, it forces an entrance page by page and chapter by chapter.

HowWhat a revenge time has brought with it for former neglect !  great the

present prominence is and how recent is shown by a comparison between the sub-

jects discussed to-day and those discussed at the beginning of the present or

during the past century, between the general trend of an economic treatise now

and that of those of the past. Then Labour itself was the subject of bare refer-

ence as an agent of production, and as one, but by no means the chief, factor

requiring payment, and in only a few cases were there traces that its condition

and its environment were even regarded as matters for economists to discuss, while

now there is the risk of other elements escaping attention. It is not the way in

which the subject is dealt with that is insisted on here, but the bare prominence of

the subject, though the former in its turn has changed greatly, the somewhat rigid

impassiveness of the earlier date yielding to expressions of a vivid and personal

sympathy.

   --On turning to what is the Jirst portion of our taslv the consideration of

--the causes which have made thus conspicuous one agent in production and one

economic element the identification or rather the confusion of labour with labour

of one grade calls for remark. Labour is the term used to denote either the work

of one class, the class, that is, which monopolises the title of the working-class,
or all human work necessary to production. In some instances the term is

stretched so far as to include all eifort, direct or indirect, involved in production.

But though instances of these different meanings are found in abundance, and

though the second of them is the most strictly consistent, as it expresses the dis-

tinction between personal effort and that which is not personal, Labour when

used emphatically and spelt with a capital initial is almost invariably, so far as

popular usage is concerned, taken as implying some particular reference to the

grade of manual labour. Other labour, skilled labour or labour of management,

if included at all, is treated as comparatively insignificant. To all intents and

purposes by labour, especially when conditions and remuneration are referred to,

is meant manual labour. This restriction in definition is significant and unfortu-

nate. Associations centring round labour in the wider sense come almost imper-

ceptibly to be conceived of as relating to labour in the more narrow meaning of

the word. Coincident with its growth in popular favour, the tendency to restrict the

term has increased. It is true, of course, that in economic writings labour,

when defined, is applied to personal action of all grades and of all degrees of skill,

but even there laxity finds entrance in the frequent unguarded use of slipshod

popular expressions, as the difficulties of labour, the labouring classes, conflicts

of labour and capital, and the like, when by these are meant the difficulties and

interests of one class of labour only. Such, then, is the aspect which confronts

the student of social phenomena in the present day. Considerations respecting

Labour have acquired, and that comparatively recently, an unusually large share

of attention at the very time when the term, in popular usage at any rate, has

been shorn of some part of its meaning and severely restricted in definition.

    The causes of the new prominence of this class of labour form a subject of
much importance, for on our knowledge of them largely rest the conclusions as

to the true significance of the problem and the meaning of such results as we

discern. Such knowledge also provides the means of discriminating between

changes due to direct economic movements and those arising out of nothing more

than an altered attitude on the part of society brought about by general causes.
     To some, no doubt, the explanation of this particular change, and of the pro-

minence of this question, lies in the greater humanity which characterises the

economic thought of the present as contrasted with the past ; to others, in the wide

find it in the subtle changes in tlie general conceptions of a restless and singularly
receptive society. But these various impulses, important though no doubt
their influence has been, are very general in character, and seem hardly definite
enough to account for a change in thought so distinctive and so unrelieved
in its nature, while all of them are open to the pertinent criticism that they them-

selves may be due in part, and in large part, to modifications in economic circum-

stances. Were they, or any of them, the sole or even the principal cause, it is
hardly necessary to add that the alteration which has taken place has been in the way

of looking at things, and not in things which are looked at. Others, again, have

found their answer in the greater degree of certainty and assurance with regard to

economic elements which in earlier times constituted difficulties in the way of
progress and menaced considerable dangers, and it is true that much that may be

iirged in this direction is well founded. Capital which, at the beginning of the

present century, was in imminent demand and vastly insufficient for the develop-
ment of industry, has grown, not by any slow if certain increase, but by leaps and

bounds just as certain, and its accumulation under the most varying vicissitudes

has removed the constant apprehensions as to its supply which confront the reader
in early literature. The relation between population and its food supply, which

left an indelible mark on one period of economic thought, has temporarily, at
any rate, retreated into the background with the opening up of new countries, the

discovery of new natural forces, and the observed conditions of the more settled

--nations. Again, so far as England is concerned, the adoption and for the time,
--at any rate, the successful adoption of a Free Trade Policy, led to a lull in the

controversies which raged with regard to tariffs, the balance of trade, and protec-

tion. Less importance, too, has been attached to difficulties involved in the
ownership of the land and the conditions of its cultivation, partly through

measures of economic reform, partly, so far as the older and more settled countries

.are concerned, by reason of the subordination of agricultural interests to the grow-

ing and giant industries of manufacture and commerce. Indeed, the only questions

which remain conspicuous by reason either of agitation or intrinsic urgency relate

to currency, a matter which, however pressing, sufi'ers under the popular disad-

vantage that its discussion is seen to require actual knowledge, because of its use

of technical terms, and one which to all of us is of increasing interest, the

economic relations which should exist between the various portions of a widespread

«mpire, with its aspirations after greater cohesion and co-ordinated though distri-

buted strength.

But the very fact that in these respects the various nations differ largely,

and that despite these differences the position of the manual labour classes

uniformly impresses itself, though perhaps in varying degree, upon the plastic

mind of the public, suggests the existence of some positive and active force as a

cause for this prominence ; and such we find in the alterations in the conditions

of labour, which have led naturally, positively and necessarily to a change in the

estimation in which it is held.

Though the course of economic development during the past century and a half

has differed greatly in various countries, being largely affected both by the par-

ticular stage of progress to which they have attained and by the varying relative

importance of the two great branches of agriculture and manufacture, a change in

the method of employment is common to all. In England this feature is displayed

in stronger and more definite relief, less embarrassed than elsewhere by extraneous

influences                                                 and it is in  England that  its nature has been most attentively studied.
                                                        ;

There the period has been one of undoubted change. The revolution in the

methods of industry, of which much has been said, had its counterpart in agricul-

ture, less noticed, perhaps, but hardly less important. While in the former the great

mechanical inventions, with the introduction of water and steam power, accelerated

the change already in progress from a system of small and local industries to a

system of great national industry, the agricultural classes were the witnesses of

alterations as vital to their interests, and which were to co-operate in producing a
remarkable alteration in the general conditions of employment. Owing partly to

improvements in agriculture itself, partly to the sweeping eflects of the inclosurea
730  ·  EEPOET-- 1897.

and the abolition of common rights, partly to the greater opportunities afforded for

the use of capital hy these and other causes, farming came to be carried on in

greater separation from proprietorship, and both the average size of farms and of

properties would seem to have increased. Agricultural labour became more and

more the occupation of a class of agricultural labourers, disassociated from capital

and severed more decisively than before from the ownership of the soil, or the

prospect of independent cultivation. But this was the very change which

took place at much the same time in manufacture. Here, too, the powerful

progress of change was sweeping into the distant past the small master craftsman

with his one or two apprentices and his three or four journeymen. Here, too, in
ever increasing number throng those who are employed with small hope or prospect

of ever employing either themselves or others. The development of the means of

communication and locomotion, at first by road-making and canalisation, and

afterwards by the laying and extension of the vast railway system, set free demand

from those bonds of restriction which had confined it to seek its satisfaction in the

products of the district, and by delocalising demand localised industry. Here and

there, indeed, local industries continued to survive, here and there special circum-

stances stood in the way of the establishment of factories, but elsewhere and in

general there emerged into view the colossal growth of the nineteenth century,

the system of Great Industry. And one feature, and that the most important

feature so far as we are concerned, in industry as in agriculture, was the demar-

cation of those engaged into the classes of Employer and Employed.

    This tendency to horizontal cleavage, to borrow an expressive term, which may

be studied in the contrast between the existing systems and those of the past, as

well as in the history of the actual movement, was greatly accentuated by the

blurring of those lines of vertical division which had left districts and local groups

partially self-subsistent and separate ; and, in England and certain other countries,

by the disproportionate increase of the urban population, more closely knit and

more sensitive to sentiments of union and the possibilities of common action.

Non-competing grades have been substituted for non-competing groups. Though

these former are more than two, being many in number and capable of extension

so far as some degree of non-competition is concerned, there are, however, cir-

cumstances inherent in our system which make the separation between the class

of manual labour and the others more complete, and restrict within the most

rigid limits the competition which can take place. It has been said, indeed, that

the leading feature of modern times is the substitution of the cash nexus for the

personal nexus, but it may be doubted if it is really the most important. Pecuniary

payments connect the employers and those who under the more skilled labour of

superintendence control direction and invention, and yet these latter classes rank

themselves and are ranked in general estimation with the employers rather than

with the employed. They are not included popularly, at any rate, under the term         I

Welabour when labour difficulties are spoken of.  must look somewhat deeper for

an explanation. There are some three or four characteristics which may serve to

distinguish labour in its popular sense from the other industrial grades.

In the first place, the work is different. Manual labour has to do what is set

before it, the others have to devise what is to be done. Theu' work is one con-

cerned largely with management and with organisation as a whole, and this quality

not only enables them to realise the entire circumstances of the industry, but in

many cases relieves them from the narrow and unsatisfying consequences of

specialisation or restriction to the performance of particular portions of the com-

mon task. In the second place, the needs of the manual labom' class are particular.

Specialisation, and particularly manual specialisation, with its blunting effects on

the mind, requires a powerful corrective. In the third place, the highly-skilled

labour which directs and invents is less decisively removed from the chance of at-

taining to the employing class, and even if few prove successful in this to the full

extent, the functions they exert are closely akin. It is, no doubt, true that no posi-

tive barrier is placed in the way of indefinite rise on the part of those engaged in

labour of any kind, however unskilled ; but in point of practice the obstacles to be

overcome amount well-nigh to prohibition. In the fourth place, the dependence
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.                731

of several millions of men for their existence on a weekly -wage apportioned by

others, and dependent on vicissitudes which they not only cannot control, but do

Anot foresee, is a very striking fact.  miserable insecurity attaches to their posi-

tion. But a weekly or daily wage and uncertainty are ill companions. Riglitly
or wrongly, the responsibility is attributed to those who pay the wage, and the

inculcation of thrift, with all its good effects, only increases the confusion and

sharpens the censure. The influences thus described have, no doubt, rarely been
operative all to the same effect, and frequently have not been all present at the

same time ; but shorn though it he, in one case of one, in another case of anuther,
the change which has passed over the lower and more numerous classes of labour
is substantially the same. Owing to it labour is subject to the condition of

employment by others, and is less responsible in feeling and partly in fact for its

own direction, and for the continuance of the means of earning its own mainten-
ance. To the restrictions of society with some reason, and to those who represent
to him the restrictive influences without reason, the working man vaguely, if not

definitelj', attributes want of work, slackness of work, and change of work. Limi-

tations of some kind have always existed, and it would be wrong to ignore the fact
that the condition of the classes in question was far worse when these were the

incidents of custom and external nature than at present ; but then in those cases

the limitations on the action of individuals were both inevitable and impersonal.

In many ways they seem to have interfered less with the innate conviction on the

part of those who were self-employed that failure and success rested on themselves.
But now the whole bulk of the nation is employed by others. Another aspect too.

People often resign themselves to the inevitable, but they do not recognise the

inevitable in the actions and opinions of others.

Moreover, there are other influences besides those purely economic which have

added prominence to this important separation into the two classes of Emploj'ers

and Employed, a very small class of Employers and a very large class of Em-

ployed.

The extension of political power and political privileges, which has affected the

operative class most of all, has had consequences in more than one direction :.

men who become voters exercise a greater influence on public opinion and on the
opinions of their would-be leaders, than is the case when logic and argument

form their only weapons or means of persuasion ; and though at times this

may take unpleasant forms, in the main it is a perfectly sound political result.
People are not made voters in order to act as jurors in an abstract question. They

are representative of particular feelings, and are responsible to themselves as

to the whole State for bringing into view the interests which are theirs, and the

amelioration of which forms part of the problem of government. But even more

important in this connection than the influence thus summoned into being for the

redress of much that is ill, is the nature of the relation between political equality
and social equality. No one nowadays, or, to speak accurately, hardly anyone,^

believes in the vague and fantastic doctrines which embraced physical and mental

equality, as if the time had come for mankind to be cast in one mould, and for

identity of condition and accomplishments. But still the extension of political

equality may be held to promise something. If not, what can he more vain than

Athe cry for the extended franchise ?   vote by itself is no precious possession if

we consider it mainly as the right to give abstract decisions on matters of more or

less general interest, and as carrying with it no social assurances. Surely a thing

such as this would not have formed the motive of the great enthusiasms, and made

death itself a thing of nought to those who sought it in tumultuous times. But it is
just because it seemed to them to be something more than this that it won its

mastery over their life, and because it is taken to be more than this that the more

recent extensions of the franchise are so significant. They are construed as ration-

ally involving a greater equalisation, so far as human opportunities are concerned,

and as conveying an assurance that there shall not be, so far as society can help
it, any one class condemned to bear from generation to generation the burden and

toil devolving on the lowest ranks of labour. But whether the feeling be rightly

defined, whether it be in itself right or wrong, a belief in such a connection i&

powerful in making more conspicuous the subject of Labour, especially the position

of Employed Labour.

In another way this subject gains additional prominence, as has been suggested,

by the temporary abeyance of other causes of economic embarrassment, and

insufficient though this might be as a substantive cause, it is impossible to under-

rate its effect as subsidiary in the cause of a change already accomplished and

capable of attracting more interest with each fresh access of attention bestowed

upon it.

But even these do not exhaust the number of subsidiary causes to which so

much is due. There are others, and though many of them are comparatively

unimportant this is far from being the case with one. The age itself and the

character of the age has much to do with the attention, and especially with the

sympathetic attention, patiently yielded to the problem. To characterise an age is

never easy. It is difficult even when the age is far distant and the human

memory so far kind as to refuse to retain more than one or two pieces of informa-

tion, letting the others slip through and fall into a deep and unrecovered oblivion.

How much more difficult when the epoch is our own ? But in this instance

there are some few features so marked and so capable of identification, that one

pauses to ask in amazement if the age of the Renaissance has not dawned upon us

again in an altered guise. The resemblance is the more striking if we take the

general characteristics and aspect of the two periods as distinct from the particular

Adirection in which the respective movements trend.  renaissance is twofold. On

the one hand it is a time of imrest,' due, indeed, to the breaking down of old

ideals and the decay of former springs of conduct and life, but due also to the

magnificent new life quivering to its birth. On the other hand, the meaning of

the particular renaissance is to be found in the nature of its own ideals and the

fresh direction and impetus imparted to life. Briefly, it is not only a change but

a particular change. What the new ideals are and what the new direction, will be

determined by the past history and the present needs of the nation passing through

its time of stress, and groping blindly after the truth which is to give meaning to

its actions, and which it must struggle to express in art and literature and by every

means at its command. Analogies between this present period and that of the

fifteenth and sixteenth centuries present themselves in different ways. Then, as

now, the time was one of discovery, for the great geographical discoveries of the

earlier epoch find a counterpart in the scientific discoveries which, like them, have

had effects both destructive and constructive ; destroying, that is, convictions and

opinions resting on certain narrow conceptions of the sphere of life, but giving

opportunity on the other hand for new ideas and vaster conceptions. Both are

times of a new learning, and though the causes giving rise to the enthusiasm for

knowledge may differ, in both cases knowledge has been sought in a return from

theories rigid and out of consonance with life to life itself and the facts of life. In

the sphere of religion and morals the likeness is strangely evident. In both cases

the particular form of religion was found inadequate, in both cases there was

failure to distinguish between the fleeting form and the abiding reality, and in

both cases there were particular tendencies, largely by way of result, affecting

morals and conduct. In the fifteenth century, as now, these latter were not so

much in the direction of that coarseness which somehow or other is often called

immorality, but rather in that of a lack of moral discrimination and will.

Prejudices are to be put on one side, prejudices as to morals, prejudices as to

the relations of sexes, prejudices as to one thing and the other. What does it

--mean ? Partly, perhaps, a positive uncertainty sometimes a pretended un-
--certainty as to right and wrong; partly, again, a wanton and curious desire

to experiment on all sides and everywhere, to gain emotional experience irrespective

of the means and the cost whereby it is gained. Novelty is allowed to cover a

multitude of sins. Some such impulse reveals itself in the literature and life of

the Renaissance. Do we recognise nothing like it in the present day ?

     This peculiar moral attitude has its bearing on the subject of our consideration.

Each age works out its own salvation. The mediaeval Renaissance found its

salvation in the emphasis of individuality, alike in religion, in the State, and in
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION F.  733

industrial activity. At the present we seem tending^ in another direction, and in

response to our needs and our circumstances seeking a positive moral guidance in an
enlarged conception of social duty and solidarity ; and the position -which employed
labour occupies with regard to them is sufficient to insure it attention, and not

attention only, but sympathetic attention. Those who have lost their means of
faith in the first commandment of the New Testament turn with feverish haste
to work out their salvation by a stricter attention to the second, and those whose

faith is unimpaired but spiritual vision enlarged perceive that the one is imperfect

without the other. Social regeneration, socialisation, collectivism, social duty,
social action, are phrases which occur in profusion, and, though they disfigure the

language, mark the attitude and give distinction to the actions of the present. In
England, at any rate, the imagination of the people has been struck and its feelinga

stirred with regard to this particular problem, which stands out before other
matters sharply marked and conspicuous.

    But though ifis true that many general influences have combined to increase-

this prominence, its main and original cause lies in the vast economic change which
has swept mankind into two opposite, though not necessarily opposed, classes. To
realise the history of that change is a first step towards imderstanding its nature
and its consequences. But for it it would be possible to interpret present com-

plaints as but the repetition of those of the past, and as finding prototypes in the

outcries which have arisen from time to time from those who brooded over the
contrasts between the poor and the rich. They would mean nothing more than
did many an early pamphlet bearing such a title as ' England's Crying Sin with

Regard to the Poor.' Or, again, the opposition might be construed as an
antagonism between Labour and Capital, in disregard of the union existing between
labour of a certain kind and capital, and of the confusion which such a distinction
involves between profits and interest.

     Of equal importance is the light which history throws upon the present con-
dition of the masses affected by this grave economic change. Its effects might
well have been experienced in two ways. Not only did the power of directing
their lot pass from them to others, resulting in somewhat subtle consequences as
regards the burden and pride of feeling the full responsibility for action, but in
addition it would not have seemed unnatural had they experienced considerable
material injury from a competition against an employing class with a practical
monopoly of capital ; and it is true that the conditions of that competition, which,
be it remembered, determines the division of the product between wages, profits,
and interest, were in one respect altered to their disadvantage. But in another
way, and due to the self-same causes, new opportunities were offered for the
development of organisations which were to turn the balance in their favour.
Till the change of which we have been speaking, till the breaking down of
local divisions which held separate those in like circumstances and of like

interest in different places, till the simplification into one class of employed of so

large a number of those whose means were small, common action for common

ends, as, indeed, any definite control and direction by a central authority, were
impossible. Thus the very forces occasioning change provided the means for its
beneficial regulation. The narrowness of view attributed to a too rigidly
specialised labour has been met by educational advantages which, in England at
any rate, found their occasion in the factory organisation which began to spread
through the country at the close of the eighteenth century. Factory development
has given rise to a control which fails of its effect when called on to penetrate into
the small workshops and the seats of home industries. Dependence on wages finds
a corrective in the growth of benefit societies and the insurance clauses of trade
associations; separation from management and capital has in some instances been
stayed by schemes for co-operation and profit-sharing ; while the greatest defect of
all, the weakness of employed labour in competition with the allied and resourceful
forces of capital and management, has led to the marvellous organisation of trade
unions and kindred associations. In face of these remedial agencies, and despite
the mismanagement and abuses which have attended many of them, the ill-fate
which seemed at one time to menace the condition of those whose streogth lay in
734 REPOKT-- 1897.

manual exertion has not been realised. On the contrary, these classes have shared

to the full in the increased results attending production. Accordiug to the most
reliable estimates, their condition has undergone not only absolute but relative
improvement ; and this is due largely, if not altogether, to the opportunities con-
cealed in the bosom of the economic causes which affected employment so ominously.
The true remedies are those which arise out of the historical circumstances of

the complaint.

     The points which have demanded attention are these. Firstly, the causes,
primarily economic, which have made labour difficulties so prominent ; secondly,
the nature of the great economic change resulting in the separation of the labour
under employment from that determining and directing industry ; and thirdly, the
extent to which this has furnished opportunities for the formation of labour
associations, and the development of a State policy for regulating the conditions of
employment. With regard to the latter point much has been said. It has, for
instance, been argued by some that the great modern interdependence of labour of
different kinds, the growth of State control, and the supersession in many directions
of the private employer by large companies, trusts, and syndicates, are indications
of the necessity and possibility of the monopoly and entire management of industry
and commerce by the State. But the simplicity of this remedy, which has proved so
attractive to many who dwell in a world of ideas as far removed as possible from
fact, is an indication of weakness in the eyes of the student of social and historical
phenomena. As he examines the varying moods and forces which unite in the
tano-led complex of modern industry and society, as he traces from their growth
the tendencies which have made them what they are, interweaving, counteracting,
modifying and coalescing in the pages of history, he grows aware of the intricacies
of the economic constitution and mistrustful of simple theories based on the
-confident recognition of some elements and the neglect, equally confident, of
many others. The one-sided solution is no solution at all. Similarly insufficient
is the reading which finds a confirmation of unrestricted individualistic competition
in the increased social demand for enterprise and individual energy. The careful
study of the past two centuries enforces several conclusions as to economic tenden-
cies all of which require recognition. In the first place, with the growth of intricacy
and the extension of the area of production and distribution, the free exchange of
·commodities has become more and more the one effective means of ascertaining
what is wanted and what are the requirements of the community. In the second
place, so far from there being a diminution, there has been an increase in the
urgent need for eliciting and stimulating individual ability. While, in the third
place, the necessity for State regulation has been enforced and new opportunities

for it provided.

      In turning to the secojid matter for consideration, the treatment by economists
and in economic writings of Labour and the circumstances of employment,
and its results in providing better means of forming correct judgment and

judiciously guiding action, will occupy our attention. On the importance, in

"this respect, of researches into economic history, little need be added. Its
value is felt in every direction. Not only does it discountenance premature

generalisation based on insufficient, and, ii' I may use the expression, fleeting

 data, but it guards us against the still greater danger of first forming con-
 clusions on hypotheses, and then forgetfully assuming that these conclusions are

 based on observed facts. Viewed more positively, it adds the conception of
 organic development and furnishes a large share of the knowledge which forms a
 preliminary to judgment, and which should form a preliminary to social action.
 But the point to be insisted on here is the enormous recent advance achieved in
this direction. Again, the abstract theory of distribution, dealing with the relation
 between various classes of payments, as rent, profits, interest and wages, has
 nndergone considerable change, owing to the labours of the mathematical school
 and other economists, who, starting from the qualitative conceptions first promi-
 nently employed by Ricardo, have dealt with the inter-relation of these and their
 connection with value. But by far the most notable progress has been in

 matters involving quantitative, as well as, or in place of, qualitative admeasurement.

alterations in the rate of wages and the hours of labour, into the causes which

they are sufficient for the purpose. They point to active growth in Economics in

regard to this particular subject. On the other hand, they are painfully insuffi-

Wecient in themselves.  may know more, but we want to know more still.

Concurrent with the advance in knowledge, the general conceptions of labour and

with reference to its treatment have undergone alteration most marked in three

directions. Labour power is no longer viewed as a mere aggregate of hard and

disconnected units which can be sifted out or increased under the stress or stimulus

Weof unhindered competition.    recognise that the labour which survives may be

so aflfected in and by reason of the very process of its selection as to be widely

different from the forces contemplated and required. In social evolution de-

generation, or at any rate variation in the surviving factor, is an almost regular

phenomenon. In the second place, the effects of conditions on efficiency have

been established in a variety of directions, a matter of peculiar importance when

we pass from the contemplation of the working powers available at any given

time to questions of their permanence and their future. In the third place, the

economic change in the circumstances of employment has served to introduce to the

notice of economists the necessity of certain agencies to counterbalance the lack of

self-direction and responsibility, agencies, that is, of education and combination.

In view of such and other developments, the great need of the present, apparent

nowhere more forcibly than with regard to the matter occupying our attention,

is on the one hand the careful modification of the general body of economic

reasoning in their light, and, on the other hand, continued close inductive study

into the circumstances of both the past and the present. This latter is indeed

necessary. To recognise this does not imply any disparageinent of other methods
required in other stages. In many of the subjects already singled out for notice

preliminary deductions have been made and have proved of the highest value.

The theory of non-competing groups, the earliest refutation of the wage-fund

theory, the theory of the effect upon productivity of altered hours and wages, afford

admirable instances of the way in which truths afterwards established on a wide

inductive basis were foreshadowed, and an estimate of their importance attempted

by writers proceeding along the lines of partial observation and large use of
assumption ; but these in common with other hke attempts must be regarded as

preliminary. They do not indicate, for instance, the extent to which the element

of which they treat is important. Surely it is just here that we see the necessary

relation and mutual importance of the different methods of study which have some-

times been treated as antagonistic. Preliminary and working theories are neces-

sary to the wise conduct of inductive inquiries, but these in their turn are

necessary to formulate a theory which may be something more or something other

than that which it supplants, which is to be representative in place of being

suggestive. But it is a grievous mistake to take the working theory for the necessary
736 - REPORT-- 1897.

substance, and to assume that the importance of all subsequent researches lies in

their connection with it, and that their function is its general verification and

further development, whereas they may bring about its actual subversion.

   A survey of the results achieved in a particular branch of Economics affords

an excellent opportunity for examining the mutual interaction of various methods
of study, and their combined progress. The work of the economists of the

period extending over the close of last century and the earlier portion of the

present one, a period which, as a living economist has well said, has been in-

aptly and unfortunately termed classical, was mainly occupied in preliminary
discussion and in its formulation of tlieories, some of which dealt with quali-
tative relations, and many of which must be viewed as working theories only.
They dealt, among other matters, with such questions as the connection between

the various classes of remuneration and their relation with value, the distinction

between utility and material, the causes necessitating payment, and the eflect of

condition upon the agents of production ; but in nearly every one of these

respects very much was left for subsequent generations of students to accomplish,
and the way for inductive research was but prepared. And much has been
accomplished. Theories have been modified, theories have been recast, and new

theories have been formulated.

But this gradual advance in study, necessary though it be and common though

it is to all sciences and subjects, stands at a peculiar disadvantage in the case of
social science, and, to take our particular case, in that of Economics. Here every-

thing is claimed, not only as a working theory for the investigator, but as one for

practical people and the statesman, and error is invested with grave, positive con-

sequences. Incorrect theories as to taxation led to the separation between England

and those colonies which now form the United States of America ; unsound eco-

nomic and social theories lit throughout Europe the cleansing if devouring fires of

the French Revolution ; unsound economic theories threatened to sap the vigour

of England in the third and fourth decade of the present century, and, to take a

specific instance, embodied themselves in the opposition to Factory Reform. This

peculiar gravity is at once the difficulty and the importance of economic study.

But when the mistakes of Economics, thus sadly illustrated, are cited in its dis-

paragement, does it never occur to those kindly anxious to enforce the salutary

lesson, how grave would have been the result had like importance been attached

to other sciences in their earlier stages? Have they not had their working
Atheories and made their mistakes ?
                                     review of the course of any one of these

shows that the difl'erence between such a one and Economics is not in greater

immunity from error, but in the degree of importance attaching to the error. This
Wein its turn has its lesson, or rather its lessons.
                                                      in this generation have to pay

for the wrong attitude assumed in previous times by those who confused working

and tentative theories applicable to one time and one place with truths of universal

application, proclaiming their belief with a trying absence of misgiving and hesita-

tion. On the other hand, the immense importance of sound economic knowledge,

the danger of that which is unsound, coupled with the fact that all legislation and

every person must have and will proceed on some economic theory, emphasises

the need of stimulating economic research and economic teaching. Other sciences

are needed by those training for particular professions ; this is needed by all those

who, either by action, word, or vote, have a part in the direction of the destinies

of a country. It has been suggested with cheap cynicism that differences among

economists disprove the utility and need of the study. "What a pitiable con-

fusion between the spheres of physical and social science. The majority of men

are none the worse in their daily life for a general ignorance of chemistry or

biology, but in the case of Economics matters are far otherwise. An average

citizen can do and does without a knowledge of theories of chemistry ; but some

economic theory he will have and some basis for economic action he has or assumes

that he has. The only point at issue is whether he should form his opinions after
study or in ignorance. Difi'er though they may on many points of detail and

method, economists at any rate will agree in the belief that study is a better

preliminary for economic action than neglect. Knowledge must be souglit by the

study both of economic method and of economic facts.

The particular question which has occupied our attention illustrates very

rividly the great advance made in economic knowledge of recent years. Taken by

itself as a type of the general progress which has taken place, a review of its

course should serve to reassure those who are tempted in moments of depression

to believe that the want of adequate recognition of the study is in some way or

other a symptom of its backwardness or failing vitality. The reverse is true. It

is the living character of Economics which leads to the demand that its importance

should be duly recognised. The advance has been remarkable. The spirit which

animates inquiry is as vigorous in the field of Economics as anywhere else. But
this much must be remembered. In Economics, as elsewhere, the attainment

to anything approaching a perfected theory is very far distant, for a complete

iheory implies not only full knowledge of facts, but their correct treatment.

How distant such a goal is the hardest worker in the field knows best of all, for

the circumstances of his inquiries teach him how slow progress is, and how great

the continent into which his enthusiasm as a pioneer has enabled him to penetrate
Asome little distance.
                        few generalisations which may endure, a somewhat

mixed mass of material, a brief influence, constitute the work of the foremost.

And yet in the history of any science there come times when things move more

rapidly than is their wont, as when waters chafing in a narrow passage suddenly

burst down all obstacles, and establish themselves once and for ever in a wider

channel. It is possible, it .seems even probable, that some such moment of advance

is before Economics. Materials have been accumulated with .singular diligence,

critical sagacity has discriminated and classified, and some great constructive

Advance seems not far distant. The atmosphere of economic thought is instinct

with expectation. With a new realisation of the economic elements and motives

of society, in the light of some conception perhaps little taken into account as yet,

we shall stand nearer to the problem one part of which we strive to unravel

the forces which govern action and constitute society.          >

1. The History of Trade Combination in Canada. By W. H. Moore.

     There hava been trade monopolies in Canada since the first settlement of the
country. The present movement toward trade combination began in the years of
depression caused by the low prices of agricultural products and the excessive
amount of capital invested in manufacturing industries. The latter, in part, the

result of the introduction of a system of high protection. The result of the com-
petition has been destructive, and with the development ofmachinery the economies
which give to a large business an advantage over a small business have had the
efifect of increasing the size of the factories, mills, and shops, and decreasing the
number of producers. The natural end of this destructive competition is monopoly
in the hands of one producer. This result has been hastened in some instances by
voluntary amalgamations of the businesses of different producers, and in others
deferred by a combination of independent producers for the regulation of matters
in which they have a common interest. This latter form of union is most common
in Canada. The agreements usually contain provisions for the arrangement of

·uniform price-lists, the diminution of the output, or the division of the market.

--Combinations of this kind exist, or have existed, in the production or sale of the

following goods : alkali, agricultural tools, biscuits, baking powders, blacklead,
blacking, blues, buckwheat flour, building paper, bolts and nuts, barbed wire,

binder twine, cigars, cheese (certain brands), cottolene, cocoas, chocolates, con-

soups, pressed tinware, rope, salt, soaps, starches, spikes, shovels, sugars, tobaccos,
Tarnishes, wire, wire nails.

     The manufacture of cotton goods, cigarettes, glass goods, watch cases, agri-
cultural implements, sugar, and other goods, is influenced by the existence of
monopolies fornaed by the union of producers, in which the individual interests are
merged in a common undertaking. The rebate plan is the method by which most
of the combinations attempt to enforce their objects. It is alleged on behalf of
the combination of independent producers, with some degree of truth, that they
have developed trade in foreign markets, improved the quality of the goods, and
prevented speculation. Against them it is urged they have increased the costs of
goods to consumers, and discriminated against the trade interests of certain dis-
tricts. The ' trust ' method is the more economical, and in several instances
businesses which were, previous to the formation of the ' trust,' almost bankrupt,
have been placed on a paying basis without an advance in the cost of goods to the

consumers.

     2. Recent Aspects of Profit Sharing} By Professor N. P. Gilmax,

                                    Meadville Theological School.

    1. The reasonableness of giving a dividend to labour is shown when we con-
sider that human nature is tbe same in the working man as in the employer. If

a share in the variable profits of business is held out as an inducement, the wage-
earner will be very apt to take more, interest in his work, and will help to make a
larger profit than under the usual conditions.

     2. Experience has shown that this reasoning is borne out by facts of record.
The case of the Bourne Cotton Mills at Fall Run, Mass., was taken to illustrate
the working of profit-sharing under unfavourable conditions. In the eight years
1889-97 the Bourne Mills paid bonuses amounting to 54 per cent, on wages, and
there was a great improvement in the quantity of the work done.

     3. There are now some 120 cases of proiit-sharing houses in France, 20 in

Germany, 100 in the British Empire, 50 in other parts of Europe, and 30 in the
U.S.A., making some 320 in all.

     4. This method is not to be recommended as a finality or a panacea, but, as the
treasurer of the Bourne Mills says, ' it is worthy of a trial by any fair-minded

business man as a modest attempt to improve upon the present wages system.'

  3. A Consideration of an EuroiJean Monopoly as a Contribution to the
Theory of State Industries. By S. M. Wickett, Ph.D., Toronto University.

     The great Austrian tobacco monopoly Is the oldest of all existing tobacco
monopolies, and as regards the population to which it applies and the number of
its employes also the largest. Dating from 1670, it nets the Government at present
 about 5,000,000/. yearly, or 14 per cent, of the total budget.

      This form of taxation has become very popular in Europe, for eight out of the
 seventeen European countries, embracing 38 per cent, of the population of Europe,
 have incorporated it into their financial system. Financial writers, too, have
 supported it, e.ff. Lorenz von Stein, Wagner, Roscher, and Leroy-Beaulieu.

      The first point to consider is the effects of concentration on the general condi-
 tions of labom\ The very satisfactory conditions of labour in the Austrian tobacco

 factories, notwithstanding the great labour concentration there (on the average
 1,181 in each factory) ; and, on the other hand, the highly unsatisfactory conditions
 under a system of scattered manufacture, as in Germany, point to the conclusion
 that a monopoly, in so far as it controls or reforms these latter, confers wide

 benefits.

     As to incentives to an economic administration imder State control, the

 Austro-Hungarian administrative system is suggestive. For by its administrative

-- --unification under one central authority the Ministry of Finance it excludes

all undue inter-state competition as to price and as to the quality of the manu-
factures; hut hy its divided technical management it preserves a healthy rivalry

as to satisfactory conditions of manufacture, and as to financial results to be credited

each half of the Empire at the end of the year.
     This inter-state or ' federal ' monopoly organisation ofTers a new idea for State

--activity control by central authorities, but technical management by provincial

officials for provincial credit. Even where the system of provincial credits does

not exist, the same principle of organisation will hold good for the general details

of manufacture.

    As to the efl'eets of the monopoly on export trade there are two features to be

considered : the danger of State monopolies being aftected in their sales abroad by
international relationships, a factor of direct influence on exportation, and seemingly

quite overlooked in financial treatises ; and secondly, the fact that State monopoly,
by increasing home manufacture, renders the question of actual export of relatively

small importance. Germany, for instance, for 1893, had a surplus of imports over

exports of  sixty-one  tons                         Austria of  exports  over imports of  sixty-seven.  And
                                                 ;

although this year is exceptional, the fact wiU serve to emphasise the point which

the foregoing years have sufficiently shown. This is in direct contradiction to

Koscher's opinion, and sets the question of monopoly export in a new light.

With regard to the actual weight of monopoly taxation, the enormous revenues

from tobacco would seem to indicate a high rate, that is, a decidedly high price

tariff. Austro-Hungary's tobacco revenue for 1893 was 3i^ million dollars

Italy's 30 millions, and that of France reached the high figure of 61 millions.

Yet everywhere we find cheap tobaccos for the small pocket-book. In Austria

in 1893, for instance, 50 per cent, of the cigarettes sold (retail) were at 2 c. per

package of ten ; 50 per cent, of the monopoly cigars sold (retail) were at f c. each
and under ; 54 per cent, of the imported Havanna cigars were at 4| c. each

73 per cent, of the smoking tobaccos were at 22 grammes for 1 c.

This surprising condition of aflairs largely explains itself by savings through

avoiding unnecessary competition, and by increased earnings otherwise going to

Anddifferent classes of capitalists (box-makers, lithographers, etc ).                    in fact, the

actual results of a close comparison of monopoly and competition tobacco prices

give results relatively not unfavourable to the former. Monopoly taxation does

not appear, therefore, to be at all as high as the large revenues would lead us to

suppose.

      Finally, as to the question of a progressive indirect tax, a tax said to be possible

only under a State monopoly. An investigation of the direction of tobacco con-

sumption under a monopoly shows such a tax to be prima facie improbable, since

the consumption tends so strongly to concentrate itself, as indicated, on very few

grades, these being, moreover, mamly of the cheaper qualities. On the other hand,

these latter qualities, representing machine work, leave a larger tax margin than do

the finer qualities consisting mostly of handwork.

The assumption then supporting the possibilities of a progressive rate, viz.,

. that the tobacco consumption will show a gradation as to quality somewhat like
 the schedules of a progressive income tax, cannot stand. And, on the other hand,

given the condition of a large revenue, for the same reasons the tax prices miist be

set simply according to fiscal principles, that is, according to what each quality

--will bear a good principle for fiscal manipulation, not for the realisation of the

idealised gradation. In fact, between such a principle and the latter there is no

direct connection. And in face of the above-mentioned tendency of the consump-

tion to the cheaper qualities, a progressive rate will be in general possible only
under a very low revenue tariff.

     These conclusions, the author hopes, will be found to possess a more or less

general validity making for a better understanding of the peculiar position of State

industries. For fuller details see the author's paper in Schanz's ' Finanz-Archif,'

      2. Canada and the Silver Question. By John DAVinsoN, D.Phil.

      The similarity of conditions existing in the United States and Canada renders
it remarkable that while the United States was being convulsed by the movement
for free silver, Canada was peacefully conducting an election on a mixed tariff and
 educational issue. The reason is not to be found in any lack of interest in Canada,
 but in forces partly political and agricultural, but mainly financial.

      Canada has been developed later than the Western States, and in consequence
neither has the burden of mortgages been so heavy nor has the fall of prices
affected the farmer so seriou.'sly. The development of the West has taken place
in Canada largely since 1880, and Canadian competition has contributed to the

fall in prices.

      The political causes of Canada's immunity are partly derived from the constitu-
tion which allows the Federal Government a larger field for its activity, because
provincial issues can be transferred to the Federal arena ; and are partly due to
the long period during which one party has held the reins of ofEce. The result of
 this latter force has been that a not vitally important issue has been kept before
the public mind as the universal panacea. As a remedy for depression the
Government party has demanded more protection, while the opposition has de-
manded freer trade.

     These, however, are simply contributory causes. The real reason lies in almost
perfect adaptation of the banking system of Canada to the needs of a new country,
and in the consequent absence of any soft money tradition. The greatest banking
necessity in a new country is elasticity in the issues ; the greatest danger is that
security will be sacrificed to elasticity. The supervision of bankmg legislation in
the colonies by the Imperial authorities, who were devoted adherents of the
principles of the Bank Charter Act, prevented the sacrifice of security when the
character of the system was being formed, and created a tradition of sound banking
 which has permitted financial questions to be regarded as problems for experts
and not for decision at the polls. Although now the Imperial authorities do and
 could exercise no supervision, there is an efficient substitute for that supervision
in the wide-spread respect for English precedent and example.

      The banking system has been a gradual growth, and has by successive amend-
ments been moulded to suit the needs of the community. With almost perfect
 security there is still such an elasticity in the issues that the volume of the
 circulation fluctuates in perfect harmony with the fluctuations in the volume of
business, not only over long periods but from month to month. The practice of
branch banking, which is the most striking characteristic of the system, greatly
facilitates this automatic correspondence, besides favouring the development of the
newer parts of the country by furnishing them with banking facilities as good as
can be obtained in the cities, and equalising the rate of discount throughout the
country, and thus providing farmers with capital at practically the same rate as it
can be obtained even in the commercial centres, provided they have equally good

-security to ofTer.

colonial restrictions of the Navigation Laws ; the effect of the abrogation of the

Corn Laws upon Canada ; the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 and the effects of its

abrogation in 1866 ; the period from 1867 to 1872 of a nominal revenue tariff

policy which, through extraneous causes, was one of practical protection ; the

revenue tariff years of 1873-79 in which American manufactures swept Canadian

competitors out of their own field ; the years of positive protection which followed

from then to the present time.

The influences of free-trade and protection, or alternate dependency upon the

American market, and upon the British fiscal system, up to the development of

Canadian fiscal independence, and the ability to regulate the Dominion tariff in

accordance with the wishes of its own people, and in harmony with its obligations

to the Empire, were traced at length. Some time was also given to a consideration

of the efforts made after confederation in 1867 to obtain reciprocity with the

United States.

The conclusion drawn was that Canada's true policy was one of closer com-

mercial relations with the Empire and the steady development of public opinion

in favour of a preferential taritt' system within its bounds. As to the past, the

author believed that Canada had practically run the whole gamut of fiscal

experiment and experience, and had tried every form of fiscal arrangement known

to theory or practical government.

1. National Policy and International Trade. By Edwin Cannan, M.A.

     The most widely followed and most generally approved policy in the civilised
world is still undoubtedly, as it has been for two or three centuries, the encourage-
ment of exportation and the discouragement of importation. This policy is no
longer founded on the idea that it is necessary in order to secure a large stock of
the precious metals ; that notion is completely obsolete. Nor is it founded on the
wish for diversification of industries ; this is shown by the popularity of the
Zollverein idea, which evidently sets no value whatever on local diversification of
industries even in an Empire consisting of enormous and scattered territories.
Nor, finally, is it founded on the idea of maintaining national security, or the host
of other reasons of a particularist, local, and consequently contradictory character
alleged by its more ingenious advocates in various countries. Its true source is to
be looked for in the fact that exports are supposed to give employment, and
imports to take it away, so that encouragement of exports and discouragement of
imports tends to increase employment. The usual free-trade answers that exports
only balance imports are unsatisfactory, and left a loophole for the entrance of the
742 EEPORT--1897.

pernicious notion that ' artificially cheap ' imports, such as the products of prison

labour, or of ' bounty-fed trades,' diminish employment. The elementary economic
text-books have scarcely furnished any answer since the doctrine that ' industry
is limited by capital ' was abandoned. The truth of the matter is that industry is

Alimited by labour, i.e., the amount of employment depends on the population.

policy of protection cannot increase population, and consequently employment,
except temporarily and under very special circumstances. It is doubtful, however,
whether ' increase of employment ' has not come to be used in a metaphorical
sense, as simply equivalent to increase of pay for the same work. But if this is
granted, tbe protectionist argument falls to pieces, as there was no reason for sup-
posing that the advantages of division of labour cannot be obtained by territorial
groups co-operating as well as by groups on other than a territorial basis and by

separate individuals.

     The true national policy is to take as much advantage of the division of labour
as possible. The individual who gets most advantage from it is the one who is
able to do the most skilled work in the best way, and the same thing is true of a
nation. What statesmen ought to do, therefore, is to aim at improving the finest
industrial qualities in the population. There are many wavs of promoting this

aim, but one of the most important is to allow free importation of the most
ingenious and most cheaply produced products of other countries.

 3. Crown Revenues in Lower Canada (1763-1847). By J. A. McLeait.

     The 'financial difficulties ' that arose in the Government of Lower Canada
between 1791 and 1841 were not, in the last analysis, financial, but constitutional.

They may be regarded as forming the pomids, shillings, aud pence side of the

struggle for self-government. The Assembly of Lower Canada, desiring self-

government as an end, endeavoured to gain control of the Crown revenues as a

means. From 1791 to 1831 these Crown revenues consisted of (1) The casual

and  territorial  revenues                                     (2)  The revenues arising under the Quebec llevenue

             (3)

to which may be added another small aid, granted in 1801.

In 1831, on the recommendation of the Canada Committee of 1828, the pro-

ceeds of the Quebec Revenue Act were surrendered without reserve or condition

to the control of the Provincial Legislature. This surrender weakened the Pro-

vincial Executive, and encouraged the House of Assembly to hope that consti-
tutional reforms might be obtained by withholding supplies. From October 1832

to the suspension of the Constitution no supplies were voted by the House. In

1836 the Home Government finally decided to apply the provincial moneys to the

payment of arrears without the sanction of the Provincial Legislature. Their

constitutional weapon being thus vn-ested from their grasp, the thoughts of a
large number of the French Canadians turned towards separation from England,

republicanism, independence.

By the Union Act of 1840 the casual and territorial revenues were surrendered

with some reservations and conditions to the Provincial Legislature. Most im-

portant was the deduction of 75,000/. for a Civil List. In 1847, at the request

of the Canadian Parliament, the appropriation clauses of the Union Act were

repealed, and the Civil List was made to rest upon provincial enactment. Since

1847 all expenditures of the Government have been made under the authority of

the Canadian Parliament, consequent^, since 1847, it has been necessary for a

Canadian Governor-General, entirely apart from his own opinions on the subject

of colonial self-government, to choose as his constitutional advisers those who,

possessing the confidence of the Lower House, can induce Parliament to vote

supplies.

Responsible government became necessary the moment that the Legislature

gained full control of the Provincial Treasury. The political situation compelled

the solution, and credit is due not only to the great British statesmen who were

able to realise the political situation, but also to the great Canadians who

created it.

4. The Evolution of the MefrojMlis, and Problems in Metropolitan

    Government. By Wm. H. Hale, Ph.D. Brooklyn, iV". Y., U.S.A.

   A brief statement is made of the development of Greater New York, otherwise

called the city of New York, as it will be constituted on and after January 1,
1898, by the consolidation of the cities of New York, Brooklyn, and Long Island

city, the county of Richmond (Staten Island), and a part of the county of Queens.

The new consolidated city of New York will be second only to London in popula-

tion, and will contain a population estimated at 3,430,000, being more than that

of the United States when the Government of that country was founded, and
greater than that of any other State of the Union at the present time except Penn-

sylvania, Ohio, and Illinois ; or nearly equal to the combined population of the

provinces of Ontario and Quebec.

     The government of the vast aggregation of heterogeneous elements drawn from
all quarters of the globe presents new and difficult problems in American juris-
prudence, which the writer hoped would receive elucidation at this meeting.

    The charter of Greater New York provides for the novel and interesting

experiment of a bi-cameral municipal government, the municipal assembly being

--composed of two Houses the common council of twenty-nine members, of whom

the president is elected by the city at large, and the other members by districts
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

and the board of aldermen of sixty-one members, elected one from each district.
The mayor of the city has a seat and voice, but no vote in the Upper House, and
heads of departments in the Lower.

     The resei-vation to the city of ownership of all public franchises -was charac-
terised as the most notable reform in municipal government. The charter limits
the term for which such franchises may be leased to individuals to twenty-five-
years, with renewal for the same period.

     The extension of the elective system to all the judiciary was recommended by

tie writer, in lieu of the system of appointment by the mayor, which is now the-

case with police justices.

           5. Local Differences in Discount Rates in the United States.

                          By R. M. Breckenridge, Ph.D.

     The annexed table of discount statistics for forty-three leading commercial cities
of the United States shows :

     (a) That there is no such regularity or generality in the prevalence of low rates
in the large cities, or of high rates in the smaller cities, as to permit the explana-
tion of local differences in discount rates by differences in population between the

cities appearing in the reports
                                                                                                                                                                      ;
      (6) That a similar lack of uniformity in the emergence of low rates in towns

where clearings are large, and vice vetscc, prevents the establishment of any close
connection between cheap discounts and heavy exchanges, as indicated by clearing

returns;

      (c) That rates of interest upon loans on the security of urban and suburban landed
property show a tendency, in their varying heights as between localities generally,
though not exactly or always at the same distance, to follow the movements of

discount rates

      (d) That discount rates appear to be high in proportion as the cities for which
they are quoted are remote in western or southern direction from the States on the
North Atlantic seaboard of the United States, more particularly from the foremost
commercial and financial centres of that region; the cities with heaviest clearings
and largest population in each of the other great divisions of the country, in other
words, the chief money markets of each section, show, however, somewhat low-er
rates than places of less consequence in such sections.

       Result (d) appears more clearly in the following tables.

from the lowest rate quoted weekly for such cities, and may consequently he held
to represent the price paid for discount of the best paper which was made in those

localities.

      Differences in the rate of discount charged upon the hest paper brought to
market so greatly to the disadvantage of districts remote from the chief money
markets of the land, do not emerge in countries where a number of large banks
extend their activity into every considerable district by means of numerous branches
and agencies, e.g., as in Scotland and Canada ; nor where a great central bank, in
observance either of the law or of its own interest, provides identical facilities to
discount customers in every market of consignment, e.g., as in France, Germany,
Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium and Japan.

      It is submitted, therefore, that differences in discount rates as between the
various cities and geographical divisions of the United States are chiefly to be
explained by the peculiarities of the banking system of that country. It consists of
nine thousand odd 'National,' 'States' and private banks, each conf.ned in the
main to one locality, and the neighbourhood immediately thereto adjacent, as
well in its borrowing as in its lending business. But 3,600 banks, in round
numbers, enjoy privileges of issue, and these are extremely restricted in character.
Just as there exists no adequate machinery for gathering up loanable capital from
the older and accumulating groups of the population and applying it further west
and south, to the exploitation of natural resources and of other undertakings, the
development of which is in progress, or awaits the beginning, so is there no
efficient system of domestic arbitrage, nor even an approximate equalisation of
discount rates.

          --Peesident of the Section G. F. Deacon, M.Inst.C.E.

                             THURSDAY, AUGUST 19.

       Tlie President delivered the following address:

In this ever-memorable year of the Victorian Age, it is not unnatural that
anyone called to fill the chair I occupy to-day should experience a sense of oppres-
sion, when contemplating the fruits of mechanical science during the last sixty
years, and the tremendous vista, fading in the distance to a dream, of the fruits it
is destined to produce before such another period shall have passed away.

     There would be no possibihty, in the time at my disposal, even if I were

cjualified to attempt it, of adequately reviewing the past ; and however fascinating

the thought may be, it would ill become my office to venture far along the vista

before us, lest a too airy imagination shoidd break the bonds of that knowledge
and that truth to which she must ever remain, in our rightful speculations, a
helpful, if not always an obedient, handmaiden.

      In the year 1831, two places, the one ancient and memorable, the other young,
but destined to become memorable, bore the name of York. At the first of these,

amid relics of ancient Rome and lasting memorials of the better phases of Britain's

mediaeval history, were met together in that year the earliest members of the

British Association. And as the sun at noonday shone on that ancient York, it
rose upon the other York --a little town, scarcely more than a village, of 1,700
people, fast springing from a plain on the shores of Ontario, where the wigwam

of the Chippewa had lately been ; and between the two lay the Atlantic and a

distance of 3,800 miles.
      Sixty-six years later, the British Association meets in that other York, dis-

tinguished under the name of Toronto, and grown into a noble city. Painfully, in
stage coaches, must many of the founders of this Association have travelled to that
ancient York peacefully and amid all comfort and luxury have we from the

                                                         ;

--mother country reached, at her invitation, this great city chiefest, in her people,

her commerce, and her University, of the cities of Western Canada.

     Neither at the meeting in York of 1831, nor elsewhere, until many years later,
was there any expectation of the possibility of these things. Six years later,
about the beginning of that glorious reign of which the sixty-first year is now

--passing although two or three vessels had already crossed the Atlantic under

steam, it was still seriously doubted whether, without the aid of a Government

subsidy of considerable amount, a line of steamers, even for the New York service,

could be permanently maintained. It was not, indeed, until 1838 that the Great
 Western inaugurated the attempt on a commercial basis, and she performed in
fifteen days the vovage which is now regularly performed with complete com-

mercial success in five.
748 EEPORT--1897.

Would not the suggestion of such a change, of such a spanning of great dis-

tances, of such a consequent growth of prosperity and of culture, within the reign

of a princess then approaching womanhood, have been received as the wildest of

forecasts by the British Association of 1831 ?

Yet this is but one of a multitude of results, no less startling, which the same
Weagencies have brought about.
                                are now holding the second meeting of the

Association in Canada, and at the first such meeting, held thirteen years ago in

Montreal, some hundreds of miles nearer home, Sir Frederick Bramwell told you
from this chair, in his own inimitable way, the causes of so great a change, and he

pointed out to you, as I venture to point out again, that the visible instruments of

that change have been forged by the men who are, or were, or ought to be, the mem-

Gbers of Section Q. To such encouragement as Section has given is largely due

the progress and triumph of applied mechanics as the natural outcome of theoretical

investigation and physical research. Finally, and with no reserve in the minds of

reasonable men. the old fallacy of a discord between theory and practice has been

swept away. For centuries that fallacy held apart, as it were, the oxygen and

the nitrogen of that atmosphere in which alone the new life could exist. It limited
the philosopher who examined the laws of nature almost entirely to the study of

phenomena external to the earth on which he dwelt, and it stamped the practical
man as a lower being, the possessor of certain necessary knowledge, having no

relation to the studies of the schoolmen, and which it would be beneath their

dignity to pursue. And notwithstanding the great names which have stood out in

opposition to these views, the popular idea of discord between theory and practice

took long to die, and only within the Victorian Age has the complete truth been

generally recognised, that if one fails to account for the result of any physical

combination, the cause is to be found not in any discord with theory, tjut in the

fact that the observer has failed to discover the whole of the theory.

   We English-speaking people, alone, I believe, among civilised nations, use this

--word, theory, with unpardonable looseness as almost s3'nonymous in effect with

hypothesis, and the result is fruitful of error. Until the truth of any hypothesis is

placed beyond all manner of doubt it is not, and should never be called, the

theory.

    Within these walls, the genius loci impels me to thoughts which have not

Goften entered into discussions of Section ; and, perhaps, if this address were to

be discussed, I should choose subjects and premises, the proof of which, to the

satisfaction of others than myself, it would probably be less difficult to maintain.

In this University of Toronto under whose cegis all that was best in the older

schools of thought is cultivated by the side of those practical applications of

science which in bygone days were distinguished as the unworthy uses of philo-

sophy, one's thoughts insensibly turn to the marvellous change in the opportunities

--afibrded for acquiring a knowledge of applied science for beginning, in short, the

career of an engineer.

     It is not proposed to discuss the progress and prosperity which mechanical

science has brought about in the Victorian Era, much less that which the suc-

ceeding years will yield ; but I venture to think that a proper subject for con-

sideration from this chair, if not for discussion in this Section, is to be found in

any unnecessary waste of energy which may occur in the process of mental
development of the men who are to succeed us in the great work to which
we devote our lives. Obviously it is to the interests of our calling, and conse-

quently of the nation at large, that such waste should be reduced to a minimum,
and therefore I make no apology for mentioning certain points in which its presence
is particularly striking. There may be waste of potential, as well as of actual

energy, and if we fail to expend energy on certain subjects because our time

is occupied with others which are less useful, it is waste of energy only differ-

ing in degree from its expenditure on useless subjects. There is assuredly no lack

of potential energy in the coming race. In spite of any training, whether well oi"

ill directed, a large proportion will become actual and useful energy ; but guidance
and direction being given, the mode of that guidance and direction should be the
one best calculated to secure the highest possible proportion of useful effect.

If we look back at the greatest names among the engineers and inventors of the

latter part of the eighteenth century and the first half of this, we find that tho

majority were brought up in pursuits quite distinct from the work of their after

lives, and by which they have become so familiar to us. There were scarcely any

means whatever, beyond the original thought and dogged perseverance of the

worker, by which those men could attain the knowledge they used with such

effect. Men of no less exceptional parts are among us now, but the whole environ-

Wement of their early work has changed.                                                have given to the exceptional man a

starting-point of knowledge which, wisely used, lifts him as high above our heads

as of old, but we have given to the average man a comparatively easy means of

Weattaining the same knowledge.                                                        cannot ensure the wise use of that linowledge,

but we can at least endeavour to impart it in such a manner that the sense of

Woright proportion shall be acquired and maintained.                                                                            have made it more
--difficult to distinguish between the exceptional and the commonplace between

the gold and the silver, if not between the silver and the brass ; let us be careful,

so far as early guidance can control it, that the knowledge imparted to the average

mind gives to that mind a fair start concerning the relations, undivided and

indivisible, between true theory and sound practice.

Having myself passed as an ordinary apprentice through workshops of

--mechanical engineering in the old days when working hours were longer than

they now are from six in the morning till six in the evening, and that, too, on the

banks of the Clyde, where no special indulgence was given to what was sometimes

called the ' gentleman apprentice,' and feeling convinced, as I still do, of the

immense and permanent advantage derived from that experience, I shall not be

judged to underrate its value in the case of others who have yet to choose the

details of the career by which they expect to gain a place in the profession or

business of an engineer.

On the other hand, as a student thirty-four years ago under the late Professor

Macquorn Eankine and the present Lord Kelvin, I shall not be prone to under-

estimate the advantages of academical training in its proper application to the

profession to which I am proud to belong.

-- myIn the pursuit of that profession it has fallen to                                lot to observe the training

as engineers of many younger men men of variously constituted minds, but one

and all bent on learning some portion of ' the art of directing the great sources of

power in nature for the use and convenience of man,' words wisely chosen, sixty-

nine years ago, and set out as the object of the profession in the Royal Charter of

the Institution of Civil Engineers. It is a noble object, this direction of the great

forces of nature for the use and conve7iience of man ; it is an ambitious object, and

one which I venture to think demands for its right performance the best energies

of well-balanced minds working upon a store of knowledge which nothing but years

of untiring study and observation can give. Yet tliere is no hesitation shown to

enter the lists. The number of candidates is appalling. ' In the old country, at

least, there certainly is not work for all, but when one points this out, anxious

parents only reply that the difficulty is as great in connection with any other

profession. Whether this be so or not I cannot judge, but I am persuaded that of
those who do enter the business or profession of the engineer, the enormous majority

are not born engineers, and cannot, in the nature of things, hope for success unless

--they take advantage of the best facilities open to them the best facilities
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

here is the difficidty : from the multitude of facilities how are we to choose ?

Do not suppose that I think the training of the born engineer should not be

controlled. He will stand head and shoulders above the rest of us whatever we

may do with him                                                                        but in order that his exceptional parts  may not  wreck  him  as
                                                                                    ;

an engineer, and in order that his energies may be rightly directed at the start,

he, too, should have the advantages of that systematic training which to his less

gifted brethren is becoming more and more absolutely essential to success.
    At the time I began practice the large majority of young engineers were left

entirely to their own devices so far as the attainment of any scientific knowledge
was concerned. As pupils or apprentices, articled or not, they entered an engineer's

works or office ; for a certain number of years they had the run of the place and
750 REPORT-- 1897.

some encouragement if they worked ·well, but it could not, in the nature of things,

amount to much more. This was a very necessary, perhaps the most necessary,
element of their training ; but except to the few who were so constituted that with

little or no guidance they could supplement their practical knowledge with the
study of principles elsewhere, it was entirely ineii'ectual in the production of that

well-balanced attitude of mind which any person who properly assumes the name

of an engineer must hold towards every engineering problem, great or small, which

he is called upon to solve. And so strongly have I felt this, that in the earlier

days, when there were fewer schools of practical science, and when their utility

was little understood, I required, wherever the matter was under my control, the

insertion into the articles of apprenticeship of a clause by which, at some incon-
venience to the office, the pupil was required to attend two sessions at the science
classes of Glasgow University, or at some other approved school of practical
science ; and without this condition 1 decUned to take the responsibility attaching
to the introduction into the profession of men who, in their earlier careers, from no
fault of their own, had not even acquired a knowledge of what there was to learn,

much less of how to learn it.
     More recently this course has generally become unnecessary ; for in West-

minster, at least, the young engineer rarely enters an office until he has acquired

some knowledge of what he has to learn. He enters, in short, at a much more
advanced age than formerly. When it is essential that he should be earning-

something soon after he comes of age, anything like a complete training is an
impossibility ; his work ceases to be general, and his practice is more or less con-

fined in a much narrower sphere than need be the case if the pursuit of further

knowledge continues to be his chief duty.

    But whatever course his circumstances may permit him to adopt, the difficulty

of gaining the reqiured knowledge in the time available is a serious one. This i»
not the place to inquire whether public school education in the mother country
is, or is not, the best for the general purposes of after life, or to discuss what

improvements may be made in it ; and of higher education in Canada I unfortu-
nately know little or nothing. Personally I admit the possibility of improvement

in the English system, and slowly but surely improvement is creeping in, as such

changes rightly find their way into institutions which have done so much for

Englishmen. In this particular I lean to the conservative side, and whatever our

individual views may be concerning the time spent on the study of Latin and
Greek, we should all probably agree that the school education of an engineer

should be as thorough and liberal as for any other profession. But for the sake of

a technical training to follow, this school education is often unduly curtailed, to

the great after-grief, in very many cases, of the successful engineer, and not

infrequently also of the less successful engineer who, in some phases of his pro-

fessional career, has been only too keenly alive to the self-reproach and sense of
inferiority which want of thoroughness or of time, or of both, at school has

brought upon him.
     But at some time the boy must leave school. Let us hope that he does not

aspire ' to control the great forces of nature ' ; but if he does we must ^make the
best we can of him.

      It is not desirable, at least so it appears to me, that even at this stage his

training should be specialised in view of the particular branch of the profession
or business he is likely to follow. The fundamental principles of any branch of

mechanical engineering are broadly the fundamental principles of any branch of

the profession. I hesitate to speak of civil engineering as if it were a separate

branch, instead of being, as it really is, the generic name of the profession ; but
the training demanded for the various branches of civil engineering in its narrower
 sense is precisely the same as that required in its earlier stages for mechanical

engineering pure and simple.
     I shall make no attempt to review the large number of excellent courses which

 are now available for the teaching of applied science in relation to engineering.
Experience of the results as judged by the students who have come directly under

my notice, and examination of many calendars, has aroused various thoughts con-
                                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.        751

cerning them, and this thought is perhaps uppermost : are u-e not vi some cases

attempting at^ too early a stage the teaching of subjects instead of principles f
Complete subjects, I mean, including the practical working of details which will
become the regular study of the student in the office or works of an engineer. It

certainly seems to me to be so. I do not say that subject training of this kind
at college may not be useful ; but we have to consider whether it does not, for the

sake of some little anticipation of his office work, divert the attention of the student

from the better mastery of those principles which it is so essential for him to grasp

at the earliest possible time, and which do not limit his choice in the battle of life
to any branch whatever of the profession or business of an engineer, but which,
on the contrary, qualify him better to pursue with success whatever branches his

inclination or his opportunities or his means may suggest. Not one in a hundred
of us can hope to emulate the careers of exceptional men in our profession, but it

is sometimes useful to observe those careers, and whenever we do so we find the
very reverse of specialisation. The minds of such men are impregnated with the
fundamental principles which we may call the common law of our art ; it has

happened that their practice has been large in certain branches, and small or

wanting in certain others ; but in any it would have been equally successful. Of
no class of men can it be said with greater truth than of engineers that their

standard should be sound knowledge of the principles of many things and of the

practice of a few.

There is some danger in the usual limitation of compulsory subjects in examina-

tions for certificates and degrees. When an examination has to be passed subjects

not made compulsory are too often entirely neglected, however important to the
Aengineer they maybe.
                                        little learning is certainly not a dangerous thing if

within its limits it is sound, and every engineer will in after life be grateful to

those who in his student days insisted upon his acquiring some knowledge of the

principles of such subjects as electricity and chemistry. At present it too often

happens that, unless an engineering student is predestined to practise electrical

work or some chemical industry, he begins life as an engineer with little or no

knowledge of the principles of either the one or the other, and chiefly as a result

of their neglect for the sake of certain subjects made compulsory for the test he has

had to pass, which subjects too often include highly speciahsed details which, I

venture to think, cannot be rightly mastered in schools. It is natural and right

that each professor of a principal subject should seek to make the best, from his
own particular standpoint, of every student who attends his lectures or his labora-

tories                         and the  professor of a compulsory  subject cannot be expected to encourage
                            ;

the inclusion, in a course already overcrowded, of secondary or collateral subjec'ts

which are dealt with by other professors; while, on the other hand, the pro-

fessors of secondary subjects, such as electricity or chemistry, not unnaturally

value chiefly the students who make those subjects their principal work.

For these reasons it appears to me that a certain very moderate standard in all

such subjects should be made compulsory if a certificate of proficiency, whether by

degree or otherwise, is to be given to students of engineering.

     In the teaching of mathematics within the Victorian age a considerable change
lias taken place, and I plead for still a little more change in the same direction wheTe

the training of the engineer is concerned. Mathematics, as taught in our public

schools-- let us say for the Cambridge University Tripos--may be all that is
claimed for it as a mode of mental culture ; but of kindred mental culture the
engineer must necessarily have more than most men, and much might therefor©

be omitted which, to hun at least, has only an abstract value, to the great advan-

tage of his mastery over those branches which at once train his mind and give
point and direct utility to his solutions.

     In America I understand that a college course of engineering generally includes
workshop practice designed to supersede the old system of apprenticeship to a
mechanical engineer. This fact and other important diflerences between the

English and American practice have only lately come to my knowledge, and before

they did so the substance of this address had been written. It might, in some

particulars, require modification as applied to Canada, but it remains the result of
 752 REPORT-- 1897.

 my observations concerning the conditions of engineering education which ohtain

 in the mother country.

    A few words now in relation to that physical and mental training gained

 laboriously, and somewhat wastefullyas I think, at the joiner's bench, in the fitting
 and turning shops, the foundry and the forge, during the old course of mechanical
 engineering apprenticeship. I am convinced that the kind of knowledge which
 comes of thoughtful chipping and filing and turning and forging, though only
 applied to a few of the materials with which in after life the engineer has to deal,
 are quite as important as tables of density and strength to his future sense of
 Tightness in constructive design. The use of such work is not merely to teach one
the parts and combinations of any particular macliiue ; in a still higher degree it
is the insensible mastery of a much more subtle knowledge or mental power, the

apphcation of the senses of sight and touch and force, it may be of other senses
Also, to the determination of the nature of things. (1 am not going to apologise

 for referring to the sense of force. The vexed question of its separate existence

appears to me to have been settled fourteen years ago by Lord Kelvin in his
 address at Birmingham on * the six gateways of knowledge,' and I may well leave

it where he left it.) I should altogether fail to describe adequately what this
mastery means. It appears to me to be inscrutable. The value and nature of the

power can only be appreciated by those who have experienced it, and who have
felt its defect in those of their assistants or in others who do not possess it.

      But the great workshop training has still further advantages. The apprentice
is surrounded by skilled workers from whose example, if he is wise, he learns a

great deal ; and apart from this it is no small profit to have rubbed against the

British workman, to have discovered what manner of man he is, and to compre-
hend how little the world knows of his best parts. The whole time spent in large

engineering works cannot, however, be uniformly beneficial ; the apprentice must
take the work as it comes ; the most interesting or instructive portions cannot be
reserved for him, and he often feels that some of his time is being well-nigh

wasted.

   A few years ago I should not have thought it practicable usefully to substitute

for such a course anything that could be undertaken in a student's workshop, how-
ever organised ; but the impossibility, in many cases, of including such experience

without neglecting something equally important has led me to view with satisfac-

tion the introduction of workshop training into certain schools of applied science in

England. Such a change cannot of course carry with it all the advantages of
experience in the great workshop and of contact with its workers, but those

-advantages which it does retain may be secured in a shorter time where there is

uo commercial interest to be served.
     In Canada and the United States, as I have already said, the principle of the

student's workshop has been carried considerably further. Compared with the

·old country, I believe the number of young assistant engineers who in proportion to
the number of their chiefs can find employment in America is much greater, and that

it would be practically impossible for the British system of pupilage to be generally
employed. Here, therefore, the whole college training of an engineer is designed
to tit him for immediate employment in some specific branch of the profession,
and up to this point his training is, necessarily no doubt, more academic than in
England, where the application of the principles he has acquired at college is still

generally left for the office or works of the engineer. With this diflerence I am

not at present concerned, but I desire to reiterate what I have already said to the

efl'ect that where, as in England, the student of engineering has the opportunity of

continuing his training in the office or works, it is better that his limited college
course should cover all that is possible of the principles of those sciences which

may prove useful or necessary to him in after life, rather than that any of them

should be omitted for the sake of anticipating the practical application of certain

others.

     The compulsory inclusion of the principles of all such subjects as chemistry,
electricity, geology, and many others, in science courses intended for a future
·engineer is desirable not only because a fundamental knowledge of them leaves
                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION G.                               753

open a very much wider field from which the engineer may, as opportunity offers,
increase his knowledge and practice in the future, but because many of such sub-

jects are inseparable from an intelligent understanding of almost any great

engineering work. ' Nothing so difficult as a beginning ' may be a proverb of

rather too far-reaching a nature, but it contains the suggestion of a great truth,

increasing in weight as we grow older, and the beginnings of such coUateral

sciences should therefore find a place in every engineering student's store of early

knowledge.

   --But after all, when these things have been done in the best manner when the

scientific and practical training of the engineering student has been all that can be

desired, it is a matter of general experience among engineers who have closely

watched the rising generation that the most successful men in after life are not

produced exclusively from the ranks of those whose college coui'se has been most

successful. No doubt such men have on the average been nearer the top than the

bottom, but it is an undoubted fact that when we class them according to their

Weearlier successes or failures we find the most remarkable disparities.   find

many who in academic days gave but little promise, and we miss large numbers

who promised great things. These facts are not confined to the profession of the

Weengineer, but they seem to me to be accentuated in that profession.  shall no

doubt be right in attributing the disparity to diSerences of mental temperament

and of opportunity ; but does it follow tliat there are no faculties which may be

cultivated to reduce the effect of such differences ? I venture to think there are.

I will instance only one, but perhaps the most important of such faculties, and which

in my experience among young engineers is exceptionally rare. I refer to the power

of marshalling facts, and so thinking:, or speaking, or writing of them that each

maintains its due significance and value.

In the minds of many young engineers exceptional mathematical powers often

have the effect of making it extremelv difficult to avoid spending an amount of time

upon some issues out of all proportion to their importance ; while other issues

which do not readily lend themselves to mathematical treatment, but which are

many times more important, are taken for granted upon utterly insufficient data,

and chiefly because they cannot be treated by any process of calculation. I

believe that nothing but well-directed observation and long experience can enable

one to assign to each part of a large engineering problem its due importance

but much may be done in early training also, and I think ought to be done,

to lead the mind in broader lines, to accustom it to look all round the problem,

and to control the imagination or the natural predilection for one phase from

disguising the real importance of others. In the practical design and execution of

important works the man will sooner or later be recognised who has the power so

to formulate his knowledge, and on the same principles has succeeded in so

marshalling and expressing his thoughts, as to convey to those by whom he is

employed just so much as may be necessary and proper for their use.

     Such considerations are not, it is true, a branch of mechanical science, but

being essentially important to the attainment of maximum usefulness iu the

application of any science to the various branches of engineering which are the

chief ends and aims of mechanical science, they are, I think, worthy of mention

from this chair.

In proportion as the engineer possesses and exercises such powers he will avoid

those innumerable pitfalls to which imperfectly instructed ingenuity is so particu-

larly liable, and to which the Patent Office is so sad a witness ; and in the same
proportion must always be the useful outcome of the great schools of science

which hava become so striking a feature of the later Victorian age.

In relation to the results of applied science, I have spoken only of the steam-

ship ; add the telegraph, and I think we have the most important tools by which
the present conditions of modern civilisation have been rendered possible. And

more than this, I think we have, in the lessening of space, and the facility for

intercourse they give, the chief secret of that marvellous development of the

empire which this year has so pleasantly and so memorably signalised.  Is ' Our

its beginning in 1779, under General Haldimand, to the present time. Also some
remarks on the growth of population and commerce, together with a comparison
of the chief characteristics of the rival routes for the western trade ; and the

 By Professor Henry T. Bovey, M.Inst.C.E., and J. T. Farmer, Ma.E.

    This paper commenced with a general description of the equipment in the Hy-

draulic Laboratory, McGill University, Montreal, and then discussed in detail the

--principal pieces of apparatus. Amongst these, especial reference was made to the

following :

     The valvp arrangement in the experimental tank by which the orifice plates
can be easily taken out and replaced by others, with the loss of not more than a
pint of water, whatever the head over the orifice might be.

   A jet-measurer, by which the sectional dimensions of a jet at any point of its

path can be rapidly and accurately determined.

    An imjKict machine for measuring the force with which water issuing from

orifice nozzles or pipes strikes buckets or vanes of different forms and sizes.

   A pressure chamber which defines more accurately the mean pressure at any point

of a mass of water flowing through a pipe. The main feature of this chamber is
the substitution for the small holes usually adopted of a continuous opening less
than -005 inch in width, around the bore.

   A selfadjusting dynamometer giving the drag in a single reading. One half of

the brake-band is of leather and one half of copper, the angle of contact for each
material being very approximately 180°. The frictional resistance of the leather
is greater than that of the copper. Thus, if the band friction should increase, the
drag would also increase, a portion of the leather would be unwrapped, an equal
portion of the copper would he brought into contact so that the frictional resistance
would be less, and the drag would continue to diminish until dynamical equilibrium
had again been established. If the band-friction should diminish, a reverse process
would be the result.

    A triple-throw single-acting experimental pump, designed for a maximum speed

of 150 revolutions per minute against a pressure of 120 lb. per square inch. The

pump has interchangeable valves, and is also provided with a specially designed

       2. The Strength of Columns. By Professor Gaetano Lanza-

    An attempt to compute the strength of any given column by the various rules

and formulae commonly found in different handbooks, and books written by so-

called authorities, will speedily reveal considerable discrepancies, not only in the
formuloe, but also in the results.

    Hence it becomes a matter of importance to make a careful study of the tests
that have been made, under practical conditions, on columns of such, sizes and
proportions as are used in construction ; for, whether we desire to adopt empirical
formulae or to endeavour to obtain rational ones, the final tests of all theories and
formulae must be whether they agree with the facts as shown by the results of

such tests.

   A summary is therefore given of the principal experiments that have been

made of columns of practical sizes.
     The greater part of the tests contained in this list were made on the United

States testing machine of eight hundred thousand pounds capacity, located at the
arsenal at Watertown, Massachusetts. The details of these tests are published in
special yearly reports issued by the Ordnance Department of the United States
Government.

     The following is the summary :

     In order to represent to the eye the results of these tests, and therefore to
enable us to discuss them, the following diagrams are presented :

square inch of sectional area is practically constant up to a certain ratio of lengtli
to radius of gyration, which in wrought-iron bridge columns varies from sixty to

eighty, and in a corresponding way to timber columns.

mens prepared from the beams tested transversely. The following inferences were
drawn :

     (a) The tensile strength does not seem to be much affected by kiln-drying, but

in the majority of cases it is diminished.
      (b) Kiln-drying invariably and greatly increases the compressive strength.
      (c) Kiln-di-ying invariably and greatly diminishes the shearing strength, and

therefore increases the tendency of beams to fail by longitudinal shear.
     (d) The transverse strength is increased by kiln-drying, in consequence of the

increased strength given to the portion of the timber in compression.
      (e) Kiln-drying increases the co-efficient of elasticity, and with kiln-dried

specimens the changes of deflection and length are practically directly proportional
to the changes of load, whether the specimen is being loaded or relieved of load.

     (f ) The last (viz. e) is also true of specimens in a normal state, i.e. specimens in
which the moisture is in equilibrium with the moisture present in the atmosphere.

      (g) Timber ia extremely sensitive to variations in the hygrometric condition of
the atmosphere.

     (h) The development of shakes and the tendency to longitudinal shear are
much less in specimens which have been air-dried than in those which have been

kiln-dried.

    As the result of some experiments by electrical methods on the measurement

of the temperature changes of the walls and steam in the cylinder of a working
steam-engine, which were made at the McDonald Engineering Building of IMcGill
University in the summer of 1895, the authors arrived at the conclusion that the
well-known phenomena of cylinder condensation could be explained, and the

amount of condensation in many cases predicted, from a knowledge of the indicator

card, on the hypothesis that the rate of condensation of steam, though very great,

was not infinite, but finite and measurable. An account of these experiments was

communicated to the Institute of Civil Engineers in September 1896, and will, it
is hoped, be published in the course of the ensuing year. In the meantime the
authors have endeavoured to measure the rate of condensation of steam under dif-

ferent conditions by a new and entirely different method, with a view to verify the

results of their previous work, and also to estimate the probable effect of wetness
or superheating of the steam, and the infliuence, if any, of the film of water adhering
to the walls of the cylinder.

5. Tests on the Triple-expansion Engine at Massachusetts Institute oj

      Technology. By Cecil H. Peabody, Professor of Marine Engineer-

       ing and Naval Architecture.

     The experimental engine is a horizontal three-crank triple-expansion engine,
built by the E. P. Atlis Company of Milwaukee. The diameter of the high-
pressure cylinder is 9 inches, that of the intermediate cylinder is 16, and that
of the low-pressure cylinder is 24 inches. All these pistons have a stroke of
30 inches. Th« high-pressure and intermediate cylinders have Corliss valves of
the ordinary type, moved by eccentrics with a small angular advance. The
valves for the low-pressure cylinder are moved by two eccentrics, each working
its own wrist plate ; one of the eccentrics has a small angular advance, and
760 REPORT-- 1897.

works the exhaust valves, which, as usual, have a small lap ; the other eccentric
lias a large negative angular advance, and controls the ad mission valves, which

are set with -J-inch clearance. This separation of the admission and exhaust

valve gear allows the cut-off to be prolonged to about § stroke without changing

the action of the exhaust valves.

   A single powerful bail governor is given control of the cut-off valves for all

three cylinders ; but any set of valves may be disconnected from the governor,

and then the cut-off by those valves may be raised by hand while the engine is

running. It is the practice in the laboratory to allow the governor to retain con-

trol of the high-pressure admission valves only, those for the other cylinders

being adjusted for each test by hand. This arrangement throws a very light duty

on the governor, so that with the aid of a heavy fly-wheel it regulates the

engine very closely, and successive indicator diagrams from the several cylinders

are very nearly identical.

Intermediate receivers, each several times as large as the cylinders connected

to it, are placed between the high and intermediate and between the intermediate

and low-pressure cylinders. In each receiver there is placed an efficient reheater,

made of copper tubing.

The several cylinders are provided with steam jackets on the heads and the

Abands.  proper system of pipes and valves allows steam to be supplied to or

excluded from any steam jacket or either receiver reheater. The condensed water

from the jackets of any cylinder, or from either reheater, is collected in a closed

receptacle and measured by displacement, five such receptacles being provided.

The steam-piping is arranged so that boiler steam may be supplied to any

cylinder independently ; and the exhaust pipes from the several cylinders are so

connected that various combinations of compounding can be made. For example,

steam may be exhausted from the middle cylinder into both receivers, and may

then pass into both the small and the large cylinders, which then act as low-

pressure cylinders. The exhaust steam in any cate is finally condensed in a

surface condenser, and is collected and weighed in two tanks on scales.

Tests on this engine are made as a part of the regular class work in the steam-

engineering laboratory, all observations and calculations being made by the

students. But the work is all under the careful supervision of competent instruc-

tors, who also calculate all the results to give a standard with which the students'

calculations are compared. It is our experience that this method gives at once

the best instruction to the students and very reliable results, which have been

published from time to time for the information of engineers. The paper of which

this is an abstract gives a rksume of all the tests that have thus far been made.

The standard time for an engine test is one hour, which has been found to be

abundant, provided the engine has been running a sufficient time under constant

condition when the test is begun. "When steam is supplied to the jackets of the

cylinders during the test fifteen or twenty minutes' preliminary running is enough,

but when steam is not admitted to the cylinders one hour is required, it being the

habit to start the engine when cold by first warming all the cylinders by aid of

the steam jackets.

Tests have been made on the engine running as a triple-expansion engine, and

also running compound, using sometimes the small cylinder and the large cylin-

der, and sometimes the intermediate and the large cylinders. The several com-

binations have been tested, both with and without steam in the jackets. The

best results have been attained when the engine is run triple-expanding, with

steam supplied to the jackets on the heads and the barrels of all three cylinders.

With a boiler pressure of 150 pounds, and with cut-off at one-third stroke for the

high-pressure cylinder, the engine develops 150 horse-power at 90 revolutions per

minute, and uses 13-7 pounds of steam per horse-power per hour, or 2-?3 R.T.TI.

per horse-power per minute.

    When no steam is supplied to the jackets of any of the cylinders the engine

runs 270 B.T.U. per horse-power per minute, so that the ratio of th.« heat con-

sumption with and without steam in the jackets is

                            233:270 = 1:1-16.
TKANSACTIOXS OF SECTION G.  761'

     "When steam is supplied to the jackets on the heads of the cyliadevs, but not to
those on the barrels, the heat consumption is 262 B.T.U. per horse-power pea

minute, giving a ratio of

                                            233: 262 = 1 : 1-12,

which shows an appreciable but not a large eifect from using steam in the jackets

on the heads of the cylinders.
     It is to be remarked that this engine under its most favourable conditions

shows a very good efficiency, i.e., 0-183. This is 0736 of the efficiency of Camot's
cycle for the same range of temperatures, and is 0'813 of that of a non-conducting
engine having the same range of pressure.

                    By J. G. W. Aldridge, A.M.Inst.C.E.

    Tramway work is at the present time, and has been for some years past,
characterised by au increasing use of mechanical traction systems. The reasons

for this are obvious and self-evident. It is, however, worth while to look into the
considerations that, so far as electric traction is concerned, have caused one system
or another to grow into favour, noting also the inherent qualities or attributes of
each, which must have an effect on future developments.

    The United Kingdom has practically 130 miles of electric tramway at work or

under construction; of this length 103| miles are operated on the trolley or over-
head wire system, 15| miles by means of a third rail conductor, 6 miles by means
of storage batteries, and only 4 miles on the underground conduit system.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          _

    These proportions may be taken as fairly representative of other countries also,.

as far as can be ascertained.

     They seem likely to be maintained or even increased in favour of the overhead!
wire system, unless radical improvements can be made in the direction of a cheaply
built and maintained conduit method, or more durable and light accumulators for
placing direct upon the car. Objections to the overhead trolley wire system are
almost entirely aesthetic, but at the same time have such great weight and force that
every incentive is oflered to the genius of invention to make improvements in.

other directions.

     The ordinary underground conduit with open slot is most expensive to instal
and troublesome to maintain efficiently ; it cannot be built for less than 10,000/. or
12,000Z. per mile. Even its latest form (consisting practically of an underground;
trolley wire) must require an outlay of nearly double the cost of an overhead wire

sj-stem.

     Closed conduits with surface contacts usually operated by means of electro-
magnetic switching devices in boxes under the street level are complicated, and it
is to be feared are unreliable. The great weight of lead required on each car for
accumulator traction means practically that the live paying load can never reach
2") per cent, of the gross weight of loaded car ; whilst the combinations of trolley
wire and battery, attempted on systems like those of Hanover and Dresden, are
obviously ill-designed, the dead weight of battery being carried throughout the-
entire journey, though it is only required for part thereof.
762 REPORT-- 1897.

     The overhead trolley wire system therefore appears likely to come into still
greater use than has already been the case, if only on the g^'ound of economy ; but
in view of its admitted defects, the aiitlior has worked out an alternative method
which avoids the erection of trolley wires ahmg the streets above the tracks.

                                 By J. L. W. Gill, B.A.Sc, of McGill University, Montreal.

                                         [Communicated by Professor Callexdar, M.A., F.R.S.]

When a specimen of iron is passed to and fro through a naagnetic field without

any motion of rotation, the direction of the field being reversed each time the

specimen passes out of the field, the iron passes through a complete magnetic

cycle for each cycle of motion, and a definite amount of energy is lost, due to

hysteresis in the iron. Since energy is supplied only in the form of mechanical

work upon the specimen, the hysteresis loss is, by the law of the conservation of

energy, numerically equal to the resultant mechanical work expended.

The instrimrent described below is based upon the above principle, and its

function is to measure the work so expended.

The magnetic field is obtained by the use of a solenoid wound on a brass tube.

This solenoid is arranged vertically and has a vertical motion, the ends of the

Ansolenoid being fitted with collars, which slide on two rigid vertical rods.

arm is fastened rigidly to the solenoid; and extends out on one side. To this arm

Ais fastened a cord, which passes over a grooved pulley vertically above.

balance-weight is attached to the other end of the cord. By rotating the gi-ooved

pulley the solenoid may be moved up and down, and will remain in any desired

position. The specimen to be tested is placed in a stirrup, which is sufficiently

small to pass through the solenoid, and is suspended by a helical spring, the point

of suspension being vertically above the centre of the solenoid. Another helical

spring extends from the bottom of the stirrup to a point vertically below. Tliis

serves to keep the stirrup steady. The stiiTup is suspended so that when the

solenoid is in its lowest position the specimen is out of the magnetic field, being

above the solenoid. As the solenoid is moved up the stirrup and specimen pass

through it, and when the solenoid is in its highest position the specimen is prac-

tically out of the field. If the solenoid be moved once up and down, the field

being reversed when the specimen is out of it, the specimen passes through a

·complete magnetic cycle, provided the specimen has been once through the field

and is initially in that particular cyclic state.

As the solenoid is moved up, the specimen is attracted down, the force of

;attraction increasing until it reaches a maximum when about one-half of the

specimen is inside the solenoid. The attraction then decreases and becomes zero

when tlie specimen is in the centre of the solenoid. Up to this point work is

being done by the magnetic force. As the solenoid is moved up to its highest

position the specimen is attracted upward, and work is done against the magnetic

force                            the attracting  force  becomes a maximum when  the specimen is about  one-
                              ;

half out of the solenoid on the lower side, and becomes zero when the solenoid is

in its highest position. The maximum force in the second half of the motion is

greater than the maximum force in the first half. The work done in the second

half of the motion is also greater than that done in the first half, the difference

being the work expended in taking the specimen through half a cycle. When the

field is reversed and the solenoid moved down, the action is similar to that which

takes place when the solenoid is moved up, and the resultant work done will be

the same, provided the specimen is homogeneous.

The resultant work done on the specimen may be determined by observing the

attracting force when the solenoid is in different positions, and then drawing a

-distance-force curve. The integrral of this curve gives the resultant work done on

the specimen. The force at different points can be determined by calibrating the

springs which support the stirrup, and then observing the extension of these

springs. The author has determined the hysteresis loss in different specimens at

different iuductiona by tliis method, the extension of the springs being observed

with the aid of a microscope.

To make this method practical, a simple integrating apparatus is attached to

the instrument above described, by which the work done is integrated automati-

Acally.  glass disc is connected rigidly to the pulley which moves the solenoid,

so that when the pulley rotates, the glass disc rotates in its own plane, which is

vertical, the axis of rotation passing through its centre. The motion of the glass

Andisc is therefore proportional to the motion of the solenoid.  arm is fastened

to the stirrup which supports the specimen, and extends up to the glass disc.
This arm supports a graduated steel disc, which is free to rotate in its own plane

about a vertical axis through its centre. This steel disc presses lightly on the

glass disc, the point of contact being at the centre of the glass disc. AVhen the

solenoid is moved up, the specimen is attracted down, taking the stirrup with it.

AThis causes the steel disc to recede from the centre of the glass disc.  motion of

rotation is then communicated to it by the glass disc, the speed of rotation

depending on its distance from the centre ; since its distance from the centre at

any instant is proportional to the attracting force, and the motion of the glass

disc is proportional to the motion of the solenoid, the speed of rotation of the disc

is proportional to the work being done at that instant. The total amount of

rotation is therefore proportional to the total work done. Consequently all that

is necessary to test a specimen with this instrument is to place the specimen in the

stirrup, move the solenoid up and down to get the specimen in a cyclic state, then

take it through a cycle, and observe the amount of rotation communicated to the

steel disc. This is a direct measure of the work expended.
    The constant of the instrument is determined by placing a known weight in

the stirrup, and observing the amount of rotation communicated to the disc when

the solenoid is moved through a known distance.

The specimen may be taken through a number of cycles and the readings

allowed to accumulate. Tlie average of a number of cycles is thus obtained.

5. A New Method of Investigating the Variation of the Magnetic Qualifies
    of Iron icith Temperatxtre. By F. H. Pitcher, M.A.Sc., Demonstrator

      of Physics, McGill University, Montreal,

                 [Communicated by Professor H. L. Callendar, M.A., F.R.S.]

     Owing to the apparent lack of exact knowledge on the subject of the variation
of hysteresis in iron with temperature, and as it is of some importance in the work-
ing of transformers, it was thought well to investigate the subject further.

     At the same time it was intended to repeat the experiments of Hopkinson and
others on magnetism at high temperatures, by a different method and with higher
fields. For this purpose a new method, devised by Professor Callendar, was

employed.

                                        Description of the Method.

     The specimen of iron in question was in the form of a wire, and was tested by
the direct magnetometric method in-the broad side-on position. The first intention
was to insulate the specimen in a small and Tery thin platinum tube, heated by
having a current passed through it. The temperature of the specimen was to be
inferred from tlie resistance of the platinum tube over tlie length occupied by the
iron wire specimen. The resistance was to be measured by the fall of potential
between the terminals of very fine platinum wire leads, attached to the platinum

tube at the ends of the above length.

     In this way, if the tube were made considerably longer than the wire, the
middle portion occupied by the wire would be very uniformly heated, and very
exact values of the mean temperature could be obtained. The slack of the
platinum tube when heated was arranged to be taken up by copper springs. To
prevent oxidation of the iron wire specimen, and at the same time to promote a
764< REPORT-- 1897.

steady temperature tliroughout the length of the platinum tube, the whole was

inclosed iu a vacuum tube. The vacuum was maintained by a five-fall Sprengel

pump, which was kept running during the experiment and was assistid by a water-

pump in the early stages of exhausting the tube.

With this method in view, a platinum tube was constructed from a strip of

foil 20 cm. long, 2-95 cm. wide, and 0-00254 cm. thick. It was rolled around a

mandrel 0'438 cm. diam., and after annealing kept its dimensions without necessi-

tating binding wires. The fine platinum leads were attached by winding their
Aends once around the tube and twisting up tight.
                                                        specimen of iron wire was

threaded through mica wads of the same diameter as the mandrel, and slipped

into position inside the platinum tube. The ends of the platinum tube were bound

with bare copper wire to J copper rods, and the whole carefully centred in a

glass tube.

The tube was exhausted, and a pi-eliminary test for uniformity of heating made

before placing it in the solenoid. It was seen to be heated very uniformly up to

2 cm. from each end. The apparatus was then fixed in position in the solenoid,

and the whole placed in position with respect to the magnetometer. It was found,

however, that platinum tubes constructed in this manner from thin foil would not

stand at high temperatures. Two others were tried, which, on account of not

--having thicker foil of sufficient length, had to be constructed out of foil of one-half

the thickness one being wound three times around the mandrel and the other five

times. These shared the same fate as the first one, giving way in circular cracks

running sometimes over one-half the width of the foil.

The initial exten.sion of the copper springs was not more than 2 mm. in any

case, and the ends of the tubes made as square as possible so as to equalise the

tension. This method was therefore abandoned until drawn tubes of suitable

thickness could be obtained. In the meantime the platinum tube was replaced by

the iron wire specimen itself, and in this way observations were obtained, and, by

making the specimen its own thermometer, very exact values of its temperature

could be obtained.

By heating the specimen in this manner there would be a strong circular field

due to the heating current. The curves plotted from the temperature and magneto-

meter readings would therefore have to be corrected for this circular magnetism.

This was effected in the manner explained, which, however, limited the temperature

Ato which the wire could be raised.  set of observations was taken with the

specimen in air and another in a high vacuum. The true magnetic behaviour of

the iron with temperature could then be obtained from these two sets.

   --The Solenoid. The magnetising coil as made in the laboratory was wound on

This winding was fed on by hand in a lathe and was very fairly uniform. Each

layer was carefully paraffined before winding the next. The insulation resistance
when finished, as tested on 100 volts, was over a megohm. The winding was

backed up at the ends by square ebonite washers which were fixed to the tube by

brass set screws.

that if it were slipped into the solenoid tube the annular space between them

would be about 2 mm. The smaller tube was centred by brass rings fitted at the

ends to the annular space between the tubes. The joint was made tight by solder-

ing. The water-circulation was effected by two small brass tubes, about 0-75 cm.
diameter, entering laterally through the solenoid tube beyond the ebonite end into

the spaces between the tubes.

   --Combined Galmnometer mid Magnetometer. This instrument was simply a

mirror galvanometer, mounted on levelling screws, and with two coils of copper
wire fitted closely on each side of the needle. The instrument was made fairly
dead beat by employing a large thin aluminium vane, just fitting the needle
chamber, to carry the mirror and needle. The resistance of the coils was found to
be 100-3 ohms at 18°-7 C. It was used for measuring currents and resistances by
the fall of potential method. The direct effect of the solenoid was balanced in the

usual way oy a balancing coil.

      The Mountiiiq for the Iron Wive Specimen.--The iron wire specimen was
26-1 cm. long and 6-127 cm. diam. Its ends were fused to copper wires 10-5 cm.
long and 0-40 cm. diam., an arrangement intended to conduce to a constant tem-
perature throughout the length of the iron wire when the heating current was
passed through the circuits. The ends of the copper wire were riveted and tin-

soldered to two Jt B. & S. copper rods, which were brought out at both ends of the

containing tube. · The rods were at about 6 cm. from their inside ends, and copper

springs, 3 strands t 18 B. & S., wound oppositely, were introduced to take up the

slack of the specimen and copper wires when heated. The springs fitted the inclosing
glass tube fairly well, but better centring was obtained by brass washers soldered

 on the 6 cm. segments at about 5 cm. apart and turned up to fit the tube.

     Two fine platinum wires, for potential leads, were attached at 15 cm. apart to

the iron wire specimen. They were brought out in glass capillary tubes running
 through diametrically opposite holes in the washers and inside the springs to one
 end of the glass containing tube. The ends of the capillary tubes were allowed to
 protrude about 5 cm. beyond the containing tube, and were fused at both ends to

 the platinum wires.
      The diameter of the platinum leads was 0-005 cm.; total length, 98 cm.;

 resistance, 8-06 ohms.

      The glass containing tube was made tight at the ends in the following manner.
 At the end where the capillary tubes were brought out a large brass cup, 2 cm.
 deep and 2 cm. internal diameter, drilled through the bottom to fit the rod and
 capillary tubes, was threaded over into position and soldered to the rod. This

 tube just fitted the inner solenoid tube, and had an internal diameter
 of about 1-27 cm. It was slipped over the apparatus till its end reached the
 bottom of the cup. The cup was then filled with melted fusible alloy, and to
 make tightness doubly sure a mixture of beeswax and resin was run around all the
 joints. The other end of the glass tube was drawn down so as nearly to fit the
 copper rod, and a similar but, on account of having to go through the solenoid
 tube, smaller cup soldered to the rod, after putting a small initial extension of

 about 2 mm. in the springs.
     The seal was made in the same way as before. The connection to the pump

 was made by means of a small copper tube entering through the bottom of the
 brass cup and sweated in with solder. It was bent up at a right angle to facilitate
 a mercury immersion joint. The length of glass tube between the cups was

 61 cm., which was about 2 cm. longer than the inner brass tube of the solenoid.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          _
      "When the apparatus was in place so that the specimen was symmetrical with

 respect to the solenoid, the small brass cup was just at the end of the inner solenoid

  tube. Three brass set screws, ranged symmetrically, were tapped through this end

 of the solenoid tube and screwed down hard on the cup. At the other end of the
 solenoid tube a brass binding screw was soldered. This, with a similar screw on

 the adjacent end of the copper rod, formed the heating current terminals. By

 making the heating current return around itself in this way, its direct efiect on the

 magnetometer was minimised.

    A compressed fibre block was screwed to the copper rod near the ends of the

 capillary tubes, and vertical holes drilled side by side in it, to form mercury cups

 for the platinum leads. Twin wire leads of approximately equal resistances were

  brought from the terminals of the standard resistances in the magnetising and

ends of the platinum potential leads, to three pairs of mercury cups on the table
near the telescope and scale. The readings for magnetising current, heating
current, and E.M.F. over the specimen could be very conveniently and quickly
obtained by dipping the ends of the galvanometer leads into each pair of cups in

turn.

                By W. G. Walker, M.Inst.M.E., A.M.Inst.C.E.

     Only about 50 per cent, of the indicated horse-power of the engines of a ship is
absorbed in actually propelling the vessel, the other half being wasted in the fric-
tion of the machinery and the resistance and sUp of the propeller. The indicated

horse-power developed by the engines may be divided into the following five con-

stituent parts :

     1. The power necessary to overcome the friction of the unloaded engines.
     2. The power to overcome the friction due to the working load.
     3. The power to overcome the skin friction of the propeller blades.
     4. The power expended in the slip of the propeller.
     5. The power necessary for the propulsion of the vessel.

     The power necessary for the propulsion of the vessel can be subdivided into
two parts.

     1. The power required to overcome the skin friction of the ship.
     2. The power due to the formation of waves.
     The author had carried out a series of progressive speed trials on a river steamer
60 feet long. The steam pressure necessary to overcome the friction of the un-
loaded engine was equal to about 9 lb. per square inch. The friction due to
working load was taken at 7h per cent, of the net power, the net power being
obtained by subtracting friction of unloaded engine from the total power, the blade
friction was taken at -45 lb. per square foot of blade surface when moving in its
helical path at a velocity of 10 feet per second, and for other speeds in the ratio of

the square of those speeds to the square of 10. If the first three quantities are

subtracted from the indicated horse-power there remains a quantity the sum of the
power spent in the action and reaction of the propeller ; from this remainder was
subtracted the slip, and the final remainder was the power required to propel the
vessel. This final power divided by the net power is a measure of the efficiency of

    The President delivered the following Address on Friday, August 20 :

    Some Distinctive Characters of Ilicman Structure.

When the British Association for the Advancement of Science held its first

·Canadian meeting at Montreal in 1884, the subject of Anthropology, or the

Science of Man, attained on that occasion for the first time the rank of an

independent Section.
     It was presided over by the accomplished writer and learned anthropologist

Dr. E. B. Tylor, who selected as the subject-matter of his opening address several

prominent questions in Anthropology, with special reference to their American

aspects. For example, the question of the presence of a stone age in America

whether the aborigines are the descendants and representatives of man of the post-

glacial period ; the question of the Asiatic origin of the American Indiana, and the

aro-umeuts derived from anatomical structure, language, and social framework,

bearing upon this theory. The traces of Asiatic intiueuce in the picture writings
of the Aztecs, correspondences in the calendar cycles of Mexico and Central
America with those of Eastern Asia, and the common use of certain games of

chance were also referred to.

    It is not my intention, even had I possessed the requisite knowledge, to enlarge
on the topics so ably discussed by my eminent predecessor. As my own studies

have been more especially directed to the physical side of Anthropology, rather
than to its arcbasological, historical, philological, moral and social departments, I

naturally prefer to call your attention to those aspects of the subject which have

from time to time come within the r.ange of my personal cognizance. I have selected
as the subject of my address ' Some Distinctive Characters of Human Structure.'

    AVlien we look at man and contrast his form and appearance with other

vertebrate creatures, the first thing probably to strike us is his capability of

assuming an attitude, which we distinguish by the discinctive term, the erect

attitude. In this position the head is balanced on the summit of the spine, the

lower limbs are elongated into two columns of support for standing on two feet, or

for walking, so that man's body is perpendicular to the surface on which he stands

or moves, and his mode of progression is bipedal. As a consequence of this, two

of  his limbs, the arms,  are liberated  from  locomotor functions                                                                             they acquire great
                                                                                                                                            ;

freedom and range of movement at the shoulder-joint, as well as considerable move-

ment at the elbow and between the two bones of the forearm ; the hands also are

modified to serve as organs of prehension, which minister to the purposes of his higher

intelligence. The erect position constitutes a striking contrast to the attitude
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.      769

assumed by fish, amphibia, and reptiles when at rest or moving, in which verte-
brates the body is horizontal and more or less parallel to the surface on which
they move. Birds, although far removed from the erect attitude, yet show a

closer approximation to it than the lower vertebrates or even the quadrupedal

mammals. But of all vertebrates, those which most nearly approximate to man

in the position assumed by the body when standing and walking are the higher

apes.

     The various adaptations of structure in the trunk, limbs, head, and brain
which conduce to give man this characteristic attitude are essential parts of his
bodily organisation, and constitute the structural test which one employs in
answering the question whether a particular organism is or is not human.

     These adaptations of parts are not mere random arrangements, made at hap-
hazard and without a common purpose ; but are correlated and harmonised so as

to produce a being capable of taking a distinctive position in the universe, superior

to that which any other organism can possibly assume. If we could imagine a fish,
a reptile, or a quadruped to be provided with as highly developed a brain as man

possesses, the horizontal attitude of these animals would effectually impede its full

and proper use, so that it would be of but little advantage to them. It is essential,
therefore, for the discharge of the higher faculties of man, that the human brain

should be conjoined with the erect attitude of the body. The passage of a verte-
brate organism from the horizontal position, aay of a fish, in which the back, with

its contained spinal column, is uppermost, and the head is in front, to the vertical
or erect position of a man, in which the back, with its contained spinal column, is

behind, and the head is uppermost, may be taken as expressing the full range and

limit of evolution, so far as the attitude is concerned, of which such an organism is

capable. Any further revolution of the body, as in the backward direction, would

throw the back downwards, the head backwards, and would constitute a degrada-
tion. It would not be an advance in the adaptation of structure to the duties to be

discharged, but rather an approach to the relation of parts existing so generally

in invertebrate organisms.

     At an early period in the evolution of the human mind and intelligence an

anthropomorphic conception of the Deity arose, to whom were ascribed the posses-

sion of the bodily form and attitude of man, and even human affections and

passions. This idea took so firm possession of the imagination that, in the course

of time, it obtained objective expression in the statues of ancient Greece and Rome

and in the masterpieces of Christian art. In one of the most ancient of all books,
in which is embodied the conception entertained by the Jewish writers of the
Genesis of the world, and of all creatures that have life, we read that ' God created

man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female
created he them.' By the association, therefore, of the human form with the idea

of Deity, there was naturally present in the minds of these writers, although not

expressed in precise anatomical language, a full recognition of the dignity of the

human body, of its superiority to that of all other creatures, and that the human

form was the crown and glory of all organic nature.

     This conception of the dignity of man in nature is not confined to those writings
which we are accustomed to call sacred. The immortal Greek philosopher and
naturalist, Aristotle, in his treatise ' On the Parts of Animals,' composed at least

three hundred years B.C., refers more than once to the erect attitude of man, and

associates it with his 'God-like nature and God-like essence.' In the second
century of our present era lived another Greek author, Claudius Galen, whose

writings exercised for many centuries a dominating influence in medicine and
anatomy, comparable to that wielded by Aristotle in philosophy. Although Galen,
 as has been shown by Vesalius and other subsequent anatomists, was often incorrect
in his descriptions of the internal parts of the human body, doubtless because his

 opportunities of dissection were so scanty, he had attained a correct conception of
 the perfection of its external form, and he thoroughly understood that in its con-
 struction it was admirably fitted for the sentient and intelligent principle which
 animated it, and of which it was merely the organ. In his treatise on the use of

 the various parts of the body he associates the hand with the exercise of the gift

770 REPORT-- 1897.

of reason in man, and he speaks of it as an instrument applicable to every art and

occasion, as well of peace as of war. It is, he says, the best constructed of all

prehensile organs, and he gives a careful description of how both the hand as a whole

and the individual digits, more especially the thumb, are brought into use in the

act of grasping.* Galen does not indeed enter into the minute anatomical details

which have been emphasised by more recent writers on the subject, but by none

of these has the use of the hand and its association with man's higher intelligence

been more clearly and more eloquently expressed than by the Greek physician and

philosopher seventeen centuries ago.

By the publication in 1859 of Charles Darwin's ever-memorable treatise ' On

the Origin of Species,' an enormous impulse was given to the study of the anatomy

of man in comparison with the lower animals, more especially with the apes. By

many anatomists the study was pursued with the view of pointing out the

resemblances in structure between men and apes ; by a more limited number to
show wherein they did not correspond. I well remember a course of lectures

on the comparative characters of man delivered thirty-five years ago by my old

master. Professor John Goodsir, in which, when speaking of the hand of man and

apes, he dwelt upon sundry features of difference between them.* The human

hand, he said, is the only one which possesses a thumb capable of a free and
complete movement of opposition. It may be hollowed into a cup and it can

grasp a sphere. It is an instrument of manipulation co-extensive with human
activity. The ape's hand again is an imperfect hand, with a short and feeble

thumb, and with other clearly defined points of difference and inferiority to that
of man. It can embrace a cylinder, as the branch of a tree, and is principally

subservient to the arboreal habits of the animal. Its fingers grasp the cylinder in

a series of spirals.

     Here then is an important difference in the manipulative arrangements of the
two hands, the advantage being with the hand of man, in regard to the greater

variety of movement and adaptability, to co-ordinate it with his reasoning
faculties. As showing the acuteness of perception of Galen and his complete

recognition of a fundamental feature of the human hand, he also dwells on the
hand being able to form a circle around a sphere, so as to grasp it on every side,
and to touch it with every part of itself, whilst it can also securely hold objects that

possess plane or concave surfaces. So impressed was the old Greek wi-iter with

the fitness of the hand to discharge the duties imposed on it by the higher intelli-

gence of man that, pagan though he was, he regarded its construction as evidence

of design in nature, and as a sincere hymn to the praise and honour of the Deity.
    It is not my intention to dwell upon the multitudinous details of those features

of structure which distinguish man from other vertebrates, for these have been

considered and described by numerous writers. The leading structural differentiae

constitute the merest commonplaces of the human anatomist, and are already

sufficiently imprinted on the popular mind. But it may not be out of place to

refer to certain aspects of the subject which are not so generally known, and

the significance of which has been brought into greater prominence by recent

researches.

If we compare the new-born infant with the young of vertebrates generally,

we find & striking difference in its capability of immediately assuming the

Acharacteristic attitude of the species.  fish takes its natural posture and

Amoves freely in its element as soon as it is hatched.  chicken can stand

and walk when it is liberated from the eo;g, though, from its wings not

Abeing developed, it is not at once able to fly.  lamb or calf can assume

the quadrupedal position a few minutes after its birth. But, as we all know,

the infant is the most helpless of all young vertebrates, and is months before it

can stand on two feet and move freely on them. During the period of transition,

from the stage of absolute dependence on others to the acquisition of the power of
 bipedal progression, important modifications in the structural arrangements both
of the spine and lower limbs have to take place. At the time of birth the infant's
spinal column exhibits only two curves ; one, corresponding to the true vertebrae,
extends from the upper end of the neck to the lowest lumbar vertebra, and the
concavity of its curve is directed forwards ; the other and shorter corresponds to
the sacro-coccygeal region and also has its concavity directed forwards. In the
number and character of the curves, the new-born infant difi'ers materially from
the adult man, in whose spine, instead of one continuous curve from the neck to
the sacrum, there are alternating curves, one convex forwards in the region of the

neck, succeeded by one concave forwards in the region of the chest vertebrae,
which again is succeeded by a marked convexity forwards in the vertebrae of the
loins. The sacro-coccygeal region continues to retain the forward concavity of the
new-born child. The formation and preservation of this alternating series of
curves is associated with the assumption of the erect attitude, and the development
of the lumbar convexity is correlated with the straightening of the lower limbs
when the child begins to walk.'

    When the child is born, the curvature of its spine in the dorso-lumbar region

approximates to that of an ordinary quadruped in which there is no lumbar con-

vexity, so that the spine in that region presents one continuous curve concave

forwards. For some time after its birth the infant retains the quadrupedal

character of the spinal curve in the dorso-lumbar region, and, as it acquires nervous

and muscular power and capability of independent movement, its mode of pro-
gression in the early months by creeping on hands and knees approximates to that

of the quadruped. It is only after it has attained the age of from a year to sixteen
months that it can erect its trunk, completely extend the hip and knee joints, and

draw the leg into line with the thigh> so as to form a column of support, which
enables it to stand or move about on two feet. Hence there is this great difference
between the young of a quadruped and that of a man, that whilst the former is
born with the dorso-lumbar curve proper to its attitude, and which it retains
throughout life, the chUd does not possess, either when bom, or for some months

after its birth, the characteristic spinal curves of the man. These curves are there-
fore secondary in their production; they are acquired after birth, and are not

imprinted on the human spine from the beginning, though the capability of
acquiring them at the proper time is a fundamental attribute of the human

organism.*

     It has sometimes been assumed that the acquisition of the erect attitude by the
young child is due to the fostering care of the mother or nurse ; that it is a matter
of training, encouragement and education, without which the child would not
raise itself upon its feet. I cannot, however, agree with this opinion. If one
could conceive an infant so circumstanced that, though duly provided with food
fitted for its nutrition and growth, it should never receive any aid or instruction in
its mode of progression, there can, I think, be little doubt that when it had gained
sufficient strength it would of itself acquire the erect attitude. The greater growth
in length of the lower limbs, as compared with the upper, would render it incon-
venient to retain the creeping or the quadrupedal position.

   We cannot lose sight of the important influence which, altogether independent

of education, is exercised by parents on their offspring. The transmission of
hereditary qualities, through the germ from which each individual organism is
derived, is one of the fundamental and most striking properties of the germ plasm.
Characters and peculiarities which appertain not only to the family of which the
individual is a member, but also to the species to which he belongs, are conveyed

through it from one generation to another. Hence, as the capability of assuming
the erect attitude and of thus standing and moving on two feet have been attri-

butes of the human form from its beginning', there can be little doubt that this
power is potential in the human organism at the time of birth, and only requires a

further development of the nervous and muscular systems to become a reality,

without the aid of any special training.
     The spinal column in the region of the true vertebrae consists of numerous bones

jointed together, and with discs of soft fibro-cartilage interposed between and
connecting the bodies of adjoining vertebrae with each other. It is to their
presence that the spinal column owes its flexibility and elasticity. These discs
are larger and thicker in the region of the loins, where the lumbar convexity is
situated, than in other parts of the column, and there can be no doubt that the
acquisition of this convexity is intimately associated with the presence of thesa

discs.

It is a matter for observation and consideration to what extent the bodies of

Athe vertebrae contribute to the production of this curve.  few years ago Professor

Cunningham, of Dublin,^ and I^ undertook much about the same time researches

into the form and dimensions of the bodies of these bones. Our observations were

made independently of each other and on two different series of skeletons, and as

we arrived at practically the same conclusions, we may, I think, infer that, in their

main features at least, these conclusions are correct.

The method followed in the investigation was to measure the diameter from

above downwards of the body of each of the five lumbar vertebrae, both in front

and behind. If the upper and lower surfaces of the bodies of the vertebrae were-

parallel to each other, it is obvious that, so far as they are concerned, the column

formed by them would be straight, as is the case in a column built of hewn stones

possessing similar parallel surfaces. But if the surfaces are not parallel the body

of the vertebra is wedge-shaped ; should the front of the collective series of bones

have a greater vertical diameter than the back, it is equally obvious that the-

column would not be straight, but curved, and with the convexity forwards. From

the examination of a considerable number of spinal columns of Europeans, we found

that, although the vertical diameter of the bodies of the two highest vertebrae was

greater behind than in front, in the two lowest the anterior vertical diameter

so greatly preponderated over the posterior that the anterior vertical diameter of

the bodies of the entire series of lumbar vertebrae in each spine was collectively

greater than the corresponding diameter of the posterior surface. In twelve

European skeletons I observed that the mean difference was between 5 and 6 mm.

in favour of the anterior surface. If we are to regard the collective vertical

diameter anteriorly of the five bones as equal to 100, the same diameter posteriorly

is only equal to 96, which may be regarded as the lumbar index in Europeans.

Dr. Cunningham obtained a similar index from the examination of a much larger

number of European skeletons, and he further showed that in women the lumbar

convexity forwards is more pronounced than in men. It follows therefore, from

these observations, that when the broad end of the wedge-shaped bodies is in front

the bones themselves would by their form give a forward convexity to the spine in

the lumbar region. But a similar wedge-shaped form is also possessed by the

lower intervertebral discs in this region, and especially by that interposed between

the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. Hence it follows that both vertebral

bodies and intervertebral discs contribute in the white races to the production of

the lumbar convexity.

    When we pass to the examination of the corresponding region in the spines of

those races of men that we are accustomed to call lower races, we find a remarkable

and important difference. Let us take as a characteristic example of a lower race

the aborigines of Australia. In their skeletons our observations have proved, that

the vertical diameter of the bodies of the five lumbar vertebrae was collectively

deeper behind than in front. In my series of skeletons the mean difference was

between 6 and 7 mm. in favour of the posterior surface, so that they possessed the
opposite condition to that which prevails in Europeans. Hence if the spine had

been constructed of vertebras only, instead of a lumbar convexity, the column would
have possessed a forward concavity in that region. For this character, as shown
in the skeleton only, I have suggested the descriptive term ' Koilorachic'

    We know, however, that elastic discs are intercalated between the bodies of the

osseous vertebrae in the black races as well as in Europeans. It is necessary,

therefore, to examine their spinal columns, when the intervertebral discs are in

position, in order to obtain a proper conception of the character of the curve in the

living man.

   A few years ago Professor Cunningham had the opportunity of studying the

spinal column of an aboriginal Australian,' in which the intervertebral discs had

been preserved in their proper position, in relation to the bones, without losing their

flexibility, or their natural shape and thickness. He found that, whilst the bodies

of the lumbar vertebrae were longer than in Europeans, the proportion of inter-
vertebral disc to vertebral body was distinctly less, so that the disc appeared to be

reduced in depth, in relation to the greater vertical diameter of the vertebral body.

Notwithstanding this difference, as compared with the white man, the Australian
spine had a marked lumbar convexity which showed no material difference from

that seen in Europeans. As the lumbar curve was not due to the wedge-shaped
form of the bodies of the vertebrae, it was therefore produced solely by the strong

wedge-shape of the intervertebral discs, and was not, as in Europeans, a product of

a combination of both these factors. The spinal column, when complete, is not

therefore koilorachic in the lumbar region.
     The greater vertical diameter of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae behind than

in front, as compared with Europeans, is not limited to the Australians, but is

participated in by other black races, as the now extinct Tasmanians, the Bushmen,
Andaman Islanders, and Negroes, which, if tested solely by the measurements of
the skeleton, would also be koilorachic. But in these races intervertebral discs
are also present, and there can be no doubt that through the compensating
influence of the wedge-shaped discs, with their deeper ends in front, the lumbar
curve is in them also convex forwards. It is clear, therefore, that in the black
races the intervertebral discs play relatively a more important part in the produc-
tion of the lumbar curve than in Europeans.

     One of the requirements of civilisation is the wearing of clothes, and fashion
frequently prescribes that they should be tight-fitting and calculated to restrict
motion in and about the spinal column. In savage races, on the other hand,
clothing is often reduced to a minimum, and when worn is so loose and easy as in
no way to hamper the movements of the body. The spinal column retains there-
fore in them much more flexibility, and permits the greater measure of freedom in
the movements of the trunk, which is found in savage man, and has often been
referred to by travellers.

     It used to be considered that the possession of a lumbar convexity in the spinal
column was the exclusive privilege of man, and was shared in by no other verte-

brate. There can be no doubt that it attains a marked development in the human
spine, and as such is associated with the erect posture. But the observations of
Cunningham on the spinal column of apes, more especially the anthropoid group,
made in i'resh specimens, in which the intervertebral discs were in place, have
proved that in the Chimpanzee the lumbar convexity is probably as strongly pro-
nounced as in the adult man. In a Chimpanzee, two years old, the development
is more advanced that in a child of the same age. The lumbar convexity is
«stabhshed at an earlier age than in the child, for it would seem as if the Chim-
panzee attained its maturity at a younger period of life than the human being.
In the Orang the lumbar curve is more feeble than in Man and the Chimpanzee,
and in the specimen described by Cunningham resembled that of a boy six years
old. In a fresh specimen of the Gibbon, examined by the same anatomist, the
lumbar curve was intermediate between the Chimpanzee and the Orang.

      In 1888, 1 purchased the bones of an adult male Gorilla, in which the vertebrae

774 BEPORT-- 1897.

were in position and connected together by the dried intervertebral discs. This

condition is of course not so satisfactory, for the study of the spinal curves, as if

the specimen had been fresh, and with the discs retaining their natural flexibility

and elasticity. But it was quite obvious that the spine possessed an alternating

series of convex-concave curves from above downwards. The cervical and lumbar

convexities, more especially the latter, did not project so far forwards as in man,

and the dorsal concavity was not so deep. The most projecting part of the lumbar

convexity was at the junction of the bodies of the third and fourth lumbar verte-

Abrae and their intermediate disc.  vertical line drawn downwards from the most

prominent part of this convexity fell in front of the coccyx. When prolonged

upwards it passed in front of the bodies of the dorsal vertebrae, and intersected the

body of the sixth cervical vertebra, so that the bodies of the vertebrae, higher than
the sixth, were directed obliquely from below upwards and forwards in front of

the vertical line.

The dried state of the discs did not enable one to determine precisely the

proportion in which they entered into the formation of the length of the column,
but the vertical diameter of the interlumbar and lumbo-sacral discs was obviously

not as great as in the human spine. On the other hand, the vertical diameter of

the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae was greater than in man, so that the length of
the lumbar spine, and possibly its degree of convexity, were due more to the bodies
of the vertebrae than to the elastic discs interposed between them. The Gorilla
corresponds with the Chimpanzee in having longer vertebral bodies and shorter

intervertebral discs than in man,

"Without going into the question whether a lumbar convexity exists in the

tailed monkeys, the determination of which with precision is a matter of some

difficulty, it must be obvious that the presence of this convexity can no longer be

regarded as the exclusive prerogative of man. It undoubtedly forms an important

factor in the study of the erect attitude ; but in order that man should acquire and

be able to retain his distinctive posture, something more is necessary than the

possession of a spinal column with a curve in the lumbar region convex forwards.

    Our attention should now be directed to the lower limbs, more especially to
the two segments of the shaft, which we call thigh and leg.

    If we look at a quadruped we see that the thigh is bent on the trunk at

the hip joint, and that the leg is bent on the thigh at the knee joint ; whilst

the foot forms more or less of an angle with the leg, and the animal walks either

on the soles of its feet or on its toes. In the Anthropoid apes there is also distinct

flexure both of the hip and knee joints, so that the leg and thigh are set at an

angle to each other, and the foot is modified, through a special development of the

great toe, into an organ of prehension as well as of support. When we turn to

the human body we find that in standing erect the leg and thigh are not set at an

angle to each other, but that the leg is in line with and immediately below the

thigh, that both hip and knee joints are fully extended, so that the axis of the

shaft of the lower limb is practically continuous with the axis of the spine. The
foot is set at right angles to the leg, and the sole is in relation to the ground. The

vertical axis of the shaft of the lower limb, the extended condition of the hip

and knee joints, and the rectangular position of the foot to the leg are therefore

fundamental to the attainment of the erect attitude of man.

    In narratives of travel by those who have studied the Penguins in their native

habitats, you may read that these birds may be seen standing on the rocks on the

coasts which they frequent, in rows, like regiments of soldiers, and the idea has become

implanted in the minds of many that they can stand erect. Even so accomplished

a writer and acute a critic as the late Mr. G. H. Lewes thought that the Penguins

had the vertical attitude when standing, and that some mammals, as the Jerboa
and Kangaroo, very closely approached to it. The attitude of man was, he con-

sidered, merely a question of degree, and did not express a cardinal distinction.^

      In arriving at this conclusion, however, only the external appearance of the

birds and mammals referred to by him can have been looked at. If the skin and

flesh be removed, and the arrangement of the constituent parts of the skeleton be
studied, it will be seen that the axis of the spine in them, instead of being vertical
is oblique, and that there is no proper lumbar convexity ; that the hip and knee
joints, so far from being extended, are bent ; that the thigh is not in the axis of
the spine, and that the leg, instead of being in a vertical line with the thigh, is set
at an acute angle to it. The so-called vertical attitude therefore in these

animals is altogether deceptive. It does not approximate to, and can in no sense
be looked upon as equivalent to, the erect attitude in man.

   We may now consider what agents come into operation in changing the curve

of the spine from the concavity forwards, found in the new-born infant, to the

alternating series of curves so characteristic of the adult. The production of the
lumbar convexity is, without doubt, due to structures associated with the spine,
the pelvis and the lower limbs, whilst the cervical convexity is due to structures
acting on the spine and the head.

     There can, I think, be little doubt that muscular action plays a large part in the
production of the cervical and lumbar convexities. The study of the muscles,
associated with and connected to the spinal column, shows that large symmetrically

arranged muscles, many of which are attached to the neural arches and transverse

processes of the vertebrae, extend longitudinally along the back of the spine, and

some of them reach the head. On the other hand, those muscles which lie in

front of the spine, and are attached to the vertebrae, are few in number, and are
practically limited to the cervical and lumbar regions, in which the spine acquires
a convexity forwards.

     It has already been pointed out that the formation of the lumbar convexity is
correlated with the power of extending the hip joints and straightening the

lower limbs. When these joints are in the position of extension, an important

pair of muscles called the 'psoae,' which reach from the small trochanter of the femur
to the bodies and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, are in a state of
tension. In the act of extending the hip joints so as to raise the body to the erect

position, the opposite ends of these muscles are drawn asunder, and the muscles are
stretched and elongated, so that they necessarily exercise traction upon the
lumbar spine. Owing to its flexibility and elasticity, a forward convexity is in

course of time produced in it in this region. By repeated eflbrts the convexity

becomes fixed and assumes its specific character.

     Along with the changes in the spinal column, a modification also takes place
in the inclination of the pelvis during the extension of the hip joints and the
straightening of the lower limbs. The muscle called ' iliacus ' is conjoined with
the psoas at its attachment to the small trochanter, but instead of being connected
to the spinal column by its upper end, it is attached to the anterior surface of the
ilium. It exercises traction therefore on that bone, draws it forwards and increases

the obliquity of the pelvic brim. This in its turn will react on the lumbar spine
and assist in fixing its convexity.

     By some anatomists great importance has been given to the ' ilio-femoral band,'

situated in the anterior part of the capsular ligament of the hip joint, as causing
the inclination of the pelvis, and in promoting the lumbar curve. This band is

attached by its opposite ends to the femur and the ilium. As the hip joint is being
extended, the ends are dravm further apart, the band is made tense, and the ilium
might in consequence be drawn upon, so as to aiTect the inclination of the pelvis.
As the hgament has no attachment to the spinal column, it cannot draw directly

on it, but could only affect it indirectly through its iliac connections. It can
therefore, I think, play only a subordinate part in the production of the lumbar

curve.

     Contemporaneous with the straightening of the lower limbs and the extension
of the hip joints, the spinal column itself is elevated by muscles of the back,
named ' erectores spinae,' which, taking their fixed points below, draw upon the
vertebrae and ribs and erect the spine. The lumbar convexity is the form of stable
equilibrium which the flexible spinal column tends to take under the action of
the muscular forces which pull upon it in front and behind. It is probably due to
the fact that the average puU, per unit of length, of the psoae muscles attached in
776 REPORT-- 1897.

front is greater than the average pull, per unit of length, of the muscles attached

behind in the same region.

     The muscles which lie on the back of the neck and which are attached to the
occipital part of the skull, when brought into action, will necessarily affect
the position of the head. The new-born infant has no power to raise the head,

which is bent forward, so that the chin is approximated to the chest. As it

acquires strength the head becomes raised by the muscles of the back of the neck,

and the flexible spine in the cervical region loses its primary curve, concave

forwards, and gradually assumes the cervical convexity. The formation of this

curve is, I believe, assisted by the anterior recti muscles, the lower ends of which

are attached to the front of the vertebrae, whilst their upper ends are connected to
the basi-occipital. In the elevation of the head the opposite ends of the muscles

are drawn apart, which would exercise a forward traction upon the cervical
vertebrae. The production of the cervical convexity precedes the formation of the
lumbar curve, for an infant can raise its head, and take notice of surrounding

objects, months before it can stand upon its feet.

    We shall now look at the bones in the thigh and leg, which possess characters

that are distinctively human, and which are associated with the erect posture.
These characters can be more clearly recognised when the bones are contrasted

with the corresponding bones of the large Anthropoid apes.

    As compared with the ape, the shaft of the human thigh bone is not so broad
in relation to its length ; when standing erect the shaft is somewhat more oblique,

it is more convex forwards and generally more finely modelled, and it has three

almost equal surfaces, the anterior of which is convex. But, further, a strong ridge

(linea aspera) extends vertically down its posterior surface ; so that a section
through the shaft is triangular, with the two anterior angles rounded and the

posterior prominent. In the Gorilla, Chimpanzee, and Orang, the shaft is flattened

from before backwards, and the linea aspera is represented by two faint lines,

Aseparated from each other by an intermediate narrow area.  section through the

shaft approximates to an ellipse. In the Gibbon the femur is greatly elongated,

and the shaft is smooth and cylindriform. The linea aspera is for the attachment

of powerful muscles, which are more closely aggregated in man than in apes, so
that the human thigh possesses more graceful contours.

    In the human femur the shaft is separated from the neck by a strong anterior

intertrochanteric ridge, to which is attached the ilio-femoral ligament of the hip

joint, which, by its strength and tension, plays so important a part in keeping the
joint extended when the hody is erect. In the Anthropoid apes this ridge is faint

in the Gorilla, and scarcely recognisable in the Orang, Gibbon, and Chimpanzee, and

the ilio-femoral ligament in them is comparatively feeble. It may safely therefore

be inferred that in apes, with their semi-erect, crouching attitude, the ilio-femoral

band is not subjected to, or capable of sustaining, the same strain as in man.
     The head of the thigh bone is also distinctive. In the apes the surface covered

by cartilage is approximately a sphere, and is considerably more than a hemi-

sphere. It is sharply difierentiated from the neck by a definite boundary, and it

has a mushroom-like shape. In man the major part of the head is also approxi-

mately a sphere ; but, in addition, there is an extension outwards of the articular
area on the anterior surface and upper border of the neck of the bone. The form

of this extended area differs from the spherical shape of the head in general. The

curvature of a normal section of its surface has a much larger radius than the

curvature of a normal section of the head, near the attachment of the ligamentum

teres.

     The amount of this extended area varies in diflferent femora, but as a rule it

is larger and more strongly marked in Europeans than in the femora of some

savages which I have examined. When the joint is in the erect attitude, the

area is in contact with the back of the iliac part of the iho-femoral ligament. It

provides a cartilaginous surface which, during extension of the joint, is not situated
in the acetabulum, but, owing to the centre of gravity falling behind the axis of
movement, is pressed against that ligament, and contributes materially to its

tension. It is associated with the characteristic position of the human hip joint in
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  777

standing, and may be called appropriately the extensor area. When the femur ia

abducted it passes within the acetabulum. The head of the femur in man is not so

sharply differentiated from the neck as in the Anthropoid apes, especially in the

 region of the extensor articular area.

     Both man and apes possess at the lower end of the femur a trochlear or pulley-

like surface in front for the patella, and two condyles for the tibia. In the apes
the trochlea is shallow, and the concave curve from side to side is a segment of an

approximate circle, with a large radius. In man the trochlea is much deeper, and

the inner and outer parts of the curve deviate considerably from a circle, and
are not symmetrical ; the outer part is wider and extends higher on the front of
the bone than the inner part, whUst the direction of the curve changes towards

the edges of the trochlea.
      In the apes the articular surface of the inner condyle is very markedly

larger than that of the outer condyle, both in breadth and in the extent of its
backward curve, which winds upwards on the posterior part of the condyle, so
that the articular surface is continued on to its upper aspect. The curve of the

outer condyle is much sharper, and the condyle does not project so far backwards

its articular surface is not prolonged so high on the back of the bone. In the
apes, therefore, the inner is the more important condyle in the construction of the
knee joint, and the marked extension of its articular area backwards and upwards
is associated with the position and movements of the knee in flexion. In the ape
the thigh is more rotated outwards than in man, and the inner condyle is directed

to the front of the limb.

     In man there is not nearly the same dLsproportion in the size of the two con-
dyles as in the apes. I have occasionally seen in man the articular area of the
inner broader than that of the outer condyle, but more usually the outer is appre-
ciably the wider. The backward curve of the outer condyle is also prolonged
somewhat higher than that of the inner, and thus the condition of the two con-

dyles is the reverse of that found in the ape. It should, however, be stated, as has

been shown by Dr. Havelock Charles,' that in persons who habitually rest in the

squatting position, an upward extension of the articular area of the inner condyle
exists, which is associated with the acute flexion of the knee whilst squatting.
In man, the outer condyle, when seen in profile, is, as compared with the inner,
more elongated antero-posteriorly than in the Gorilla. The approximate equality

in the size of the two condyles in man is, without doubt, associated with the ex-

tension of the knee joint in the erect attitude, and with tlie more equable distribu-
tion of the weight of the body downwards on the head of the tibia. In the ape
the intercondylar fossa, in relation to the size of the bones, is wider in front than

in man ; but it is wider behind in man than in the ape, for in the latter the inner

condyle inclines nearer to the outer condyle than in man.

     In man, when the knee joint is extended, the tibia is slightly rotated outwards
on the femoral condyles, and the joint is fixed, partly by the tension of the lateral
and posterior ligaments and the anterior crucial ligament, and partly by the gene-

ral tension of the muscles and fascife around the joint. So long as these structures
remain tense, the joint cannot be bent, and no lateral movement, or rotation, ia
permitted. The fixation of the joint is of fundamental importance in the act of

standing. Free rotation of the human knee can only take place when the joint is

acutely bent.

     In apes, the joint cannot be fully extended ; its natural position, when the
animal is standing, is partial flexion, and in this position a limited rotation is per-
mitted, which can be greatly increased when the joint is more completely bent.
Id rotating the leg on the thigh the inner condyle is apparently the pivot. The
rotation facilitates the use of the foot as an organ of prehension, and assists the
ape to turn the sole inwards and forwards when holding an object. These move-
ments produce results, which approximate to those occasioned by pronation and
supination of the radius on the ulna, in the movements of the forearm and hand.

     In the Anthropoid apes, the head of the tibia slopes very decidedly backwards
at the upper end of the shaft, so that its axis forms an angle with that of the shaft,

                          ' J(mrnal of Anatomy and Physiology, vol. xxviii.
778 REPORT-- 1897.

and the bead may be described as retroverted. If tbe shaft of the tibia were held
vertically, the articular surface for the inner condyle would also slope downwards
and backwards, and to a greater degree than that for the outer condyle. But in

the natural semiflexed position of the ape's knee the condylar articular surfaces of
the tibia are essentially in the horizontal plane.

     In the human tibia the axis of the head is, as a rule, almost in line with that
of the shaft, and the backward and downward slope of the inner articular surface
is not so great as in the ape. In some human tibia3, however, well-marked

retroversion of the head has been seen. In skeletons referred to the Quaternary

period of the geologist, this character has been noticed by MM. Collignon,

Fraipont, and Testut, and the inference has been drawn that the men of that period

could not extend the knee joint and walk as erect as modern man. It has,
however, been shown by Professor Manouvrier ^ and Dr. Havelock Charles - that

this condition of the tibia is not uncommon in some races of men, in whom there

can be no question that the attitude is erect when standing. Dr. Charles has
associated the production of retroversion to the habit in these races of resting on

the ground in the position of squatting. I have found in the tibiae of the people

of the Bronze Age that retroversion of the head of the tibia is not uncommon.

In five specimens the backward slope of the head formed with the vertical axis

of the shaft an angle which ranged in the several bones from 20° to 30°. But
when these tibiae were put into the erect position alongside of similarly placed
modern European bones, the condylar articular surfaces were seen to approximate

to the horizontal plane in all the specimens. In order, therefore, that retroversion
of the head of the tibia should iDe associated with inability to extend the knee

joint, it is obvious that the articular surfaces should have a marked slope down-
wards and backwards, as is the case in the Anthropoid apes, when the shaft of the

tibia is held in a vertical plane.

     I shall now proceed to the examination of the human foot (pes), and in order

to bring out more clearly its primary use as an organ of support and progression,

I shall contrast it with the human hand (manus) and with the manus and pes in

apes. In man, while standing erect, the arched sole of the foot is directed to the
groimd, and rests behind on the heel and in front on pads, placed below and in line
with the metatarso-phalangeal joints, the most important of which is below the
joint associated with the great toe. It is therefore a plantigrade foot. The great
toe (hallux) lies parallel to the other toes, and from its size and restricted move-

ments gives stability to the foot.

     The ape's foot agrees with that of man in possessing similar bones and almost
 similar soft parts ; but it differs materially as to the uses to which it can be
put. Some apes can undoubtedly place the sole upon the ground, and in this

 position use the foot both for support and progression ; though the Orang, and to
 some extent other Anthropoid apes, rest frequently upon the outer edge of the foot.
 But in addition these animals can use the foot as a prehensile organ like the hand.
The old anatomist Tyson, in his description of a young Chimpanzee,' spoke of the
 pes as ' liker a hand than a foot ' and introduced the term ' quadrumanous,' four-
 handed, to designate this character. This term was adopted by Cuvier and applied
 by him to apes generally, and has long been in popular use. The eminent French
 anatomist was, however, quite alive to the fact that though the pes was capable of
 being used as a hand, yet that it was morphologically a foot, so that the term was
 employed by him to express a physiological character.

      In the ape, the great toe, instead of being parallel to the other toes as in man,
 is set at an angle to them, not unlike the relation which the thumb (poUex) bears
 to the fingers in the human hand. It is able, therefore, to throw the hallux

 across the surface of the sole in the prehensile movement of opposition. As it can

 at the same time bend the other toes towards the sole, it also has the power of

 encircling an object more or less completely with them. By the joint action of

                        ' Memoires de la Societe d'Anthropologie de Paris, 1890.

all the toes a powerful grasping organ is produced, more important even than its

hand, in which the thumb is feebly developed.

It has sometimes been assumed that the human foot is also a prehensile instru-

ment as well as an organ of support. In a limited sense objects can undoubtedly

be grasped by the human toes when bent towards the sole. In savages, this power

is preserved to an extent which is not possible in civilised man, in whom, owing

to the cramping, and only too frequently the distorting influence, exercised by

badly fitting boots and shoes, the proper development of the functional uses of the

toes is impeded and their power of independent movement is often destroyed.

Even in savages who have never worn shoes, the power of grasping objects by

the toes cannot be regarded as approximately equal in functional activity and

usefulness to the range of movement possessed by the ape. The four outer toes

are so short and comparatively feeble, that they cannot encircle an object of any

magnitude. But, what is even more important, the great toe cannot be opposed to

the surface of the sole, in the way that an ape can move its hallux or a man his
thumb. Savage man can no doubt pick up an object from the ground with the

great toe. Many of us have doubtless seen, among civilised men, persons who have

had the misfortune to be born without arms, or who have accidentally lost them

in early life, who have trained themselves to hold a pen, pencil, brush, or razor

with the foot, and to write, draw, paint, or even shave. But in these cases the

object is held between the hallux and the toe lying next to it, and not grasped

between the great toe and the sole of the foot by a movement of opposition.

If we compare the anatomical structure of the human foot with that of the foot

of the ape, though the bones, joints, and muscles are essentially the same in both,

important differences in arrangement may be easily recognised, the value of which

will be better appreciated by first glancing at the thumb. Both in man and apes

the thumb is not tied to the index digit by an intermediate ligament, which, under

the name of ' transverse metacarpal,' binds all the fingers together, and restricts

their separation from each other in the transverse plane of the hand. The great

toe of the ape, similarly, is not tied to the second toe by a ' transverse metatarsal

ligament,' such as connects together and restricts the movements of its four outer

toes in the transverse plane of the foot. The hallux of the ape is therefore set

free. It can, like the thumb of man and ape, be thrown into the position of
                               _

opposition and be used as a prehensile digit. Very different is the case in the
human foot, in which the hallux is tied to the second toe by a continuation of the

same transverse metatarsal ligament which ties the smaller toes together. Hence

it is impossible to oppose the great toe to the surface of the sole in the way in

which the thumb can be used, and the movements of the digit in the transverse

plane of the foot are also greatly restricted.

The development of a connecting transverse band, for the restriction of the

movements of tiie great toe in man, is not the only anatomical structure which

differentiates it from the hallux of an ape, or the thumb in the hand. In the

manus both of man and apes the joint between the metacarpal bone of the thumb

and the bone of the wrist (trapezium) is concavo-convex, or saddle-shaped, and

permits of a considerable range of movement in certain directions, and notably the
Amovement of opposition.
                          joint of a similar configuration, permitting similar

movements, is found in the pes of the ape between the metatarsal of the hallux and

the tarsal bone with which it articulates. In the foot of man, on the other hand,

the corresponding joint is not saddle-shaped, but is almost plane-surfaced, and con-

sequently the range of movement is slight, and is little more than the gliding of

one articular surface on the other.

     One of the chief factors in the production of the movement of opposition in the
manus of man and apes is a special muscle, the opponens poUicis, which, through

its insertion into the shaft of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, draws the entire

digit across the surface of the palm. In the foot of the Anthropoid apes there is

not complete correspondence in different species in the arrangement of the muscles

which move the great toe. In the Orang the abductor hallucis, in addition to the
customary insertion into the phalanx, may give rise to two slips, one of which is

inserted into the base and proximal part of the first metatarsal bone, and the other
780 REPORT-- 1897.

into the radial border of its shaft for a limited distance; these slips apparently
represent an imperfect opponens muscle, which acts along with the adductor and
ehort flexor muscle of the great toe. In the other Anthropoid apes, the muscle

eeems to be altogether absent, and the power of opposition is exercised solely by
the adductor and the flexor brevis hallucis, the inner head of the latter of which is
remarkably well developed.' In the human foot there is no opponens hallucis,

and the short flexor of the great toe is, in relation to the size of that digit,
comparatively feeble, so that no special provision is made for a movement of

opposition.

     The character and direction of the movements of the digits both in hand and
foot are imprinted on the integument of palm and sole. In the palm of the human
hand the oblique direction of the movements of the fingers towards the thumb,
when bent in grasping an object, is shown by the obliquity of the two great grooves
which cross the palm from tlje root of the index to the root of the little finger.
The deep curved groove, extending to the wrist, which marks ofl' the eminence of
the ball of the thumb from the rest of the palm, is associated with the opponent
action of the thumb, which is so marked in man that the tip of the thumb can be
Ibrouglit in contact with a large part of the palmar surface of the hand and fingers.

Faint longitudinal grooves in the palm, situated in a line with the fingers, express

slight folds which indicate, where the fingers are approximated to or separated

from each other, in adduction and abduction. In some hands a longitudinal groove
marks ofi" the muscles of the ball of the little finger from the rest of the palm, and

is associated with a slight opponent action of that digit ; by the combination of

which, with a partial opposition of the thumb, the palm can be hollowed into a

--cup the drinking-cup of Diogenes.

     These grooves are present in the infant's hands at the time of birth, and I have

seen them in an embryo, the spine and head of which were not more than 90 mm.
(three and a half inches) long. They appear in the palm months before the infant

can put its hand to any use ; though it is possible that the muscles of the

thumb and fingers do, even in the embryo, exercise some degree of action, especially

in the direction of flexion. These grooves are not therefore acquired after birth.

It is a question how far the intra-uterine purposeless movements of the digits are

suflicient to produce  them                             but  even should  this be the  case, it  is clear that they
                                                     ;

are to be regarded as hereditary characters transmitted from one generation of

human beings to another. They are correlated with the movements of the digits,

which give the functional power and range of movement to the hand of man.

In the palm of the hand of the Anthropoid apes grooves are also seen, which

differ in various respects from those in man, and which are characteristic of the
group in which they are found. In these animals the palm is traversed by at least
two grooves from the index border to that of the minimus. In the Gibbon they

are oblique, but in the Gorilla, Chimpanzee, and Orang they are almost transverse,
which implies that in flexion the fingers do not move so obliquely towards the com-
paratively feeble thumb as they do in man. The curved groove which limits the
ball of the thumb is present, but on account of the less development of that
eminence, it is not so extensive as in man. The longitudinal grooves in the palm
are deeper than in the human hand, and in the Gorilla and Orang a groove
differentiates the eminence associated with the muscles of the little finger from the
adjoining part of the palm. The character and direction of these grooves are
such as one would associate with the hand of an arboreal animal, in which the
long fingers are the chief dierits employed in grasping an object more or less
cylindrical, like the branch of a tree, and in which the thumb is a subordinate
digit. I have not had the opportunity of examining the palm of the embryo
of an Anthropoid ape, but in that of an embryo Macaque monkey I have seen both
the groove for the ball of the thumb which marks its opposition, and the transverse
and longitudinal grooves in the palm which are correlated with the movements of

Anthropoid apes consult Dr. Hepburn's memoir in Jonrnal of Anatomy and Physiology,

TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.  781

the fingers. In apes, therefore, as in man, these grooves are not acquired after
birth, but have an hereditary signification.

    We may now contrast the grooves in the skin of the sole of the human foot

with those which we have just described in the palm. For this purpose the foot

of an infant must be selected as well as that of an older person in which the toes
have not been cramped and distorted by ill-fitting shoes.^

     The toes are marked ofl" from the sole proper by a deep diagonal depression,
which corresponds with the plane of flexion of the first and second phalanges.
Behind this depression, and on the sole proper, is a diagonal groove, which com-
mences at the cleft between the great and second toes, and reaches the outer border
of the foot. It is seen in the infant, but disappears as the skin of the foot becomes
thickened from use and pressure. This groove marks the plane of flexure of the
first phalanges on the metatarsal bones of the four smaller toes. Associated with
its inner end is a short groove which curves to the inner border of the foot, and
marks oflPthe position of the joint between the first phalanx and the metatarsal
bone of the great toe. The groove indicates the movements of the great toe in
flexion, and in adduction to, or abduction from, the second toe. It has sometimes

erroneously been regarded as the corresponding groove in the foot to the deep

curved groove in the hand, which defines the muscles of the ball of the thumb
and is associated with the movement of opposition. This is not its real character,,
for the chief joint concerned in opposition is that between the metacarpal bone and
the corresponding carpal bone, and not that between the metacarpal bone and
the phalanx. In addition, one, or it may be two faint grooves run from
within outwards near the middle of the sole. In the infant's foot a groove also
extends longitudinally in the centre of the foot. The grooves on the integument
of the sole are in harmony with the inner anatomy of the foot, and confirm the
statement, already made, that the great toe in man cannot be opposed to the
sole, as the thumb can to the palm, for the great curved groove expressing the
movement of opposition is wanting.

      In the apes, the condition of the tegumentary grooves in the sole is very

difierent from the human foot. In the Anthropoid group, the ball of the great toe,
with its muscles, is marked ofi^ by a deep curved groove, which extends from the
margin of the cleft between it and the second toe, backwards along the middle
of the sole almost as far as the heel. Its depth and extent are associated with the

powerful opponent, or grasping action of the hallux. Two other grooves, in front

of that just described, pass obliquely across the sole, from the cleft between the
hallux and the second toe, and reach the outer border of the foot. They are
associated with the movements of the four smaller toes, and their obliquity shows-

that, when the foot is used as a prehensile organ, the object is grasped not only by
the great toe being moved towards the sole, but by the smaller toes being moved
towards the hallux. From these arrangements it is obvious that the pes of the
ape is, physiologically speaking, a foot-hand, it is pedimanous. Though anatomi-

cally a foot, it can be used not only for support and progression, but for prehen-
sion, and, for the latter-named office, the hallux is a more potent digit in the foot
than is the poUex in the hand. The external rotation of the thigh at the hip joint,,
and the power of rotating the leg inwards on the thigh at the knee joint, contribute

to make the foot of the ape a more important prehensile instrument, and enabls
the animal to use it more efficiently for this purpose when sitting, than would have
been the case if there had been no contributory movements at the hip and

knee.

     The power of assuming the erect attitude, the specialisation of the upper limbs

     ' These grooves have been described generally by the late Professor Goodsir
(Anatomical Memoirs, vol. i. 1868) ; by myself in a lecture on hands and feet,

whom has called especial attention to their arrangement in the feet of infants

{Nineteenth Century, vol. xxxi. 1892, p. 795). The integumentary grooves in both
hands and feet of men and apes have also been described and figured in detadl by

into instruments of prehension, and of the lower limbs into columns of support and

progression, are not in themselves sufficient to give that distinction to the human

body which we know that it possesses. They must have co-ordinated with them
the controlling and directing mechanism placed in the head, known as the brain

and organs of sense.
     The head, situated at the summit of the spine, holds a commanding position.

Owing to the joints for articulation with the atlas vertebra being placed on the

under surface of the skull, and not at the back of the head, and to the great reduc-
tion in the size of the jaws, as compared with apes and quadrupeds generally, the
head is balanced on the top of the spine. The ligaments supporting it and connected
with it are comparatively feeble, and do not require for their attachment strong

"bony ridges on the skull, or massive projecting processes in the spine, such as one

finds in apes and many other mammals. The head with the atlas vertebra can be
rotated about the axis vertebra by appropriate muscles. The face looks to the

front, the axis of vision is horizontal, and the eyes sweep the horizon with com-

paratively slight muscular effort.

The cranial cavity, with its contained brain, is of absolutely greater volume in

man than in any other vertebrate, except in the elephant and in the large whales,

in which the huge mass of the body demands the great sensory-motor centres in

the brain to be of large size. Relatively also to the mass and weight of the body,

the brain in man may be said to be in general heavier than the brains of the lower
vertebrates, though it has been stated that some small birds and mammals are

exceptions to this rule.

   We have abundant evidence of the weight of the brain in Europeans, in whom

several thousand brains have been tested. In the men, the average brain-weight
is from 49 to 50 oz. (1,390 to 1,418 grm.). In the women, from 44 to 45 oz.

(1,248 to 1,283 grm.). The difference in weight is doubtless in part correlated
with differences in the mass, weight, and stature of the body in the two sexes,

although it seems questionable if the entire difference is capable of this explana-

tion. It is interesting to note that even in new-born children the boys have

bigger heads and heavier brains than the girls. Dr. Boyd gives the average for
Athe girl infants as 10 oz., and for boys 11"67 oz.
                                                     distinction in the brain

weight of the two sexes is obviously established, therefore, before the child is bom,

and is not to be accounted for by the training and educational advantages enjoyed

"by the male sex being superior to those of the female sex.

     The brains of a number of men of ability and intellectual distinction have been

"weighed, and ascertained to be from 55 to 60 oz. In a few exceptional cases, as
in the brains of Ouvier and Dr. Abercrombie, the weight has been more than 60 oz.
but it should also be stated that brains weighing 60 oz. and upwards have occa-

sionally been obtained from persons who had shown no sign of intellectual eminence.
    On the other hand, it has been pointed out by M. Broca and Dr. Thurnam,

that if the brain falls below a certain weight it cannot properly discharge its

functions. They place this minimum weight for civilised people at 37 oz. for the

men, and 32 oz. for the women. These weights are, I think, too high for savage
Wemen, more especially in the dwarf races.
                                            may, however, safely assume that if

the brain-weight in adults does not reach 30 oz. (851 grm.), it is associated with

idiocy or imbecility. There would seem, therefore, to be a minimum brain-weight,

which is necessary in order that the mental functions may be actively discharged.

We have unfortunately not much evidence of the weight of the brain in the

uncultivated and savage races. The weighings made by Tiedemann, Barkow,

Reid, and Peacock give the mean of the brain in the negro as between 44 and

45 oz., a weight which corresponds with that of European women ; whilst in

the negress the mean weight is less than in the female sex in Europeans. In two

-- --Bush girls from South Africa representatives of a dwarf race the brain is said

to have been 34 and 38 oz. respectively.^

Chimpanzee, it would seem that the brain-weight in these apes ranges from 11 to

15 oz. (312 to 426 grm.),and the brain-weight appears to be much about the same

in the Gorilla. These figures are greatly below those of the human brain,

even in so degraded a people as the dwarf Bush race of South Africa. Thev

closely approximate to the weight of newly born male infants, in whom, as has just

been stated, the average weight was 11 '67 oz. For the purposes of ape-life, the

low brain-weight is sufficient to enable the animal to perform every function of

which it is capable. Its muscular and nervous systems are so accurately co-ordi-

nated that it can move freely from tree to tree, and swing itself to and fro                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       it can

seize and retain objects with great precision, and can search for and procure its

food. In aU these respects it presents a striking contrast to the infant, having an

almost similar brain-weight, which lies helpless on its mother's knee.

Another line of evidence, of which we may avail ourselves, in order to test

the relative size of the brain in the different races of men and in the large

apes is to be obtained by determining the internal capacity of the cranium.

Examples of the brains of different races (except Europeans) are few in number in

our collections, but the crania are often well represented, the volume of the

cavity in which the brain is lodged can be obtained from them, and an approximate

conception of the size and weight of the brain can be estimated. In pursuing this

line of inquiry, account has of course to be taken of the space occupied by the

membranes investing the brain, by the blood vessels and the cerebro-spinal fluid.

A small deduction from the total capacity will have to be made on their behalf.

There is a general consensus of opinion amongst craniologists that the mean

internal capacity of the cranium in adult male Europeans is about 1,500 c.c.

(91-5 cub. in.). The mean capacity of the cranium of fifty Scotsmen that I have

measured by a method, which I described some years ago,^ was 1,493 c.c.

(91-1 cub. in.). The most capacious of these skulls was 1,770 c.c, and the one

with the smallest capacity was 1,240 c.c. Thus, in a highly civilised and

admittedly intellectual people, the range in the volume of the brain-space amongst

the men was as much as 530 c.c. in the specimens under examination, none of
which was Imown or believed to be the skull of an idiot or imbecile, whilst some

were known to be the crania of persons of education and position. In twenty-

three Scotswomen the mean capacity was 1,325 c.c, and the range of variation was

--from a maximum 1,625 to a minimum 1,100 c.c. viz., 525 c.c.

Again I have taken the capacity, by the same method, of a number of crania

of the Australian aborigines, a race incapable apparently of intellectual improve-

ment beyond their present low state of development. In thirty-nine men the

mean capacity was only 1,280 c.c. (78'1 cub. in.). The maximum capacity was

1,514 c.c, the minimum was 1,044 c.c. The range of variation was 470 c.c. In
twenty-four women the mean capacity was 1,115-6 c.c, the maximum being 1,240
and the minimum 930, and the range of variation was 310 c.c. It is noticeable

that in this series of sixty- three Australian skulls, aU of which are in the

Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh, eight men had a smaller

capacity than 1,200 c.c, and only four were above 1,400 c.c. Of the women's skulls

ten were below 1,100 c.c, four of which were between 900 and 1,000 c.c, and only

three were 1,200 c.c and upwards.

Time does not admit of further detail on the cranial capacities of other races

of men. Sufiicient has been said to show the wide range which prevails, from the

maximum in the Europeans to the minimum in the Australians, and that amongst

persons presumably sane and capable of discharging their duties in their respective

spheres of activity; for we must assume that the crania of the Australians,

having the small capacities just referred to, were yet sufiiciently large for the

lodgment of brains competent to perform the functions demanded by the life of a
savage. From a large number of measurements of capacity which I have made of

the skulls of the principal races of men, I would draw the following conclusions

First, that the average cranial capacity, and consequently the volume and weight

of the brain, are markedly higher in the civilised European than in the savage

races ; second, that the range of variation is greater in the former than in the

latter ; third, tliat in uncivilised man the proportion of male crania having a

capacity equal to the European mean, 1,500 c.c, is extremely small; fourth, that
though the capacity of the men's skulls is greater than that of the women's, there
is not quite the same amount of difference between the sexes in a savage as in a

 civilised race.

     It may now he of interest to say a few words on the capacity of the cranium

in the large anthropoid apes. I have measured, by the method already referred to,
the capacity of the skulls of five adult male Gorillas, and obtained a mean of

494 c.c, the maximum being 590 c.c. and the minimum 410 c.c, the range of

variation being 180 c.c. Dr. Delisle found the old male Orang (Maurice),^ which
died a short time ago in the Jardin des Plantes, to have a capacity of 385 c.c,
whilst the younger male (Max) had a capacity of 470 c.c.^ The mean of eleven
specimens measured by him was 408 c.c, which is somewhat less than the
measurements of males recorded by M. Topinard and Dr. Vogt ; but it should be
stated that in some of Dr. Delisle's specimens the sex could not be properly dis-

criminated, and possibly some of them may have been females. The cranial
capacity of seven male Chimpanzees is stated by M. Topinard to be 421 c.c.

     The determination of the mass and weight of the brain as expressed in ounces,
and of the capacity of the cranial cavity as expressed in cubic centimetres, are
only rough methods of comparing brain with brain, either as between different

races of men, or as between men and other mammals. Much finer methods are

needed in order to obtain a more exact comparison.
     The school of Phrenologists represented in the first half of the century by Gall,

Spurzheim, and George Combe, whilst recognising the importance of the size of
the brain as a measure of intellectual activity, also attached value to what was
called its quality. At that time the inner mechanism of the brain was almost
unknown, for the methods had not been discovered by which its minute structure
could be determined. It is true that a difference was acknowledged, between the
cortical grey matter situated on the surface of the hemispheres and the sub-
jacent white matter. Spurzheim had also succeeded in determining the presence
of fibres in the white matter of the encephalon, and had, to a slight extent, traced
their path. The difference between the smooth surface of the hemispheres of the

lower mammals and the convoluted surface of the brain of man and the higher
mammals, and the influence which the development of the convolutions exercised

in increasing the area of the cortical grey matter, were also known.

   A most important step in advance was made, when, through the investigations

of Leuret and Gratiolet, it became clear that the convolutions of the cerebrum,

in their mode of arrangement, were not uniform in the orders of mammals which

possessed convoluted brains, but that different patterns existed in the orders

examined. By his further researches Gratiolet determined that in the anthropoid
apes, notwithstanding their much smaller brains, the same general plan of arrange>-
ment existed as in man, though differences occurred in many of the details, and
that the key to unlock the complex arrangements in man was to be obtained by

the study of the simpler disposition in the apes. These researches have enabled
anatomists to localise the convolutions and the fissures which separate them from
each other, and to apply to them precise descriptive terms. These investigations
were necessarily preliminary to the histological study of the convolutions, and to
experimental inquiry into their functions.

    By the employment of the refined histological methods now in use, it has been

shown that the grey matter in the cortex of the hemispheres, and in other parts of
the brain, is the seat of enormous numbers of nerve-cells, and that those in the
cortex, whilst possessing a characteristic pyramidal shape, present many variations

in size. Further, that these nerve-cells give origin to nerve axial fibres, through
which areas in the cortex become connected directly or indirectly, either with
other areas in the same hemisphere, with parts of the brain and spinal cord
situated below the cerebrum, with the muscular system, or with the skin and
other organs of sense.

     Every nerve-cell, with the nerve axial fibre arising from and belonging to it,

is now called a Neurone, and both brain and spinal cord are built up of tens of
thousands of such neurones. It may reasonably be assumed that the larger the

brain the more numerous are the neurones which enter into its constitution. The

greater the number of the neurones, and the more complete the connections which

the several areas have with each other through their axial fibres, the more complex

becomes the internal mechanism, and the more perfect the structure of the organ.

We may reasonably assume that this perfection of structure finds its highest

manifestations in the brain of civilised men.

The specialisation in the relations and connections of the axial fibre processes

of the neurones, at their termination in particular localities, obviously points to

functional differences in the cortical and other areas, to which these processes

extend. It has now been experimentally demonstrated that the cortex of the

cerebrum is not, as M. Flourens conceived, of the same physiological value

throughout ; but that particiUar functions are localised in definite areas and con-

volutions. In speaking of localisation of function in the cerebrum, one must not

be understood as adopting the theory of Gall, that the mental faculties were

definite in their number, that each had its seat in a particular region of the

cortex, and that the locus of this region was marked on the surface of the skull

and head by a more or less prominent ' bump.'

The foundation of a scientific basis for localisation dates from 1870, when

Fritsch and Hitzig announced that definite movements followed the application of

electrical stimulation to definite areas of the cortex in dogs. The indication thus
given was at once seized upon by Uavid Ferrier, who explored not only the hemi-

spheres of dogs, but those of monkeys and other vertebrates.' By his researches
and those of many subsequent inquirers, of whom amongst our own countrymen

we may especially name Beevor, Horsley, and Schafer, it has now been esta-

blished that, when the convolutions bounding, and in close proximity to the fissure

of Eolando are stimulated, motor reactions in the limbs, trunk, head and face

follow, which have a definite purposive character, corresponding with the volitional

movements of the animal. The Rolandic region is therefore regarded as a part of

the motor apparatus ; it is called the motor area, and the function of exciting

voluntary movements is localised in its cortical grey matter.

    By the researches of the same and other inquirers it has been determined that

certain other convolutions are related to the different forms of sensibility, and are

sensory or perceptiA'e centres, localised for sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.

Most important observations on the paths of conduction of sensory impressions

in the cortex of the convolutions were announced last year by Dr. Flechsig,* of

Leipzig, so well known by his researches on the development of the tracts of

nerve-fibres in the columns of the spinal cord, published several years ago. He

discovered that the nerve-fibres in the cord did not become myelinated, i.e. attain

their perfect structure, at a uniform period of time, so that some acquired their

complete functional importance before others. He has now applied the same

method of research to the study of the development of the human brain, and has

shown that in it also there is a difference in the time of attaining perfect structural

development of the nerve-tracts. Further, he has discovered that the nerve-fibres

in the cerebrum become myelinated, subsequent to the fibres of the other divisions of

Whenthe cerebro-spinal nervous axis.  a child is born, very few of the fibres of its

cerebrum are myelinated, and we have now an anatomical explanation of the

reason why an infant has so inactive a brain and is so helpless a creature. It will

therefore be of especial interest to determine, whether in those animals which are

active as soon as they are born, and which can at once assume the characteristic

attitude of the species, the fibres of the cerebrum are completely developed

at the time of birth. Flechsig has also shown that the sensory paths myeli-

nate before the motor tracts ; that the paths of transmission of touch, and

the other impulses conducted by the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves, are

the first to become completely formed, whilst the fibres for auditory impulses are

the last.

     Flechsig names the great sensory centre which receives the impulses

associated with touch, pain, temTpeTa.tm-e,m\.iscu[a.T sense, &c., Korperfiihlsphare,
the region of general-body-sensation, or the somsesthetic area as translated by
Dr. Barker.^ The tracts conducting these impulses myelinate at successive
periods after birth. They pass upwards from the inner and outer capsules and the

optic thalamus as three systems.^ Some enter the central convolutions of the

Bolandic area, others reach the paracentral lobule, the inferior frontal convolution,
the insula, and small parts of the middle and superior frontal convolutions ; whilst
considerable numbers reach the gyrus fornicatus and the hippocampal gyrus,

which Ferrier had previously localised as a centre of common or tactile sensibility.
    ' The Eolandic area, therefore, is not exclusively a motor area, but is a centre

associated also with the general sensibility of the body. The motor fibres in it

are not myelinated until after the sensory paths have become developed. As the
motor paths become structurally complete, they can be traced downwards as the

great pyramidal tract from the pyramidal nerve-ceUs in this area, from which they
arise, into the spinal cord, where they come into close relation with the nerve-
ceUs in the anterior horn of grey matter, from which the nerve axial fibre*

proceed that are distributed to the voluntary muscles.
      Flechsig's observations agree with those of previous observers in placing the

visual centre in the occipital lobe ; the auditory centre in and near the superior
temporal convolution ; and the olfactory centre in the uncinate and hippocampal
convolutions. Of the position of the taste centre he does not speak definitely,

although he thinks it to be in proximity either to the centre of general sensation,

or to the olfactory centre.

     The centres of special sense in the cortex, and the large Eolandic area, which
is the centre both for motion and general sensation, do not collectively occupy so
much as one-half of the superficial area of the convolutions of the cortex. In all

-- --the lobes of the brain frontal, parietal, occipito-temporal, and insula convolutions

are situated, not directly associated with the reception of sensory impressions,
or as centres of motor activity, the function of which is to be otherwise
accounted for. These convolutions lie intermediary to the sensory and motor
centres. Flechsig has shown that in them myelmation of the nerve-fibres does

not take place until some weeks after birth, so that they are distinctly later in

acquiring their structural perfection and functional activity. As the nerve-fibres

become differentiated, they are seen to pass from the sense-centres into these inter-
mediate convolutions, so as to connect adjacent centres together, and bring them
into association with each other.^ Hence he has called them the Association
centres, the function of which is to connect together centres and convolutions

otherwise disconnected.*

   We have now, therefore, direct anatomical evidence, based upon differences in

their stages of development, that, in addition to the sensory and motor areas in the

     - Drs. Ferrier and Aldren Turner communicated to the Royal Society of London
a few weeks ago (Proc. R.S. June 17,1897) an account of an elaborate research on the
tracts which convey general and special sensibility to the cerebral cortex of monkeys.
Their results were obtained by the aid of destructive lesions and the study of the

consecutive degenerations in the nerve- tracts. From the brief abstract in the Pro-
ceedings, their research, though conducted by a different method, harmonises with the
observations of Flechsig on the human brain, in regard to the course and connections
of the great thalamic cortico-petal sensory fibres. They have also traced association

fibres in connection with both the visual and auditory systems.
     3 The term association fibres was introduced a number of years ago to express

fibres of the cerebrum which connect together parts of the cortex in the same hemi-

sphere. Flechsig's fibres belong to this system.

     · The Association centres had previously been referred to by other observers as

' silent portions ' of the cortex, not responding to electrical stimulus. Their possible

function had been discussed by Professor Calderwood in Relations of Mind and

-- --cortex of the humau train, a third division the association centres is to he

 distinguished.

     If we compare the cerehrum in man and the apes, we find those convolutions
·which constitute the motor and sensory centres distinctly marked in both. An ape,

like a man, can see, hear, taste, smell and touch ; it also exhibits great muscular
activity and variety of movement. It possesses, therefore, similar fundamental
centres of sensation and motion, which are situated in areas of the cortex, resembling

in arrangement and relative position, though much smaller in size than, the corre-
sponding convolutions in the adult human brain. It is not unlikely, though the

subject needs additional research, that the minute structure of these centres
resembles that of man, though, from the comparatively restricted area of grey

matter in the ape, the neui-ones will necessarily be much fewer in number.

     In the cerebrum of a new-born infant, whilst the motor and sensory convolu-
tions are distinct, the convolutions for the association areas, though present, are

comparatively simple, and do not possess as many windings as are to be seen in
the brain of a chimpanzee not more than three or four years old.

    Again, if we compare the brain of the Bushwoman, miscalled the Hottentot

Venus, figured by Gratiolet and by Bischoff", or the one studied by Mr. John Marshall,
with that of the philosopher Gauss, figured by Rudolph Wagner, we also recognise
the convolutions in which the motor and sensory areas are situated. In all these
brains they have a comparative simplicity of form and arrangement which enables

one readily to discriminate them. When we turn, however, to the associatioii

areas in the three tiers of convolutions in the frontal lobe, and in the parieto-
occipital and occipito-temporal regions where the bridging or annectant convolu-

tions are placed, we cannot fail to observe that in a highly-developed brain, like

that of Gauss, the association convolutions have a complexity in arrangement, and

an extent of cortical surface much more marked than in the Bushwoman, and to
a still greater degree than in the ape. The naked-eye anatomy of the brain there-

fore obviously points to the conclusion that these association areas are of great

physiological importance.

    The problem which has now to be solved is the determination of their function.

Prolonged investigation into the development and comparative histology of the

brain will be necessary before we can reach a sound anatomical basis on which to

found satisfactory conclusions. It will especially be necessary to study the suc-
cessive periods of development of the nerve-fibre tracts in the cerebrum of apes and
other mammals, as well as the magnitude and intimate structure of the association
areas in relation to that of the motor and sensory areas in the same species.

      Flechsig, however, has not hesitated to ascribe to the association centres func-

tions of the highest order. He believes them to be parts of the cerebral cortex

engaged in the manifestations of the higher intelligence, such as memory, judgment,

and reflection ; but in the present state of our knowledge such conclusions are of

course quite speculative.

     It is not unlikely, however, that the impulses which are conveyed by the inter-
mediate nerve-tracts, either on the one hand, from the sense centres to the associa-
tion centres, or on the other, from the association centres to the sensory and motor
centres, are neither motor nor sensory impulses, but a form of nerve energy,

determined by the terminal connections and contacts of the nerve fibres. It is possible

that the association centres, with the intermediate connecting tracts, may serve to

harmonise and control the centres for the reception of sensory impressions that

we translate into consciousness, with those which excite motor activity, so as to

give to the brain a completeness and perfection of structural mechanism, which
without them it could not have possessed.

    We know that an animal is guided by its instincts, through which it provides

for its individual wants, and fulfils its place in nature. In man, on the other
hand, the instinctive acts are under the influence of the reason and intelligence,
and it is possible that the association centres, with the intermediate association

fibres which connect them with the sensory and motor centres, may be the
mechanism through which man is enabled to control his animal instincts, so far as

they are dependent on motion and sensation.

                                                                                                                        3E2

tion centres bear to the other centres both in mammals and in man, the period of

    3. Squaktktquaclt, or the Benign-faced Oannes of the Ntlakaimmuq,

                      British Columbia. By C. Hill-Tout.

     SquaMkfquaelt, or Benign-face, the mythological hero of the Ntlakapamuq,
B.C., is the youngest son of the red-headed woodpecker by his favourite wife, the
black bear woman. The grizzly woman, his other wife, became jealous of the
black bear, and killed both her and her husband by treachery, and would have
also killed the black bear's three sons, but they ran away. They were pursued by

the grizzly, who met her death in the pursuit. The three boys wandered about

the country, the youngest, Squaktktquaclt, becoming a powerful but kind-hearted

shaman, who used his power in alleviating the misery and misfortunes of the
people and in punishing by metamorphosis the evildoers. He also teaches the
people many useful arts, and otherwise instructs them. He is to the Ntlakapamuq
what Skilap is to the Shushwaps, and seems indeed to be the same personage. He

also recalls the ' Great Transformer ' of the Kwakiutl.

          4. The Blaclfoot Legend of Scar-face. By R. N. WiLSOX.

     The legend of Uk-ske, or Scar-face, is believed by the Algonquian Blackfeet to
explain the origin of their principal sacred ceremonies and beliefs. So much ritual
has reference to this myth, and so many observances are founded upon it, that the
                                                                                        TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.              789

student of Indian religious thought may accept it as one of the most significant and

instructive legends possessed by these tribes.

    A very beautiful young Indian woman refused all her suitors, but promised a

young man, who was disfigured by a scar, that she would marry him when the
scar disappeared from his face. After a long journey to the East he came to
where the Sun lived with his wife, the Moon. Their son, the Morning Star, took
pity on Scar-face, and they ultimately became great friends. The Sun cured
Scar-face and kept him for a year in order to teach him religious ceremonies.
Eventually Scar-face returned home and married the girl. The great religious

ceremonies of the Blackfeet, having first been performed under the direction of
Scar-face, were practised every year after that, and the Sun, as he had promised,

was kind to the people and heard their prayers.

                5. Blackfoot Sun-offerings. By R. N, Wilson.

     In the neighbourhood of Indian camps and reservations a familiar sight is an
article of clothing, such as a coat, shirt, or blanket attached to a stick and placed
in a conspicuous position, or tied to the trunk of a prominent tree. These are
sacrificial off'erings to the Sun, which in former times consisted of the rarest and
most highly valued articles possessed by the Indians. Of the numerous objects of
worship the Sun is the one which receives the greatest amount of adoration.
More prayers are addressed to this principal deity than to all of the others com-
bined, and the most important of the religious rites and ceremonies are devoted to

him in particular. When a Blackfoot is asked why such rites are practised in

worship of the Sun, he replies, ' Because Scar-face taught us so.' Although the
Sun is now, and has doubtless for centuries been, pre-eminently the Blackfoot

divinity, it may be that they have or had more ancient deities. The Sun is then
the principal deity. Every middle-aged Indian in the three tribes knows that the

'Creator' was never heard of by them until the advent of the missionaries.
Equally erroneous is the view that they addressed prayers to, or in any manner

worshi'pped, ' Napi,' the Old Man of the legends, the blunderer, the immoral mis-

chief-maker. The details of the rites of sacrificing to the Sun cannot, do not,
readily admit of condensation. It is to be hoped that these two papers of

Mr. Wilson's will be published in full by the Anthropological Institute.

             5. A Case of Trepanning in North- Western Mexico.
                By W. Carl Lumholtz and Dr. A. Hrdlicka.

     The trepanned skull ' was found in a burial cave known to the Tarahumare
Indians of the Pino Gordo section of the Sierra Madre, about one and a half days
north of Guadalupe y Calvo. Three skeletons were found, lying in Tarahumare

fashion, on their backs, with the faces to the east, and accompanied by a few crude
native clay vessels. The trepanned skull is that of an aged female, a little more
massive than the native average, to all appearance not pre-Columbian, but at the
same time not recent, for a spindle wheel found with it is not of recent type The
skull presents no deformity or fracture, but signs of an old superficial injury at
about the middle of the junction of the right parietal with the occipital.

     The opening in the skull lies in the anterior and superior part of the right
parietal bone, 1'3 cm. behind the coronal and 2'3 cm. below the sagittal suture.
It is almost exactly round, measuring 2 cm. in diameter : the outer edge is smooth
and somewhat sunken, the inner obscured by a lamella of thin bone from all parts
of the inner edge to the centre, and whose free edge is very sharp and irregular.
Seen from within this skull the lamella appears smooth and directly continuous with
the inner skull surface. There seems no doubt that part, at least, of this lamella
remained after the wound had been made.

     The walls of the opening are quite smooth, and covered with a compact bony
tissue. This fact, in connection with the smooth and slightly sunken external

--edge, shows that the wound had been made a long time several years before the

death of the person.

     The almost circular form of the opening and its perpendicular walls, which
show no signs of bevelling, do not admit of the supposition that it was produced
by scraping. One is forced to believe that it was produced by a kind of flint
wimble with three teeth, very much like the instruments of iron used to-day in
trepanning by the Berbers of I'Aur^s." At present the Tarahumares have no

--such tool, and, moreover, no knowledge of the operation of trepanning.

region has come to the notice of the authors. This second skull (which also is in

in the first case. The two specimens will be described in detail in one of the

          4. The Kootenays and their Salishan Neighbours.
By Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Mass.

The chief results of the investigations carried ou amongst the Kootenays of

South-eastern British Columbia by the writer in 1891 have appeared in the

Eeport of the British Association for 1892, but the material then obtained is still

Anbeing studied, especially the linguistic data.  ethnological sketch of the

Shushwaps, neighbours of the Kootenays on the v?est, who belong to the Salishan

linguistic stoclr, was published by Dr. G. M. Dawson, in the ' Transactions ' of the

Royal Society of Canada for 1891, and another brief account of them, by Dr.

Pranz Boas, appeared in the Report of the British Association for 1890. It is-

upon these that the comparisons here made are based. In respect of languages

these adjacent peoples show marked differences : the Kootenay makes very little

use of reduplication (none, seemingly, for grammatical purposes), possesses incor-

poration in a manner similar to the Nahuatl of Mexico, and verbal composition

like the Sionan and the Athapascan languages. The Shushwap employs reduplica-

tion extensively and has ' substantivals ' like the Algonkian tongues. The general

linguistic affinities of the Kootenay seem to lie, perhaps with the Shoshonian

stock, though nothing definite has yet been made out, and it still remains an

independent family of speech. The general affinities of the Shushwap are more

with the Kwakiutl-Nootka. Of borrowings between Kootenay and the Salishan

languages there have been few. Statlsm, ' a dug-out,' hdEtltsin, ' a dog,' kdiltsa,

' lour,' finding cognates in Salishan dialects also, perhaps, the words for ' four,'
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

and 'eight.' In certain arts, implements, &c., sweat-houses, fire-baking of roots,

pine-bark fuel, root-foods games, the likeness between the two peoples, even in

detail, is very close, the affinity lying, however, sometimes with peoples north of

them, sometimes with those to the south, the Kootenays favouring the latter, the

AShushwap the former.  peculiar pipe figured by Dawson, and ' differing in shape

from any hitherto seen by me in British Columbia,' closely resembles one found

among the Kootenays, who also possess the pestle-shaped hammer of the Shush-

waps and coast tribes. By far the most noteworthy coincidence, however, is the

possession by the Kootenays and the Shushwaps of the peculiar double (down-

wards) pointed bark-canoe, of the kind which Professor 0. T. Mason calls the
Amoor type, since it is found also on that Asiatic river. The Kootenay name

ydktsdmitl differs entirely from the Salishan names, and its use with them is
much more common than with the Shushwaps. Hence one might reasonably

argue that the borrowing here has been from the Kootenays on the part of the

Shushwaps, and not vice versa. The fish-traps and fish-weirs of the two peoples

are practically identical. In their social organisation the two peoples resemble

each other in their lack of gentes and complicated secret societies. More evidences

of sun-worship are found with the Kootenays than with the Shushwaps. In

mythological fond there are striking resemblances especially in the animal tales,

where the coyote (indicative of southern affinities) performs a chief role, though

with the Kootenays he is not the hero as with the Shushwaps.

                                5. Kootenay Indian Drawings.

      By Dr. A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Mass.

     The author exhibited some 300 drawings of natural objects, animals, imple-
ments, human beings, &c., which he obtained in the summer of 1891 from certain

members of the Kootenay tribe of South-eastern British Columbia, to whom he

had given, for the purpose, paper and pencils. None of the Indians whose genius
the drawings represent had ever, so far as known, received any instruction in the

art from the whites, and the skill displayed is even more noteworthy, when we

consider the fact that no rock carvings or picture-writings are on record from the
region in question.

     In the delineations of celestial and terrestrial phenomena the most remarkable
points are the depicting of the clouds as musses dependent from the arch of the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION H.                                   793

sky, or resting on the mountains, and the ability shown in map-drawing, the
course of the Kootenay and Columbia Rivers, the lake expansions, and the tributary
streams being properly indicated. These Indians readily recognise on a map the
chief topographical features of their country. Of 1 88 figures of animals, birds,
reptiles, lish, &c., all but two (both owls) are in profile, while of thirty-five human
figures, seven only are in profile, and of these four are by one Indian and three by
another. Of the animal figures eighty-three distinctly face the right, ninety-two
the leit ; of the seven human profiles two are right, five left. The characteristic
attitudes of such creatures as the buffalo, the bear, tlie coyote, the rabbit, the otter,
the beaver, the horse, squirrel, salmon, swallow, humming-bird, woodpecker, owl,
are represented, and the distinctive marks of the male and female horned animals,
tails and beaks of birds, and the like denoted. The same is the case with the

figures representing men and women of various Indian tribes.
    As the drawings represent the eflbrts of Indians of various ages from eighteen

to sixty, there is a great range of difference in the merit of the productions, some,

especially those of the oldest artist, being made almost to caricature, while some
drawings of buffaloes, bears, horses, and especially steamboats by the younger

Indians evidence marked ability, and compare favourably with the efibrts of very
many adult whites. In complexity the drawings range from the simple delinea-
tion of a fish-hook or an arrow-point to the depicting of a steamboat at anchor in

-- --the river, or a buflalo hunt this last a remarkable piece of work and a gambling-

scene, in the delineation of which conventionalising appears. Another interesting

picture is that of a war-dance ; and it may be worth noting here that when the
old Indian artist who drew it had concluded his work the force of association
was too much for him, and holding the paper aloft in his hand he exemplified for

a few moments what the picture represents.
     The marked abilities of the Kootenays in drawing go with their noticeably

high mental character, which has been noted by all observers from De Smet to the
present time. As compared with the drawings of children these Indian pictures

emphasise the difi"erence between the art of primitive races, with their sharp

observation gift, and the self-scribblings, imperfect copj'ings, and crude imagininga.

With the savage art is beginning to be an art; with tbe child it lingers long as an

amusement.

A Rock Inscription on Great Central Lake, Vancouver Island.
                       By J. W. MacKay.

    7. Blackfoot Womanhood, By Rev. John Maclean, M.A., Ph.D.

    The imperfection of woman and her position of inferiority are emphasised in
the legends of the Blackfeet. Girls are trained by the women in the duties of

camp life. The loose style of dress worn begets freedom of motion, and intiuences
the physical form. The outdoor life induces health, yet early marriage, harsh
treatment, the use of tobacco, the smoke of the lodges, and the lack of ambition
bring premature physical and mental decay. The women prepared the hides of
the bufialo for sale, pitched the lodges and took them down, and the first wife
retained supremacy in the lodge. The internal arrangements of all the lodges are
similar. Log houses have replaced the lodges of buflalo-skin since the people
settled on reservations and the buffalo has disappeared. Civilisation has intro-
duced cooking utensils and modified methods of coolcing materially affecting the
health of the people. The women gather the berries, pound them between stones,
and put them up in skin-bags for winter use. They wash themselves by filling
their mouths with water, squirting it into their hands, and rubbing their faces
and hair with their hands. Striking the hair with the hands supplies the place
of a comb. The artistic skill of the women is shown in making moccasins, tire-
bags, leggings, and leather shirts, the designs being wrought with beads, dyed
porcupine quills, and silk thread of various colours. The Blackfoot women are
794 REPORT--1897.

not as expert as ulie Northern Ci'ee women at this kind of work. There is a
natural division of labour between the sexes. Agriculture is a new occupation
for these hunting- tribes. The ordinary costume of the women consists of a loose
gown of equal width from top to bottom without fastenings of any kind, having

wide sleeves, a pair of leggings and moccasins, and an outer blanket or skin.
Brass rings on each finger of both hands, earrings, and necklace and painted face
serve as ornaments. Napioa instituted marriage. The females are married early,

sometimes at eleven or twelve years of age. Marriage is by purchase. War

between tribes destroyed the men and left a large majority of women, and polygamy

arose. Nature is putting an end to polygamy through an equalising of the sexes.
Divorce is an easy matter. Adultery is punished by cutting oft" the woman's

nose. Twins are considered a calamity. There are medicine-women who are not
members of the medical priesthood. The women are modest, love their children
intensely, obey their husbands, quarrel with the other members of the lodge, ride
horseback in the same fashion as men, smoke as men, but use common pipes and
smoke separately, not in unison as the men ; are good swimmers, throwing the
hands in dog fashion ; mourn deeply when one of their dogs is killed, drink tea

incessantly, are inveterate gamblers. Since coming in contact with civilisation

many of the women have become immoral. Cree and Kootenay women are
sometimes found married to Blackfoot husbands. The women are sweet singers.

In the native dances they dance separately. The females prepare the corpses of
their deceased relatives for burial, are the chief mourners at funerals, prepare the

eacred tongues for the sun-dance.

     Mythology affects the status of woman. Harsh treatment, early marriage,
and poverty induce premature physical and mental decay. Cooking exerts a
strong influence on the health and longevity of individuals. Totemism affects the
modes of life and thought of the people. Polygamy is dependent on tribal wars.

Civilisation injures the morals of the aborigines.

8. On the Hut burial of the American Aborigines. By E. Sidney Hartland.

     James Adair, whose 'History of the American Indians' was published in
1775, describes the burial of natives belonging to the Cherokees and allied tribes as
taking place in their own huts. The deceased was buried within his own house,
under the widow's bed. The same custom was found by the Spaniards among
certain tribes of South America, and it has continued to the present day in Brazil.
Traces also remain of it among the Zuiiis. Nor is it peculiar to the American
continent ; at one time it was even the practice of the ancestors of the European
peoples. Its origin must be sought for in the savage idea of kinship, and in the

desire to retain within the kin the deceased, with all his power and virtues. As

civilisation developed, however, the inconveniences of keeping the dead, either
above or below ground, in the hut which continued to be the dwelling of the
survivors began to be perceived. Various expedients were devised to obviate

these inconveniences. Many people preserved the desiccated bones of the dead,
which were often, as among many of the North American tribes, finally deposited

in gentile ossuaries.

   We are accustomed to regard the decisive triumphs of man as he wins each

one of them as simple additions to his resources, material and mental, whereas in
truth they are multipliers of high potency, entering as they do into wide and
fruitful union with the talents and powers they find already in the field. The
introduction of every invention or discovery of prime dignity at once tends to
quicken the pace of progress to a leap. It woidd appear that the distinction

between a multiplier and an addition, as each supreme victory comes to human

wit, sheds light on three cardinal facts regarding man. First, his comparatively
rapid development from animality. Second, his separation to-day from his next of
kin by a gulf more profound and wide than that between any two other allied
families in all nature. Third, his advance, when civilised, in power and faculty at
a pace ever accelerated.

     By the President of the Section, Sir W. Turner, F.R.S., F.R.S.E.

     In July of this year I received from Dr. G. Archdall Reid three specimens of
spear heads, which had recently been brought by Mr. Robert Grant from Roebucl

Bay, West Australia. They had been made by the natives from glass bottles
thrown into the bush by the English settlers in that locality. Two were made of I

coloured glass, as if from beer bottles, and one from white glass. That from white
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               _

glass was 96 mm. long and 30 mm. in its widest part, whilst the others were'
91 mm. and 81 mm. long respectively. They were sharply pointed at one end,

whilst the opposite end was in two instances finished with a convex border and
in the third with a straight base. The margins were serrated, and the surfaces showed
the marks where flakes of glass had been removed during the manufacture of the spear
head. Mr. Grant has seen the natives engaged in the manufacture of these imple-

ments. He states that the piece of glass rests during the process on the operator's

knee, who takes a stone adze atout 2 inches long, with which he strikes the glass.
The adze is a smooth stone, not a flint. The natives had made, prior to the visits

of Europeans, spear heads of flint, which are still manufactured in the back
districts of the country, and the glass implements are of the same pattern.
Mother-of-pearl shell is sometimes used for making spear heads, hut it is apparently
ground, and not chipped to the required shape.

THURSDAT, AUGUST 19.

The President delivered the following Address :

We who have come from the little island on the other side of the great waters

to take part in this important gatherbg of the British Association, have of
Welate been much exercised in retrospection.
                                              have been looking back on the

sixty years reign of our beloved Sovereign, and dwelling on what has happened
Weduring her gracious rule.
                                 have, perhaps, done little in calling to mind the

wrongs, the mistakes and the failures of the Victorian era ; but our minds and our

mouths have been full of its achievements and its progress ; and each of us, of

himself or through another, has been busy in bringing back to the present the

events of more than half a century of the past. It was while I, with others,

was in this retrospective mood that the duty of preparing some few words

to say to you to day seemed suddenly to change from an impalpable cloud in the

far distance to a heavy burden pressing directly on the back ; and in choosing

something to say I have succumbed to the dominant influence. Before putting

pen to paper, however, I recovered sufficiently to resist the temptation to add one

more to the many reviews which have appeared of the progress of physiology

--during the Victorian era. I also rejected the idea of doing that for which I find

precedents in past presidential addresses namely, of attempting to teU what has

been the history of the science to which a Section is devoted during the brief

interval which has elapsed since the Section last met ; to try and catch physiology,

or any other science, as it rushes through the brief period of some twelve months

seemed to me not unlike photographing the flying bullet without adequate appara-

tus ; the result could only be either a blurred or a delusive image. But I bethought

me that this is not the first, we hope it will not be the last, time that the

British Association has met  in  the Western  Hemisphere                                                  and though  the  events
                                                                                                       ;

of the thirteen years which have slipped by since the meeting at Montreal in 1884

might seem to furnish a very slender oat on which to pipe a presidential address,

I have hoped that I might be led to sound upon it some few notes which might be

listened to.

     And indeed, though perhaps when we come to look into it closely almost every

period would seem to have a value of its own, the past thirteen years do, in a

certain sense, mark a break between the physiology of the past and that of the

future. When the Association met at Montreal in 1884, Darwin, whose pregnant

ideas have swayed physiology in the limited sense of that word, as well as that

broader study of living beings which we sometimes call biology, as indeed they

have every branch of natural knowledge, had been taken from us only some two

years before, and there were still alive most of the men who did the great works

of physiology of the middle and latter half of this century. The gifted Claude
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                         799

 Bernard had passed away some years before, but his peers might have been present
at Montreal. Bowman, whose classic works on muscle and kidney stand out as

 peaks in the physiological landscape of the past, models of researches finished and

 complete so far as the opportunities of the time would allow, fruitful beginnings

and admirable guides for the labours of others. Browu-Sequard, who shares with

Bernard the glory of having opened up the great modern path of the influence of

the nervous system on vascular and thus on nutritional events, and who, if he made
some mistakes, did many things which will last for all time. Briicke, whose
clear judgment, as shown in his digestive and other work, gave permanent value
to whatever he put forth. Du Bois Reymond, who, if he laboured in a narrow
path, set a brilliant example of the way in which exact physical analysis may be
applied to the phenomena of living beings, and in other ways had a powerful

influence on the progress of physiology. Bonders, whose mind seemed to have

caught something of the better qualities of the physiological organ to which his
professional life was devoted, and our knowledge of which he so largely extended

--so sharply did he focus his mental eye on every physiological problem to which

he turned and these were many and varied. Helmholtz, whose great works on

vision and hearing, to say nothing of his earlier distinctly physiological researches

make us feel that if physics gained much, physiology lost even more when the
physiologist turned aside to more distinctly physical inquiries. Lastly, and not
least, Ludwig, who by his own hands or through his pupils did so much to make
physiology the exact science which it is to-day, but which it was not when he
began his work. I say lastly, but I might add the name of one who, though
barred by circumstances from contributing much directly to physiology by way of
research, so used his powerful influence in many ways in aid of physiological

--interests as to have helped the science onward to no mean extent, at least amono-

English-speaking people I mean Huxley. All these might have met at

Montreal. They have all left us now. Among the peers of the men I have

mentioned whose chief labours were carried on in the forties, the fifties and the

sixties of the century, one prominent inquirer alone seems to be left, Albert von

Kolliker, who in his old age is doing work of which even he in his youth might
have been proud. The thirteen years which have swept the others away seem to
mark a gulf between the physiological world of to-day and that of the time iu
which most of their work was done.

    They are gone, but they have left behind their work and their names. Mav
they of the future, as I believe we of the present are doing, take up their work

and their example, doing work other than theirs but after their pattern, followiu-^°-

in their steps.

In the thirteen years during which these have passed away physiology has not

been idle. Indeed, the more we look into the period the more it seems to contain.

The study of physiology, as of other sciences, though it may be stimulated by

difiiculties (and physiology has the stimulus of a special form of opposition unknown

to other sciences), expands under the sunshine of opportunity and aid. And it
may be worth while to compare the opportunities for study of physiology in 1884
with those in 1897. At this meeting of the British Association I may fitly confine

myself I was going to say to British matters ; but I feel at this point, as others
Wehave felt, the want of a suitable nomenclature.
                                                   who are gathered here

to-day have, with the exception of a few honoured guests from the Eastern

Hemisphere, one common bond, one common token of unity, and, so far as
I know, one only; I am speaking now of outward tokens; down deeper in
Weour nature there are, I trust, yet others.
                                              aU speak the English tono-ue.

Some of us belong to what is called Great Britain and Ireland, others'' to

that which is sometimes spoken of as Greater Britain. But there are others

here who belong to neither; though English in tongue, they are in no
sense British. To myself, to whom the being English in speech is a fact of far
deeper moment than any political boundary, and who wish at the present moment

to deal with the study of physiology among all those who speak the English

tongue, there comes the great want of some word which will denote aU such. I

hope, indeed I think, that others feel the same want too. The term Anglo-Saxon
800 REPORT-- 1897.

is at once pedantic and incorrect, and yet there is none other ; and, in the absence

of such a better term, I shall be forgiven if I venture at times to use the seemingly-

narrow word English as really meaning something much broader than British in

its very broadest sense.

    Using English in this sense, I may, I think, venture to say that the thirteen

years which separate 1884 from to-day have witnessed a:iiong English people a

development of opportunities for physiological study such as no other like period

has seen. It is not without significance that only a year or two previous to this

period, in England proper, in little England, neither of the ancient Universities of

Oxford and Cambridge, which, historically at least, represent the fullest academical

aspirations of the nation, possessed a chair of physiology ; the present professors, who
are the first, were both appointed in 1883. Up to that time the science of physi-

ology had not been deemed worthy, by either university, of a distinctive professorial

mechanism. The act of these ancient institutions was only a manifestation of

modern impulses, shared also by the metropolis and by the provinces at large.

Whereas up to that time the posts for teaching physiology, by whatever name

they were called, had been in most cases held by men whose intellectual loins
were girded for other purposes than physiology, and who used the posts as step-

ping-stones for what they considered better things, since that time, as each post

became vacant, it has almost invariably been filled by men wishing and purposing
at least to devote their whole energies to the science. Scotland, in many respects

the forerunner of England in intellectual matters, had not 80 much need of change

but she, too, has moved in the same direction, as has also the sister island.

    And if we turn to this Western Continent, we find in Canada and in the

States the same notable enlargement of physiological opportunity, or even a still

more notable one. If the English-speaking physiologist dots on the map each
place on this Western Hemisphere which is an academic focus of his science, he may
well be proud of the opportunities now afforded for the development of English
physiology ; and the greater part of this has come within the last thirteen years.

    Professorial chairs or their analogues are, however, after all but a small part of

the provision for the development of physiological science. The heart of physiology
is the laboratory. It is this which sends the life-blood through the frame ; and in

respect to this, perhaps, more than to anything else, has the progress of the past
thirteen years been striking. Doubtless, on both sides of the waters there were

physiological laboratories, and good ones, in 1884 ; but how much have even these
during that perod been enlarged and improved, and how many new ones have

been added? In how many places, even right up to about 1884, the professor or

lecturer was fain to be content with mere lecture experiments and a simple course
                                                                                                              Now each
of  histology, with  perhaps a few  chemical  exercises  for  his  students
                                                                                                           !

teacher however modest his post, feels and says that the authorities under whom

he works are bound to provide him with the means of leading his students along
the only path by which the science can be truly entered upon, that by which each

learner repeatsfor himself the fundamental observations on which the science isbased.

    But there is a still larger outcome from the professorial chair and the physio-

loo-ical laboratory than the training of the student; these are opportunities not

for teaching only, but also for research. And perhaps in no respect has the

development during the past thirteen years been so marked as in this. Never so

clearly as during this period has it become recognised that each post for teaching

is no less a post for learning, that among academic duties the making knowledge
is as urgent as the distributing it, and that among professorial qualifications the

"ift of garnering in new truths is at least as needful as facility in the didactic

exposition of old ones. Thirteen years has seen a great change in this matter,

and the progress has been perhaps greater on this side of the water than on the
Weother so far as English-speaking people are concerned.
                                                                   on the other side

have witnessed with envy the establishment on this side of a university, physio-
logy having in it an honoured place, the keynote of which is the development of

original research. It will, I venture to think, be considered a strong confirmation

of my present theme that the Clark University at Worcester was founded only

ten years ago.
       TRA>-S ACTIONS OF SECTION I.      801

     An<l hei-e, as an English-speaking person, may I be allowed to point out, not

v7ithout pride, that these thirteen years of increased opportunity hav* been
thirteen years of increased fruitfulness. In the history of our science, among the

names of the great men who have made epochs, English names, from Harvey
onwards, occupy no mean place ; but the greatness of such great men is of no

national birth ; it comes as it lists, and is independent of time and of place. If
we turn to the more everyday workers, whose continued labours more slowly
build up the growing edifice and provide the needful nourishment for the greatness

of which I have just spoken, we may, I will dare to say, affirm that the last
thirteen years has brought contributions to physiologj', made known in the
English tongue, which, whether we regard their quantity or their quality, signifi-
cantly outdo the like contributions made in any foregoing period of the same

length. Those contributions have been equally as numerous, equally as good on

this side as on the other side of the waters. And here I trust I shall be pardoned
if personal ties and affection lead me to throw in a personal word. May I not
say that much which has been done on this side has been directly or indirectly the
outcome of the energy and gifts of one whom I may fitly name on an occasion such

as this, since, though he belonged to the other side, his physiological life was passed

and his work was done on this side, one who has been taken from us since this

Association last met, Henry Newell Martin ?

     Yes, during these thirteen years, if we put aside the loss of comrades, physiology

has been prosperous with us and the outlook is bright ; but, as every cloud has its
silver lining, so shadow follows all sunshine, success brings danger, and something
bitter rises up amid the sweet of prosperity. The development of which I have
spoken is an outcome of the progressive activity of the age, and the dominant note
of that activity is heard in the word ' commercial.' Noblemen and noblewomen
open shop, and every one, low as well as high, presses forward towards large or
quick profits. The very influences which have made devotion to scientific inquiry

a possible means of livelihood, and so fostered scientific investigation, are creating

a new danger. The path of the professor was in old times narrow and strait, and
only the few who had a real call cared to tread it ; nowadays there is some fear
lest it become so broad and so easy as to tempt those who are in no way fitted for
it. There is an increasing risk of men undertaking a research, not because a
question is crying out to them to be answered, but in the hope that the publication
of their results may win for them a lucrative post. There is, moreover, an even
greater evil ahead. The man who lights on a new scientific method holds the key
of a chamber in which much gold may be stored up ; and strong is the temptation
for him to keep the new knowledge to himself until he has filled his fill, while all

the time his brother-inquirers are wandering about in the dark through lack of that

which he possesses. Such a selfish withholding of new scientific truth is beginning
to be not rare in some branches of knowledge. May it never come near us

        Now I will, with your permission, cease to sound the provincial note, and ask

    your attention for a few minutes while I attempt to dwell on what seem to me to
    1)6 some of the salient features of the fruits of physiological activity, not among

    English-speaking people only, but among all folk, during the past thirteen years.

        When we review the records of research and discovery over any lengthened

    period, we find that in every branch of the study progress is irregular, that it ebbs
    and flows. At one time a particular problem occupies much attention, the peri-
    odicals are fall of memoirs about it, and many of the young bloods flesh their
    maiden swords upon it. Then again for awhile it seems to lie dormant and
    unheeded. But quite irrespective of this feature, which seems to belong to all
    lines of inquiry, we may recognise two kinds of progress. On the one baud, in

    such a period, in spite of the waves just mentioned, a steady advance continually

     goes on in researches which were begun and pushed forward in former periods,

    some of them being of very old date. On the other hand, new lines of investiga-
    tion, starting with quite new ideas or rendered possible by the introduction of

I

" new methods, are or may be begun. Such naturally attract great attention, and

     give a special character to the period.

1897.                                3P
802 KEPORT-- 1897.

In the past thirteen years we may recognise hoth these kinds of progress. Of

the fortner kind I might take, as an example, the time-honoured problems of the

mechanics of the circulation. In spite of the labour which has been spent on these

in times of old, something always remains to be done, and the last thirteen years

have not been idle. The researches of Hiirthle and Tigerstedt, of Eoy and Adami,
not to mention others, have left us wiser than we were before. So again, with the

also old problems of muscular contraction, progress, if not exciting, has been real

we are some steps measurably nearer an understanding what is the exact nature of

the fundamental changes which bring about contraction and what are the relations

of those changes to the structure of muscular fibre. In respect to another old

problem, too, the beat of the heart, we have continued to creep nearer and nearer

to the full light. Problems again, the method of attacking which is of more

recent origin, such as the nature of secretion, and the allied problem of the nature

of transudation, have engaged attention and brought about that stirring of the

waters of controversy which, whatever be its eflects in other departments of life,

is never in science wholly a waste of time, if indeed it be a waste of time at all,

since, in matters of science, the tribunal to which the combatants of both sides

appeal is always sure to pive a true judgment in the end. In the controversy

thus arisen, the last word has perhaps not yet been said, but whether we tend at
present to side with Heidenhain, who has continued in+o the past thirteen years

the brilliant labours which were perhaps the distinguishing features of physiolo-

gical progress in preceding periods, and who in his present sufferings carries with

him, I am sure, the sympathies if not the hopes of all his brethren, or whether
we are more inclined to join those who hold different views, we may all agree

in saying that we have, in 1897, distinctly clearer ideas of why secretion gathers

in an alveolus or lymph in a lymph space than we had in 1884.

I might multiply such examples of progress on more or less old lines until I

wearied you ; but I will try not to do so. I wish rather to dwell for a few minutes

on some of what seem to be the salient new features of the period under review.

One such feature is, I venture to think, the development of what may perhaps

Webe called the new physiological chemistry.  always are, and for a long time

always have been, learning something new about the chemical phenomena of living

beings. During the years preceding those immediately recent, great progress, for

which we have especially, perhaps, to thank Kiibne, was made in our knowledge

of the bodies which we speak of as proteids and their allies. But while admitting

to the full the high value of all these researches, and the great light which they

threw on many of the obscurer problems of the chemical changes of the body,

such, for instance, as the digestive changes and the clotting of blood, it could not

but be felt that their range was restricted and their value limited. Granting the

extreme usefulness of being able to distinguish bodies though theirsolution or precipi-

tation by means of this or that salt or acid, this did not seem to promise to throw

much light on the all-important problem as to what was the connection between the

chemical constitution of such bodies and their work in the economy of a living

being. For it need not be argued that this is an all-important problem. To day,

as yesterday and as in the days before, the mention of the word vitalism or its

equivalent separates as a war-cry physiologists into two camps, one contending

that all the phenomena of life can, and the other that they cannot, be explained as

the result of the action of chemico-physical forces. For myself, I have always felt

that while such a controversy, like other controversies as I ventured to say just

now, is useful as a stirring of the waters, through which much oxygen is brought

home to many things and no little purification effected, the time for the final

judgment on the question will not come until we shall more clearly understand

than we do at present what we mean by physical and chemical, and may perhaps

be put off until somewhere near the end of all things, when we shall know as fuUy

as we ever shall what the forces to which we give these names can do and what

they cannot. Meanwhile the great thing is to push forward, so far as may be,

the chemical analysis of the phenomena presented by living beings. Hitherto the

physiological chemists, or the chemical physiologists as perhaps they ought rather

to be called have perhaps gone too much their own gait, and Lave seemed to be
                       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                                                                 803

constructing too mucli a kind of chemistry of their own. But that, may I say, has

in part been so because they did not receive from their distinctly chemical brethren

the help of which they were in need. May I go so far as to say that to us physio-

logists these our brethren seemed to be lagging somewhat behind, at least along

those lines of then- science which directly told on our inquiries ? That is, however,

no longer the case. They are producing work and giving us ideas which we can

carry straight into physiological problems. The remarkable work of Emil Fischer
on sugars, one of the bright results of mj' period of thirteen years, may fully be

regarded as opening up a new era in the physiology of the carbohydrates, opening

up a new era because it has shown us the way how to investigate physiological

problems on purely and distinctively chemical lines. Not in the carbohydrates

only, but in all directions our younger investigators are treating the old problems

by the new chemical methods; the old physiological chemistry is passing away;

now^here, perhaps, is  the outlook  more promising  than  in this  direction                                      and we
                                                                                                               ;

may at any time receive the news that the stubborn old fortress of the proteids has

succumbed to the new attack.

Another marked feature of the period has been the increasing attention given

to the study of the lower forms of life, using their simpler structures and more

diffuse phenomena to elucidate the more general properties of living matter.

During the greater part of the present century physiologists have, as a rule, chosen

as subjects of their observations almost exclusively the vertebrata ; by far the

larger part of the results obtained during this time have been gained by inquiries

restricted to some half a dozen kinds of backboned animals ; the frog and the

myograph, the dog and the kymograph have almost seemed the alpha and the

omega of the science. This has been made a reproach by some, but, I cannot help

thinking, unjustly. Physiology is, in its broad meaning, the unravelling of the

potentialities of things in the condition which we call living. lu the higher animals

the evolution by differentiation has bi'ought these potentialities, so to speak, near

the surface, or even laid them bare as actual properties capable of being grasped.

In the lower animals they still lie deep buried in primeval sameness ; and we may

grope among them in vain unless we have a clue fnrniahed by the study of the

higher animal. This truth seems to have been early recognised during the progress

of the science. In the old time, observers such aa Spallanzani, with but a mode-

rate amount of accumulated knowledge behind them, and a host of problems before

them, with but few lines of inquiry as yet definitely laid down, were free to choose

the subjects of their investigation where they pleased, and in the wide field open

to them prodded so to speak among all living things, indifferent whether they

possessed a backbone or no. But it soon became obvious that the study of the

special problems of the more highly organised creature was more fruitful, or

at least more easily fruitful, than that of the general problems of the simpler

foi-ms ; and hence it came about that inquiry, as it went on, grew more and more
limited to the former. But an increasing knowledge of the laws of life as exempli-

fied in the differentiated phenomena of the mammal is increasingly fitting us

for a successful attack on the more general phenomena of the lowly creatures

possessing little more than that molecular organisation, if such a phrase be per-

mitted, which alone supplies the conditions for the manifestation of vital activities.

And, though it may be true that in all periods men have from time to time laboured

at this theme, I think that I am not wrong in saying that the last dozen yeai-s or

so mark a distinct departure both as regards the number of researches directed to

it, and also, what is of greater moment, as regards the definiteness and clearness of

the results thereby obtained. One has only to look at the results recorded in the

valuable treatises of Verwom and Biedermann, whether obtained by the authors

themselves or by others, to feel great hope that in the immediately near future a

notable advance will be made in our grasp of the nature of that varying collection

of molec-alar conditions, potencies and changes, slimy hitherto to the intellectual

no less than to the physical touch, which we are in the habit of denoting by the

more or less magical word protoplasm. And perhaps one happy feature of such an

advance wUl be one step in the way of that reintegration which men of science

fondly hope may ultimately follow the differentiation of studies now so fierce and

                                                                   3 f2

attended by many ills ; in the problems of protoplasm the animal physiologist

touches hands with the botanist, and both find that under different names they are

striving towards the same end.

Closely allied to and indeed a part of the above line of inquiry is the study of

the physiological attributes of the cell and of their connection with its intrinsic

organisation. This is a study which, during the last dozen years, has borne no

mean fruits                                               but it is an old study, one which        has  been                          worked  at  from  time  to
                                                       ;

time, reviving again and again as new methods offered new opportunities. More-

over, it wiU probably come directly before us in our sectional work, and therefore

I will say nothing more of it here.

Still another striking feature of the past dozen years has been the advance of

our knowledge in regard to those events of the animal body which we have now

learnt to speak of as 'internal secretion.' This knowledge did not begin in this

period. The first note was sounded long ago in the middle of the century, when

Claude Bernard made known what he called ' the glycogenic function of the liver.'

Men, too, were busy with the thyroid body and the suprarenal capsules long before

the meeting of the British Association at Montreal. But it was since then, namely

in 1889, that Minkowski published his discovery of the diabetic phenomena result-

ing from the total removal of the pancreas. That, I venture to think, was of

momentous value, not only as a valuable discovery in itself, but especially, perhaps,

in confirming and fixing our ideas as to internal secretion, and in encouraging

further research.

Minkowski's investigation possessed this notable feature, that it was clear,

sharp and decided, and, moreover, the chief factor, namely sugar, was subject to

quantitative methods. The results of removing the thyroid body had been to a

large extent general, often vague, and in some cases uncertain ; so much so as to

justify, to a certain extent, the doubts held by some as to the validity of the con-

clusion that the symptoms witnessed were really and simply due to the absence

of the organ removed. The observer who removes the pancreas has to deal with

a tangible and measurable result, the appearance of sugar in the urine. About

this there can be no mistake, no uncertainty. And the confidence thus engendered

in the conclusion that the pancreas, besides secreting the pancreatic juice, effects

some notable change in the blood passing through it, spread to the analogous

conclusions concerning the thyroid and the suprarenal, and moreover suggested

further experimental inquiry. By those inquiries all previous doubts have been
removed ; it is not now a question whether or no the thyroid carries on a so-called

internal secretion                                                                                 the problem is reduced to finding  out what it exactly does and
                                                                                                ;

how exactly it does it. Moreover, no one can at the present day suppose that this

feature of internal secretion is confined to the thyroid, the suprarenal, and the

pancreas                                     it needs no spirit of prophecy                        to foretell that the coming                years will add
                                          ;

to physiological science a large and long chapter, the first marked distinctive verses

of which belong to the dozen years which have just passed away.

The above three lines of advance are of themselves enough to justify a certain

pride on the part of the physiologist as to the share which his science is taking in

the forward movements of the time. And yet I venture to think that each and all of

these is wholly overshadowed by researches of another kind, through which

knowledge has made, during the past dozen years or so, a bound so momentous

and so far-reaching that all other results gathered in during the time seem to

shrink into relative insignificance.

It was a little before my period, in the year 1879, that Golgi published his modest

Unnote, '                                    nuovo processo di technica microscopica.' ^ That was the breaking out

from the rocks of a little stream which has since swollen into a great flood. It is

quite true that long before a new era in our knowledge of the central nervous system

had been opened up by the works of Ferrier and of Fritsch and Hitzig. Between

1870 and 1880 progress in this branch of physiology had been continued and rapid.

Yet that progress had left much to be desired. On the one hand the experimental

Minot has called my attention to the fact that Golgi really published his method

 iuqiibies, even when they were carried out with the safeguard of an adequate psychical
 analysis of the phenomena which presented themselves, and this was not always
 the case, sounded a very uncertain note, at least when they dealt with other than

 simply motor effects. They were, moreover, not unfrequently in discord with
 clinical experience. In general the conclusions which were arrived at through

 them, save such as were based on the production of easily recognised and often

 measurable movements, were regarded by many as conclusions of the kind which
 could not be ignored, which demanded respectful attention, and yet which failed
 to carry conviction. It seemed to be risking too much to trust too implicitly to

 the apparent teaching of the results arrived at ; something appeared wanting to give
 these their full validity, to explain their full and certain meaning by showing their

 connection with what was known in other ways and by other methods. On the

 other hand, during nearly all this time, in spite of the valuable results acquired by
 the continually improving histological technique, by the degeneration method, and

 by the developmental method, by the study of the periods of myelination, most of

 us, at all events, were sitting down, as our forefathers had done, before the intricate

 maze of encephalic structure, fascinated by its complexity, but wondering what it
 all meant. Even when we attempted to thread our way through the relatively
 simple tangle of the spinal cord, to expect that we should ever see our way so to
 unravel out the strands of fibres, here thick, there thin, now twisting and turning,

 and anon running straight, or so to set out in definite constellations the seeming

milky way of star-like cells, so to do this as to make the conformation of the cord

 explain the performances of which it is capable, appeared to be something beyond

our reach. And when we passed from the cord to those cerebral structures the

 even gross topography of wnich is the despair of the beginner in anatomical studies,

the multiple maze of grey and white matter seemed to frame itself into the letters

graven on the gateway of the city of Dis, and bid us leave all hope behind.

     What a change has come upon us during the past dozen years, and how great
is the hope of ultimate success which we have to-day. Into what at the meeting

at Montreal seemed a cloudy mass, in which most things were indistinct and

doubtful, and into which each man could read images of possible mechanisms

according as his fancy led, the method of Golgi has fallen like a clarifying drop,

and at the present moment we are watching with interest and delight how that

vague cloud is beginning to clear up and develop into a sharp and definite picture,
in which lines objectively distinct and saying one thing only reveal themselves more
and more. This is not the place to enter into details, and I will content myself

with pointing out as illustrative of my theme the progress which is being made in

Aour knowledge of how we hear and how sounds affect us. dozen years ago we pos-

sessed experimental and clinical evidence which led us to believe that auditory

impulses sweeping up the auditory nerve became developed into auditory sensations

through events taking place in the temporo-sphenoidal convolution, and we had some
indications that as these passed upward through the lower and middle brain the
striae acusticse and the lateral fillet had some part to play. Beyond this we knew
but little. To-day we can with confidence construct a diagram which he who
runs can read, showing how the impulses undergoing a relay in the tuberculum

acusticum and accessory nucleus pass by the striae acusticae and trapezoid

fibres to the superior olive and trapezoid nucleus, and onwards by the lateral

fillet to the posterior corpus quadrageminum and to the cortex of the temporo-

sphenoidal convolution. And if much, very much, yet remains to be done even

in tracking out yet more exactly the path pursued by the impulses while they are
still undeveloped impulses, not as yet lit up with consciousness, and in understand-
ing the functional meaning of relays and apparently alternate routes, to say

nothing of the deeper problems of when and how the psychical element intervenes,
we feel that we have in our hands the clue by means of which we may hope to

trace out clearly the mechanisms by which, whether consciousness plays its part
or no, sounds affect so profoundly and so diversely the movements of the body,

and haply some time or other to tell, in a plain and exact way, the story of how
we hear. I have thus referred to hearing because the problems connected with

this seemed, thirteen years ago, so eminently obscure ; it appeared so pre-eminently
806 REPORT-- 1897.

hard a task, that of traciug out the path of an auditory impulse through the con-

fused maze of fibre and cell presented by the lower and middle brain. Of the

meclianism of sight we seemed even then to have better knowledge, but how much

more clearly do we, so to speak, see vision now ? So also with all other sensations,

even those most obscure ones of touch and pain; indeed, all over the nervous

system light seems breaking in a most remarkable way.

This great and significant progress we owe, I venture to say, to Golgi, to the

method introduced by him ; and I for one cannot help being glad that this impor-

tant contribution to science, as well as another contingent and most valuable one,

the degeneration method of Marchi, should be among the many tokens that Italy,

the mother of all sciences in times gone by, is now once more taking her right

Weplace in scientitic no less than in political life.  owe, I say, this progress to

(Grolgi in the sense that the method introduced by him was the beginning of the

Wenew researches.  owe, moreover, to Golgi not tbe mere technical introduction

of the method, but something more. He himself pointed out the theoretical signifi-

cance of the results which his method produced ; and if in this he has been out-
stripped and even corrected by others, his original merit must not be allowed to

be forgotten. Those others are many, in many lands. Among the first was one

Frithiof Nansen, whose brilliant though brief memoir makes us selfish physio-

logists regret that the icy charms of the North Pole so early froze in him' the

bubbling spring of histological research. From the rest two names stand

out conspicuous. If rejuvenescent Italy invented the method, another ancient

country, whose fame, once brilliant in the past, like that of Italy, sufi'ered

in later times an eclipse, produced the man who, above all others, has showed us how
to use it. At the meeting at Montreal a voice from Spain telling of things physio-

logical would have seemed a voice crying out of the wilderness ; to-day the name
of Ramon-y-Cayal is in every physiologist's mouth. That is one name, but there

is yet another. Years ago, when those of us who are now veterans and see signs

that it is time for us to stand aside were spelling out the primer of histology, one

name was always before us as that of a man who touched every tissue and touched

each well. It is a consoling thought to some of us elder ones that histological

research seems to be an antidote to senile decay. As the companion of the young

Spaniard in the pregnant work on the histology of the central nervous system done

in the eighties and the nineties of the century, must be named the name of the
man who was brilliant in the fifties, Albert von Kolliker,

    When I say that the progi-ess of our knowledge of the central nervous system

during the past thirteen years has been largely due to the application of the method

of Golgi, I do not mean that it, alone and by itself, has done what has been done.

That is not the way of science. Almost every thrust forward in science is a result-

ant of concurrent forces working along different lines : and in most cases at least

significant progress comes when efforts from different quarters meet and join hands.
And especially as regards methods it is true that their value and effect depend

on their coming at their allotted times. As I said above, neither experimental

investigation nor clinical observation nor histological inquiry by the then known

methods, had been idle before 1880. They had moreover borne even notable

fruits, but one thing was lacking for their fuller fruition. The experimental and

clinical results all postulated the existence of clear definite paths for impulses

within the central nervous system, of paths moreover which, while clear and

sharp, were manifold and, under certain conditions, alternate or even vicarious,

and were so constructed that the impulses as they swept along them underwent from

-- --time to time that is, at some place or other transformations or at least changes

in nature. But the methods of histological investigations available before that of

Golgi, though they taught us much, failed to furnish such an analysis of the tangle

of grey and white matter as would clearly indicate the paths required. This the

method of Golgi did, or rather is doing. Where gold failed silver has succeeded,

and is succeeding. Thanks to the black tract which silver when handled in a cer-

tain way leaves behind it in the animal body, as indeed it does elsewhere, we can

now trace out, within the central nervous system, the pathway afforded by the

Wenerve cell and the nerve cell alone.  see its dendrites branching out in various
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION 1.                                     807

directions, each alert to dance the molecular dance assigned to it at once by the

more lasting conditions which we call structural, and the more jjassing ones which

Wewe call functional, so soon as some partner touch its hand.  see the body of the

cell with its dominant nucleus ready to obey and yet to marshal and command

Wethe figure so started.  see the neuraxon prepared to carry that figure along

itself, it may be to far-distant parts, it may be to near ones, or to divert it along
collaterals, it may be many, or it may be few, or to spread out at once among

numerous seemingly equipollent branches. And whether it prove ultimately true

or no that the figure of the dancing molecules sweeps always onwards along the

dendrites towards the nucleus, and always outwards away from the nucleus along

the neuraxon, or whatever way in the end be shown to be the exact differences in

nature and action between the dendrites and the neuraxon, this at least seems sure,

that cell plays upon cell only by such a kind of contact as seems to afford an

opportunity for change in the figure of the dance, that is to say, in the nature of the

impulse, and that in at least the ordinary play it is the terminal of the neuraxon

(either of the main core or a collateral) of one cell which touches with a vibrating

Wetouch the dendrite or the body of some other cell.  can thus, I say, by the
--almost magic use of a silver tolcen I say magic use, for he who for the first time

is shown a Golgi preparation is amazed to learn that it is such a sprawling thing

as he sees before him which teaches so much, and yet when he comes to use it

--acquires daily increased confidence in its worth it is by the use of such a silver

token that we have been able to unravel so much of the intricate tangle of the

possible paths of nervous impulses. By themselves, the acquisition of a set of

pictures of such black lines would be of little value. But, and this I venture to

think is the important point, to a most remarkable extent, and with noteworthy

rapidity, the histological results thus arrived at, aided by analogous results reached

by the degeneration method, especially by the newer method akin to that of Golgi,

that of Marchi, have confirmed or at times extended and coi'rected the teachings

of experimental investigation and clinical observation. It is this which gives

strength to our present position ; we are attacking our problems along two inde-
pendent lines. On the one hand we are tracing out anatomical paths, and laying

bare the joints of histological machinery; on the other hand, beginning with the

phenomena, and analysing the manifestations of disorder, whether of our own
making or no, as well as of order, we are striving to delineate the machinery by

help of its action. When the results of the two methods coincide, we may be con-

fident that we are on the road of all truth ; when they disagree, the very disagree-

ment serves as the starting-point for fresh inquiries along the one line or the other.

Fruitful as have been the labours of the past dozen years, we may rightly con-

sider them as but the earnest of that which is to come ; and those of us who are
far down on the slope of life may wistfully look forward to the next meeting of

the Association on these Western shores, wondering what marvels will then be told.

Physiology, even in the narrower sense to which, by emphasis on the wavering

barrier which parts the animal from the plant, it is restricted in this Section, deals

with many kinds of being, and with many things in each. But, somewhat as

man, in one aspect a tiny fragment of the world, still more of the universe, in

another aspect looms so great as to overshadow everything else, so the nervous

system, seen from one point of view, is no more than a mere part of tlie whole

organism, but, seen from another point of view, seems by its importance to swallow

up all the rest. As man is apt to look upon all other things as mainly subserving

his interests and purposes, so the physiologist, but with more justice, may regard

all the rest of the body as mainly subserving the welfare of the nervous system

and, as man was created last, so our natural knowledge of the working of that

nervous system has been the latest in its growth. But, if there be any truth in
what I have urged to-day, we are witnessing a growth which promises to be as

rapid as it has seemed to be delayed. Little spirit of prophecy is needed to foretell

that in the not so distant future the teacher of physiology will hurry over tl;e

themes on which he now dwells so long, in order that he may have time to

expound the most important of alL the truths which he has to tell, those which
have to do with the manifold workings of the brain.
808 REPORT-- 1897.

And I will be here so bold as to dare to point out that this development of his

science must, in the times to come, influence the attitude of the physiologis-t

towards the world, and ought to influence the attitude of the world towards him.

I imagine that if a plebiscite, limited even to instructed, I might almost say

scientific, men, were taken at the present moment, it would be found that the

most prevalent conception of physiology is that it is a something which is in some

way an appendage to the art of medicine. That physiology is, and always must

be, the basis of the science of healing, is so much a truism that I would not venture

to repeat it here were it not that some of those enemies, alike to science and

humanity, who are at times called anti-vivisectionists, and whose zeal often

outrims, not only discretion, but even truth, have quite recently asserted that I think

otherwise. Should such a hallucination ever threaten to possess me, I should only

have to turn to the little we yet know of the physiology of the nervous system

--and remind myself how great a help the results of pure physiological curiosity

--repeat the words, pure physiological curiosity, for curiosity is the mother of

science have been, alike to the surgeon and the physician, in the treatment of

those in some way most afflicting maladies, the diseases of the nervous system.

No, physiology is, and always must be, the basis of the science of healing ; but it is

something more. When physiology is dealing with those parts of the body which

we call muscular, vascular, glandular tissues and the like, rightly handled she
points out the way not only to mend that which is hurt, to repair the damages of

bad usage and disease, but so to train the growing tissues and to guide the grown
ones as that the best use may be made of them for the purposes of life. She not

only heals, she governs and educates. Nor does she do otherwise when she comes

to deal with the nervous tissues. Nay, it is the very prerogative of these nervous

tissues that their life is above that of all the other tissues, contingent on the envi-

ronment and susceptible of education. If increasing knowledge gives us increasing

power so to mould a muscular fibre that it shall play to the best the part which it

has to play in life, the little knowledge we at present possess gives iisat least much

confidence in a coming far greater power over the nerve cell. This is not the place

to plunge into the deep waters of the relation which the body bears to the mind ;

but this at least stares us in the face, that changes in what we call the body bring

about changes in what we call the mind. When we alter the one, we alter the

other. If, as the whole past histoi'y of our science leads us to expect, in the coming

years a clearer and deeper insight into the nature and conditions of that molecular

dance which is to us the material token of nervous action, and a fuller, exacter

Icnowledge of the laws which govern the sweep of nervous impulses along fibre and

cell, give us wider and directer command oyer the moulding of the growing ner-

vous mechanism and the maintenance and regulation of the grown one, then

assuredly physiology will take its place as a judge of appeal in questions not only

of the body, but of the mind                                                                                                               it will  raise  its voice  not  in  the hospital  and con^

suiting- room only, but also in the senate and the school.

WeOne word more.  physiologists are sorely tempted towards self-righteous-

ness, for we enjoy that blessedness which comes when men revile you and persecute

you and say all manner of evil against you falsely. In the mother-countrj^ our

hands are tied by an Act which was defined by one of the highest legal authorities

as a 'penal' Act; and though with us, as with others, difficulties may have

awakened activity, our science sulTers from the action of the State. And some
there ai-e who would go still farther than the State has gone, though that is far,
who would take from us even that which we have, and bid us make bricks wholly

without straw. To go back is always a hard thing, and we in England can

hardly look to any great betterment for at least many years to come. But

imless what I have ventured to put before you to-day be a mocking phantasm,

unworthy of this great Association and this great occasion, England in this

respect at least offers an example to be shunned alike by her offspring and her

fellows.

     The following Papers were read :

    1. The Bhythm of Smootii Muscles. By Professor H. P. BowDiTcn.

      Gaskell (' Jourual of Physics,' iv. 118) has called attention to the fact that the

--three sorts of muscle fibre recog-nised by physiologists namely, striped, smooth and

--cardiac fibres are each characterised by the special development of a particular

form of activity, but that each kind of muscle possesses to a certain degree the
forms of activity which specially characterise the other kinds. Thus the power of
rapid contraction, which is most highly developed in striped muscles to serve the
purpose of locomotion, is possessed in a lesser degree by the cardiac, and in a still
less degree by the smooth muscles, whereas the power of tonic contraction,

strikingly manifested by smooth muscles, is much less marked in the cardiac and
striped muscles, and rhythmical contraction, which is the special function of the
cardiac muscle, is a phenomenon of subordinate importance in the smooth and
striped muscles. The following table represents the order in which the three

sorts of muscles stand with regard to the manifestation of the three forms of

activity.

simple and regular than those of the pyloric portion of the stomach. See also

Ducceschi (' Ar. It., de Biol.' xxvii. 61), Experiments on dog's stomacli.

      Quite recently (March, 1807), the apparatus being brought into use in a class
demonstration, the tracings of one of the pieces of stomach was observed to present

an appearance which suggested the idea that the curve was a compound one
formed by the superposition of two sets of rhythmical contractions difiering from
each oijjer slightly in rate. Diagrams were shown which illustrate two cases of
this phenomenon, in one of which there was a difference of 5 and in the other a

difference of 17 seconds in the rate of the constituent rhythms.
     Another form ox rhythm occasionally presented by smooth muscles studied in

this way is the repetition of a complicated set of contractions, the separate con-

tractions of each set differing from each other in appearance, but the set as a
whole being a repetition of the previous set.

     It is evident that if two or more such complicated sets of contraction occur
simultaneously in the same preparation, the resulting curve will be of a nature to

almost defy analysis.

   A few experiments directed to the determination of the influence of hunger

and digestion upon the nature of the gastric movements led to no definite result.
     Neither was any connection to be observed between the width of the muscular

ring and the complication of the curve.

2. The Innervation of Motor Tissues, with especial reference to Nerve-

     endings in the Sensory Muscle-spindles. By Professor G. Carl

     HuBEB, J/.i>., and Mrs. De Witt.

The obsei-vations here recorded were made with the methylen-blue method, as

Amodified by Bethe.  1 per cent, solution of methylen-blue was injected into

the blood-vessels ; the tissues to be studied were fixed in ammonium molybdate,

sectioned, and double-stained in alum carmine.

The results obtained were as follows :

     Nerve-ending in Striated Muscle (rabbit and frog). The neuraxis of the motor
neurons terminates, under the sarcolemma, in an end-brush, the fibrils of which
present the same structure as the neuraxis itself. The so-called ' sole ' is an accu-
mulation of srtreoju^rtswia, at the place of ending of the motor nerve-fibre, which is
continuous with the sarcoplasma of the muscle-fibre. The 'sole nuclei' are

muscle-nuclei.

      Nerve-ending in Heart-muscle (cat). Heart-muscle receives its innervation
from sympathetic nerve-cells. The neuraxes of such nerve-cells terminate in
varicose fibrils which end on the heart muscle-cell in small bulbar enlargements

or in small clusters of such bulbar enlargements.
     Nerve-ending in Involuntary Smooth Muscles (intestine of cat, frog, and tor-

toise). Involuntary smooth muscle receives its nerve-supply from sympathetic
nerve-cells. The neuraxes of the sympathetic neurons innervating involuntary
muscle end, after repeated branching, in small knobs which rest on the spindle-
shaped muscle cells, often near the nucleus.

     Nerve-ending in Muscle-spindle. Muscle-spindles were described by Kblliker
((under the name ' Muskel-Knospen ') in frog's muscle as early as 1862. They
were soon after found by Kiihne in the voluntary muscles of other vertebrates.
Since that time they have been repeatedly described and variously interpreted.
They were described as growth-centres by Kolliker, Bremer, Felix, v. Frauqut^,

nerve-endings, by Kerschner, lluffini, Sherrington, and Sihler : Sherrington having
shown conclusively by the degeneration-method that the spindle-nerves are spinal

root-ganglion nerves.

      VVe were concerned more particularly with the ending of the spindle-nerves in
the muscle-spindles ; our observations were as follows :

     In the frog the spindle-nerves terminate in fine, varicose fibrils, which run
along, outside of the sarcolemma, on the intrafusal fibres.

      In the snake only one intrafusal muscle-fibre is found in the muscle-spindles.
The spindle-nerve enters the spindle from the pole, and breaks up into several
nonmedullated branches, which follow along by the side of the intrafusal fibres,
giving ofi" in their course flat, band-like off-shoots, which partly or completelj-^

encircle the intrafusal fibre.

     In the tortoise the spindle-nerves end in nonmedullated branches, which flatten
out into irregular, notched endings having a serpentine course ou the intrafusal

fibres.

     In the bird the spindle-nerves terminate in nonmedullated fibres, which have
the appearance of a repeatedly folded ribbon.

     In mammalia the spindle-nerves terminate in ribbon-like endings, which are
often distinctly wound around the intrafusal fibre (dog, cat and rat) iu the form of

--a spiral annulo-spiral endings ; or may branch and have a zigzag course on the

intrafusal fibre, in which case few spirals are seen (rabbit and probably also man).
The ribbon-like nonmedullated fibres terminate by branching and ending in disc-

--like expansion flower-like endings of Ruffini.

     Some few observations are at hand which go to show that the intrafusal fibres
have a motorial ending. In this respect we corroborate Kerschner.

    We have regarded the muscle-spindles as sensorial end-organs.

4. The Ear and the Lateral Line in Fishes.^ By Frederic S. Lee, Ph.D.

     The chief morphological facts upon which the tbeoiy of the origin of the ear
from the system of the lateral line is based are similarity in structure of the adult
organs, in innervation, and in ontogeny. Physiology seems able to present at least
circumstantial evidence in favour of this theory. The author has investigated the
functions of the ear and the sense-organs of the lateral line in fishes.

   --1. The Ear. The results may be tabulated as follows :

Tlie above functions are divisions of the general function of equilibration : the

sense-organs of the ear deal with the equilibrium of the body imder all circum-

stances, both in movement and at rest.

In vertebrates above the fishes we must add to the above

     Experiments by the author and by Kreidl prove that fishes do not possess the
power of audition. Hence the ear in fishes is purely equilibrative in function.

812 REPORT-- 1897.

   --2. The Lateral Line. Simple cutting- of the lateral nerve or destruction of

the lateral organs does not seem to aftect equilibrium. But destruction of th&
organs, combined with removal of tlu pectoral and pelvic fins, causes marked
lack of equilibrium, manifested by uncertain, ill-regulated movements ; removal of
fins alone has no pronounced effect. Central stimulation of the lateral nerve
causes the same compensating movements of the fins as does stimulation of the
acoustic of the opposite side. These results make it probable that the organs of
the lateral line are equilibrative in function, and are employed in the recognition
of currents in the water and of movements of the body through the water. The
results of Bonnier and of Fuchs are in harmony with this.

    This was probably the primitive function. By the inclosure within the skull

of a bit of the lateral line and the differentiation and refinement of its sense-organs,
a more perfect organ of appreciation of movement, and hence of equilibrium, was
evolved in the ear. Along with the appearance of land animals a portion of this
organ became still more differentiated and refined and, as the papilla acustica

hasilaris, acquired the power of appreciating the movements that we call sound.
Thus equilibration and audition became associated in the same organ.

6. A Dynamometric Study of the Strength of the Several Gronjjs of

    Mttscles, and the Relation of Corresponding Homologous Groups of
    Muscles in Man. By 3. H. Kellogg, M.D.

    In the Paper the author describes a new dynamometer so constructed that it
may be conveniently employed in testing the strength of each of the important

groups of muscles in the body. By means of this apparatus charts have been pre-
pared whereby the strength of each muscular group in the individual may be com-

pared with the strength of those of the average man or the average woman-, or the
average man or woman of the same height.

    By a study of the tabulated results of several thousand examinations the

author has been able to formulate a series of new physical coefficients, the chief of

which are the following :--

1. The strength-weight coefficient is obtained by dividing the total strength

in kilograms by the weight in kilograms, the result showing the number of kilo-

grams which a person is able to lift for each kilogram of his own weight. This-

coefficient expresses the dynamic value or capacity of a person's body.

2- The respiratory-weight coefficient, obtained by multiplying the lung capa-

city in litres as shown by the spirometer, by the respiratory strength in kilograms,

and dividing the result by the body weight in kilograms. This coefficient expresses

the respiratory capacity for each kilogram.

3. The strength-height coefficient, obtained by dividing the total strength in

kilograms by the total height in millimetres. This coefficient expresses the number

of kilograms which an individual is able to lift for each millimetre in height.
     4. The respiratory-height coefficient, obtained by multiplying the lung capacity

in litres by the respiratory strength in kilograms and dividing by the height in

millimetres. This coefficient represents the respiratory capacity of the individual

for each millimetre in height.

5. The coefficient of vital efficiency, obtained by dividing the respiratory-

mweight coefficient by the strength-weight coefficient. This coefficient combines
    one expression the relations represented by the respiratory-weight and the

strength-weight coefficients, and represents the relation of a person's respiratory

capacity to his working capacity.

  6.  The  coefficient  of  vital  development, obtained by dividing the respiratory-

_

height by the strength-height coefficient, which combines in one expression the
         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                          813

relations represented by the respiratory-height and the strength-height coefficient
respectively, and indicates at once whether a person's respiratory development is
properly proportioned to his motor development.

     The same data from which these several coefficients are deduced afford oppor-
tunity for the formulation of a coefficient relating to any individual group of

muscles.

     The extended study of the strength of various muscular groups by comparison
with each other and with the strength of the body as a whole, or of distinct sec-
tions of the body, has developed numerous interesting relations. In this compara-

tive study chief attention has been given to the following points :

     1. The relative strength of each group of the muscles, and of each division of
the body, and also of the total muscular strength, as compared with the average
weight of the body.

     2. The strength of each group of muscles, of the muscles of each of the principal
divisions of the body, and' of the total strength of the body compared with the

average height in inches.

     3. The strength of each group of muscles, and of the muscles of each of the
principal divisions of the body, as compared with the total strength.

     4. The strength of each group of muscles (right and left together) as compared
with the strength of the corresponding division of the body.

     5. The strength of the muscles of the left side of the body as compared with

those of the right side of the body.

     6. The strength of each group of muscles, of the muscles of each division of
the body, and the total strength in women as compared with the same in men.

     7. The strength of each group of muscles as compared with the antagonising

group.

     8. The strength of the muscles of the arms as compared with the homologous

or corresponding muscles of the legs.

   A9. study of the muscular strength of men as compared with that of women

of the same height.

    10. A study of the muscular strength in short men and short women as com-

pared respectively with that of tall men and tall women.

The following Papers and Report were read :

1. The Output of the Mammalian Heart, By Dr. G. N. Stewart.

We possess at present very few data for the determination of the amount oi

blood thrown out by the left ventricle at each beat. The direct estimation of this

important physiological quantity by the introduction of a ' Stromuhr ' in the

undivided aorta (according to the method of Tigerstedt, in the rabbit), or by the

insertion of a measuring cylinder in the course of the lesser circulation, after the

great systemic vessels have been tied (as Stolnikow has done in the dog), is not

only beset with experimental difficulties, but the results obtained under conditions

fio highly artificial can hardly be applied with any confidence to the problems of

the normal and unobstructed blood-flow. The author of this paper has, accordingly,

re-examined the question by means of a new method, and by its aid has measured

the output of the heart in a series of dogs, more than twenty in number, and

--Aranging in weight from 5 to nearly 35 kilograms.
Method.  solution of a substance which can be easily recognised and quanti-

tatively estimated iu the blood (1"5 or 2 per cent, sodium chloride) is allowed to

flow for a measured time, not greater than the circulation time (usually 10-15 sec.)

into the heart. The solution is delivered from a burette connected either with a

catheter passed through the jugular vein down nearly to the right auricle (or into
814 REPORT--1897.

the auricle), or with a glass tube inserted through the carotid artery into the left

ventricle. In the latter case, a valve in the course of the connecting tube prevents

any back-flow of blood. Both femoral arteries (or sometimes both brachials) are

Aexposed.  cannula (collecting cannula) is inserted into a branch of one of the

arteries and the other is laid on two hook-shaped platinum electrodes connected

with the Wheatstone's bridge, with which a telephone is connected in the usual way.

Weak induction shocks from the secondary of a du Bois coil are sent through the

arrangement, including the piece of artery on the electrodes, and tlie bridge is

balanced. When the mixture of blood and salt solution reaches the electrodes the

balance is upset, and the telephone announces the moment of arrival of the mixture.

A sample of blood is now drawn off by means of the collecting cannula, during

the passage of the salt solution, and immediately defibrinated. Then it can be

determined at leisure how much of the salt solution must be added to a sample

collected before the injection to make its resistance equal to that of the sample

collected during the passage of the mixture. Numerous observations can be made

in this way on one animal ; and from these data the output of the heart for the

period of injection, and, therefore, the pulse-rate being known, for a single beat, can

--be calculated.
     Specimens of Mestdts. In a dog weighing 32-26 kilo, the average output (for

the first si.x observations) was 568 c.c. per beat, equal to 2'71 c.c. per kilo, of body-

weight per second, with an average pulse-rate of 1*54 per second. In a dog of
body-weight 6-48 kilo., the average output was 14'8 c.c. per beat, or 3'52 c.c. per

kilo, per second for an average pulse-rate of 1-61. In an animal of intermediate
size (18"2 kilo.) the average output for the first five observatians was 41'6 c.c. per

beat, or 2-ul c.c. per kilo, per second for an average pulse-rate of 1"01.

    In general it may be said that the results of these experiments go to show that

the more recent measurements of Tigerstedt and Stolnikow are too low, while the

older numbers of Volkmann and Vierordt are too high.

   ACEThe animals were all completely antesthetised with morphia and ether, or

mixture, and were killed before recovering from the anaesthetic.

      2. Observations on the Mammalian Heart. By W. T. Porter.

     Experimental evidence was offered in support of the following propositions :

    A. On the cause of the heart-beat.
     1. The cause of the rhythmic contraction of the ventricle lies within the

ventricle itself.

     2. The cause of the rhythmic contraction is not a single, localised co-ordination
centre ; the co-ordination mechanism, whatever it may be, is present in all parts

of the ventricle.

     3. The integrity of the whole ventricle is not essential to the co-ordinated

contraction of a part of the ventricle.

     4. The apex of the mammalian heart possesses spontaneous rhythmic contrac-

tility,

     5. Assuming that the general belief in the absence of nerve-cells fi-om the
apical part of the ventricle is correct, these experiments demonstrate that nerve-

cells are not essential to spontaneous, long-continued, co-ordinated contractions of
the ventricle.

     B. Fibrillary contractions do not destroy beyond recall the power of normal
rhythmic, co-ordinated contraction of the heart muscle.

      C. The influence of ventricular systole on the blood'Jlow through tJte heart

muscle.

     1. The contraction of the heart compresses the blood-vessels in the substance

of the heart.

     2. The systole aids the circulation of the blood through the heart muscle.
             TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                              815

     3. The ventricle acts on the coronaiy circulation as a force-pump, and not, to
any noticeable extent, as a suction-pump.

     D. The circulation through the veins of Thelesius.
     1. The nutrition of the mammalian heart may be maintained through the
vessels of Thehesius in a degree sulhcient to give long-continued rhythmic contrac-
tions while the coronary arteries are empty.
     2. The circulation through the veins of Thebesius is probably an important
source of nutrition in hearts in which the coronary arteries have been obstructed
by pathological processes.

3. On the Resistance of the Vasculxir Channels. By Professor K. Hurtule.

     For every scientific investigation of the flow of fluid through a tube or system
of tubes a knowledge of the three following factors is necessary :

     (1) The pressure at thi:- inlet and outlet of the tube (difference = b).
     (2) The velocity of flow, or the quantity of fluid flowing through in an unit of
time = Q.
     (3) The resistance offered to the flow.

    Concerning the first two factors in the movement of the blood we have data
sufficient for most purposes, but of the third we have no clear conception, since we

possess no standard of resistance of the vascular channels.
     The amount of this resistance depends on two factors :

     (1) The internal friction of the blood.
     (2) The dimensions of the tubular system.

     These two factors must therefore first be determined.

     1. The method used to determine the internal friction of living blood consists
in allowing the blood from {e.g.) the carotid of an animal to flow through accu-
rately calibrated capillary tubes for about thirty seconds, the quantity, the pres-
.sure and the time of flow being accurately measured, the last to within ^ J- second.

     It was proved that this method, in spite of the short period of observation,
gives reliable results by determining with it the internal friction of distilled water.
The value obtained was the same as that by Poiseuille.

     In the same series of experiments it was also shown that the internal friction
can be ascertained even when the pressure varies rhythmically, the outflow bein"-
always proportional to the mean pressure, whether the pressure be constant or

variable.

     The measurements of the internal friction of the blood of difierent animals by
this method gave the following results. The ratio of the internal friction of dis-
tilled water at 37° C. (Z- = 4700) to that of the blood is--

                               In the dog =1:4-5 (K = 1,045).
                                In the cat = 1 : 4-1 (K = 1 ,140).
                                In the rabbit = 1:3-2 (K = 1,475).

     2. Direct determination of the external resistance by measurement of the

dimension of the system of tubes is impossible, since the variation in tonus causes

considerable differences in the calibre of the blood-vessels. But if in any par-
ticular organ we know (1 j the quantity of blood flov.'ing through in an unit of
time ( = Q), (2) the arterial pressure ( = 6), (3) the coefficient of Jnternal friction
of the blood ( = A),

Q --= A --^  where d is the diameter, and 1 the length of the tube,

we can, by Poiseuille's law, calculate the dimensions of a tube through which,
under the given conditions, the same quantity of blood would flow. Such a tube
--816 REPORT 1897.

would represent a numerically expressible resistance. On this basis the folio-wing

calculations of resistances were made, using R. Tigerstedt's measurements of

velocity :
       TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.                       817

therefore tecomes much distended. Periods of large ventricular diastoles and

systoles and large auricular systoles thereof alternate with others of small ventri-
cular movements and weak systoles and great distension of the auricle.

     These periods are best seen in the beginning of the irregular stage of poisoning

with substances of the digitalis group, where the irritability of the ventricle has
been increased just enough to cause a slightly more rapid rhythm than that supplied

from the auricle. As the irritability is further augmented, the periods become

shorter and less distinct. I have observed this periodic variation once (under

caffein), where Rw = R« -- 1.
    Occasionally another form of rhythmic irregularity occurs, in which Ry =

R« -- 2. In this case a secondary period occurs during the primary one, and the
whole period is distinctly less regular. When Ry = R« -- 3 the periodic variations
become still more difficult to trace, and when the divergence between Rj; and Ra

is still greater all appearance of periodicity is lost.

    In the normal lieart the position of the As in the ventricular cycle varies from
the first third of the diastole to the extreme end of the diastolic pause, and may
even be prolonged into the ventricular systole. The efficiency of the heart must
be atfected by this factor, least work being wasted when the auricular systole

corresponds with the first part of the ventricular relaxation, and a considerable

amount of energy being expended in the mutual opposition of the auricle and
ventricle, when the systole of the former overlaps into that of the latter.

7. The Absorption of Serum in the Intestine. By E. Waymoutii Reid,

               Professor of Physiology in University College, Dundee.

     Heidenhain ^ demonstrated the fact that the water, organic and inorganic
solids of serum introduced into the intestine, are absorbed.

    The experiment was devised in support of the theory that intestinal absorption
is possible under conditions in which osmotic transfer is excluded.

     It was found that even inspissated serum is absorbed, and that at no time
during the course of the experiment is a serum with a lower percentage of sohds
than that of the experimental animal found in the loop of gut, thus meeting the

objection (so far as the absorption of the solids is concerned) that in such cases

the serum introduced into the gut is diluted by water from the succus entericus.
     Heidenhain omitted to measure the hydrostatic pressure on either side of the

intestinal membrane, so that the possibility of the result being due to filtration
was not excluded; and, indeed, the ancient filtration theory of Lieberhuhn"^ has,
with the necessary modern histological modifications, been revived of late by

Hamburger.^ In the experiments now described, the animal's own serum (obtained

by the centrifugal machine) was introduced into a loop of its intestine, and the hydro-
static pressure in the cavity of the experimental loop, and in a mesenteric vein
proceeding from a control loop, filled with ' normal saline ' solution, observed
(iontinuously during the course of the experiment.

     As will be seen from the cases quoted, water, organic and inorganic solids, are

absorbed against considerable excess of hydrostatic pressure in the blood-vessels.
(Since the velocity of the blood stream in capillaries is low, it is taken for granted
that the pressure in the capillaries of the intestinal villi is not lower than that in
a mesenteric vein at the border of the gut.)

     The experiment presents practically the same features iohen all the lacteals

    Xo explanation of the above experiments is here attempted, but attention is

briefly called to the following negative points :

     Osmosis, filtration into the blood capillaries, or into the lacteals bythe action of
Briicke's ' villus pump ' are, it is considered, excluded by the conditions of the

experiment.

     That the disappearance of the serum from the cavity of the gut is simply a

                                                                                3g2

matter of imbibition is in the highest degree improbable, because the cells must be,
at the commencement of the experiment, soaked to the highest degree possible in
those constituents of the animal's serum which they are capable of taking up.

      Electro-osmotic action is again improbable, because secreting membranes pro-
duce ingoing electrical currents as well as absorbing membranes ; and, to apply
such an hypothesis, it would be necessary to assume that the ingoing current of the

cells is active in one case (absorption), the outgoing retm-n current in the other
 (secretion) involving the further hypothesis of some valvular nature of protoplasm
with higher ' porosity ' in the ' in-out ' direction in the absorbing, and the ' out-in '
direction in the secreting, membrane.

      Finally, any aspirating action of the blood current in the capillaries of the villi
is negligible on account of the low velocity of the current in capillary districts of
the circulation.

      10. On the PhosplLorus MetahoUsm of the Salmon in Fresh Water.
                   By D. Noel Paton, M.D., F.R.C.P. {Ed.).

     The observations here recorded form part of an extended study on the meta-
bolism of the salmon in fresh water.

     The method of investigation was to take for analyses sample salmon through-
out the spring, summer, and autumn from tbe mouths of certain rivers, and other
specimens from the upper waters of the same rivers, and by comparing these to

arrive at conclusions as to the extent of the changes going on.

     Observations made by Drs. GuUand, Gillespie, Uunlop, and myself clearly show
that the fish do not feed during their stay in fresh water. The muscle substance
steadily diminishes, while the ovaries and testes grow at its expense. The fats
and proteids lost from the muscles are sufficient to supply these materials for the
growing genitalia, and to yield a very large amount of energy for muscular work.

     The question here discussed is the Exchange of Phosphorus.
     It is first shown that in muscle the phosphorus is chiefly in the form of
inorganic phosphates, though a comparatively large amount of lecithin and a small
amount of nuclein are also present.

  --In the ovary the phosphorus is chiefly combined in the pseudo-nuclein ichthu-

lin ; but it is also present in considerable amounts in lecithin, and in very small
amounts as inorganic phosphates.

     In the testis the phosphorus is chiefly in the form of true nucleins, but there are
also a considerable quantity of lecithin and a small quantity of inorganic phosphate.

    As the season advances the phosphorus in the genitalia increases, while the

phosphorus of the muscle diminishes. The loss of phosphorus from the muscle
IS barely sufficient to account for the gain in the ovary, amply sufficient to yield
the increase of phosphorus in the testis. The lecithin lost from the muscle is
sufficient only to account for a small part of the lecithin gained by the ovary.
The lecithin and ichthulin of the ovary must thus be found by synthesis as these
structures grow. The nuclein of the testis must be formed in a similar manner.

     The presence of considerable amounts of lecithin in the growing ovary and
testis would seem to indicate that this substance is one of the first stages in the-
construction of nucleo compounds.

      12. The Gastric Inversion of Cane Sugar hy Hydrochloric Acid}

                             By Professor Graham Lusk.

     For thirty-five years it has been shown upon the lecture table of ^'oit that a
·3% hydrochloric acid solution at the temperature of the body has the power of
rapidly inverting cane sugar. After feeding an animal with cane sugar, that and

invert sugar are found in the stomach, while only invert sugar is to be detected in

the intestinal canal. No inverting enzyme has been fouud in the stomach similar

to that present in the small intestines. The question to be solved was this : is

the acid of the gastric juice a sufficient agent to accomplish such inversion of cane

sugar as takes place within the stomach ? The following table shows in per cent,
the amount of cane sugar inverted after standing diiferent lengths of time, with

different strengths of acid, at a temperature of 38-40° C.

1. Study of the Coni'parative Fhysiolorpj of the Cells of the Sym^mthetic

               Nervous System. By Professor G. Carl Huber.

     The sympathetic neurons are multipolar in all vertebrates except the amphibia,
where the nerve cells are unipolar. The dendrites of the multipolar sympathetic
neurons form an intercellular plexus (between the cell-bodies of the sympathetic
neurons constituting the ganglion) and a general peripheral plexus' under the
capsule of the ganglion. The neuraxes of sympathetic neurons terminate either in

involuntary muscle, in heart muscle, in glandular tissue, in the spinal root-ganglion,
and possibly also in other sympathetic ganglia.

      Terminating in the sympathetic gapglia are found small medullated nerve
fibres, first correctly described by Gashell, then by Langley and others, which
leave the cerebro-spinal axis through the anterior or motor roots of the dorsal and
three or four upper lumbar nerves and constitute the white rami communicantes.

That these nerve fibres end in the ganglia has been shown by Langley and others
by the nicotin-method.

     They end by forming pericellular, intracapsular plexuses, which, while they may
show a slight variation in structure in the different vertebrates, may nevertheless

be regarded as similar in all vertebrates.
      The sympathetic neuron forms, therefore, a terminal link in a neuron-chain of

which the second link is formed by a neuron the neuraxis of which constitutes the
neuraxis of a nerve-fibre in a white ramus.

               2. Investigations in the Micro -chemistry of Nerve Cells.

                              By J. J. Mackenzie.

      It was found that the Nissl granulations iu nerve cells were distinctly iron-
 holding, and consequently related to the iron-holding chromatins of the nucleus.

      Pathological cells from rabbits, inoculated with rabies, were studied for com-
 parison, and it was found that as long as basophil granulations were present in the
 cell, it was possible to obtain an iron reaction in them. In the motor cells of the
 cortex, in rabid animals, it was found that oxyphil granulations appeared in the
 situations which the Nissl granulations had occupied, and that these oxyphilic
 granules were very slightly iron-holding. It seemed probable that there was a
 conversion of iron-holding basophil granules into oxyphil granules containing little

 iron.

                              Par Professor Dr. C. Richet.

     J'ai pu, avec la collaboration d'Andre Broca, d^moutrer qu'il y a dans les
centres nerveux cer^braux et m6dullaires (chez le chien) une periode refractaire.
On ne connaissait jusqirici ce ph^nomene que pour le ccEur; il est important de
coni-tater qu'il existe, avec une nettett^ plus grande encore que pour le coeur, dans

les cellules nerveuses.

     Soit un chien, refroidi a 30°, et, pour rimmobilisation et 1 insensibility, anes-
t!iesi(5 avec du chloralose (0-10 grin, par kilogrm.); il repondra aux excitations
c^rebrales electriques, si celies-ci ne sont pas trop frequentes, par des r^ponses mus-

culaires isolees. La plupart des physiologistes n'ont tUudit3 que les excitations

fr6quentes. Voyons les etfets des excitations Isoldes.
      Si elles sont rythmees a 1 par seconde, elles sont 6gales ; mais, si elles sont

rythmces a 4 par seconde, il y en aura une grande et une petite, et enfin, si elles
sont rvtbm^es a 10 par seconde. il n'y aura plus de rdponse a chaque excitation,
mais seulement 1 reponse sur 2. II se fait alors un rythme qui est dans un rapport
simple avec le rytbme excitateur ^, |, \. selon les cas, suivant la rapidite des excita-

     Ainsi, dans certaines conditions, sur deux excitations luminal nerepond qua

 ime seule, car la seconde tombe dans la p6riode refractaire.

    Meme avec les excitations mecaniques le resultat est identique. Un cbien

cbloralos6 repond a chaque excitation mtScanique de la table sur laquelle il repose
par une contraction convulsive soudaine. Mais s'il est refroidi, et si on fait des

6branlement3 frequents de la table, il ne repond plus qua une secousse sur deux.
     On peut (^tablir qu'il s'agit la d'un phenomene analogue a, celui que les physiciena

ont appel^ Vamortissement des vibrations et synchronisation des oscillant^. De

 fait dans I'^tude du systeme nerveux on ne s'etait pa3_ preoccupS de Tel^ment
 physique de la vibration nerveuse, et on avait surtout envisage I'el^ment chimique.
 Mais il est n^cessaire qu'une vibration s'^teigne apres qu'elle a eu lieu, de sorte que
 cette periode d'extinction de la vibration est la periode refractaire.

      Pour amortir une vibration, il semble que le mode adopt(5 par la nature soit
 celui d'uue courbe avec retour graduel a I'^tat d't5quilibre, au lieu du retour par
 une s^rie d'oscillations de plus en plus petites. C'est le procsSde que Lord Kelvin a

 adopte pour I'amortissement des oscillations electriques dans la transmission des

 d6peches par cable sous-marin.

      La dur^e de cette periode r6fractaire est d'un dizieme de seconde chez ces chiens

 normaux.
       Chez les chiens refroidis a 30° elle est de 0"5 sec.

      On la mesure en saisissant le moment ou deux secousses consecutives sont

 ^"ales entre elles. Chez un chien refroidi a 30°, il suffit que les excitations c^r^brales
 soient distantes de moins de 0'5 sec pour que les deux r^ponses musculaires soient

  int5gales.

      On peut prouver qu'il y a chez I'homme une periode refractaire, en ce sens,

 que des excitations cer6brales (ou des volitions) Isoldes ne peuvent avoir un

 rythme plus frequent que 10 ou 11 par seconde. On peut s'en convaincre en
 essayant de penser une gamme mu.sicale, par exemple, ou une sdrie de voyelles ou
 de mots, avec le maximum de rapidity, et on verra qu'on ne ddpasse pas 11, ou 12

  tout au plus, par seconde.
       Nous avons done par cette constatation et cette mesure de la periode refractaire

  determine la duree de la vibration nerveuse ; et par la etabli en quelque sorte

  Vuniti psychologique du temps.

       La conscience, resultat de I'activite nerveuse, a done une periode ilementaire
  et cette periode elementaire est d' environ un dizieme de seconde.

9. Demonstration of the Pendidtom Chronoscope aiid Accessory

  Apparatus. By Dr. E. W. Scripture, Yale University.

    The pendulum chronoscope contains, in the first place, an accurately adjusted
double-bob pendulum. This pendulum is held by a catch at the right-hand side.
In making an experiment this catch is pressed noiselessly and the pendulum starts
its swing. It carries along a light pointer held in position by a delicate spring.
At a definite moment it presses a delicate catch which releases the mechanism
beneath the base. This mechanism is adjusted to do several things : one of them
is to drop a shutter which covers an opening at the back of the chronoscope. The
person experimented upon is seated at the back ; owing to the curtain he can see

nothing but the covered opening. He finds before him a rubber button like that
on a telegraph-key. He is to press this button as soon as he sees the shutter
expose the opening. He does so, and another mechanism releases a horizontal bar

running behind the scale. The pointer swings between this bar and the scale, and
is consequently stopped when the bar snaps against the scale. The zero-point is
passed at the moment the shutter starts to fall ; the marks on the scale indicate
the number of thousandths that elapse till the button is pressed. The instrument

is built with the greatest accuracy. For reaction to light, coloured cards or pieces
of transparent celluloid are inserted into a holder just behind the shutter.

     The reactions to light are not disturbed by noises, as the pendulum makes no

noise either at release or during its swing, and the shutter makes only a faint

Boimd.

For reactions to sound without further apparatus, the shutter is arranged to

strike with a noise. In this case a constant quantity is subtracted from the scale.

For these reactions it is generally preferable to insert a telephone with a battery in

circuit with the platinum contact about to be described.

    The shutter rests against a platinum point in such a way that its movement

can be used to break an electric circuit ; this can be used ibr producing lights,

Asounds, electric shocks, &c.   strong electro-magnet is placed beneath the base

in such a way that it can take the place of the button ; thus the pointer can be

caught by the movement of a key in the hands of a distant person. An arrange-

ment is also provided whereby the pendulum itself is released electrically. Still

further mechanisms are added for various purposes.

   Among the accessory apparatus are a newly invented lamp battery, a simple,

cheap and convenient arrangement which changes a high voltage dynamo current

into a low voltage current suitable for ordinary battery purposes^e.^., to run

tuning forks, telegraph instruments, bells, &c.

10. The Tricolour Lantern for Illustrating the Physiology and Psychology

      of Colour-vision. By Dr. E. W. Scripture, Yale University.

    By means of special triple slides and accessory apparatus, the fundamental laws
of colour-vision can be demonstrated. The newer theory of colour-blindness is

illustrated by some specially devised slides.

                          11. Observations on Visual Contrast.

          By C. S. Sherrington, M.A., M.D., F.R.S., Liverpool.

    1. On a parti-coloured disc let two concentric circular bands, each composed of

the same two colours alternately disposed, be inscribed, and the arrangement of the
Component colours be such as to, in one band (A), minimise the contrast of the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION I.  825

colours, and in the other (B) to accentuate it. On whirling the disc, it is found

Athat the r.ate of revolution required to fuse the component colours in ring-band

is less than that required for ring-band B. In this way the heightened contrast
between the colours is found to take effect when all knowledge of the contrast

between their components and the background has been eliminated from conscious-
ness. Judgment is thereby eliminated from the effect, and the relation of judg-
ment to simultaneous contrast decided against the lielmholtz view and in favour
of the Hering view.

   A measurement of the degree of simultaneous contrast may be obtained from the

rate of rotation required for fusion.

     2. On a parti-coloured disc two concentric circular bands, each composed of the
same two component tints, are so inscribed that the darker component of one (A) is to a
certain extent deepened in tint by simultaneous contrast against the background. On

spinning the disc it is found that the ring-band (A) appears darker than its fellow
ring-band, although physically the intensity of the components are exactly equal in
the two. This visual darkening is apparent w^hen all knowledge of the existence
of simultaneous contrast has been dismissed by fusion of the components of the

background by rapid translation of the surface.

    3. On a disc half black half white let two short black arcs jut from the black

into the white half, and at the opposite radius two counterpart white arcs jut into
the black half. These pairs are so placed as to compensate one for the other
throughout the entire disc the angular quantities of black and white are equal.

On spinning the disc the rate of intermission sufficient to extinguish ' flickering ' in

the sensation obtained might be expected to be the same for all parts of the disc.

This is not the case. In one direction of spin, the rate of rotation required to fuse
the ring-bands possessing the jutting black arcs is higher than that required for

the intermediate ring-band on the disc; in the opposite direction the reverse.

Successive contrast is here adding its effect to simultaneous contrast : the latter is

here, as in the previous experiments, obviously taking effect, although rapid trans-
lation of the surfiice has removed all possibility of the observer being aware of its

existence on the disc.

    4. On a disc half white half black two short red arcs (A and B) are inscribed in

tlie black half at different radial distances, and two similar short arcs of black

B(A' and B') are inscribed in the white half, A' and A, and B,' being at the same

radial distances. On being whirled the tints of the two ring bands are found to differ
in brightness, even when in an ordinarily lighted room, the rate of intermission is

as rapid as 80 times a second. This difference seems explicable by successive
contrast, and indicates that even after a fiftieth of a second exposure to black, the
eye has been more sensitive to white, and conversely after a fiftieth of a second
exposure to moderate white.

     5. On a disc of 160° white and 200° black, let some short and rather narrow arcs

of red be placed on the white sector where it abuts on the black. Let half the
number of red arcs lie at one border of the white near the edge of the disc, the

other at the other border near the centre of the disc. When studied by lamp

light (j-ellowish illumination) one of the sets of arcs will, on spinning the disc

somewhat slowly, seem much less bright than the other set, and the grey of the

disc in the spaces between the arcs of visually darker red will appear bluish-green

in the spaces between the visually brighter red arcs will appear pale yellow.

This yellow appears due to a development of a positive after-image, the blue

chiefly to a negative image, but also in part probably to simultaneous contrast.

On whirling the disc at higher speed, the tints of the two red bands, also of the

intermediate bands, approximate, both the latter two becoming pale greenish-blue.

At still higher speeds the red bands become fully alike, and the intermediate bands
become completely similar pale green-blue bands. At this rate the intermittence

has become too frequent to permit the influence of rebound effects, and successive
contrast has been eliminated, simultaneous contrast alone remaining. But the rate

required to do this is higher in certain discs than one-fiftieth of a second. By

thus using the discs as rheotom for the visual sensations, it is found that a

perceptible after-image is formed after a very moderately intense stimula-

tion in less tlian one-fiftieth of a second. The method shows also that from one-
tiftieth of a second up to a quarter of a second after its commencement this after-
image continues perceptibly increasing in intensity.

1. Preliminary Account of the Effects vqmn Blood-jn-essure j)roduced hy the

     Intra-venous Injection of Fluids containing Choline, Neurine, or

    Allied Products. By F. W. Mott, M.D., F.R.S., and W. D. Halli-

     burton, M.D., F.R.S.

--The experiments have been conducted as follows: The animals used were

dogs anaesthetised with ether. The right external jugular vein and the left

carotid artery were exposed, and a cannula was introduced into each vessel. The

artery was connected with a mercurial manometer in the usual way for taking a
Ablood-pressure tracing.
                          simultaneous tracing of the respiratory movements

was taken by the tambour method.

     The fluids were injected into the vein, and the results were, with certain

--exceptions to be afterwards mentioned, in all cases similar viz., no marked effect

upon respiration, but a marked temporary liill in the blood-pressure, which begins

about 10 seconds after the commencement of the injection.

The fluids we used were

(1) Normal cerebro-spinal fluid. This produced no effect.

(2) Cerebro-spinal fluid obtained jaosf onortem from a considerable number of

cases of general paralysis of the insane, from one case of stuporose melancholia,

and from one case of cerebral haemorrhage owing to the giving way of a cortical

cerebral vessel.

To avoid fallacy of decomposition from microbic growth, it may be stated that

the bodies were placed in a cold chamber (0° C. or below that) within half an

hour of death, and cultures were in all cases made from the cerebro-spinal fluid

and blood of the frontal sinus, nnd in nearly all instances without result. This is

necessary, because many of these people die with bladder afiection or ulcerative

colitis, and microbic toxins might arise.

    As a rule, 10 c.c. of the fluid were injected ; and although the effect varied
somewhat in degree, yet in only one instance did no fall in the blood-pressure
                           trat;sactions of section i.                                                           827

occur. That iustaiice was the cerebro-spinal fluid from the case of cortical

htt'iuorrhage, au acute case with no naked-eye wasting of the brain substance.

      (o) The cerebro-spinal fluid was boiled and filtered, and the filtrate gave the

same result. It could not, therefore, be due to proteid.

     (4) The cerebro-spinal fluid was mixed with several times its volume of
alcohol, by which all proteids and proteoses would be precipitated. It was

filtered, and the filtrate dried at a temperature of about 40° C, and the residue
dissolved in saline solution. This, when injected, gave a similar fall in the blood-

pressure.

     (5) Solution of neurine hydrochloride 0-1 per cent, solution. 2-5 c.c. gave a
similar fall ; but in most instances this was followed by a return to or even above

tlie original pressure and then a second fall ' which persisted to some extent, a

condition we never observed with the cerebro-spinal fluid. This result is similar

to that previously obtained by Schiifer and Oliver. Stronger doses produce marked

slowing of the heart, and slowing and deepening of the respiration. The fatal dose

is less than a decigramme, respiration ceasing before the heart.

      (G) Solution of choline hydrochloride 0'2 per cent, solution. 5 c.c. gave a

result identical as far as we could observe with tliat obtained by the pathological
cerebro-spinal fluids. With stronger doses there is slowing of the heart.

     (7) The blood obtained from patients snflering from pseudo-apoplectiform con-
vulsions of general paralysis obtained by venesection was mixed with several times

its volume of absolute alcohol, filtered, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness at
about 40° C. The residue was dissolved in saline solution and a (][uantity was

injected corresponding to 50 c.c. of the original blood in each case. The result
obtained corresponded entirely with that obtained with the pathological cerebro-
spinal fluids and with solution of choUiie. Normal blood similarly treated gave a

negative result.

    It may be added that section of the vagi has no influence on the fall of blood-

jn-essure produced by the injection.

     The substance in the pathological cerebro-spinal fluid which produces the efiect
is precipitable by phosphotungstic acid ; it is therefore probably alkaloidal in
nature. Normal cerebro-spinal fluid after removal of the proteid gives no precipi-
tate with phosphotungstic acid. The pathological cerebro-spinal fluids we have
examined are rich in coagulable proteid, contain no proteose or peptone, and are-
usually free from reducing substance. The reducing substance of the normal fluid
was considered by one of us ';o be allied to or identical with pyrocatechin. In

small doses pyrocatechin produces no effect on blood-pressure ;· in large doses it causes

a very slight fall.

    The disintegration of the nerve-cells of the brain in the cases from which the
fluid was obtained can be demonstrated best by Nissl's method.

   We have also taken tracings of blood-pressure simultaneously with plethysmo-

graphic tracings of the limbs, and of the kidney, an air oncometer being used in

connection with the latter organ. There is no peripheral dilatation of the blood-

vessels. That the fall of blood-pressure is cardiac in origin was confirmed by

experiments on the frog's and mammal's heart. This conclusion fits in very weil

with  what  is  found  in  general paralysis  of the  insane                                  cardiac  weakness  and
                                                                                           ;

.7. Visual Reaction to Intermittent Stimulation. By O. F. F. Grunbaum.

     The factors upon wliich fusion of intermittent retinal stimuli depends have
apparently been noted singly, and never collectively considered.

      Scbafhautl found that, on increasing the strength of the stimuli, increase in
frequency was necessary to produce fusion : speed of translation was observed by
Filehne to have an effect.

     Charpentier and Baader pointed out that the size of the field of vision was an
important factor, and Sherrington has recently demonstrated the effects produced
by simultaneous contrast.

     Experiments have been made, bearing in mind the above facts, along with the

necessity of guarding against fatigue.

     It was found that if the field of vision were small, so that the image fell
entirely within the fovea, and the speed of translation great, it was impossible to
discern that the stimulus was intermittent above sixty-three alternations per

second.

     It must be noted that when the source of light is within focal range, and of a

nature that can be focussed, there is no sudden transition from the recognised
·coarse flicker to that of a smooth, steady sensation, but an intermediate stage of
fine flicker or tremor of the field is experienced.

     If the stimulus be greatly increased, the maximum frequency at which discon-
tinuity of stimulation is observed may fall to forty-five alternations per second

before pathological phenomena ensue.

     If the speed of translation be small, discontinuity of stimulation may be

·observed at 600 alternations per second, with practice, but then only through a

short range of luminosity. On increasing the strength of stimuli, the frequency
 must be rapidly diminished in order to discern discontinuity.

      The effect of speed of translation is well shown by keeping the luminosity
 constant, and using rotating discs with varying numbers of sectors : it is then
found that one with many sectors, and consequently a slow speed of translation,
will require a high frequency of alternation to produce fusion, while one with but
few sectors will fuse with a frequency of alternation of sixty-three per s3cond or
below. This is probably due to unconscious simultaneous contrast.

      McGill University, Montreal.

      The purpose of the research described in this Paper is to determine whether
the cerebral cortex is functional at birth, and, if not, then how soon afterwards in
several species of animals, those being selected that are most commonly emploj^ed
 for physiological experiments and are best known.

      The method of investigation was described, illustrated protocols of experiments
rgiven, and inferences drawn for each species of animal the subject of experiment.

      The paper concluded with a criticism of the work of other investigators, and
 with some general deductions.

   (From the Bacteriological Laboratorj' of "Westminstpr Hospital Medical School.)

      .4.t the last meeting of the Association, held at Liverpool in 1896, a report on
the influence of glycerine on the vital activity of certain micro-organisms was pre-

sented to this Section. In that Paper we showed that the presence of glycerine to

the extent ot 40 per cent, in culture media, such as peptone beef broth, sufficed to

kill out, in various periods of time, certain pathogenic microbes, including the

 Pf/ogenic cocci, Streptococcus Pyogenes, Streptococcus Erysipelutosiis, Bacillus-

Tuberculosis, B. Typhosus and B. Diphtlierire, the maximum resistance being over-
come in about three weeks. On the other hand, the spores of the common Hay-

Bacillus were shown to be capable of resisting the action of glycerine considerably
longer, as also was the B. Coli Comtminis when kept at low temperatures.
Samples of small-pox and vaccine material, in the form of lymph and ' crusts,'
were also employed, and were found to have become freed from extraneous micro-
organisms within comparatively short periods, when exposed to the influence of
40 per cent, glycerine.

     During the past year we have instituted furtlier experiments in this direction,

working especially witli the Bacillus Tuberculosis, with the object of determining
whether this micro-organism can survive and remain capable of further develop-

--ment after a sojourn, for varying periods, in glycerinated vaccine lymph.
     Method. Vaccine material was rubbed up in the usual way with a mixture

of glycerine and water, the greater part of the resulting emulsion (containing

glycerine to the extent of 42 per cent.) being then filled into small tubes. To the
residue, amounting +o about 4 c.c, was added a large quantity of growth from a
recently isolated and virulent culture of Tubercle Bacilli. This growth was
thoroughly mixed with the emulsion, and the whole was poured into two small

tubes, which were corked and placed in a cool, dark cupboard with the rest of the

tubed emulsion. At the same time, from the tubercle culture, control inoculations
were made in tubes of 6 per cent, glycerine agar-agar, and in tubes of 6 per cent,

peptone beef broth. These were incubated part at body temperature, and part at

that which ordinarily obtained in the laboratory. At the end of a month the
emulsion was demonstrated by the method of plate cultivation to be free from

extraneous microbes. Similarly plates poured from the small tubes containing the-

tubercle culture also showed no growth. Numerous inoculations were made on

the surface of G per cent, glycerine agar, and on solidified blood serums, the tubes-
being then incubated at 37° O. After a month's incubation, no growth resulted
from any of these inoculations.

     Lest traces of glycerine carried over by the inoculation needle should have-
retarded or prevented the growth of the Tubercle Bacillus, some of the emulsion
originally contaminated with tubercle was mixed with sterile beef-broth, and from.

tins numerous inoculations were made and incubated at 37° C. These also, after
the lapse of a month, failed to show any sign of growth. Control tubes, inocu-
lated from tlie oriffinal tubercle culture employed in the whole series of experiments,
and incubated at 37°C., all exhibited a copious growth in a month, and sulj-
cultnres from them were all, in turn, successful.

    As the result of a lengthy series of experiments on the Unes described, il has
been found impossible to recover Tubercle Bacilli after exposure for a month to

the action of an intimate admixture of glycerine to the extent of 40 per cent.,
either with sterile beef-broth or with fresh vaccine material.

                          of Botany in the University of Cambridge.

Tlie President delivered the following Address on Friday, August 20 :

The competent historian of our branch of science will have no lack of materials

when he comes to review the progress of botany daring the latter half of the

Victorian reign. The task of doing justice to the work in phanerogamic botany

alone, under the leadership of men like Hooker, Asa Gray, Mueller, Eugler,

Warming, and the army of systematists so husily shifting the frontiers of the

various natural groups of flowering plants, will need able hands for satisfactory

Atreatment.  mere sketch of the influence of Kew, the principal centre of syste-

matic botany, and of the active contingents of Indian and colonial botanists

working under its inspiration, will alone require an important chapter, and it will

need full knowledge and a wide vision to avoid inadequacy of treatment of its

powerful stimulus on all departments of post-Darwiuian' botany. The 'Genera

Plantarum,' the 'British Flora,' the "'Flora of India,' suffice to remind us of the pres-

tige of England in systematic botany, and the influence of the large and growing

library of local and colonial floras we owe to the labours of Bentham, Trimen,

Clarke, Oliver, Baker, Hemsley, Braudis, King, Gamble, Balfour, and the present

Director of Kew, is more than merely imperial.

The progress in Europe and America of the other departments of hotauy has

been no less remarkable, and indeed histology and anatomy, comparative mor-

phology, and.the physiology and pathology of plants have perhaps advanced even

more rapidly, because tlie ground was newer. In England the work done at

Cambridge, South Kensington and elsewhere, and the publications in the · Annals

Aof Botany' and other journals sufficiently bear witness to this. consequence has

--been the specialisation which must soon be openly recognised as it already is
--tacitly in botany as in zoological and other branches of science.

No note has been more clearly sounded than this during the past twcuty-iive

years, as is evident to all who have seen the origin, rise, and progress of our modern

laboratories, special journals, and even the gradual subdivisions of this Association.

We may deplore this, as some deplore tlie departure of the days when a naturalist

was expected to teach geology, zoology, and botany as a matter of course                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             but the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

inevitable must come. Already the establishment of bacteriological laboratories

and a huge special literature, of zy mo-technical laboratories and courses on the

--study of yeasts and mould fungi, of agricultural stations, forestry and dairy schools,

and so on all these are signs of the inexorable results of progress.
 832 REPORT--1897.

      There are disadvantages, as the various Centralbldtter and special journals
 show ; for hurried work and feverish contentions for priority are apt to accompany

 these subdivisions of labour ; and those of us who are most intimately concerned

 with the teaching of botany will do well to take heed of these signs of our times,
 and distinguish between the healthy specialisation inevitably due to the sheer
 weight and magnitude of our subject, and that incident on other movements and
 arising from other causes. The teaching and training in a university or school
 need not be narrow because its research-laboratories are famous for special work.

      One powerful cause of modern specialisation is utility. The development of
 industries like brewing, dyeing, forestry, agriculture, with their special demands

 on botany, shows one phase ; the progress of bacteriology, palaeontology, pathology,
 economic and geographical iDotany, all asking special questions, suggests another.

In each case men are encouraged to go more and more deeply into the particular

 problems raised.

     Identification of flowers in Egyptian tombs, of pieces of wood in Roman

 excavations, the sorting of hay-grasses for analysis, or seeds in the warehouses
 the special classifications of seedlings used by foresters, or of trees in winter, and
 so on, all aflbrd examples. It is carried far, as witness the immense labour it is
found worth while for experts to devote to the microscopic analysis of seeds and
fruits liable to adulteration, or to the recognition of the markings in imprints of
fossil leaves, or of characters like leaf-scars, bud-scales, lenttcels, and so on, by

which trees may be determined even from bits of twigs.
     If we look at the great groups of plants from a broad point of view, it is

remarkable that the Fungi and the Plianerogams occupy public attention on quite
other grounds than do the Algae, Mosses, and Ferns. Algae are especially a
physiologists' group, employed in questions on nutrition, reproduction, and cell-
division and growth ; the Bryophyta and Pteridophyta are, on the other haiKl, the
domain of the morphologist concerned with academical questions such as the
Alternation of Generations and the Evolution of the higher plants.

      Fungi and Phanerogams, while equally or even more employed by specialists
in Morphology and Physiology, appeal widely to general interests, and evidently
on the gi'ound of utility. Without saying that this enhances the importance of
either group, it certainly does induce scientific attention to them.

    I need hardly say that comparisons of the kind I am making, invidious though
they may appear, in "no way imply detraction from the highest honour deservedly
paid to men who, like Thuret, Schmitz, and Thwaites in the past, and Bornet,
VVille, and Klebs in the present, have done and are doing so much to advance our

academical knowledge of the Algte ; and Klebs' recent masterpiece of sustained
physiological work, indeed, promises to be one of the most fruitful contributions

to the study of variation that even this century has produced. Nor must we in
England forget Farmer's work on Ascophyllum, and on the nuclei and cell-divisions
of Hepatica ; and while Bower and Campbell have laid bare by their indefati-

gable labours the histological details of the Mosses and Vascular Cryptogams, and
carried the questions of Alternation of Generations and the evolution of these
plants so far, that it would almost seem little remains to be done with Hoffmeister's
brilliant conception but to ask whither it is leading us ; the genetic relation-
ships have become so clear, even to the details, that the recent discovery by Ikeno
and Hirase of spermatozoids in the pollen tubes of Cycas and Gimjko almost loses
its power of surprising us, because the facts fit in so well with what was already

taught us by these and other workers.
     It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of these comparative

studies, not only of the recent Vascular Cryptogams, but also of the Fossil
Pteridophyta, which, in the hands of Williamson, Scott, and Seward, are yielding

at every turn new building stones and explanatory charts of the edifice of Evolu-
tion on the lines laid down by Darwin.

    All these matters, however, serve to prove my present contention, that the

groups referred to do not much concern the general public ; whereas, on turning to
the Fungi and Phanerogams, we find quite a different state of affairs. It is very
significant that a group like the Fungi should have attracted so much scientific
      TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.      833

 attention, and aroused popular interest at the same time. In addition to their

--importance from more academical points of view for they claim, the attention of

morphologist and physiologist as much as any group, as the work of Wager,
Massee, Trow, Hartog, and Harper, and an army of Continental investigators, with

--Brefeld, Von Tavel, Magnus, &c., at their head, has shown the Fungi appeal to

wider interests on many grounds, but especially on that of utility. The fact that

Fungi affect our lives directly has been driven home, and whether as poisons or
foods, destructive moulds or fermentation-agents, parasitic mildews or disease

germs, they occupy more of public interest than all other Cryptogams together,

the flowering plants alone rivalling them in this respect.

   A marked feature of the period we live in will be the great advances made in

our knowledge of the uses of plants. Of course, this development of Economic
Botany has gone hand in hand with the progress of Geographical Botany and the

extension of our planting and other interests in the colonies, but the useful applica-

tions of Botany to the processes of home industries are increasing also.
     The information acquired by travellers exploring new countries, by orchid-

collectors, prospectors for new fibres or india-rubber, or resulting from the experi-

ences of planters, foresters, and observant people, living abroad, has a value in money
which does not here concern us ; but it has also a value to science, for the facts

collected, the specimens brought home, the processes observed, the results of analyses,

-- --the suggestions gathered in short, the puzzles propounded by these wanderers all

stimulate research, and so have a value not to be expressed in terms of money.

     The two react mutually, and I am convinced that the stimulus of the questions

asked by commerce of botanical science has had, and is having, an important
effect in promoting its advance. The best proof to be given of the converse

--that botany is really useful to commerce is afforded by the ever-increasing

demands for answers to the questions of the practical man. At the risk of touch-
ing the sensibilities of those who maintain that a university should regard only

the purely academical aspects of a science, I propose to discuss some cases where

the reciprocal influences of applied, or useful, and purely academic or useless

--botany useless because no use has yet been made of it, as some one has wittily

-- myput it have resulted in gain to both. In doing this, I wish to clearly state

conviction that no scientific man should be guided or restricted in his investiga-
tions by any considerations whatever as to the commercial or money value of his
results : to patent a method of cultivating a bacillus, to keep secret the composi-

tion of a nutritive medium, to withhold any evidence, is anti-scientific, for by the
nature of the case it is calculated to prevent improvement i.e. to impede progress.

It is not implied that there is anything intrinsically wrong in protecting a dis-
covery : all I urge is that it is opposed to the scientific spirit.

   --But the fact that a scientific discovery is found to have a commercial value

also for instance, Wehmer's discovery that the mould fungus, Citryomyces, will

convert 50 per cent, of the sugar in a saccharine solution to the commercially

valuable citric acid ; or Matruchot's success in germinating the spores of the

--mushroom, and in sending pure cultures of that valuable agaric into the market
    is no argument against the scientific value of the research. There are in agri-
culture, forestry, and commerce generally, innumerable and important questions
for solution, the investigation of which will need all the powers of careful

observation, industrious recording, and thoughtful deduction of which a scientific

man is capable. But while I emphatically regard these and similar problems as

worthy the attention of botanists, and recognise frankly their commercial import-

aace, I want to carefully and distinctly warn all my hearers against supposing that

their solution should be attempted simply because they have a commercial value.
      It is because they are so full of promise as scientific problems, that I think it

no valid argument against their importance to theoretical science that they have

been suggested in practice. In all these matters it seems to me we should recog-
nise that practical men are doing us a service in setting questions, because they set
them definitely. In the attempt to solve these problems we may be sure science
will gain, and if commerce gains also, so much the better for commerce, and

indirectly for us. But that is not the same thing as directly interesting ourselves

1897                              3H
834 . REPORT-- 1897.

in the commercial value of the answer. This is not our function, and our

advice and researches are the more valuable to commerce the less we are concerned

with it.
     It is clear that the magnitude of the subject referred to is far beyond the

measure of our purpose to-day, and I shall restrict myself to a short review of

some advances in our knowledge of the Fungi made during the last three decades.
     Little more than thirty years ago we knew practically nothing of the life-history

of a fungus, nothing of parasitism, of infectious diseases, or even of fermentation,

and many botanical ideas now familiar to most educated persons were as yet

nnbovn. Our knowledge of the physiology of nutrition was in its infancy, even

the significance of starches and sugars in the green-plant being as yet not under-
stood; rootz-hairs and their importance were hardly spoken of; words like heter-

cecism, symbiosis, mycorhiza, &c., did not exist, or the complex ideas they now
connote were not evolved. When we reflect on these facts, and remember that

bacteria were as yet merely curious * aniuialculfe,' that rusts and smuts were

generally supposed to be emanations of diseased states, and that ' spontaneous

generation ' was a hydra not yet destroyed, we obtain some notion of the condi-

tion of this subject about 1860.

    As with otlier groups of plants, so with the Fungi, the first studies were those
of collecting, naming and classifying, and prior to 1850 the few botanists who

concerned themselves with these cryptogams at all were systematists. So far as

the larger fungi are concerned, the classification attained a high degree of perfec-
tion from the point of view of an orderly arrangement of natural objects, and the

student of to-day may well look back at the keen observation and terse, vivid
descriptions of these older naturalists, which stands in sharp contrast to much of

the more slovenly and hurried descriptive work which followed.

    It may be remembered that even uow we rely mainly on the descriptions and

system of Fries (1821-1849) for our grouping of the forms alone considered as

fungi by most people, and indeed we may regard him as having done for fungi

what Linnceus did for flowering plants.
     But, as you are aware, a large proportion of the Fungi are microscopic, and in

spite of the" conscientious and beautiful work of several earlier observers, among

whom Corda stands pre-eminent, the classification and descriptions of the

thousands of forms were rapidly bringing the subject into chaos.
AThe dawn of a new era in Mycology was preparing, however.
                                                                  few isolated

observers had already begun the study of the development of Fungi, but their

work was neglected, till Persoon and Ehrenberg at the beginning of this century

again brought the subject into prominence, and then came a series of discoveries

destined to stimulate work in quite other directions.

    The Tulasnes may be said "to have brought the old period to a close and pre-

pared the way for the new one ; they combined the powers of accurate observation

with a marvellous faculty of delineation, and applied the anatomical method to
the study of fungi with more success than ever before. Their new departure,
however, is more evident in their selection of the parasitic fungi for study, and

you all know how indispensable we still find their drawings of the germinating-

spores of the Smuts and Rusts. It is difiicult to say which of their works is the

most masterly, but probably the study of the life-history of Claviceps imrpurea

deserves first place, though successive memoirs on the Uredineoe, Ustilagineae,
Peronosporeas, Tuberacete, and then that magnificent work the ' Selecta Fungorum

Carpologia,' cannot be forgotten.

In England, Berkeley was the man to link the period previous to 1860 with

Athe present epoch.  systeraatist and observer of high power, and with a rare

faculty for appreciating the labours of others, this grand old naturalist did work

of unequalled value for the period, and the student who wishes to learn what was

the state of mycology about this time will find it nowhere better presented than

--in Berkeley's works, one of which his ' Introduction to Cryptogamic Botany '

is a classic.

    Like all classifications in botany, however, that of the Fungi now took two

courses: one in the hands of those who collated names and herbarium-specimens,

and proposed cut and dried, but necessary and from a certain point of view very
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  835

 complete systems of classification, and those -wlio, generalising from actual

 cultures and observation of the living plant, proposed outline schemes, the details

 of which should be filled in by their successors.

     No one who knows the history of botany during this century will deny that
 it is to the genius of De Bary that we owe the foundation of modern mycology,

 for it was this young Alsatian who, though pi-ofoundly influenced by the work of

 Vou Mohl and Schleiden on the one hand, and of Unger and the Tulasnes on the

 other, refused to follow either the school cf the phytotomists--though his

 laborious ' Comparative Anatomj' of the Ferns and Phanerogams ' shows how

--well equipped he was to be a leader in that direction or that of the ana-

 tomical mycologists. Iso doubt the influence of Cohn, Pringsheim, and others

 of that new army of microscopists who were teaching the necessity of con-

 tinued observation of living organisms under the microscope, can be traced

in impelling De Bai'y to abandon the older methods, but his own unquestionable
 originality of thought and method came out very early in his investigations on
 the Lower Algm and Fungi. If I may compare a branch of science to an arm of
 the sea, we may look on De Bary's influence as that of a Triton rising to a
 surface but little disturbed by currents and eddies. The sudden upheaval of his

 genius set that sea rolling in huge waves, the play of which is not yet exhausted.

     The birth and flow of the new ideas, expressed in far-reaching generalisations and

 suggestions which are still moving, led to the revolutions in our notions of polymor-

phism, parasitism, and the real nature of infection and epidemics. His development

 of the meaning of sexuality in Fungi, his startling discovery of heterceeism, his
clear exposition of symbiosis, and even his cautious and almost wondering whisper of
chemotaxis were all fruitful, and although the questions of enzyme-action and
fermentation were not made peculiarly his own, he saw the significance of these

and many other phenomena now grown so important, and here, as elsewhere,

thought clearly and boldly, and criticised fearlessly with full knowledge and

justice.

      I do not propose to occupy our time with even a sketch of the history of these
and other ideas of this great botanist ; but rather pass to the consideration of a few

of the results of some of them in the hands of later workers, in schools now far

developed and widely independent of one another, but all deeply indebted to the

genial little man whom we so loved and revered.

     The most marked feature noticed in the founding of the new schemes of classi-
fication of the Fungi was the influence of the results of pure and continuous cultures
introduced by De Bary. The efiect on those who followed can best be traced by
examining the great systems of subsequent workers, led by Brefeld and Van
Tieghem, and the writings of our modern systematists. This task is beyond

my present scheme, however, and there is only time to remind you of the fungus

floras of Saccardo, Oonstantin, Massee, and others, in this connection.
     The word ' fermentation ' usually recalls the ordinary processes concerned ui the

brewing of beer and the making of wines and spirits ; but we must not forget that
the word connotes all decompositions or alterations in the composition of organic

substances induced by the life-activities of Fungi, and that it is a mere accident
which brings alcoholic fermentation especially into prominence.

     I ventured some time ago to term alcoholic fermentation the oldest form of

microscopic gardening practised by man, and this seems justified by what we know

of the very various and very ancient processes in this connection.

     But the making of beers, wines, and spirits, as we understand them, constitutes
but a small part of the province of fermentation, and even when we have added
cider and perry, ginger-beer, and the various herb and spruce beers to the list, we
have by no means exhausted the tale of fermented drinks. Palm-wines of various
kinds, toddy, pulque, arrack, kava, and a number of tropical alcoholic fermented

liquors have to be included, and the koumiss and kephir of the Caucasus, the
curious Russian kwass, the Japanese sake, and allied rice-preparations must be

mentioned, to say nothing of the now almost forgotten birch-beer, mead and

metheglin, and various other strange fermented decoctions of our forefathers' time

or confined to out-of-the-way localities.

                                                                                  3 H2
836 REPORT-- 1897.

  --In all these cases the same principal f'acts come out a saccharine liquid is

exposed to the destructive action of fungi, which decompose it, and we drink the
altered or fermented liquor. As is now well known, the principal agents in these
fermentations are certain lower forms of fungi called yeasts, and since Leeuwen-
hoeck, of Delft, discovered the yeast cells two hundred years ago, and La Tour,
Schwann, and Kiitzing (about 1840) recognised them as budding plants, living on
the sugar of the liquid, and which must be classed as Fungi, the way was paved for
two totally different inquiries concerning yeast.

     One of these was the fruitful one instigated by Pasteur's genius about 1860,
and concerned the functions of yeast in fermentation. In the hands of Naegeli,
Brefeld, and others abroad, and of A. J. and Horace Brown and Morris and others
in England, Pasteur's line of research was rapidly developed, and, as we all know,
has had a wide influence in stimulating investigation and in suggesting new ideas
and although the theory of alcoholic fermentation itself has not withstood all the
criticism brought against it, and seems destined to receive its severest blow this
year by E. Buchner's isolation of the alcoholic enzyme, we must always honour

the school which nursed it.
     The divergent line of inquiry turned on the origin and morphological nature of

yeast. What kind of a fungus is yeast, and how many kinds or species of yeasts

are there ?

     Reess, in 1870, showed the first steps on this long path of inquiry, and gave the

name Saccharomyces to the fungus, showing that several species or forms existed,

some of which develop definite spores.
     In 1883, Hansen, of Copenhagen, taking advantage of the strict methods of

culture introduced and improved by De Bary, Brefeld, Klebs, and other botanists,
had shown that by cultivating yeast on solid media from a single spore it was
possible to obtain constant types of pure yeasts, each with its own peculiar

properties.

     One consequence of Hansen's labours was that it now became possible for

every brewer to work with a yeast of uniform type instead of with haphazard
mixtures, in which serious disease forms might predominate and injure the beer.

Another consequence soon appeared in Hansen's accurate diagnosis of the specific
or varietal characters of each form of yeast, and among other things he showed

that a true yeast may have a mycelial stage of development. The question of the
nucleus of the yeast-cell, on which Mr. Wager will enhghten us, has also occupied

much attention, as have also the details of spore formation.

      Meanwhile, a question of very general theoretical interest had arisen.

     Reess, Zopf, and Brefeld had shown that many higher fungi can assume a

yeast-like stage of development if submerged in fiuids. Various species of Mticor,

^Ustilago, Exoascus, and as we now know, numerous Ascomycetes and Basidio-

mycetes as well, can form budding cells, and it was natural to conclude that
-probably the yeasts of alcoholic fermentation are merely reduced forms of these

--higher fungi, which have become habituated to the budding condition a con-

clusion apparently supported by Hansen's own discovery that a true ISaccharornyces

 can develop a feeble but unmistakable mycelium.

     With many ups and downs this question has been debated, but as yet we do
not know that the yeasts of alcoholic fermentations can be developed from higher

fungi.

      During the last two years it appeared as if the question would be settled.
Takamine stated that the Aspergillus used by the Japanese in brewing sak6 from
rice develops yeast-hke cells which ferment the sugar derived from the rice.
Jiihler and Jorgensen then extended these researches and claimed to have found
 yeast-cells on other forms of fungi on the surface of fruits, and to have

--established that they develop endogenous spores an indispensable character in
--the modern definition of the genus Saccharomyces and cause alcoholic fermen-

 tation.

      Klocker and Schionning have this last year published the results of their very
 ingenious and thorough experimental inquiry into this question, and find, partly

by pure cultures of the separate forms, and partly by means of excellently devised
                           TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                 837

cultures on ripening fruits still attached to the plant, but imprisoned in sterilised

glass vessels, that the yeasts and the moulds are separate forms, not genetically

connected, but merely associated in nature, as are so many other forms of yeasts,

bacteria and moulds.

    It is interesting to notice how here, as elsewhere, the lessons taught by pure
cultures are found to bear fruit, and how Hansen's work justifies the specialist's

laboratory.

    Among the most astonishing results that have come to us from such researches

are Hansen's discoveries that several of the yeasts furnish quite distinct races or

varieties in different breweries in various parts of the world, and it seems impos-

sible to avoid the conclusion that their race characteristics have been impressed on

--the cells by the continued action of the conditions of culture to which they have

so long been exposed they are, in fact, domestic races.

    Much work is now being done on the action of the environment on yeasts, and

several interesting results have been obtained. One of the most striking examples
is the fact observed by Sauer, who found that a given variety of yeast, whose
activity is normally inhibited when the alcohol attains a certain degree of concen-

tration in the liquid, can be induced to go on fermenting until a considerably higher

proportion of alcohol is formed if a certain lactic-acid bacterium is added to the

lermenting liquor. The bacterium, in fact, prepares the way for the yeast. Ex-
periments have shown that much damage may be done to beers and wines by

foreign or weed germs gaining access with the yeasts, and Hansen has proved that

several yeasts are inimical to the action of the required fermentation. But not all

pure fermentations give the desired results : partly because the race-varieties of

even the approved yeasts differ in their action, and partly, as it appears, on account

of causes as yet unknown.

     There are facts which lead to the suspicion that the search for the best possible

variety of yeast may not yield the desired results, if this particular form is used
as a pure culture. The researches of Hansen, Kothenbach, Belbriick, Van Laer,
and others, suggest that associated yeasts may ferment better than any single yeast

cultivated pure, and cases are cited where such a symbiotic union of two yeasts of

high fermenting power has given better results than either alone.

If these statements are confirmed, they enhance the theoretical importance of

some investigations I had made several years previously. English ginger-beer

--contains a curious symbiotic association of two organisms a true yeast and a true
--bacterium so closely united that the yeast-cells imprisoned in the gelatinous

meshes of the bacterium remind one of the gonidia of a lichen entangled in the

Nowhyphse of the fungus, except that there is no chlorophyll.         it is a singular

fact that this symbiotic union of yeast and bacterium ferments the saccharine

liquid far more energetically than does either yeast or bacterium alone, and results

in a diflerent product, large quantities of lactic and carbonic acids being formed,

and little or no alcohol.

In the kephir used in Europe for fermentmg milk, we find another symbiotic

association of a yeast and a bacterium ; indeed, Freudenreich declares that four

distinct organisms are here symbiotically active and necessary, a result not con-

firmed by my as yet incomplete investigation. I know of at least one other case
which may turn out to be different from either of the above. Moreover, examples

of these symbiotic fermentations are increasing in other directions.

Kosai, Yabe, and others have Jately shown that in the fermentations of

rice to produce sake, the rice is first acted on by an Asper(/ilhs, which converts

--the starch into sugars, and an associated yeast hitherto regarded as a yeast-form

of the Aspergillus, but, as already said, now sliown to be a distinct fungus sym-

--biotically associated with it then ferments the sugar, and other similar cases are

on record.

Starting from the demonstrated fact that the constitution of the medium pro-

foundly affects the physiological action of the fungus, there can be nothing sur-

prising in the discovery that the fungus is more active in a medium which has

been favourably altered by an associated organism, whether the latter aids the
fungus by directly altering the medium, or by ridding it of products of excretion
838 REPORT-- 1897.

or by adding some gas or other body. This granted, it is not difEcult to see that
natural selection will aid in the perpetuation of the symbiosis, and in cases like
that of the ginger-beer plant it is extremely difEcult to get the two organisms
apart, reminding us of the similar difficulty in the case of the soredia of Lichens.
Moreover, experiments show that the question of relative abundance of each

constituent aliects the matter.

     1 must now return for a moment to Buchner's discovery that by means of

 extremely gi'eat pressures a something can be expressed from yeast which at once
decomposes sugar into alcohol and carbon-dioxide, and concerning which Dr. Green

--will inform us more fully. This something is regarded by Buchner as a sort of

incomplete protoplasm a body composed of proteid, and in a structural condition
somewhere between that of true soluble enzymes like invertin and complete living

protoplasm.
      If this is true, and Buchner's zymase turns out to be a really soluble enzyme,

the present theory of alcoholic fermentation will have to be modified, and a

reversion made towards Traube's views of 1858, a reversion for which we are in a

measure prepared by Miquel's proof in 1890 that Urase, a similar body extracted
from the urea-bacteria, is the agent in the fermentation of urea. At present,

however, we are not sufficiently assured that the body extracted by Buchner is
really soluble, and I am told that very serious difficulties still face us as to what
solution is. The enormous pressures required, and the fact that the ' solution
coagulates as a whole, might suggest that he was dealing with expressed proto-
plasm, still alive, but devoid of its cell-wall ; against this, however, must be urged
the facts that the ' solution ' can be forced through porcelain and still act, and this

even in the presence of chloroform.

    We may fairly expect that the further investigation of Buchner's ' zymase,*

Miquel's ' urase,' and the similar body obtained by E. Fischer and Lindner from
Monilia Candida will help in deciding the question as to the emulsion theory of
protoplasm itself.

     In any case, soluble or not, these enzymes are probably to be regarded as bits
off the protoplasm, as it were, and so the essentials of the theory of fermentation
remain, the immediate machinery being not that of protoplasm itself, but of some-

thing made by or broken otf from it. Enzymes, or similar bodies, are now known
to be very common in plants, and the suspicion that fungi do much of their work

with their aid is abundantly confirmed.
     Payen and Persoz discovered diastase in malt extract in 1833, and in 1836

Schwann discovered peptase in the juices of the animal stomach. Since that time
several other enzymes hare been found in both plants and animals, and the
methods for extracting them and for estimating their actions have been much
improved, a province in which Horace Brown, Green, and Vines have contributed

results.

     It seems not improbable that there exists a whole series of these enzymes which
have the power of carrying over oxygen to other bodies, and so bringing about
oxidations of a peculiar character. These curious bodies were first observed
owing to studies on the changes which wine and plant juices undergo when exposed
to the action of the oxygen of the air.

     In the case of the wine certain changes in the colour and taste were traced to
conditions which involved the assumption that some body, not a living organism,
acts as an oxygen-carrier, and the activity of which could be destroyed by heating
and antiseptics. It was found that similar changes in colour and taste could be
artificialljf produced by the action of ozone, or by passing an electric current
through the new wine ; indeed, it is alleged that the ageing of wine can be suc-
cessfully imitated by these devices, and is actually a commercial process.

    The browning of cut or broken apples is now shown to be due to the action of

a similar oxydase i.e. an oxygen-carrying ferment, and the same is claimed for
the deep-colouring of certain lacks, or lackers, obtained from the juice of plants

such as the Anacardiacecs, which are pale and transparent wben fresh drawn, but

gradually darken in colour on exposure to air. Bertrand found in these juices an
oxydase, which he terms laccase, and which aflfects the oxygen-carrying, and con-
verts the pale fluid juice to a hard dark brown varnish.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  839

      Other oxydases have been isolated from beets, dahlia, potato-tubers, and several

other plants.
      These discoveries led Bourquelot and Bertrand in 1895 to the explanation of a

phenomenon long known to botanists, and partly explained by Schiinbein as far

 back as 1868. If certain Fungi (e.g.. Boletus luridiis) are broken or bruised, the

yellow or white flesh at once turns blue : the action is now traced to the presence
 in the cell-sap of an oxydase, the existence of which had been suspected but not
 proved, and the observers named assert that many fungi (69 out 107 species

·examined) contain such oxydases.

     It will be interesting to see how far future investigations support or refute the
suggestion that many of the colour-changes in diseased tissues of plants attacked

 foy fungi are due to the action of such oxydases.
      Wortmann, in 1882, showed that bacteria, which are capable of secreting

diastase, can be made to desist from secreting this enzyme if a sufficient supply of
sugar be given them, and since then several instances have been discovered where
fungi and bacteria show changes in their enzyme actions according to the nature of
their food supply. Nor is this confined to fungi. Brown and Morris, in 1892,
gave evidence for the same in the seedlings of grasses : as the sugar increased, the

production of diastase diminished.

      It is the diastatic activity of Asperf/illus which is utilised in the making of
sake from rice in Japan, and in the preparation of soy from the soja bean in the
same country, and a patented process for obtaining diastase by this means exists
and Katz has recently tested the diastatic activity of this fungus, of Penidllium,
and of Bacterium meyatherium in the presence of large and small quantities of
sugar. All three organisms are able to produce not only diastase, but also other
enzymes, and the author named has shown that as the sugar accumulates the
diastase formed diminishes, whereas the accumulation of other carbohydrates

produces no such effect.

     Hartig's beautiful work on the destruction of timber by fungi obtains new
interest from Bourquelot's discovery of an emulsion-like enzyme in many such wood-

destroying forms. This enzyme splits the Glucosides, Amygdalin, Salicin, Coniferin,
&c., into sugars and other bodies, and the hyphoe feed on the carbo-hydrates. I
purpose to recur to this subject in a communication to this Section. The
fact that Asperyilhis can form invertins of the siicrase, maltase, and trehalase
types, as well as emulsin, inulase, diastase, or trypsin, according to circumstances

of nutrition, will explain why this fungus can grow on almost any organic
substratum it alights on, and other examples of the same kind are now coming

to hand.

     The secretion of special enzymes by fungi has a peculiar interest just now, for
recent investigations promise to bring us much nearer to an understanding of the
phenomena of parasitism than we could hope to attain a few years ago.

     De Bary long ago pointed out that when the infecting germinal tube of a
fungus enters a plant-cell, two phenomena must be taken into account, the

penetration of the cell-walls and tissues, and the attraction which causes the tips
of the growing hypha to face and penetrate these obstacles, instead of gliding over
them in the lines of apparent least resistance.

     The further development of these two themes has been steady and unobtrusive,
and from various quite unexpected directions more light has been obtained, so that

we are now in a position to see pretty clearly what are the principal factors involved

in the successful attack of a parasitic plant on its victim or ' host.' That fungi

can excrete cellulose-dissolving enzymes is now well known, and that they can.

produce enzymes which destroy lignin must be inferred from the solution of wood-
cells and other lignified elements by tree-destroying fungi. Zopf has collected
several examples of fungi which consume fats, and further cases are cited by
Schmidt, by Ritthausen, and Baumann. In these cases also there can be no doubt
that an enzyme or similar body is concerned.

     There is one connection in wiiich recent observations on enzymes in the plant-
cell promise to be of importance in explaining the remarkable destructive action

of certain rays of the solar-light on bacteria. As you are aware, the English
840 REPORT-- 1897.

observers Downes and Blunt showed long ago that if bacteria in a nutrient liquid
are exposed to sunlight, they are rapidly killed. Further researches, in which I
have had some part, gradually brought out the facts that it is really the light rays
and not high temperatures which exert this bactericidal action, and by means of a
powerful spectrum and apparatus furnished by the kindness of Professor Oliver
Lodge I was able to obtain conclusive proof that it is especially the blue-violet
and ultra-violet rays which are most efiective. This proof depended on the pro-
duction of actual photographs in bacteria of the spectrum itself. Apart from this,
I had also demonstrated that just such spores as those of anthrax, at the same
tim3 pathogenic and highly resistant to heat, succumb readily to the action of
these cold light-rays, and that under conditions which preclude their being poisoned
by a liquid bathing them.

     The work of Brown and Morris ou the daily variations of diastatic enzyme in
living leaves, and especially Green's recent work on the destructive action of light
on this enzyme, point to the probability that it is the destruction of the enzymes
with which the bacterial cells abound which brings about the death of the cell.

     That these matters are of importance in limiting the life of bacteria in- our
streets and rivers, and that the sun is our most powerful scavenger, has been

shown by others as well as myself. In this connection may also be mentioned

Martinand's observations, that the yeasts necessary for wine-making are deficient
in numbers and power on grapes exposed to intense light, and he explains the
better results in Central France as contrasted with those in the South as largely

due to this fact. Whether, or how far, the curious effects of too intense illumina-
tion in high latitudes and altitudes on plants which might be expected to grow

normally there, can be explained by a destructive light action on the enzyme of
the leaves, has not, so far as I know, been tested ; but Green's experiments

certainly seem to me to point to the possibility of this, as do the previous

experiments with screens of Pick, Johow, myself, and others.

      It is interesting to note that "Wittlin and others have confirmed the conclusion

my own few trials with Eijntgen rays led to ; they show no action whatever.

     That branch of mycology which is now looked upon by so many as a separate

department of science, usually termed bacteriology, only took shape in the years

1875-79, when its founder, the veteran botanist Cohn, who recognised that the
protoplasm of plants corresponded to the animal sarcode, and who has been

recently honoured by our Royal Society, published his exact studies of these

minute organisms, and prepared the way for the specialists who followed.

     It is quite true that isolated studies and observations on bacteria had been
made from time to time by earlier workers than Cohn, though it is usually over-
looked that Cohn's first paper on Bacteria was published in 1853. Ehrenberg
in particular had paid special attention to some forms ; but neither he nor his
successors can be regarded as having founded a school as Cohn did, and this

botanist may fitly be looked upon as the father of bacteriology, the branch of
mycology which has since obtained so much diversity.

      It should not be overlooked that the first proof that a specific disease of the

higher animals is due to a bacillus, contained in Koch's paper on Anthrax, was
published under Cohn's auspices and in his ' Beitriige zur Biologic der Pflanzen
in 1876, four years after Schroeter's work from the same laboratory on pigmented
bacteria, and that the plate illustrating Koch's paper was in part drawn by Cohn.

      It is of primary importance to recognise this detail of Koch's training under
Cohn, because, as I have shown at length elsewhere, popular misapprehensions as
to what bacteriology really consists in have been due to the gradual specialisation
into three or four ditlerent schools or camps of a study which is primarily a branch
of botany ; and, again, it is of importance to observe that the whole of this particular
branch of mycology, to which special laboratories and an enormous literature are

now devoted, has arisen during the last quarter of a century, and subsequent to
the foundation of scientific mycology by De Bary. When we reflect that the

nature of parasitic fungi, the actual demonstration of infection by a fimgua spore,
The tra^nsmis.sion of germs bv water and air, the meaning and significance of poly-
morphism, heteroecism, synbiosis. had already been rendered clear in the case of
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  841

fungi, and that it was by these and studies in fermentation and in the life-history

of the fungus Saccharomyces that the way was prepared for the retiology of

bacterial diseases in animals, there should be no doubt as to the mutual bearings of

these matters.

     Curiously enough, it was an accident which deflected bacteriology along lines

which have proved so significant for the study of this particular group of minute
organisms, that an uninitiated visitor to a modern bacteriological laboratory (which
in England, at any rate, is usually attached to the pathological department of a

medical school) hardly perceives that he is in a place where the culture of micro-

--scopic plants is the chief object for the primary occupation of a bacteriologist is

really, after all, the cultivation of minute organisms by the method of ' micro-
scopic gardening,' invented by De Bary, Klebs, and Brefeld, whether the medium

of culture is a nutritive solution, or solid organic substrata like potato, agar, &r

gelatine, or the tissues of an animal.

  -- --This accident 1 use the word in no disrespectful sense was Koch's ingenious

modification of the use of gelatine as a medium in which to grow bacteria ; he hit
upon the method of pouring melted gelatine containing distributed germs on to

plates, and thus isolating the colonies.
     Pasteur and Cohn had already coped with the difficulty of isolating mixed

forms by growing them in special fluids. When a given fluid favoured one form

particularly, a small quantity containing this predominant species was put into
another flask of the fluid, then a drop from this flask transferred to a third flask,

and so on, until the last flasks contained only the successful species, the others

having been suppressed : these ' fractional cultures ' were brought to a high state
of perfection by the botanist Klebs in 1873.

     Then Brefeld (1872) introduced the method of dilution i.e., he diluted the

liquid containing his spores until each single drop taken contained on the average
one spore or none, whence each flask of sterile nutritive solution receiving one drop
contained either none or one spore. Brefeld was working with fungi, but Lister

--now Lord Lister, and our late President applied this ' dilution method ' to his

studies of the lactic fermentation in 1878, and Naegeli, Miquel, and Duclaux carried
it further, the two latter especially having been its chief defenders, and Miquel
having employed it up to quite recently.

     Solid media appear to have been first generally used by Schroeter in 1870,
when he employed potatoes, cooked and raw, egg-albumen, starch-paste, flesh, &c.
Gelatine, which seems to have been first employed by Vittadini in 1852, was
certainly used by Brefeld as early as 1874, and even to-day his admirable lecture
on Methodeti zur Untersuchung der Pike of that date is well worth reading, if

only to see how cleverly he obtains a single spore isolated in gelatine under the

microscope. Klebs used gelatine methods in 1873.

   We thus see that when Koch proposed his method of preparing gelatine plate-

cultures in 1881 he instituted, not a new culture-medium, for cultures on solid

media, including gelatine, had been in use by botanists for eight or ten years ; nor
did he introduce methods for the isolation of spores, for this had beeu done long

before. What he really did was to ensure the isolation of the spores and colonies

wholesale, and so facilitate the preparation of pure cultures on a large scale, and
with great saving of time.

     It was a brilliant idea, and, as has been said, ' the Columbus egg of Bac-
teriology ; ' but we must not lose sight of the fact that it turned the current of
investigation of bacteria from the solid and reliable ground established by Cohn,
Brefeld, and De Bary, into a totally new channel, as yet untried.

   We must remember that De Bary and Brefeld had aimed at obtaining a single

spore, isolated under the microscope, and tracing its behaviour from germination,

continuously to the production of spores again ; and when we learn how serious

were the errors into which the earlier investigators of the mould-fungi and yeasts

fell, owina; to their failure to trace the development continuously from spore to
spore, and the triumphs obtained afterwards by the methods of pure cultures, it

is not difficult to see how inconclusive and dangerous all inferences as to the mor-

phology of such minute organisms as bacteria must be unless the plant has been

so observed.
842 REPORT-- 1897.

     As matter of fact, the introduction and gradual specialisation of Koch's methods

of rapid isolation of colonies encourag-ed the very dangers they were primarily

intended to avoid. It was soon discovered that pure cultures could he obtained

so readily that the characteristic differences of the colonies in the mass could

presumably be made use of for diagnostic purposes, and a school of bacteriologists

arose who no longer thought it necessary to patiently follow the behaviour of the

single spore or bacillus under the microscope, but regarded it as sufficient to

describe the form, colour, markings, and physiological changes of the bacterial

colonies themselves on and in different media, and were content to remove speci-

mens occasionally, dry and stain them, and describe their forms and sizes as they

appeared under these conditions.

    To the botanist, and from the points of view of scientific morphology, this
mode of procedure may be compared to what would happen if we were to frame

our notions of species of oak or beech according to their behaviour in pure forests,

or of a grass or clover according to the appearance of the fields and prairies com-

--posed more or less entirely of it, or and this is a more apt comparison, because
--we can obtain colonies as pure as those of the bacteriologist of a mould-fungus

according to the shape, size, and colour, &c., of the patches which grow on bread,

jam, gelatine, and so forth.

    Now it is obvious that this is abandoning the methods of morphology, and

the consequence has been that two schools of descriptive bacteriologists are

-- --working along different lines, and the 'species' of the one the test-tube school

cannot be compared with those of the other, the advocates of continuous culture

from the spore.

     The difficulty of isolating a bacterium and tracing its whole life-history under

the microscope is so great, that the happy pioneers into the fascinating region

opened up by the test-tube methods may certainly claim considerable sympathy

in their cry that they cannot wait. Of course they cannot wait ; no amount of
argument will prevent the continual description of new test-tube ' species,' and

all we can do is to go on building up the edifice already founded by the botanists

Cohn, Brefeld, De Bary, Van Tieghem, Zopf, Prazmowski, Beyerinck, Fischer,

and others who have made special studies of bacteria.

     The objection that such work is slow and difficult has no more weight here

than in any other department of science, and in any case the test-tube school is

already in the plight of being frequently unable to recognise its own ' species,'

as I have convinced myself by a long-continued series of cultures with the object

of naming common bacteria.

     I wish to guard myself against misconstruction in one particular here. It is

not insinuated that the test-tube methods and results are of no value. Far from it

a vast amount of preliminary information is obtained by it; but I would insist upon

the  discouragement  of all  attempts  to  make  ' species '  without  microscopic  culture
                                                                                                                  ;

and continuous observation of the development as far as it can be traced.

     The close connection between bacteriology and medicine has been mainly
responsible for the present condition of aflairs ; but it is high time we recognised

that bacteriology only touches animal pathology at a few points, and that the

public learn that, so far from bacteria being synonymous with disease germs, the

majority of these organisms appear to be beneficial rather than inimical to man.

There is not time to attempt even a brief description of all the ' useful fermenta-

tions ' due to bacteria, but the following cases will point the conviction that

a school of bacteriology, which has nothing to do with medical questions, but

investigates problems raised by the forester, agriculturist, and gardener, the
dairyman, brewer, dyer, and tanner, &c., will yet be established in England

in connection with one or other of ottr great botanical centres.

     There are many industrial processes which depend more or less for their success

on bacterial fermentations. The subject is young, but the little that has been
discovered makes it imperative that we should go on, for not only are the results of

immense importance to science, but they open up vistas of practical application,

which are already being taken advantage of in commerce, and we may be sure that
every economic application of such knowledge will give the people employing it an
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  843

advantao-e over those who proceed by the old rule-of-thumh methods, where

nobody knows or cares where the waste or leakage occurs that spoils a commercial

product.

     The discovery by Alvarez of the bacillus which converts a sterilised decoction
of indigo-plant into indigo sugar and indigo white, the latter then oxidising to form
the valuable blue dye, whereas the sterile decoction itself, even in presence of
oxygen, forms no indigo, may be cited as a case in point. It remains to be decided
whether this bacillus alone is concerned, or whether the infusion of indican will fer-
ment under the action of enzymes alone derived from the leaves of the indigo plant.
It also remains for future investigation to determine whether the indigo bacillus is

-- --the same as the pneumonia bacillus which resembles it and will also induce the

indigo fermentation, and to explain why the woad-makers of the Fens find a sale

for this indigo preparation among the indigo makers, as well as to clear up certain
mysterious ' diseases ' in the indigo-vats. Our much more extensive knowledge of
the diseases of beer and wine suggests the possibility of profitable bacteriological

investigations in several directions here.

   --That certain stages in the preparation of tobacco leaves as also in the pre-
--paration of tea depend on a carefully regulated fermentation, which must be

stopped at the right moment, or the product is impaired, or even ruined, has long
been known. Regarding the possible role of bacteria in the preparation of tea,
nothing is ascertained, Ijut, if Suchsland's investigations are confirmed, there is

among the many and various organisms concerned in the fermentation of West

Indian tobacco a bacterium which has been isolated and plays an important part.
It is claimed that the flavour of European-grown tobacco can be materially

improved by its use. I read that the process is patented, which may or may not

affect its value as a scientific announcement ; but in view of the increasing number
of researches into this subject by Behrens, Davalos, Schloesing, and others, it is
evidently a domain for further bacteriological investigations in a properly equipped

laboratory.

     Every botanist knows that flax and hemp are the bast fibres of Linurn
and Cannabis respectively, separated by steeping in water until the middle
lamella is destroyed and the fibres isolated ; but it is perhaps not so well known

that not every water is suitable for this ' retting ' or steeping process, and for a

long time this was as much a mystery as why some waters are better than others

for brewing.
     Only quite recently Fribes, working under Winogradsky, has isolated the

bacillus which accomplishes this dissolution of the middle lamella, and its
behaviour brings to light some very interesting details, and furnishes another of
those cases where the reactions of living micro-organisms can be utilised in
deciding questions of plant chemistry too subtlefortesting with ordinary reagents.

     You are aware that recent researches, especially those of Maquin in France

and of "Walter Gardiner in Cambridge, Cross and Bevan and others, have caused
us to discard the view that the middle lamella is composed of cellulose, and to

learn that it consists of pectin compounds. Now Fribes' anaerobic bacillus dis-

solves and destroys pectins and pectinates, but does not touch cellulose or gum,
and thus enables us to criticise from a new point of view the bacillus {B. Amijlo-
bacter) which Van Tieghem asserted to be the cause of cellulose fermentation and
of the retting of flax. Clearly it cannot be both, otherwise the flax-fibre would be
destroyed ; and we know from other facts that B. Ajnylobacter is not the cellulose

ferment.

     Fribes* discovery has yet to be tested with reference to other processes of
retting. The Indian Government have lately published a series of notes on jute
and other fibres, and the description of the retting of jute suggests this as a very
definite problem for investigation.

    I am told that a patent exists in the United States for a process whereby the
retting organisms may be sown and encouraged in waters otherwise unfitted for

the steeping of flax, &c., another indication of the keen interest taken in these

matters.

     It goes without saying that the steeping of skins in water in preparation for
844 , REPORT-- 1897.

tanning involves bacterial actions, owing to wbicli the hair and epidermal cover-

ings are removed                                                                                  but  it  appears from recent investigations that in  the process of
                                                                                               ;

swelling the limed skins, the gases evolved in the substance of the tissues, and the

evolution of which causes the swelling and loosens the fibre so that the tanning

solutions may penetrate, are due to a particular fermentation, caused by a bacterium
which, according to Wood and Wilcox, is similar to, if not identical with, a lactic

ferment. If Haenlein's results may be accepted, it is a bacillus introduced into

the tanning solution by the pine bark, which is responsible for the advantageous

acidification of the tanning solutions much valued for making certain kinds of

leather, and of decisive importance in the quality, so that tanners add the souring

liquor of other vats to encourage the souring of the doubtful one.

Hay is made in very different ways in different countries, and in those where a

' spontaneous ' heating process is resorted to there seems to be no doubt that cer-

tain thermogenic bacteria are concerned. The researches of Bohmer, Dietrich,

Fry, Lafar, and others show that here and in the preparation of ensilage we have

important fermentation processes which affect the end result.

The whole question of fermentation in hay, and the high temperatures produced

in the process, as well as what occurs in straw-stacks under similar conditions,

have important theoretical bearings, and we know of bacilli which grow at 70° C.

    Probably no other subject in this domain has, however, attained so much im-

--portance as the bacteriology of the dairy the study of the bacteria found in milk,

butter, and cheese in their various forms. In all cases of this kind, as in brewing,

bread-making, and so on, there are three aspects of the bacteriology of the opera-

tions : we have to consider first the bacteria concerned in the normal process

secondly, introduced forms which bring about abnormalities, or ' diseases ' of the

normal operation ; and, thirdly, the possible pathogenic bacteria, i.e., pathogenic to

man, which may lurk in the product.

Of milk especially much has been said as a disease-transmitting medium, and

with good reason, as is well known ; and if we may accept the statement of a Con-
tinental authority, who calculated that each time we eat a slice of bread and
butter we devour a number of bacteria equal to the population of Europe, we

have grounds for demanding information as to what these bacteria are, and what

they are doing. And similarly with cheese, every kind of which teems with

millions of these minute organisms.

    Now I cannot, of course, go into the question of pathogenic bacteria, nor is

there time to discuss those forms which bring about undesirable or abnormal pro-

cesses in the dairy ; but I want to call your attention to the splendid field for

bacteriological investigation which is being opened up by inquiries into the normal

changes utilised in making butter and cheese.

    We may pass over the old controversies as to the souring of mUk, culminating

in Pasteur's discovery of the bacteria of lactic fermentation in 1857-68. Lister in

1877 isolated Bacterium lactis. Hueppe in 1884 confirmed his results, and added

several other lactic bacteria, and we now know a whole series of forms which can

turn milk sour by fermenting its sugar, and this in various ways, as Warington

and others have shown. The souring of milk and cream by merely leaving it to

stand often led to failure, and the study of this preliminary to butter- and cheese-

Wemaking is itself a bacteriological question of great importance.                                                                                     shall not be

surprised, therefore, that when, in 1890, Wiegmann proposed to use pure cultures

of lactic-acid bacteria for the souring of cream, the plan was at once taken up.

Some years ago Storch found that the peculiar aroma of a good butter was due

to a bacterium which he isolated, and Wiegmann has now two forms, or races,

one of which develops an exquisite flavour and aroma, but the butter keeps badly,

while the other develops less aroma, while the butter keeps better.

According to a recent publication of Conn's, however, this subject has been

advanced considerably in America, for they have isolated and distributed to

numerous dairies pure cultures of a particular butter-bacillus which develops the

famous ' June flavour ' hitherto only met with in the butter of certain districts

during a short season of the year. I am told that this fine-flavoured butter is now

prepared constantly in a hundred or more American dairies. Simultaneously with
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  845

these advances in tlie manufacture of pure butter with constant flavour, the days

of ' diseased ' butters seem numbered.

     Properly considered, the manufacture of cheese is a form of microscopic garden-
ing even more complex and more horticultural in nature than the brewing of beer.

From the outset, when the cheesemaker guards and cools his milk till his stock is
ready, he is doing all he knows how to do to keep down the growth of the germs

--introduced into the milk ; he then coagulates it, usually with rennet an enzyme
--of animals, but also common in plants and the curd thus prepared is simply

treated as a medium on which he grows certain fungi and bacteria, with the need-

ful precautions for favouring their development, protecting them against the in-

roads of animal and plant pests, and against unsuitable temperature, moisture,
access of light, and so on. Having succeeded in growing the right plants on his
curd, his art then demands that he shall stop their growth at the critical period,

and his cheese is ready for market.

     The investigations of Duclaux, Wiegmann, and others on the Continent, of
Conn in America, and of Lloyd in England, to say nothing of other workers now
busy at this subject in various parts of the world, are getting at the particular

forms of fungi concerned in so altering the constitution of curd that it becomes the

very different article of food we call cheese, and they have even determined to

some extent what role is played by these plants in giving the peculiar odours and

flavours to such different cheeses as Camembert, Stilton, and Eoquefort. It is
known, for instance, that a certain fungus {Pemcilliwn) cultivated on bread is
purposely added to Roquefort, and that it destroys the lactic and other acids and

so enables certain bacteria in the cheese, hitherto inhibited in their actions by
these acids, to set to work and further change the medium, whereas in making
Emmenthaler cheese the object is to prevent this fungus thus paving the wav for
these bacteria. Pammel claims to have discovered a bacillus which gives a peculiar
and much-admired clover aroma to certain cheeses, and according to recent state-
ments a definite Streptococcus is responsible for the peculiarities of certain Dutch
cheeses, and so on. Nevertheless, we are still profoundly ignorant of most of the
forms concerned in the ripening of cheese, and every research which throws light
on this difficult and complex subject, and so paves the way to rendering uniform
and certain this at present most haphazard and risky manufacture will be doing
service to the State. Considering that Cohn only discovered that the ripening

process is due to bacteria in 1875, and that Duclaux only published his researches

on Tyrothrix in 1878, we can scarcely be surprised that the interval has not been

long enough for the isolation and study of the numerous and curious forms, several

hundreds of which are now imperfectly known. Nevertheless, there are sio-ns of

advance in various directions, and researches into the mysteries of Roquefort,
Gorgonzola, Emmenthaler, and other cheeses are being industriously pursued on
the Continent. Even as I write this comes the news that Freudenreich has dis-
covered the coccus which causes the ripening of Emmenthaler cheese. It is not

impossible that the much more definite results obtained by investigations into the

manufacture of the vegetable cheeses of China and Japan will aid bacteriologists in
their extremely complex task.

   -- --These vegetable cheeses are made by exposmg the beans of the leguminous

plant Glycine termed soja-beans to bacterial fermentations in warm cellars,

either after preliminary decomposition by certain mould-fungi, or without this. The
processes vary considerably, and several difl"erent kinds of bean-cheeses are made,
and known by special names. They all depend on the peculiar decompositions of

the tissues of the cotyledons of the soja-bean, which contain 35 to 40 per cent, of
proteids and large quantities of fats. The softened beans are first rendered
mouldy, and the interpenetrating hyphse render the contents accessible to certain
bacteria, which peptonise and otherwise alter them.

     Here, however, I must bring this subject to a close, and time will not permit
of more than the mere mention of the vinegar fermentation, to which Mr. Adrian

Brown has lately contributed valuable knowledge, of the preparation of soy, a
brine extract of mouldy and fermented soja-beans, of bread-making, and other

equally interesting cases.
--846 REPORT 1897.

When the idea of parasitism was once rendered definite, as it was by De Bary's

work, and the fundamental distinction between a parasite and a saprophyte had

been made clear, it soon became evident that some distinction must be made

between obligate facultative 2}arasites and sajvophytes respectively ; but when
De Bary proposed the adoption of these terms of Van Tieg hem's he can hardly

have contemplated that they would be abused as they have been, and was clearly

alive to the existence of transitions which we now know to be so numerous
and so gradual in character that we can no longer define any such physiological

groups.

    Twenty years ago Penicillium and Mucor would have been regarded as
saprophytes of the most obligate type, but we now know that under certain

circumstances these fungi  can become    parasites and                                        the  border-land  between
                                                                                           ;

facultative parasites and saprophytes on the one hand and between the former

and true parasites on the other can no longer be recognised.

In 1866 the germ of an idea was sown which has taken deep root and extended

very widely. De Bary pointed out that in the case of lichens we have either a

fungus parasite on an alga, or certain organisms hitherto accepted as algae are

merely incomplete forms. In 1868 Schwedendener declared the lichen to be
a compound organism.

In 1879, in his celebrated lecture, De Bary definitely launched the new hypo-

thesis, and brought together the facts which warranted his disturbance of" the

serenity of those unprepared to accept so startling a new notion as Symbiosis.

The word itself, in the form ' Symbiotismus,' is due to Frank, who, in an

admirable paper on the biology of the thallus of certain lichens, very clearly set

forth the existence of various stages of life in common.

    This paper has been too much overlooked ; but its existence is the more note-

--worthy from its being in the same number of the ' Beitrage zur Biologie ' which
--we owe to Cohu, the founder of scientific bacteriology in which Koch's remark-

able paper on Anthrax occurs.

    The details of these matters are now principally of historical interest ; we now
know that lichens are dual organisms, composed of various alg», symbiotic

with ascomycetes and even basidiomycetes, and, as Massee has shown, even
gastromycetes. The soil contains also bacterio-lichens. The point for our con-

sideration is rather that botanists were now awakened to a new biological idea
viz., that a fungus may be in such nicely balanced relati3nships with the host

from which it derives its supplies as to afford some advantage in return, whence

we must look upon the limited liability company formed by the two sj'mbionts

as a better business concern than either of the plants could establish for itself

a case, in fact, where union is strength. Symbiosis, consequently, is now under-

stood to be of advantage to both the symbionts, and not to one only, as is the case

in parasitism, or, to use VuiUemin's term. Antibiosis.

In 1841 an English botanist, Edwin Lees, discovered the existence of 'a

hirsuture that appears like a byssoid fungus ' on the roots of Monotropa, and

observed that the hyphse linked the roots to those of a beech ; he regarded the

fungus as conveying nutriment from the latter to the former, and as an essential

constituent of the Monotropa. This discovery was published in the now defunct

' Phytologist ' for December 1841, and was unearthed by Oliver and by Dr. Dyer, of
Kew. This is apparently the first observation of a mycorhiza yet recorded, and,

although the naturalists referred to did not understand the full significance of

Lees' find, several of them made excellent guesses as to the meaning of the pheno-
menon. As Dr. Dyer points out, it disposes of Wahrlich'a claim that Schleiden

(1842) first discovered mycorhiza, as well as of Woronin's contention that the

priority is due to Kamienski, though the latter (1881-82) probably was the first

to clearly indicate that we have here a case of symbiosis, and thus anticipated

Frank's generalisation in 1885.

 Kamienski  and  Frank,    followed  by  numerous  other                                      observers,  among  whom

_

Oliver and Groom are to be mentioned, have now shown that the peculiar type of

symbiosis expressed in this intimate union of fungus-hyphas with the living cells of

--the roots of trees and other plants in soils which abound in vegetable remains

e.ff., leaf-mould, moors, &c. is very common.
                                                         TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                         847

    In tlie humus of forests we find the roots of beeches and other Cupulifera,

willows, pines, and so forth, clothed with a dense mantle of hyphas and swollen into
coral-like masses of mycorhiza ; in similar soils, and in moorlands which abound
in the slowly decomposing root-fibres and other vegetable remains so characteristic

of these soils, the roots of orchids, heaths, gentians, &c., are similarly provided

with fungi, the hyphae of which penetrate further into the tissues, and even send

haustoria into the living cells, but without injuring them.

    As observations multiplied it became clear that the mycorhiza, or fungus-root,
was not to be dismissed as a mere case of roots aS"ected by parasites, but that a
symbiotic union, comparable to that of the hchens, exists; and that we must

assume that both the tree and the fungus derive some benefit from the connection.

      Pfeifer, in 1877, suggested that the deficiency of root-hairs observed in orchids
might be explained by the fungus-hyphse playing the part of these organs, and

taking up materials i'rom the soil which they then handed on to the roots. He is

quite clear on the subject, and recognises the symbiosis definitely, comparing it

with other cases of symbiosis indicated by De Bary.

     Frank stated that, as the results of experiments, seedling forest-trees cannot be
grown in sterilised soil, where their roots are prevented from forming mycorhiza,
and concluded that the fungus conveys to the roots organic materials, which it
obtains by breaking down the leaf-mould and decaying plant-remains, together
with water and minerals from the soil, and plays especially the part of a nitrogen-
catching apparatus. In return for this important service the root pays a tax to
the fungus by sparing it certain of its tissue contents, and no doubt can well afl'ord
to do so.

It appears that the mycorhiza is only formed where humus or vegetable-mould

abounds.                                             In  sandy soils  the  roots  bear  root-hairs, as  usual, and  it  is  now clear
                                                  _

that, while mycorhiza is a far more general phenomenon than was previously

supposed, it is not essential for all the roots, nor even under all circumstances for
any of them.

     Probably what really happens is this. Trees and other plants with normal
roots and root-hairs, when growing in ordinary soil, can adapt their roots to life in
a soil heavily charged with humus only by contracting the symbiotic association
with the fungus and paying the tax demanded by the latter in return for its

supplies and services. If this adaptation is impossible, and no other suitable

variation is evolved, such trees cannot grow in such soils.

  --In certain cases--e.,!/., ground orchids, Monotropa, various Ericacece, &c. it

would seem that the plant is unable to grow in other than humus soils, and always

forms mycorhiza.

    Much further we cannot at present go, but it is evident that various diSerent

--grades of symbiosis exist in these mycorhizas. In the first place, there are several

different fungi concerned those on cupulifer® and pines, apparently mostly

Tuberacea and Gasteromycetes, and allied forms, being diflerent from those in
orchids, some at least of which appear to be Nectrias or related genera.

     The physiological relations of the root to the fungus must be difierent in details

in the case of non-green, purely saprophytic plants, like Neottia, Monotropa, &c.,
and in that of the green plants like Erica, Fagus, Pinus, &c.

     It is well known that ordinary green plants cannot utilise vegetable debris

directly, whereas trees in forests appear to do so ; this in appearance only, how-

ever, for the fungi, yeasts, and bacteria there abounding are actively decomposing
the leaves and other remains.

    Now it is possible that the mycorhiza theory is not applicable in all cases, and

that, sometimes, -what happens is this. The trees, once well established, make so
good a fight that in spite of the leaf-decomposing fungi attacking their roots para-

sitically, or merely ensconcing themselves in the dead primary cortex as it is
sloughed, they manage to keep going and to obtain such shares of the nitrates and

other products due to tlie fungus-action as satisfy their needs. But although
there may be something to be said for this view as regards a few forest-trees, it is
not easy to see how it would apply to the non-assimilating humus-plants like
Neottia, Monotrojja, &c., and we may probably regard the two sets of cases as

standing or falling together.
848 KEPORT-- 1897.

    No treatment of this subject would he complete without reference to those

-- --ohscure cases of symbiosis as we must regard them between certain algiB which

occur in the cavities of the leaves of Azolla and in Gunnera, and those found in

the intercellular spaces of cycad-roots. When we know more of the physiology

of these blue-green algse, it may be possible to explain these puzzles, but at present

they are mysterious curiosities.

   A class of pseudo-symbiotic organisms is being more and more brought into the

foreground where the combined action of two symbionts results in death or

injury to a third plant, whereas each symbiont alone is harmless, or compara-

tively so.

Some time ago Vuillemin showed that a disease in olives results from the inva-

sion of a bacillus (2?. olecc), which, however, can only obtain its way in the tissues

through  the  passages  driven  by  the  hyphse  of  a  fungus   Chcetophomd).  The result-

                                                                (

ing injury is a sort of burr. Vuillemin has this year observed the same bacillus

and fungus in the canker burrs of the ash, and so confirms Noack's statement to

the same effect.

    Among many similar cases, well worth further attention, the invasion of
potato-tubers by bacteria, which make their way down the decaying hyphae of
pioneer fungi, may be noted. I have also seen tomatoes infected by these means,
and have facts showing that many bacteria which quicken the rotting of wood are

thus led into the tissues by fungi.
     Probably no subject in the whole domain of cryptogamic botany has wider

bearings on agricultural science than the study of the flora and changes on and in

manure and soil.
     As vegetable physiology and agricultural science progressed, it became more

and more of primary importance that we should learn what manure is composed
·of, what changes it undergoes in the soil, and what the roots of plants do with it.
<Jhemistry did much to solve some of the earlier problems, but it soon became
evident that it only raised new questions which it could not solve ; and it was not

till the sequence of changes induced by the successive growths of Mucor, Pilobohts,
Coprinus, Ascobolus, and other moulds and fungi of various sorts, followed by

bacteria and yeasts, began to be understood, that anything approaching a coherent
account of the complex phenomena going on in soil or in a manure-heap could be

attempted. Not that all the difficulties have been solved even now-, but we are at

least able to trace some very important chains of occurrences which throw light

on many hitherto obscure matters going on in the field.
     Since Pasteur in 1862, and Van Tieghem in 1864, showed that certain bac-

teria are concerned in converting urea to ammonium carbonate, much has been
iearnt, and we now know from the investigations of Miquel, Jaksch, Leube, and

-- --others that numerous urea-bacteria exist; and Miquel, in 1890, isolated an ex-

tremely unstable enzyme urase which converts sterile urea to ammonium

carbonate very rapidly, a discovery of considerable interest, as it was one of

the first examples of this class of bodies to be examined ; and when we reflect

on the enormous quantities of urea which have to be destroyed daily, and that
fresh urine is in effect a poison to the roots of higher plants, some idea of the
importance of these urea-bacteria is obtained. The necessity for preventing the

losses of this volatile ammonia by fixing it in the soil and presenting it to the

action of the nitrifying organisms is also obvious.
     Winogradsky's classical isolation and cultivation of bacteria which take up

these ammonia compounds and oxidise them to nitrous and to nitric acids in the
soil, may be quoted as further instances of the bearing of bacteriological work on
this department of science, as explaining not only the origin of nitre-beds and
deposits, but also the way the ammonia compounds fixed by the soil in the neigh-

bourhood of the root-hairs are nitrified and so rendered directly available to

plants.

     The theoretical explanation of many questions connected with the washing
out of nitrates from fallows, the advantages of autumn and winter sowing, and

processes occurring in the upper soil as contrasted with subsoil, has been rendered

much easier by these researches ; moreover, as is now well known, they brought
                                                                TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                                            849

to our knowledge a startling instance of the assimilation of carbon-dioxide by

-- --these non-green plants bacteria which not only take some of the purely in-

organic ammonia, but by meins of energy set free by its oxidation obtain their

--carbon also by breaking up the cai-bonate a true case of the assimilation of

carbon-dioxide by a plant devoid of chlorophyll and without the direct aid of

light. Indirectly, it is true, the source of the energy is the light of the sun,

because the oxygen employed by these aerobic forms has been liberated by green

plants in the last instance ; but the case is none the less a startling and important

contribution to physiology, and Wiuogradsky's work, which had been preceded by

investigations in England by Warington and others, affords one of the best illus-

trations I know of the importance of this branch of botanical investigation.

Stutzer and Hartleb's recent publications go to show that the nitrifying

organism is a much more highly developed and complex form than has hitherto

--been suspected ; that it can be grown on various media, and exhibits considerable

polymorphism for instance, it can be made to branch, and show the chai-acteristics

of a true fungus, statements confirmed to a certain extent and independently by

the even more recent work of                                    Rullmann                                            and it appears that we have much  more
                                                                                                                 ;

to learn of the morphology of this widely spread and interesting plant.

It is impossible to go into the controversy between the observers referred to

and Winogradsky, the discoverer of the definite nitrifying organism ; but there is

one point I must just mention : if Stutzer and Hartleb's details are confirmed we

have here the most remarkable case of polymorphism I know of, for they claim

characters for their fungus which prevent our putting it into any existing group,

     I have for some time insisted on the fact that river-water contains reduced forms
of bacteria i.e., forms so starved and so altered by exposure to light, changes of

temperature, and the low nutritive value of the river-water, that it is only after

prolonged culture in richer food-media under constant conditions that their true

nature becomes apparent. Now, Stutzer and Hartleb show that the morpho-

logical form of this nitrifying organism can be profoundly altered by just such

variations in the conditions as the above, and occurs as a branched mycelial form,

as bacilli or bacteria, or as cocci of various dimensions according to conditions.

These observations, and the researches of Zopf, Klebs, and others on variations

in form (polymorphism) in other fungi and bacteria, open out a vast field for

further work, and must lead to advancements in our knowledge of these puzzling

organisms                                           they  also  help us to explain many inconsistencies             in the  existing
                                                 ;

systems of classification of the so-called ' species ' of bacteria as determined by

test-tube cultures.

     But the urea bacteria and the nitrifying organisms are by no means the only
forms found in manure and soils.

     In 1868 Reiset found evidence of a reduction of nitrates in fermenting beet-

juices, and in 1873 Schloesing found that free nitrogen escaped in certain soil-
fermentations. Further work by Mensel, Deherain, and others led to the suspicion
that certain bacteria can undo the work of the nitrifying organisms, and in 1879
Warington showed that both nitrites and nitrates occurred in his soil-fermentations.

     In 1886 Gayon and Dupetit put this almost beyond doubt, and in 1891 Giltay
and Aberson isolated and cultivated a denitrifying bacterium, capable of com-

pletely reducing nitrates with evolution of free nitrogen, provided it is cultivated

anaerobically. Several such forms have now been obtained, the observations of

-- --Burri and Stutzer that certain of the commonest bacteria of the alimentary canal
   e.g., B. coll commune abounding in fresh manure, are especially active, being
particularly suggestive. You will thus notice that we have now a sketch of the
whole of the down-grade part of the cycle of organic nitrogen in Nature : it only
needs supplementing by the history of the fixation of free nitrogen from the

atmosphere by leguminous plants and certain soil-organisms to complete the

sketch.

    As is well known from investigations in which Eriksson, Woronin, Frank,

Prazmowski, and others, including myself, have taken part, the nodules on the roots

--of leguminous plants contain a fungus the morphological nature of which ia in
--dispute living in symbiotic union with the protoplasm of the cells. Hellriegel

                                                                   "

and Wilfarth showed in 1888-90 that, provided the root-nodules are present, these

leguminous plants fix the free nitrogen of the atmosphere ; and Laurent and

Schloesing put this beyond all doubt in 1892 by demonstrating that a closed

atmosphere in which Leguminosee grow loses nitrogen in proportion as the plants

gain it. Meanwhile Schulz Lupitz had shown that agricultural land poor in nitrogen

can be made to accumulate it in paying quantities by growing lupines on it, and

quite recently pure cultures of the organism of the nodules have been placed on

the market under the unfortunate name Nitragin. It is claimed that these organisms

can be readily used in practice to inoculate the seeds or soil.

Kossowitsch in 1894 showed that certain symbiotic unions of algss with bacteria

are also capable of fixing nitrogen ; and Winogradsky declares that there exists in

the soil a bacterium which, provided it is kept protected from oxygen by aerobic

Wesoil organisms, can itself do this.                                     are quite unaware of the mechanisms here

concerned                                          but in  all cases  it  appears certain that  active destruction of carbohy-
                                                ;

drates is an essential condition, and we can only assume that the nitrogen is forced

into synthetic union by means of energy derived from this destruction. Here,

then, we have a glimpse of the up-grade part of the cycle of nitrogen in Nature,

the importance of which to agriculture cannot be overrated. As to the theoretical

bearings of the matter, we are still much in the dark, and can only anxiously await

the results of further investigations into the nature of the peculiar fermentations

and their products going on in these nodules. 1 now want to draw your atten-

tion to a bearing of the above discoveries concerning denitrifying bacteria on some

agricultural and horticultural questions.

WhyIt is well known that a gardener eschews the use of fresh manure.                            is

this ? The most obvious reply might seem to be, because the ammonia compounds

and other nitrogenous constituents in such manure are not directly useful, or are

even harmful to the roots of the plants. Some recent researches suggest that the

matter is more complex than this.

It has not unfrequeutly happened that a farmer, finding himself short of stable-

manure, has made up the deficit by adding some such artificial manure as Chili

--saltpetre, his argument running somewhat as follows: Both are good nitro-

genous manures, the one acting slowly, the other rapidly, so that a mixture of both

should be better than either alone. The results have disappointed him, and

numerous experiments in Norfolk, as I am informed by Mr. Wood, and in the

North of England, as Dr. Somerville assures me, have shown that most disastrous

results ensue if such mixtures are used, whereas if the farmyard manure is em-

-- --ployed at first the ' shorter ' the better and the nitrates applied later on as a

* top-dressing,' excellent crops follow. The explanation seems to come from some

recent experiments hy Wagner, Maercker, Burri and Stutzer, and others. The

farmyard manure, especially if fresh, so abounds in denitrifying bacteria that they

destroy the nitrates rapidly and completely, free nitrogen escaping. Curiously

enough, a very active denitrifying bacillus was found on straw, and we know

that straw abounds in such manures.

I did not intend to go so far into agricultural details as this, but it was impos-

sible to resist these illustrations of the splendid field of mycological research which

here lies before us.

Nor can I avoid instancing at least one more example of the organisms at work

Wein manure.                                       all know what enormous quantities of cellulose are manufactured

daily, and even hourly, by the activity of green leaves and when we reflect on
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

the millions of tons of dead-wood, straw, fallen leaves, roots, &c., which would

accumulate every year if not destroyed, we see at once how important is the

scavenging action of the moulds and bacteria which gradually reduce these to

carbon-dioxide and water, setting these gases free to enter once more into the

cycle of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in Nature.

In 1890 Van Senus obtained two bacteria, one an aerobic and the other an

anaerobic form, which in symbiotic union were found to excrete an enzyme which

dissolved cellulose. Such a cellulose-dissolving enzyme I had myself isolated from

the Botrrjtis of the lily-disease in 1888. In 1895 Omeliansky, working with

river mud, found an anaerobic bacillus which dissolves paper with remarkable

rapidity. I can only hint at the importance of these forms in connection with the
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K,                                             851

production of marsh gas in swamps, the question of the digestion of cellulose in
herbivorous animals, the manufacture of ensilage, and the processes of ' shorten-

ing ' of manure ; and it is clear they have much to do with the destruction of

paper, &c., in sewers and refuse-pits. Moreover, their further investigation pro-
mises a rich harvest of results in explanation of the rotting of stored tubers, certain
diseases of plants, and several theoretical questions concerning anaerobism, butyric
fermentation, and, possibly, that extremely difficult question on which Mr. Gardiner
has done such excellent work, the nature of the various celluloses and constituents

of the cell-wall.

     I now turn to the subject of fungus epidemics, of world-wide interest, if only
because the annual losses to agriculture due to epidemic diseases of plants amount

to millions of pounds sterling.
    'The history of wheat-rust can be traced to Genesis, and at least five references

to it exist in the Old Testament. The Greelis were familiar with it, and the
Romans had a special deity and ceremonies devoted to it. References can be
given to it in old Norman times, and Shakespeare can be quoted as acquainted

with it.
     According to Loverdo, a law existed in Rouen in 1660, authorising the pulling

up of barberry bushes as in some mysterious way connected with rust, and in
1755 the celebrated Massachusetts law was promulgated. Eriksson refers to an

English farmer destroying his neighbour's barberry in 1720.

     The words Robigo, Rubigo, Rouille, Rurjgine, Rtifus, and Rust comprise a his-

tory in themselves, into which, however, we have not time to go, and there are
many fascinating points in the history of wheat-rust which must be passed over.

     Felice Fontana in 1767 probably made the first scientific investigation of rust;

he distinguished the uredo- and puccinia-stages under other names, and eveu
thought of them as rootless plants exhausting the wheat ; in this, and his convic-

tion that no remedy was possible until a careful study of all phases of the disease

had been made, he was far ahead of his times.
     Jethro TuU, Marshall, and Withering are the most conspicuous English names

in connection with this question and period, and Marshall in 1781-84 experimented

intelligently with barberry and wheat inter-planted.

Persoon in 1797 gave the name Puccinia graminis to the fungus. In 1805 Sir

Joseph Banks described it, and suggested that the germs  entered  the  stomata                                         he
                                                                                                                    :

also warned farmers against the use of rusted litter, and made important experi-

ments on the sowing of rusted wheat-grains.

   A great discussion on the barberry question followed, in which Banks, De

Candolle, Windt, Fries, and others took part. Fries particularly insisting on the

--diiference between ^cidium berberidis a name conferred by Gmelin in 1791

and Puccinia gramitiis.

  --De Oandoile had also distinguished Uredo rubigo-vera in 1815, and Schmidt

soon after described a third wheat^rust Uredo glumarum.

     Matters were at about this stage when Tulasne confirmed the statement of

-- --Henslow one of my predecessors in Cambridge that the uredo- and puccinia-

stages really belong to the same fungus, and are not, as Unger asserted, mixed

species.

    Then came De Bary and his classical investigation of the whole question in
1860-G4. He proved that the sporidia of some Uredinefe (e.g., Coleosporii/»t) will

not infect the plant which bears the spores, and that the secidia of certain other
forms are only stages in the life-history of species of Uromyces and Puccinia.

     In 1864 be Bary attacked the question of wheat rust, and by means of

numerous sowings of the teleutospores on barberry proved beyond doubt that they

bring about its infection.

     But De Bary did more. For the first time in history he saw the entrance of

the infecting tube and the beginning of its growth in the tissues. In 1865 he
demonstrated in the same faultless way the infection of the cereal by means of the
aecidio-spores, and showed that P. rubigo-vera alternates on Boraginea; as yEc.
asperifolii, while P. coronata, separated by Corda in 1837, does the same as yEc,

Mhamni on Rhamnics,

                                                                       ?I2
852 REPORT-- 1897.

Thus was discovered the astounding phenomenon of Hetercecism, introducing a

new idea into science and clearing up mysteries right and left.

During the next twenty-five years the number of heteroscious forms has risen to

about seventy, including Woronin's recent discovery of this phenomenon in an

ascomycete Sclerotinia heterwcia.

About 1890 the rust question entered on a new phase. In Australia, India,

Sweden, Germany, and America especially, active commissions, inquiries, and

experiments were set on foot, and amid some confusion of meaning among some of

those concerned much knowledge has resulted from the investigations of Plowright

Denmark ; and especially from the continued and indefatigable researches of Eriksson

and Henning in Sweden. This renewed work has resulted in the complete con-

firmation of De Bary's results, but with the further discovery that our four common

cereals are attacked by no less than ten different forms of rust belonging to five

separate species or ' form-species,' and with several physiological varieties, and

capable of infecting the barberry. Some of these are strictly confined to one or

other of the four common cereals, others can infect two or more of them, and yet

others can infect various of our common wild grasses as well.

The fact that what has usually gone by the name of Puccinia graminis is an

aggregate of several species is in itself startling enough, but this was not un-

expected ; the demonstration that varietal forms exist so specially adapted to their
host that, although no morphological diflerences can be detected between them,

they cannot be transferred from one cereal to another, points, however, to physio-

logical variation of a kind met with among bacteria and yeasts, but hitherto un-

suspected in these higher parasitic fungi. It now appears that we must be pre-

pared for similar specialisation of varietal forms among TJ&tUaginea as well aa

among other Uredince, as follows from the results obtained by Kellermann and

Swingle in America, by Klebahn, Tubeuf, and others in Germany, and by Plowright

and Soppitt in England.

Not less remarkable is the conviction that among the many different pedigree

varieties of wheat, some are more susceptible to attacks of rust than others. This

had often been asserted in general terms, but the extensive observations of Cobb ia

Australia, and the even more extensive and exact experiments of Eriksson in.

Sweden, seem to put the matter beyond doubt.

Of course attempts have been made to account for these diflerences in predis-

position to the attacks of wheat-rust.

N. A. Cobb, who has done much for the investigation of Australian wheat-

ruets, regards the different susceptibility to rust as due to mechanical causes, and

seeks to explain it by the diH'erence in thickness of the cell-walls on the upper and

lower leaf-surfaces offering different resistance to the outbreak of the spore-clusters

the average number of stomata per square millimetre differing in the different sorts

of grain, influencing the predisposition to infection ; the presence of waxy bloom

affording a protection, and so on.

Eriksson and Henning have made a critical examination of Cobb's mechanical

theory, and show that, for Sweden at any rate, the conclusions of the Australian

investigator cannot be confirmed.

Nevertheless, the problem remains. As matter of fact, different sorts of wheat,,

of oats, of barley, and of rye are susceptible to their particular rusts in different

Whydegrees, and the question is,    ? Some complex physiological causes must be

at the bottom of it.

Sorauer pointed out in 1880 that every change of vegetative factors induces

differences in composition and form of a plant, and therefore alters the predispo-

sition of each individual and variety ; and this applies to the fungus as well as to

the host.

De Bary's proof, in 1886, that a Peziza succeeds in being a parasite only after

saprophytic culture to a strong mycelium, that its form is altered thereby, and that

probably a poison is excreted, throws side-lights on the same question ; while I

myself showed that similar events occur in the case of the lily disease.

                                                                                                                                                                              I
                      TRANSACTIOXS OF SECTION K.  853

Reinhardt, in 1892, showed that the apical gTowth of a Peziza is disturbed and

interrupted if the culture solution is concentrated by evaporation or diluted ; and

Biisgen, in 1893, showed that Botrytis cinerea excretes poison at the tips of the

myhyphte, confirming  results with the lily-disease in 1888, and that a similar

excretion occurs in rust-fungi.

    De Bary had also shown, in 1886, that the water-contents of the infected
plant influence the matter ; and I may remark that we have here also to consider the

case of Botrytis attacking chrysanthemums, &c., in autumn, with respect to the
chilling of the plant, which lowers the vitality of the cells and causes plasmolysis,

as well as the fact that cold increases the germinating capacity of spores, as

Eriksson showed.

     I discussed these points at some length a few years ago in the Croonian Lecture

to the Royal Society, and it now remains to see if any further gleams of hght can

be found in the progress of discoveries during recent years.

    You are all no doubt familiar with Pl'etl'er's beautiful work on chemotaxis, and

with the even more fascinating experiments of Engelmann, which prove that

bacteria will congregate in the neighbourhood of an ala:al cell evolving oxygen.

    When Pfeffer took the matter up in 1883, he was interested in the question as

to the stimulating action of various bodies on mobile organisms, for he found that

many motile antherozoids, zoospores, bacteria, &c., when free to move in a liquid,

are vigorously attracted towards a point whence a given chemical substance is

diffusing.

     Pfeffer's problems had nothing to do with those of Engelmann ; he was
concerned, not with the proof of oxygen evolution or the movements of bacteria as

evidence of the presence of that element, but with a fundamental question of

stimulation to movement in general,

Pfeffer found that the attractive power of different chemical substances varies

according to the organism, and according to the substance and its concentration.

He also showed that various other bodies besides oxygen thus attract bacteria

e.g., peptone, dextrose, potassium salts, &c. These experiments are by no means
difficult to repeat, and are now employed in our laboratories.

     During the course of several years not onlj' were these facts confirmed, but it

--was also shown that this remarkable attraction chemical attraction, or 'chemotaxis
--is a very general phenomenon.

     Pfeffer liad already shown that swarmspores of the fungus Saprolcgnia are

powerfully attracted towards the muscles of a fly's leg placed in the water in

which they are swimming about, and pointed out that in many cases where the

hyphse of fungi suddenly and sharply bend out of their original course to enter the

body of a plant or animal, the cause of the bending lies in a powerful ' chemotropic
action due to the attraction of some substance escaping from the body.

     This idea of an attractive action between the living substance of two organisms

--growing in close proximity was not entirely new it was, so to speak, in the air

e.g., the fusions of mycelial cross-connections and clamp-organs, and of the spores
of' Tilletia, Entyloma, &c. One of the most striking examples is aflbrded by
Kihlmann's demonstratit)n of the parasitism of Melanospora on Isaria, where he

states that some attractive action exists. In 1882 I had myself seen zoospores of

I'ythiian suddenly dart on to the cut surface of a bean-stem, and there fix them-
selves. But it is due to Pfeffer and his pupil Miyoshi to state that they were

the first to demonstrate these matters clearly.

    To understand the important consequences which followed, I must now refer

to another series of discoveries.

    When a spore of a parasitic fungus settles on a plant, it frequently behaves as

follows. The spore germinates and forms a slender tube of delicate consistence,

-- --blunt at the end and containing colourless protoplasm. De Bary long ago showed

that such a tube the germinal hypha only grows for a short time along the
surface of the organ, and its tip soon bends down and enters the plant, either
through one of the stomata or by boring its way directly through the cell-walls.
Several observers, and among others myself, remarked how the phenomena sug-

gested that the end of the tube is attracted in some way and by some force which
854 REPORT--1897.

trings its tip out of tbe previous direction, and De Bary even threw out the hint

that this attraction might he due to some chemical suhstance excreted by the host-

plant. I myself showed that the condition of the attacked plant affected the ease
with which the tube penetrates the cell-walls, and that the actual boring of the
cell-walls is due to a solvent enzyme secreted by the tip of the fungus, and in
clearly demonstrating this excretion of an enzyme capable of dissolving cellulose
carried a step further what was so far known, principally from De Bary's
researches, as to this process. In 1892, Reinhardt showed that the tips of hyphae
curve over towards spores they are about to attack, and found that sugar-gelatine
of greater strength attracts them from the same medium with a smaller proportion

of sugar.
     Miyoshi then showed, in 1894, that if a leaf is injected with a substance such

as ammonium-chloride, dextrine, or cane-sugar, all substances capable of exerting
chemotropic attraction on fungus-hyphse, and spores of a fungus then sown on it

which is not parasitic, the hyphse of the fungus penetrate the stomata and behave

exactly as if the fungus were a true parasite.

     This astounding result throws a clear light on many known cases of fungi
which are, as a rule, not parasitic, becoming so when the host-plant is in an
abnormal condition e.g., the entry of species of Botrytis into living tissues when
the weather is cold and damp and the light dull ; the entry of Mucor into various
fruits, such as tomatoes, apples, pears, &c., when the hyphse meet with a slight

crack or wound, through which the juices are exposed. Nay, I venture to suggest

that it is even exceedingly probable that the rapid infection of potato-leaves in

damp weather in July is not merely traceable to the favouring effect of the

moisture on the fungus, but that the state of super-saturation of the cell-walls of

the potato leaf, the tissues of which are now unduly filled with water and dis-

solved sugars, &c., owing to the dull light and diminished transpiration, is the

primary factor which determines the easy victory of the parasite, and I suggested

some time ago that the suppressed life of Ustilaginece, in the stems of grasses, is

due to the want of particular carbohydrates in the vegetative tissues there, but

which are present in the grain.

Miyoshi, in 1895, carried to proof the demonstration that a fungus-hypha is

really so attracted by substances on the other side of a membrane, and that its
tip pierces the latter ; for the hj-phse were made to grow through films of artificial
cellulose, of collodion, of cellulose impregnated with paraffin, of parchment-paper,

cork, wood, and even the chitinous coat of an insect, simply by placing the intact

films on gelatine impregnated with the attracting substance, and laying the spores

on the opposite side of the membrane.
     Hyphas so separated by similar membranes from gelatine to which the

attracting substance Avas not added, did not pierce the membranes, whence we may

conclude that it is really the substance referred to which incites the hyphse to

penetration.

Now, obviously, this is a point of the highest importance in the theory of

parasitism and parasitic diseases, because it suggests at once that in the varying

conditions of the cells, the contents of which are separated only by membranous

walls from the fungus-hyphse, whose entrance means ruin and destruction, there

may be found circumstances which sometimes favour and sometimes disfavour the

entrance  of the  hyphse                                    and it  is  at  least  a  remarkable  fact  that  some  of  the
                                                         ;

substances which experiments prove to be highly attractive to such hyphfe e.g.,

--sugars, the sap of plums, phosphates, nitrates, &c. are just the substances

found in plants, and the discovery that the action depends on the nature of the

substance as well as on the kind of fungus, and is affected by its concentration,

the temperature, and other circumstances, only confirms us in this idea.

Moreover, there are substances which repel instead of attracting the hyphse.

Is it not, then, natural to conclude that tbe differences in behaviour of different

parasites towards different host-plants, and towards the same host-plant under

different condition.s, probably depend on the chemotropic irritability of the hyphse

towards the substances formed in the cells on the other side of the membranous

cell-walls ? And when, as often happens, the effusion of substances such as the
                                  TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                                                                                                       855

cell8 contain to the exterior is facilitated by over-distension and super-saturation,

or by actual wounds, we cannot be surprised at the consequences when a fungus,

hitherto unable to enter the plant, suddenly does so.

In spite of all the progress made towards an explanation of the origin and

course of an epidemic of rust, however, one serious inconsistency has always

puzzled men who have worked with it in the open and on a large scale. This

inconsistency concerns the outbreaks of epidemics over large areas, at periods, and

within intervals, which do not agree with the weather records and the described

Webiological facts.               know, speaking generally, the conditions of germination of

the spores, we know how long infection requires, and the latent period is known

we know much as to the conditions which favour or disfavour the fungus

mycelium in the tissues, and, nevertheless, an outbreak of disease over large

areas sometimes occurs under conditions which appear quite inconsistent with

this knowledge.

During his six years' study of the wheat rusts Eriksson was so impressed with

these difficulties that he has lately committed himself to an hypothesis which may

perhaps crystallise the ideas which have floated in the minds of several who have

been puzzled by these matters.

The facts which seem to have finally impelled Eriksson to his hypothesis were

those of the distribution of the wild rusts and grasses. Having learnt which

grasses could infect the wheat, oat, barley, and rye i-espectively, he found cases of

epidemics occurring where it was impossible to fit in the facts with the view that

spores had been transferred from these grasses within the period required for

infection and development of the disease spots. Again, seasons occurred when all

the conditions pointed to the probability of a serious outbreak of rust, and no such

epidemic occurred. Further, experiments were made in which cereals of varieties
known to be susceptible to given rusts were planted in close vicinity to grasses

infected with such rusts, and, nevertheless, in seasons eminently suitable for the

outbreak of this particular rust on these particular cereals none appeared, or so

little that it was impossible to explain the outbreaks of this same rust on this

cereal elsewhere, during that season, as due to direct infection from the surrounding

grasses.

More and more it became evident that the infective capacity of the rusted

-- --grasses is small, and confined to restricted areas, and that the outbreaks in certain

seasons rust-years must be due to something other than wind-borne spores dis-

tributed by gales over the district.

Three hypotheses                  can  be  suggested             to  account  for                                                      the non-spreading                           of the
                                                                                                                                                                                ,

arities of the leaves on which the spores fell, of such a nature that infection was

prevented.

The results of many experiments showed that, as matter of fact, the spores

are often very obstinate, and refuse to germinate even when the weather is

apparently favourable, and Eriksson discovered during these experiments that

cooling the ripe spores on ice increased their germinating power. Neither of the

other two hypotheses mentioned could be brought into agreement with the results,

however.

The conclusion was thus arrived at that an outbreak of rust cannot always be

referred directly to the normal germination and infection of wind-borne spores
from neighbouring centres of infection.

In some patches of extremely susceptible cereals, the disease appeared simul-

taneously on plants isolated from all perceptible sources of infection, and on plants

--not thus protected ; the date of outbreak in these cases reckoned from the sowing of
--the grain was far too late to be explained by direct infection from spores on the

soil, or on the grain sown. Experiments demonstrated that if such spores had been

there, and germinal tubes formed as usual, the disease woiUd have shown itself
much earlier.

These and numerous other inconsistencies drove Eriksson to look for an

* internal source of infection,' in spite of the improbability of any such existing,

and of its apparent incompatibility with scientific theory since De Bary's time.
856 REPORT-- 1897.

Two methods were pursued. In one each plant of the cereal was enclosed

from the beginning in a long glass tuhe, stufiied with cotton-wool above and below,

and so carefully protected against infection from wind-blown spores that we may

accept forthwith the improbability of such infection.

    Notwithstanding these precautions, the cereal was rusted at the same time as

its unprotected neighbours, and equally badly.
     Granting the accuracy of the experiments, only two explanations seem to

--suggest themselves. Either (1) winter-spores attached to the grain had germinated

and infected the young seedling a not impossible event, since several observers

have found spore-bearing mycelia in the pericarp of the ripe grains, and we know

these spores can conserve their germinating power for months ; or (2) the infective

--material had been handed down to the embryo from the parent plant an almost

inconceivable hypothesis.

To answer this question Eriksson protected his seed-plants from external

infection, and sowed the grains in sterilised soil in specially constructed green-

houses, through which the air can only pass via cotton-wool filters. Between the

-double-glass windows water was allowed to stream, and the plants thus kept cool.

Some of these protected plants became rusted.

Before we draw any conclusions from such difficult experiments as the above,

let us see the results of microscopic examination.

     Reference has already been made to the mycelium and spores in the tissues of

the pericarp of the grain ; no trace could be, or ever has been, detected in the

endosperm or embryo. In some cases the seedlings, four to eight weeks old,

·showed the first uredo-pustules on their leaves, and the mycelium but no spores

could be detected in the seed-coats.

The tissues of the leaf, in the neighbourhood of young uredo-pustules,

frequently showed curious clumps of protoplasm in the cells, either free in the

cell-cavity, or attached to the primordial utricle, and looking like haustoria.

Eriksson assumes that we have here the key to the puzzle ; he regards these

* plasmatic corpuscles ' as the protoplasm of the fungus which, after leading a

dormant life commingled symbiotically with the living protoplasm of the cell, is

now gaining the upper hand and beginning to form a dominant mycelium.

   We are therefore to suppose that when the spores of rust, even if of the right

variety, alight on the tissues of a wheat-plant, it is a matter decided by external

and internal conditions whether the germ-tubes forthwith infect the plant and

grow out into a dominant, parasitic, sporiferous mycelium, as we know they

usually do, or simply manage to infect the cells with enough protoplasm to live

-- --a latent symbiotic life for weeks or even months as a Mi/coplasma, which may,

under favourable circumstances, gain the upper hand, and grow out in the form

of a mycelium.

This is a startling hypothesis, and brings us to the most advanced point along

Wethis line of biological speculation.  must distinguish sharply and clearly

between such a view, which is by no means inconsistent with all we know of

parasites, so far as the dormant mycelium goes, and all the hazy, mystical sugges-

tions as to ' infective substance ' and so forth, which were so freely flung about

at the beginning of this epoch, and which De Bary's strictly scientific methods put
down so firmly.

    The idea of symbiosis is now comparatively old, and there are many cases of
dormant life now well established. Even the astounding notion of blended proto-

plasms can no longer be regarded as new. I need only remind you of (Jornu's

Rozella, which invades the thallus of Sajn'oler^ma, and Woronina in Vaucheria,

the protoplasm of the two organisms apparently blending and living a common life

for some time before the true nature of the parasite manifests itself. Eriksson has

avowedly been influenced by these and other cases among the Chrytridiaceee.
That the remarkable iutra-cellular fusions of Plasmodiophora and the now well-

established symbiosis of the organism of the leguminous root-nodules have also

had their influence on his work may well be assumed, and I think we may trace

also the efiectsofour knowledge of the latent life of Ustilago during the vegetative

period of the attacked cereal.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K,  857

     But there are other cases which prevent our casting aside as impossible the

view that Eriksson has put forward.
     I showed some years ago that the mycelium of the Botrytis of the lily disease

can lie dormant for some time in the cell-walls, and I have ohservations showing
that other forms of Botrytis which attack roses and chrysanthemums only gain
the upper hand when the cold autumn nights so chill the attacked cells that they
succumb ; the mycelium was there long before, but so long as the cells were active
no progress could be made, and only when the plasmolysed chilled cells exude their
sap can the mycelium advance.

    Many cases of similarly dormant mycelia appear to exist in those cortex and

--cambium diseases which result in the production of cankers e.g., Nectria ditissima

and Peziza Willkommii, and Tubeuf's experiments with Gymnosporangium are even
more suggestive. Tubeuf found that if G. claoariceforme is sown on hawthorn
seedlings the fungus forms yellow spots and induces marked hypertrophy, and normal

--spermogonia and secidia Roestelia lacerata are developed ; but if Pyrus Aucitparia

is used as the host, no yellow spots or hypertrophy result, though a mycelium is

formed and will even produce a few starved spermogonia. On allied species of P«/7-?<s
the fungus may even succeed in forming a few poorly developed secidia. But on the

quince the fungus only just succeeds in establishing an infecting mycelium, and

soon dies ; and Wagner describes similar events with fungi on Stellaria.

      These cases point to a struggle between the protoplasm of the cells of the
diflerent hosts, and of the fungus respectively : sometimes one wins, sometimes

the other. The following cases are also suggestive. De Bary found that the

germinal hyphfe of Peronospora pyymcea, which is parasitic on Anemone, will
penetrate the tissues of Ranuncidics JFicaria, but cannot maintain its hold, and the

mycelium soon succumbs and dies.
     Still more remarkable and to the point is the following case. Soppitt and

Plowright in England, and Klebahn and others on the Continent, have gradually
unravelled a curious case of hetercecism and specialised parasitism among certain
Puccinias found on Smilax, Convallarin, Paris, and Diyraphis. The story is too
long to recount in detail, hut the Puccinia-spores from Phalaris were found by
Klebahn to refuse to infect Polygonatum leaves successfully, though they readily

infect the allied Convallaria. Close investigation showed, however, that although
the sporidia failed to develop a mycelium in the Polygonatum leaves, they really
penetrate the cells, and the delicate germ-tube is killed off' by the protoplasm, a

red spot marking the place of entrance.
     The perennial mycelia of Witches' Brooms, secidia in Euphorbia, Taphrina,

and many other perennial mycelia are also cases in point.

    It is not my purpose to hold a brief for Eriksson's hypothesis, but I may point

out that it is in no way contradictory to the facts already known since De Bary's

time. Its most serious aspect is with regard to possible treatment, and it is obvi-

ously essential that we should have it tested to the utmost, for it must be remem-
bered that no method of spraying or dusting has been, or apparently can be, devised

for cereals ; hence the questions as to the existence of really resistent forms, and
whether dormant mycelia lurking in their tissues have deceived us in these cases

also, require sifting to the bottom. Experience, so far, points to the selection of

pedigree wheats and careful cultivation as the first necessities ; how far the ques-

tion of spring versus winter wheat aids us is still matter for further experiment

early and late ripening are also concerned. Climate we cannot hope to control,

-- --but it remains to be seen when the facts are known how far it can be ' dodged.'

     Clearly what is needed, then, is experiments with varieties of wheat under all

conditions, and we may congratulate the Australian, Swedish, and United States

experimental stations on their preliminary efforts in this direction.
     I have only been able to give a mere sketch of this rapidly growing subject,

but I think you will agree that we are justified in saying that an epidemic of para-
sitic fungi depends on the interaction of many factors, congenital variations of
the host-plant and topical variations of its cell-contents being probably among the
most important ; and since we cannot hope to control the variations of the parasite,

or the meteorological conditions, it behoves agriculturists to pay more systematic
858 REPORT-- 1897

attention to the selection of those varieties of the cereal which are least predisposed

to rust.

    "When we find the annual losses from wheat- rust alone put down at sums vary-

ing from 1,000,000/. to 20,000,000/. in each of the great wheat-growing countries
of Europe, India, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere, it strikes one as very-
remarkable that so little should be done to encourage the scientific investigation
of these practical questions. I need hardly say that the establishment and main-

tenance of a fully equipped laboratory and experimental station does not cost the

interest on the smallest of these sums.
     It should be also clear that in the further development of our knowledge of the

treatment of parasitic diseases of plants the farmer, gardener, and forester can
alone supply the experimental evidence which will enable us to put theory to the
test in the field, garden, and forest. The botanist, by means of his pure cultures

of the fungus, can now show clearly what stage in the life-history of a parasite is
vulnerable. In his ' microscopic gardens ' he can show what antiseptics may be
employed, how strong they should be, and when and how they should be em-

ployed.

But we must not forget that it is one thing to kill a fungus when grown pure,

and another to kill it when growing on or in, or even associated with, other plants,

Wewithout harming the latter.  may compare the first case to the destruction of

weeds on a gravel path, where the antiseptic dressing may be employed lavishly

and at any time, because there are no other plants to injure ; but it is another

matter to kill the same weeds growing in a lawn or a flower-bed, where we have

to pay attention to the neighbouring plants.

Experiments in the open, simple in themselves, but conducted intelligently

and with due regard to the rigorous demands of science, can alone determine

these questions.

     Brewers have long known that burning sulphur in the barrels will rid these
barrels of the moulds and yeasts growing on their damp beer-soaked sides ; and
Berkeley saw clearly that sulphur could be applied to the outside of plants on

which such fungi as the hop- or grape-mildew, &c., are growing, the critical period
being when the spores are germinating, so that the slowly oxidising sulphur shovdd

evolve sulphurous acid in just sufiiicient quantities to destroy the delicate germs

without injuring the leaves. And even better results have been attained witb

Bordeaux mixture.

     But it is clear that this can only be done with an intelligent appreciation of
the life-history of the fungus, and a knowledge of when the germinating stage is
at hand. Tlie successes obtained in France and America with Bordeaux mixture

attest this.

     It would obviously be absurd to powder sulphur or spray liquids over

plants attacked by bunt- or smut-fungi, for we know that the germ-tubes only

infect the germinating grain as its first root emerges. Here, as was shown long
ago, and especially by the experiments of Hofimann, Kiihn, and De Bary, the
practice known as ' dressing the grain ' must be followed. Knowing that the

spores of the fungus are attached to the grain, or to particles of soil around, the

efforts must be directed to covering the outside of the grain with an antiseptic
which is strong enough to kill the germs but not the grain. If the land is known

to be clean, the grain may be immersed in hot water, the temperature being

experimentally determined, and high enough to kill the spores but not the wheat,
and so on. In these matters also the American stations have done good work.

     Neither of these classes of treatment can be adopted, on the other hand, for

diseases such as ' Finger and Toes,' where we have a delicate slime-fungus making
its way into the roots already in the soil ; but, here again, intelligently devised
experiments, such as those of Somerville and Massee, have shown that liming

the soil renders it so unfavourable to this disease that it can be coped witb.

    And similarly with other diseases ; the particular methods of dealing with the

'damping-ofi'' of seedlings, ' dry-rot ' in timber, the various diseases of trees, and

experimental inquiry into complex hiological relationships, and it is encouraging

to see that this is being understood in the large American and other stations,

which are distinguishing themselves by their efforts.

3. The Groicth of the Mycelium of Aecidium graveolens (Shuttlew.) on the

  Branches of the Witches' Broom on_Berberis vulgaris. By P. Magnus,

    Berlin.

Eriksson has stated in the 'Beitrage zur Biologie der Pflanzen (Bd. VIII.,

Heft I.) that the mycelium of the Aecidium producing the witches' broom of the

barbery grew within the cells of the cambium. In the ' Berichte der deutsch.

hot. Gesellschaft,' Bd. XV., I asserted that the mycelium was intercellular with

haustoria in the pith, cortex, and in the phloem. In the same volume of the

' Berichte,' Eriksson states (pp. 228-231) that he had only examined the cambium,

and I only the pith and the cortex, and the latter statement was correct. He also

pointed out that he had exammed fresh material, whereas mine had been preserved

in alcohol, which objection I did not consider of any value. I have examined,

therefore, this summer some fresh material which was kindly sent me by Messrs.

Biiumler and Reuter, and have renewed my investigations on the growth of the
mycelium in the new shoots of the witches' broom. I find my former statements

confirmed. The mycelium grows in the intercellular spaces of the pith, cortex, soft

bast, and of the medullary rays, and as I have mentioned {loc. cit.) it often causes

the walls of the cells between which it grows to swell up. It sends numerous

generally knot-like haustoria into the cells. At the end of April or at the begin-

ning of May many of the short rosette-like shoots of the barbery, the leaves of which

were covered in spring with aecidia and spermogonia, grow out into long shoots.

Into the pith of these shoots the mycelium enters, and it keeps pace with the growth

of the medullary cells, so that its ends reach into the meristem of the terminal

bud. From the pith the hyphse pass through the medullary rays into the primary

cortex, and especially through the original tissue rays opposite the insertion of the

leaves. Hence it reaches the axillary buds, and makes its way into their first

leaves, which will expand in the next spring. The hyphse which are figured by

Eriksson within the cambium cells, I consider to be the cell contents contracted

by plasmolysis                                                                          the  yellow granules  which Eriksson  observed in  them might,
                                                                                     ;

in my opinion, be the first appearance of the yellow colouring matter which fills

the young wood-cells of Berberis.

Lastly, I have to point out that I had identified this aecidium of the barbery

in 1875 with Aecidium mm/ellanicum, Berk., and all other observers have followed

me in this respect. Since then I have shewn that another aecidium is found in

Patagonia and Chili, producing witches' brooms on Berberis huxifolia, and this I
360 REPORT--1897.

have named Aecidium Jacobsthalii, Henrici, and I consider that the Aecidium
mageUanicum observed by Berkeley on Berberis ilicifolia should be distinguished
from the two abore-mentioned aecidia.

     The fungus causing the witches' broom on the barbery in Europe should there-
fore no longer be called Aecidium mageUanicum, Berk., but must be called either
Aecidium graveolens, Shuttlew., or aecidium form of Puccinia Arrhenatheri (Kleb.),

4. Stereum hirsutum, a Wood-destroying Fungus. By H. Marshall Ward,

      D.Sc, F.S.S., Professor of Botany in the University of Cambridge.

     The author has cultivated this fungus from the spores, on sterilised wood
blocks, and has not only obtained very vigorous pure cultures, and traced the action
of the mycelium week by week on the elements of the wood, but has obtained
spore-bearing hymenia, and worked out the life-history very completely. Hartig,

in his ' Zersetzungserscheinungen des Holzes,' examined the wood-destroying action
of this fungus, but used material growing in the open, and therefore not pure.

Brefeld attempted its culture, but failed to make it develop any fructification or
spores ; since Brefeld does not allow us to know the composition of his media, it

is not possible to suggest why he failed.

     The fertile hymenium arises in about three to four months, and the author has
examined the development very thoroughly, and refers to discrepancies in the
existing descriptions. The details of its destruction of the wood are also gone into

fully ; the fungus delignifies the inner layers of the walls of the wood-elements,
and in three months' cultures and upwards these turn blue in chlor-zinc-iodine,
and are shown by other reagents to undergo alteration to cellulose-like bodies
before their final consumption by the fungus.

     Drawings and lantern slides made by Mr. Ellis from the author's preparations
were shown.

          5. The Nticleus of the Yeast Plant, By Harold Wager.

     Of the numerous observers, some twenty in number, who have made observa-

tions upon the presence of a nucleus in the yeast plant three only actually deny

its existence. Many conflicting statements, however, have been made as to its

nature, some observers having described it as a perfectly homogeneous body, others
as possessing a nuclear membrane and nucleolus, whilst two observers regard cer-
tain granules present in the cell under certain conditions as of the nature of a

nucleus.

     In Saccharomyces cereviseee the nucleus can be easily demonstrated by careful
staining in hsematoxylin, Hartog's double stain of nigrosin and carmine, or by
staining in aniline-water solution of gentian violet. It appears to consist, in the
majority of cases, of a homogeneous substance, spherical in shape, placed between

the cell wall and the vacuole. By very careful staining, however, and especially

after digestion in pepsin glycerine solution, a granular structure can be observed.
The whole cell is in the normal, imdigested state, often pervaded by such a deeply

stainable substance that this granular structure is difficult to make out. On the

whole, perhaps, it resembles more than anything else the fragmenting nuclei in the
older leaf cells of Chara ; that is, it consists of deeply stained granules embedded in
a slightly less stainable matrix. These granules are probably chromatin granules,
and the matrix occasionally gives evidence of a slight granular structure.

     The process of budding in a yeast cell is accompanied by the division of this
nucleus into two. The division is a direct one, and does not take place in the

mother cell, but in the neck joining it to the daughter cell. When about to divide,

the nucleus places itself just at the opening of this neck, and proceeds to make its
way through it into the daughter cell, until about half of it has passed through,
when it divides completely, and the two nuclei thus formed separate from each

ffither towards the opposite sides of their respective cells.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.                                861

     In S. Ludwigii the nucleus appears to possess the normal structure of a nucleus
a nuclear membrane being present, together with a nuclear network and a nucleolus.
The nucleolus appears to contain all the chromatin substance, and in the process

of division increases in size and divides into two, each portion becoming a new

nucleus.

     In S. Pastorianus the nucleus is similar in structure to that of S. Ludwigiif
except that a distinct nuclear network could not be seen. The process of division

is likewise bimilar to that observed in S. Ludivigii.

The process of spore-formation was observed in S. cerevisem. In a cell about

to sporulate the large vacuole or vacuoles disappear, and the protoplasm becomes

filled with a large number of very small ones, so that its texture appears spongy.

At this stage the nucleus is found in the centre of the cell, and appears to be

homogeneous in structure. Soon, however, deeply stained granules appear in it,

and these accumulate in the centre, forming a spherical mass, which looks exactly

like a nucleolus. When this nucleus divides its outline becomes irregular, and

the granules arrange themselves in the form of a short rod surrounded by the othe?

portion of the nucleus, which stains differently and appears to form a structure of

the nature of a spindle. The granules separate into two groups, and each group

becomes a nucleus. The two nuclei thus formed again divide, and four nuclei are
Aproduced, each of which becomes the nucleus of a spore.
                                                          small quantity of

protoplasm accumulates round each nucleus, spore membranes appear, and four

spores are thus formed, standing in the remainder of the protoplasm, from which

ultimately the thick spore membranes are produced.

   We may, I think, regard the process of nuclear division in spore-formation as a

simple form of karyokinesis.

   6. A Disease of Tomatoes. By W. G. P. Ellis, M.A., Cambridge.

    From diseased tomatoes received in August 1896 from Jersey the associated

fungi and hacteria were isolated and cultivated on nutrient gelatine, and the

mycelium was traced in sections of the fruits. On removing the first skin with

carefully sterilised instruments the mycelium within the fruit formed in a short
time the well-known sporangiophores of Mucor stolonifer. Though late in the
season (August 31, 1896), infection of sound plants at the University Botanic
Gardens, Cambridge, from pure cultures caused a disease resembling that of the

fruits received in August and September from the grower. Experiments are now

(July 1897) in progress to determine (1) whether the fungi, ohtained, other than
Mucor stolonifer, cause disease, and (2) the site of infection.

          7. On the Chimney-shaped Stomata q/" Holaoantha Emoryi.
                        By Professor Charles E. Bessey.

     This prickly, leafless shrub, called the ' Burro Thorn,' ' Sacred Thorn,' ' Cruci-
fixion Thorn,' ' Corono de Christo,' &c., is a native of the arid regions of Southern
Arizona, where it was discovered fifty years ago by Major Emory, of the United
States Army. It is supplied with remarkable breathing pores, which are evidently
designed to enable the plant to obtain carbon dioxide, while at the same time pre-
venting the loss of water from its interior moist tissues. The epidermis is of
extraordinary thickness, and the stomata have long, narrow, chimney-shaped
openings above them, terminating in hollow papillae, which project some distance
above the surface.

             8. Some Considerations upon the Functions of Stomata,

                         By Professor Charles E. Bessey.

     The author summarily reviewed the structure of stomata and discussed the
needs of aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial plants as to their getting of food, and the
862 REPORT-- 1897,

means by which they resist the drying of their tissues. The facts cited are held
by him to indicate that respiration is ihe normal function of stomata, and that the

loss of water through stomata is incidental and secondary. The author concludes :--

     1. That one of the functions of stomata is the admission of carbon dioxide to
the chlorophyll-bearing tissues of the plant for use in the formation of the carbo-
hydrates. 2. That the loss of water by terrestrial plants was originally hurtful,

and is so now in many cases. 3. That if plants have utilised this constant phe-

nomenon, it is for the supply of food matters of secondary importance, as the salts

in solution in the water of the soil. He cites observations and experiments to

corroborate his views. Thus Stahl and Blackman have shown that carbon di-oxide
enters through the stomata ; Stahl has shown, also, that transpiration takes place
through the stomata, but many observations show that stomata quickly close when
the water supply is deficient. Stahl, again, has shown that the leaves of ever-
greens have their stomata closed during the times when no carbon assimilation can
take place (that is, in winter) ; observations show that green parasites (mistletoe,
&c.) have many stomata, while those not green (dodders, &c.) have scarcely any.

The following Papers were read :

1. On the Species of Picea occurring in North-eastern United States and
                    Canada. By Professor D. P. Penhallow.

Since the time of Pursh the validity of the red spruce as a distinct species has

been generally denied by systematic botanists. In 1887 the late Dr. George

Lawson maintained, in a paper before the Royal Society of Canada, that the red

and black spruces are distinct species. This view has been sustained during the

Mypast 3'ear by Britton in his ' Illustrated Flora of North America.'  own studies

prosecuted during the past two years have likewise shown that there are abundant

reasons for the separation of P. rubra as a distinct species.
     Incidentally attention has been directed to a form of the white spruce

characterised by its foetid odour and its strongly glaucous, rigid, and often
cuspidate leaves, which are commonly produced at the base. For this the name

fcntida is suggested.

2. Contribution to the Life History of Ranunculus,

            3. On the Distribution of the Native Trees of Nebraska.
                         By Professor Charles E. Eessey.

     The State of Nebraska occupies a central position in that portion of the North

American continent where forest trees may grow. In this great area it lies almost

centrally again within the prairie region, which extends from the Mississippi
River to the Rocky Mountains, and stretches from Saskatchewan to Texas,
Beginning with an elevation of a little less than 300 metres along the Missouri
River, which forms its eastern boundary, it rises gradually to an altitude of about

1,700 metres near its western border. From east to west it is an undulating plain
whose western edge has been much uplifted. Down this slope run the Niobrara,

the Platte, and the Republican Rivers, each a turbid mountain torrent rushing
swiftly and directly from the Rocky Mountains or the foot-hills to the Missouri

River.
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  863

      Across the central part of the State a broad belt of sand-hills stretches from

north-east to south-west. From these arise many small rivers of clear water,

filtered through the sands, and issuing in never-failing springs. Thus arise the
Middle Loup, North Loup, Calamus, South Loup, Shell, and the Elkhorn Rivers
and their numerous branches. Lastly, in the basin of the south-eastern quarter
there flow in different directions several alluvial streams, whose muddy waters run
sluggishly into the Republican, the Missouri, and the Platte Rivers.

     South-eastward of this area lie the heavy forests which characterise many

portions of Missouri. Southward lies the southern extension of the Great Plains,
while northward the plains continue to the international boundary and far beyond.
Eastward lie the undulating prairies of Iowa, with their streams bordered by
narrow belts of forest trees. Westward are the forests of the Rocky Mountains,
extending eastward upon the Black Hills of South Dakota, and the foot-hills of

Wyoming and Western Nebraska, namely Pine Ridge, north of the Niobrara River

and Cheyenne Ridge, between the North Platte and Lodge Pole Rivers.

      In this area, in the centre of the plains, the native trees of the South-eastern

Missouri forests, and the Western Rocky Mountain forests have pushed until there
are now about sixty-five species of trees which grow naturally within its limits.
Of this number fully fifty-six came from the Missouri forests, and but nine from
the Rocky Mountains.

                   4. The Vegetation Regions of the Prairie Province.

                 By RoscoE Pound and Frederic E. Clements.

   A portion of the paper is devoted to a critique of the treatment accorded by

various authors to the floral covering of the North American continent, and in
particular to that given by Drude in his ' Handbuch der Pflanzengeographie.'

Especial attention is paid to the latter's characterisation of the Great Plains, and
the details are discussed at considerable length. The authors endeavour to demon-
strate the integrity of the Great Plains as a single vegetation province, and, in so
doing, summarise the most salient features of the floristic. Finally, the vegetation
regions of the prairie province are outUned briefly, followed by a concise summary
of the characteristic formations.

     There are three general classes of formations, comprising a considerable number

of types, viz., the prairie formations, prairie-grass, buff"alo-grass formations, the
sand-hill formations, bunch-grass, blowout, and sand-draw formations, the foot-

hill formations, the undershrub formation of tableland and bad land, the mat and
rosette formation of buttes and hills, and the grass formation of high prairie and
sandy plains..

       5. The Zonal Constitution and Disposition of Plant Formations.

                              By Frederic E. Clements.

     The author has here reviewed the phy togeographical contributions bearing upon
the subject in hand, with especial reference to the part they have played in the
elaboration of the conception of zonation. In addition, he has endeavoured to

demonstrate the fundamental universality of zonation in all divisions of the floral

covering. The essential connection between lines of stress which are physical,
tensions which are biological, and zones which are phytogeographical is brouo-hfc
out, and the causation of these phenomena briefly discussed. Lines of stress are
symmetrical or asymmetrical. Continental lines of stress are asymmetrical. They
are transverse, in which case they are primary, and give rise to vegetation zones
or longitudinal, when they are secondary, and originate vegetation provinces.
There are also tertiary lines of stress, which are likewise asymmetrical, and define
vegetation regions. Symmetrical lines of stress produce bilaterally or radially

symmetrical tensions. Each may be the result of biological or topoo'raphical
symmetry, so that various portions of the floral covering may manifest zonation
864 REPORT--1897.

due to either bilateral or radial biological symmetry, or to bilateral or radial
topographical symmetry. Zonal and azonal formations are contrasted, and the
latter shown to be rare and atypical.

              6. The Transition Region of the Caryophyllales.

                          By Frederic E. Clements.

The history of the investigation of the transition region is discussed at con-

siderable length. After a concise sketch of the histogenetic changes in the transi-

tion reoion in general, the details of the process are given for selected genera,

Dianthus, Portulaca, Allionia, Phytolacca, Polygonum, and Rumex. Three types

of transition may be distinguished with respect to the constitution of the bundle

trace of the cotyledons: holostelar, where the trace is composed of the entire

vascular  system of  the  hypocotyledonary  stele                        prototracheidal, when the proto-
                                                                   ;

tracheids are the xylem elements to pass into the cotyledons ; metatracheidal, when

the cotyledonary trace is formed by the metatracheids. With reference to the per-

fection of the transition in the hypocotyl, the transition may be truncate or com-

plete. In the first case, the xylem and phloem reach the cotyledons in centripetal

or secantial orientation ; in the second, the orientation is centrifugal, and the stele

becomes collateral.

    7. Note on Pleurococcus. By Dorothea F. M. Pertz, Cambridge.

     Cultures of Pleurococcus in nutritive solutions were made during the winter
months, from November to April. They did well in Knop'a solution, -2 per cent.,
in sterilised glass dishes and flasks, which were placed in different situations ; in the

laboratory, in a greenhouse, and out of doors.
     Separate clusters of Pleurococcus in hanging drops of the same solution were

also observed as continuously as possible. These drops were suspended in carefully
sterilised moist chambers, which were kept for several weeks, in one case for two

months.

     The chief difficulties met with were, first, to obtain the Pleurococcus in ab-
solutely pure condition, and then to keep it sufficiently aerated without running
any risk of making the culture impure. Both the ' globular sporangia ' and those
of ' elongated or quadrangular form,' observed by Chodat, occurred frequently, and
they seem undoubtedly to be produced by the transformation of normal Pleuro-
coccus-cells. Individual sporangia were repeatedly selected for special observation,
and the process by which they break up into separate spores was noted at all its

stages,

     The filamentous form described by Chodat never occurred.

 naent of the antlierozoids in Zamia is unique. lu the generative cell two compara-
tively very large bodies are found accompanying the nucleus, which very greatly
resemble centrosomes, but which differ from any centrosomes that have been de-
scribed. The generative cell divides, forming two daughter-celLs, each of which forms

 a motile antherozoid. In the prophases of the division the centrosome-like bodies in-
crease in size, becoming from 18 to 20 /x in diameter, an exterior wall becomes plainly

distinguishable, and the contents become vacuolate. During the formation of the
spindle, the kinoplasmic filaments centered upon the centrosom-like bodies entirely

disappear, apparently being utilised in forming the spindle. The spindle is inter-

nuclear, thefilamentshavingno visibleconnection withthe centrosome. In the monas-
ter stage of the division the outer membrane of the centrosome-like bodies has the ap-
pearance of breaking up into fragments, the contents contracting away from the

wall. During the formation of the cell-plate the outer membrane may be seen to have

broken, and the contents are then visible asa.small cluster of granules in the cytoplasm.

The membrane formed by the broken wall of the centrosome-like bodies becomes
extended in length, forming a band which moves outward and becomes appressed
against the Hautschicht of the antherozoid cell. This band grows in length,
finally forming from 5 to G turns around the cell, which are arranged in the form

of a helicoid spiral. While this band is still short, protuberances can be noticed
on its outer surface, which ultimately grow into the motile cilia of the mature
antherozoid. The antherozoids of Zamia are surprisingly large, being plainly
visible to the unaided eye. They are ovate or compressed, spherical in shape, and
from 258 to 332 /i in length by 258 to 306 fi in width. Their motion and de-
velopment were studied in 10 per cent, sugar solution, in which they could be kept
living and moving for over two hours. In fecundation from two to four anthero-
zoids enter each archegonium, only one of which takes part in fecundation. In
the actual process of fecundation, the nucleus only appears to take part, the
cytoplasm and cilia bearing band probably remaining in the cytoplasm of the
archegonium. The first division of the fecundated oosphere has not been observed.
In later divisions, however, which have been carefully studied no indication of
centrosomes could be found. The centrosome-like body in Zamia seems thus to be
a temporary organ of the cell, having the special and unique function of forming
the motile organs of the antherozoid.

3. A Preliminary Account of a New Method of Investigating the Behaviour

                    of Stomata. By Francis Darwin, F.R.S.

     The method resembles in principle Stahl's cobalt test, inasmuch as it only

indirectly indicates the condition of the stomata. Both are, strictly speaking,
methods for localising the transpiration of leaves, and both, to some degree,
measure the amount of transpiration. The instrument made use of in the present

researches is a hygroscope depending for its action on the extreme sensitiveness to
watery vapour of certain substances. The best material consists of thin sheets of

horn treated in a special manner, and known as ' Chinese sensitive leaf.' The
other is what is used for the toys described as ' fortune-telling ladies,' ' magical
fish,' &c. AVhen either of these membranes is placed on a damp surface it
instantly curves with the concavity away from the source of moisture. If one end

of a strip of the material is fixed to the lower surface of a block of cork, and is
placed on the stomatal face of a leaf, it is clear that only the free end can rise. It
is on this principle that the hygroscope is constructed, the angle to which the

hygroscope tongue rises bemg a rough indication of the degree of transpiration.
Thus on a leaf having stomata only below, the index of the hygroscope remains at

aero on the upper surface of the leaf, while on the lower side it instantly rises to

1897.                              3K
866 KEPORT-- 1897.

an angle varying with the condition of the stomata. If they are widely open the
angle will be 30° or 40° to a horizontal line ; if the stomata are closed the reading

will be zero on both surfaces of the leaf. With this instrument a number of well-
known facts in the physiology of the stomata can be easily demonstrated. The

author is engaged in a general investigation of the behaviour of the stomata under

1. Further Observations on the Insemination of Ferns, and specially on

        the Production of an Athyrioid Asplenium Trichomanes. By E. J.

         Lowe, F.R.S.

     At the meeting of the British Association at Cardiff in 1891 the author used

 the term multiple parentage. Since then a biological committee of the Royal
 Society has been formed, and the term insemination has been used in the case of

animals. As a member of that committee the author uses the term insemination

 of plants in preference to that of multiple parentage.

      The author records experiments in these insemination of Asplenium Tricho-
manes with Asplenium marinum and Athyriumflixfoemina.

      In the hybrid Trichomanes the length of the frond is six inches, of which the
 lower half is hipinnate and two inches wide, the upper half being pinnate, with
 long narrow pinnae. Some of the fronds are pinnate from the base to the apex,
 and these have very long pinnae, especially near the base, some being as much as
 three-quarters of an inch in length.

      Although copiously fertile and giving promise of a crop of seedlings, it has

yet to be proved whether it may not be similar to the hybrid between Aspidium

aculeatum and Aspidium angulare, whose spores looked equally promising, though

practically sterile, for the sowings of many thousand spores (persevered in for a
TKANSACTIONS OF SECTION K,                                                     867

number of years) have only resulted in three or four plants ; but these three or

four are, however, not only copiously fertile, but have produced many plants.

In the athyrioid Trichomanes the only peculiarity connecting it with Asplenimn

marinum consists in the long narrow pinnre being substituted for the usual rounded

ones, and in the basal pinn;e being large, which is not the case in other forms of

Asplenium Trichomanes. The change from pinnate to bipinnate is evidence of a

cross with Athyrium, for the author has never heard of a bipinnate-fronded

Asple7iiiim T-tchomanes; the bipinnate lower half of the fronds have the pinnce

bent, some even at right angles to the frond (as is the case with the variety of

Asplenium Trichomanes that was used in this cross). Thece pinnae being bent at

right angles makes it impossible to show the character with a pressed frond. The
Areproductive organs largely imitate Asplenimn Trichomanes.
                                                             portion of the

fronds are not bipinnate, and in these the pinnae are very large at the base.

    Two plants having this bipinnate character are almost identical, and some
others now approaching maturity will be very similar, whilst others show no

attempt up to the present time to be bipinnate, and these have the large lengthy

pinnae of the sea spleenwort.

              2. On more than one Plant from the same Prothallus,
                                 By E. J. Lowe, F.R.S.

     Experiments have now contradicted the assertion that only one cell on a pro-

thallus can be impregnated, and that only one plant can be produced.
     It must be borne in mind that what holds good in a wild state does not neces-

sarily affect artificial impregnation, i.e., where the strongest survive, to the
destruction of the weaker. Taking two notable examples, the variety victoria of
the lady fern and the cristatujn of the Nephrodium palleacewn, both remarkable

varieties, and now to be seen in every good fernery, have never again been found
growing wild, although by artificial culture they are raised by thousands.

    In artificially cultivated plants we have some important instances. In 1885
an Athyrium was inseminated with eight varieties, and amongst the plants three

were found growing so closely together as to be difficult to separate. These
eventually proved to be all alike, and were moreover so remarkable from having

two kinds of fronds (the first instance known in the lady fern) as to make it
certain they were produced on the same prothallus. Again, in 1889 there was the

case ofa Scolopendrium,in which four varieties of a Scolopendrium from insemination
produced three plants under similar circumstances. These were also alike, and had
fronds that were undulate, muricate, periferent, and caudate, the tail or horn being
'2h inches long and branched.

     Further experiments, in which immediately on a frond appearing it was
removed, caused the prothallus to throw out other branches or fronds, which
were as speedily removed ; and in this way seven plants resulted from this one
prothallus, but this development was most conclusively shown in the experiment
of dividing and repeatedly subdividing a prothallus, as then forty plants were
obtained, and the prothallus divisions kept healthy for several years, although for
several years previously they had been kept alive and unimpregnated.

3. Results in Experiments in the Cross-fertilising of Plants, Shrubs, and

       Trees. By Wm. Saunders, Director of the Dominion Experimental

         Farms.

     In this Paper the writer gives an account of the results achieved by experi-
ments conducted by him during the past twenty-five years in the cross-fertilising
of plants, trees, and shrubs. This work has included experiments with different
sorts of wheat, barley, oats, pease, and rye ; also with different varieties of the
gooseberry, red currant, white currant, black currant, raspberry, blackberry, grape,

                                                                               3k2
868 REPORT-- 1897.

apple, pear, plum, and cherry, and with several species of ornamental shrubs and

wild flowers.

     Among the most interesting results ohtained with fruits may be mentioned

some hybrids between the black currant as female and the gooseberry as male,
which show in a very striking manner the influence of both parents. In the
hybrids the leaves are intermediate in form and character. In all but two
instances the leaves have no odour when bruised, and in these the characteristic
odour of the black currant is but faintly perceptible. The flowers also are inter-
mediate in the size of the clusters and the number of flowers on each. Even in
the structure of the pistil the flower partakes of the characteristics of both parents.
In the black currant it is single, short, and robust; in the gooseberry it is long and
slender, and divided to the base; in the hybrid the pistil is cleft halfway down.
Very little fruit has yet been produced, but the berries thus far have been borne
singly, and are of a dull reddish colour.

     The gooseberry sawfly, Nematus Ribesii, which does not eat the foliage of the
black currant, feeds on the leaves of the hybrids ; the gooseberry mildew also,
Sphcsrotheca Mors-uves, which does not affect the black currant, attacks these
hybrids. Although these have been raised from seed of the black currant, their
gooseberry characteristics are recognised by both animal and vegetable parasites.

     Another interesting hybrid spoken of was the result of a cross between the
Clinton, an improved form of the native wild grape Vitis cordifolia, with Buck-
land's Sweetwater, a variety of Vitis vinifera. The Clinton produces a bunch
which is small, long, and very compact, with a round black berry, quite acid. The
Sweetwater forms a large loose bunch, and the berries are large, oval, and pale
yellowish green. The hybrid produces large, rather loose, shouldered clusters with
berries oval in form, and of a pale yellowish green colour. In size, form, colour,
and quality the fruit resembles that of the male more than the female parent.

   A number of varieties of dark purple raspberries have been produced by cross-

ing the black cap rz.s^herry, Rubusoccidentalis, with one of the cultivated forms of the
red raspberry, Bnbus strigosus. The former is propagated by emitting roots from the

tips of the pendulous branches when these touch the ground, while the latter sends
up suckers from the running roots. The hybrids have usually rooted from the tips,
but not freely, but in several instances occasional suckers have been sent up from
the roots. The fruit has a flavour which is a striking combination of that of botl>

parents.

     Many crosses have been made during the past three years, using Pt/rus hnccata

ss female, the pollen being obtained from a number of different varieties of the
most hardy Russian apples. Pyi-us haccata has proved quite hardy on the north-
west plains, where all the larger and better sorts of apples have failed, and this
work has been undertaken with the object of securing useful fruits which will be
hardy in the north-west country. With a similar object hybrids have also been
obtained between the sand cherrv, Pj-unus pumila, and the cultivated forms of the
American plum, Prunus americana.

     Some very promising varieties of wheat have been originated by crossing the

-- --Ladoga a Russian sort with Red and "White Fife. One of these, known as

Preston, ripens earlier than Red or White Fife, and in the tests made last season
with a large number of varieties it stood first in productiveness.

     Very distinct hybrids have been obtained between two-rowed and six-rowed
barley, some of which are proving commercially valuable. Interesting results have
also been had by crossing different sorts of oats ; also different varieties of pease.

      In ornamental shrubs striking hybrids have been produced between two species
 of barberry, Berberis Thunhergii, and Berheris vulgai-is pui-purea, combining the
peculiarities of both parents in flowers, fruit, leaves, and general habit to a

remarkable extent.

5. The Morphology of the Central Cylinder in Vascular Plants,

                            By E. C. Jeffrey.

There are three main types of fibro-vascular arrangement in plant axes, viz.

(I) a single so-called concentric aggregation ; (2) several such aggregations, com-

monly, but not always, grouped in                 a  circle                        (3)  a ring  of   so-called collateral or
                                                                                ;

bicoUateral bundles.

Disregarding the older views, Van Tieghem's is that the first type is primitive,

and is to be designated monostelic; the second is derived from it by simple

multiplication, and is consequently to be considered as polystelic ; the last type

is derived from the first by the segregation of a parenchymatous pith in the

midst of the central vascular core, and the splitting of the resultant fibro-

vascular ring into wedges called fibro-vascular bundles by radiating parenchy-

matous strands, the medullary rays. The last type of stem is according to this

conception monostelic.

     The writer considers that this view of the phenomena does not correspond
with morphological facts. In some of the Pteridophyta we have a single vascular

non-meduUated axis from which originate the leaf-traces. This state of affairs is

found, for example, commonly in the genera Lycopodium and Selaginella. In many

ferns the stele becomes a tube just below the origin of the leaf-trace, and this

cylinder breaks open again above the exit of the fohar bundle. This modification

is seen in its simplest form in ferns with sparse leaves and creeping rhizomes, and

the tubulisation of the stele seems to be a mechanical device to strengthen the

slender axis, and to enable it to support its comparatively enormous leaves.

Where the leaves are close ranked and the stem ascends the foliar gaps overlap,

and the stelar cylinder becomes in a transverse section apparently a circle of

separate bundles. In all such cases examined by Le Clerc du Sablon and the
writer, the young stem has a tubular stele. Even when widely separated the

vascular strands anastomose, so that there results a mechanically efficient fibro-

vascular cylinder. In some genera, for example, Antrophyum and Vittaria, the

internal bast of the stelar tube degenerates, the result being a state of affairs

approximating that found in the Angiosperms with the exception that the pith
freely communicates with the outside. This modification is very marked in

certain Ophioglossacefe and Lepidodendraceae, which will be described at length in

the fuller account which will appear shortly. In the former there is present

sometimes an internal endodermis, although the internal bast has disappeared.

Among the Gleicheniacese we have in Mertensia the cortex sending parenchy-

matous strands into the vascular axis of the stem down through the channelled

leaf-traces; in Gldchenia and Platyzoma these are completely cut off from the

outside cortex, and we find an entirely included pith similar to that presented by

Osmunda, The pith of these forms is in reality extrastelar, but no longer com-

municates with the peripheral cortex.

   We have a similar series in the Equisetaceae, where in the young stem the

vascular axis is not primitively dialjdesmic, but gamodesmic, contrary to the

statement of Van Tieghem. The primitive stelar arrangement is a closed tube

with external and internal endodermic, but no internal bast. In the older stem

this condition may be replaced by isolated bundles, surrounded by individual

endodermal sheaths. Often, however, the primitive tube remains intact, and the

internal endodermis disappears, bringing about a disposition quite similar to that

obtaining in the higher plants. It \s interesting to note that the Calamitece pre-

sented a still closer resemblance to the latter, owing to the presence of secondary

wood.

The writer proposes for the stelar tube the term siphonostelic ; where the

internal as well as external bast is present, the stele is to be described as amphi-

phloic                            where only the  external bast is present,             ectophloic.  Monostelic axes are
                               ;

to be considered as protostelic, and present a marked contrast to the mechanicallj^

modified siphonostelic axes.

In the Filicales the siphonostelic modification arose in connection with the

support of large leaves, and hence is to be called phyllosiphonic. In the Lyco-
podiales, and probably the Equisetales, it is related to the support of branches,

and hence may be termed cladosiphonic.

                    1. The Gametophyte q/ Botrychium virginianum.

                        By Edward C. Jeffrey, B.A.

   A complete description of the gametophyte of the Ophioglossacese has long

been a desideratum.
      Since the discovery by Mettinius, in 1856, of the subterranean prothallium of

Ophioglossum pedunculosum, and by Hofmeister, in 1857, of that of Botrychium
lunaria, nothing has been added till recently to their necessarily incomplete
accounts of the gametophyte in these species. Our latest knowledge on this subject
is derived from a brief description of incomplete material of the prothallium of
Botrychium virginianum found in 1893 at Grosse Isle, Michigan, by Professor
Douglas Campbell, which was published in the ' Proceedings ' of the Oxford meeting

of the British Association in 1894, p. 695.

     During the summer of 1895 the writer secured a large number of prothallia of
the same species at Little Metis in the Province of Quebec. On examination it was

found that the material thus obtained aflbrded a complete elucidation of the
development and structure of the antlieridia and archegonia, and a less satisfactory

series of stages in the segmentation of the embryo. Last summer the remaining
prothallia were removed to the number of about six hundred ; and, although they
have only been partially studied, owing to technical difficulties in embedding
them, yet those examined have supplied all the lacking stages of the development of
the young sporophyte

      It is proposed at the present time to furnish a brief account of the features of
interest ; a fuller description will shortly appear in the ' Transactions ' of the
Canadian Institute.

     The gametophyte of Botrychium viryiniamnn is of flattened oval shape, the

Mynarrower end of the prothallium being terminated by the growing point.

examples are from two to eighteen millimetres in length, by one and a-half to eight
millimetres in breadth. Their thickness increases from the growing end backwards.
The sides and lower surface of the prothallium are covered in younger specimens
with multicellular hairs. In older plants these tend to disappear. The middle of
the upper surface is occupied by a well-defined ridge, upon which the autheridia
are situated. The archegonia are found on the declivities which slope away from

the antheridial ridge.

     As might be expected, the younger sexual organs are found nearer the growing

point than those of greater age.

   A cross section of the prothallium reveals to the naked eye the fact that the

lower part of the gametophyte is composed of tissue which is yellowish in colour,

and from which a thick oil exudes, even when the plant has been lying in 90
per cent, alcohol for months. The upper portion of the prothallium tissue, upon

Awhich the generative organs are situated, is white in colour and free from oil.

long section of the prothallium shows the same distribution of yellow oil-bearing
and white oil-free tissue as the cross section, but demonstrates that the oil-

bearing stratum is both absolutely and relatively much thicker in the older parts

of the plant.

     Microscopic examination shows that the oleiferous tissue has its cells occupied
by an endophytic fungus and a very abundant protoplasm.

     The fungus, so far as it has yet been studied, seems to be a sterile Pythium,
possibly the same as that found by Treub, Goebel, and others in the prothallium
TRANSACTIONS OF SECTION K.  871

of species of Lycopodiiim. I hope to investigate the fungus more closely iu a
living condition during the next period of vegetation. The fungus filaments

can be seen passing from the prothallium to the outside medium by way of the

I'oot-hairs.

     The antheridia, as has been already stated, occur in numbers on a ridge
running lengthwise on the upper surface of the prothallium. The young antheridia
originate behind the growing point from a single superficial cell. This divides
transversely the outer half, giving rise to the outer antheridial wall and the inner
half by repeated simultaneous divisions to a large number of spermatocytes. The
fully developed antheridium is largely embedded in the antheridial ridge, and
projects only slightly above its surface. The formation of the spermatozoids has

not yet been carefully studied, but seems to resemble closely that described in the
Marattiaceaj and Equisetacese.

     The spermatozoids are unusually large in size, but otherwise resemble the
ordinary fern type, and consequently differ from the biciliate, moss-like spermato-

zoids of the Lycopodiales.

     The archegonia are confined to the sloping sides of the upper surface of the
prothallium. Unlike the antheridia, young archegonia, although most abimdant
near the growing point, may be formed on almost any part of the archegonia-
bearing surface. The archegonium mother cell is superficial, and is distinguished
from its neighbours by a larger nucleus and a more- abundant protoplasm. It first
divides transversely into a shallow outer cell and a deeper inner cell. The inner
cell divides again, and as a result the young archegonium consists of three cells.
The most external of these, by subsequent divisions, gives rise to the neck of the
archegonium. The internal cell is the basal cell. It also divides into a plate of
cells sometimes composed of two layers and distinguished by their richly proto-
plasmic contents. The middle cell of the young archegonium series gives rise by
division to the neck canal cell and the ventral cell. The former becomes binu-
cleate, but never divides into two cells. The latter, just before the maturation of
the archegonium, divides into the egg-cell and the ventral canal cell. The ventral

canal cell is broad, like that of the Marattiacese.
     In the ripe archegonium the nuclei of the cells of the upper storeys of the arche-

gonium neck become chromatolysed. I do not know yet whether this feature is

peculiar to Botrychium.

     The fully developed archegonium is sunk into the prothallium, and only the
neck projects above its surface. The cervical cells are in four rows as in the other
Pteridophyta, and the terminal ones spring apart when the egg is ripe.

      Spermatozoids are frequently found in contact with the egg. After fertilisation

the egg grows to many times its original size, and the reduced protoplasm contains

a large hydroplastid.

     The first division of the oospoi-e is across the long axis of the archegonium.
The next division is parallel with the long axis of the prothallium, and at right
angles to the first. The third cross wall is in the transverse direction of the pro-
thallium, and at right angles to the other two. I have been unable to follow

satisfactorily the subsequent divisions.

     The organs appear very late, and only after the embryo has attained a large
size. The root is the first of them to emerge, and the proliferation of cells, indi-
cating its place of origin, is long unmarked by the presence of an apical cell. The
cotyledon, stem apex, and foot appear nearly simultaneously.

     The root and cotj'ledon originate from the upper part of the embryonic mass
the foot and stem apex from its lower cells.

    The apex of the root in many cases is in the same straight line with the canal

of the archegonium neck.

     It seems hardly possible to derive the organs from definite octants of the
embryo.

     The gi-owth of the root ruptures the calyptra, and its exit is followed somewhat
later by that of the cotyledon. The latter is not a bilaterally symmetrical
structure, as in most ferns, but is of the same palmate type as is found in the
872 REPORT-- 1897.

Osmundacere. The cotyledon begins to assimilate as soon as it reaches the surface
of the ground, and thus resembles that of Oiihioglossum j^edunculosuin.

     There seems to be no evidence to indicate that more than the cotyledon appears
above ground in the first season of the young plant's growth. In following
summers apparently only a single leaf is produced, as is the ease with the older
plant. I have found young sporophytes, bearing their sixth leaf, still attached to
the mother prothallium : and, as I have never found more than one leaf on the
spore plants at once, and as the leaves, like other organs of this species of Botry-

chium, are extremely resistant to decay, I am reasonably certain that such examples

were in the sixth year of their existence. This longevity of the gametophyte is of
some interest.

    One frequently finds two sporophytes on a single prothallium, and in many of
these cases the apex of the prothallium is bifurcated. In one case I found two
spore plants which had arisen from a single embryo. In another case I discovered
two tracheids in a prothallium in the vicinity of a decayed young spore plant.
The latter may have been of apogamous origin, as a similar phenomenon generally

accompanies apogamy. I have not yet studied thoroughly the growing region of
the prothallium, as it is best examined in longitudinal sections of the gametophyte.
So far as I have investigated the matter, there seems to be evidence of the existence
of an apical cell.

     Comparison shows that in certain cases a progressive increase in number of
sporangia has taken place, in others a decrease. The changes may be classified

  _ Probably this does not exhaust the list of modes of modification, but the con-

dition of the individual plant, as we see it in the mature state, may be regarded

as a resultant of modifications such as these, and the morphological problem will
be in each case to assign the due importance to any or all such factors. The

physiological condition of the plant during development may largely determine

the greater or less prominence of any one factor.

    An analytical study such as this may help in clearing the problem of the origin

of homosporous Pteridophyta.

3. Notes on Fossil Equisetaceoi. St/ A. C.Bewarb, M. A., F.G.S., Cambridge.

     The genus Equisetites, established by Sternberg in 1838, has been used by
several authors as a convenient designation for fossil Equisetaceous stems,^ which
show a close agreement in external form with the recent Horse-tails. In the

absence of internal structure, and without a knowledge of details, it is better to
adopt the term Equisetites than to include the fossils in the genus Equisetum.

      In tracing the geological history of the Equisetacero it is extremely difficult to

determine how far the evidence warrants the reference of certain Palaeozoic fossils
til Equisetites rather than to the genus Catamites. The fused leaf-segments usually
regarded as characteristic of Equisetites may not be a trustworthy distinguishing

i'l'ature. Equisetites Hemitigivayi, Kidst, from the English Coal Measures, and other
I'errao-Carboniferous species, afford examples of the difficulties of correct determina-
tion. There are certain species of Equisetites of Mesozoic age which present

Ancharacters of special interest, e.g., Equisetites Beatjii, E. Interalis, and others.

examination of several specimens of these forms has led to the conclusion that the
specimens originally described as Calamites Beanii, and afterwards referred to the-
Monocotyledons, must be included in the genus Equisetites. Equisetites Beanii,

from the Lower Oolite roclis of England, rivalled in size the gigantic Triassic
stems described by Schimper and others from the Vosges Sandstones. Equisetites
lateralis, regarded by some writers as a form of Phyllotheca or Schizoneura, is, in

all probability, a true Equisetites, the reference to the former genera being founded
on .in incorrect interpretation of certain specimens. The so-called branch scars
of E. lateralis are probably slightly displaced nodal diaphragms. In conclusion
the author refers to specimens described as Phyllotheca from various localities and

geological horizons, and expresses the opinion that in such cases the generic name
Equisetites would be the more appropriate designation.

G. Report upon some Preliminary Experiments with the Rontgen Rays on

                         Plants. By George F. Atkinson.

The experiments were conducted for the purpose of testing the effect of the

Rijntgen rays on plants exposed during a considerable period of time.

Because of the numerous instances of reported injury to the human body as a

result of exposure to the Kontgen rays, it has been suggested that it might also

have an injurious influence on plants.

After a few preliminary experiments with leaves of Caladium, flowers of Begonia

and seedlings of corn, wheat, sunflower, radish, german-millet, soja-bean, with

exposures of one to ten liours, in which no perceptible injury resulted, a longer

exposure was made, in which the following seedlings were acted on for a total of

forty-five hours in a dark room : sunflower, wheat, german-millet, nonpareil-beau,

Asoja-bean, cotton, oats, corn, vetch, pea, and cucumber.  duplicate set was placed

also in the dark room, but outside the range of the Rontgen rays, as a check upon

the experiment.

On some days a continuous run of fifteen hours was made. During this time

the plants behaved exactly as plants grown in a dark room would. Some of the

seedlings were at one time or another turned strongly towards the light, and at

other times just as strongly away from it, and these movements were ascribed to
nutation. At the close of the experiment all the growth which had taken place

in the dark room was etiolated. On removing the seedlings from the dark room

they all became slowly green, but the seedlings which were under the influence of

the Rontgen rays recovered the green colour more slowly, which suggests that this-

light may h.ave some slight injurious effect on the chloroplastids. No other influ-

ence of any land was noted.
874 REPORT-- 1897.

     Another set of seedlings was then exposed for two days outside of the dark

room. There was no perceptible influence.
     The absorption of the Rontgen rays by the plants was then studied. RiJutgen

photographs of the seedlings experimented with, as well as of the internal structure
oi AriscBmatriphyllum, Pellandra virgmica, fruits of Cycas, Fodophyllum peltatum,
pea, bean, peach, plum, cherries, &c., and of the venation of leaves and internal
parts of flowers were readily obtained ; which shows that, while the rays penetrate
plant tissues, they are also readily absorbed by the same. The lack of injuries or
other influences then cannot be ascribed to non-absoi-ption of the Rontgen rays.

     Experiments were also made upon three species of Mucor, on several species of

Bacteria, and on one species of Oscillatoria. No influence was exerted on the

·growth or movement of any of the plants experimented with.
