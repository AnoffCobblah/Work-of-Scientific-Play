   On the first day of the Annual Meeting, the President, Vice-Presidents,
and Secretaries of each Section having been appointed by the General Com-

mittee, these Officers, and those previous Presidents and Vice-Presidents of

the Section who may desire to attend, are to meet, at 2 p.m., in their Com-

mittee Rooms, and enlarge the Sectional Committees by selecting individuals
from among the Members (not Associates) present at the Meeting whose as-

sistance they may particularly desire. The Sectional Committees thus con-
stituted shaU have power to add to their number from day to day.

   The List thus formed is to be entered daily in the Sectional Minute-Book,
and a copy forwarded without delay to the Printer, who is charged with
publishing the same before 8 a.m. on the next day, in the Journal of the

Sectional Proceedings.

read on Thursday shall be then arranged, and the general distribution of
business throughout the week shall be provisionally appointed. At the close
of the Committee Meeting the Secretaries shall forward to the Printer a List
of the Papers appointed to be read. The Printer is charged with publishing
the same before 8 a.m. on Thursday in the Journal.

   On the second day of the Annual Meeting, and the following days, the

read, are now as far as possible determined by Organizing Committees for the several

Sections before the beginning of the Meeting. It has therefore become necessary, in order

to give an opportunity to the Committees of doing justice to the several Communications,

that each Author should prepare an Abstract of his Memoir, of a length suitable for in-

sertion in the published Transactions of the Association, and that he should send it, toge-

ther with the original Memoir, by book-post, on or before        addressed

                                                               ,

              --REPORT 1874.

  Report of the Council for the Tear l?>Ti~14: presented to the General Com-

                   mittee at Belfast, on Wednesday, August 19<7(, 1874.

   The Council have received Reports during the past year from the General
Treasurer; and his Account for the year will be laid before the General
Committee this day.

   The General Committee at Bradford referred the following four Resolutions
to the Council for their consideration, and they beg to report their proceed-

--ings upon each case :
       First Resolution. " That the Council be requested to take steps to bring
            the importance of the meteorological researches at Mauritius before
          the Government, in order that, when they become convinced of the
          value of these researches by the action of the Association, they may
            be induced to increase the assistance."
    The Council found that it was unnecessary to take action in this case,
the application made by the Association last year having resulted in an

--increase to the Staff of the Observatory by the Government.
        Second Resolution. " That the Council be requested to take such steps
          as they may consider desirable for the purpose of representing to Her
           Majesty's Government the importance of the scientific results to be
            obtained from Arctic Exploration."
    In November last, Sir Bartle Frere, President of the Royal Geographical
Society, requested Mr. Gladstone to receive ajoint deputation from the Royal
Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the British Association, and the
Dundee Chamber of Commerce, on the subject of an Arctic Expedition.
 Mr. Gladstone declined to receive a deputation, but requested an application,
 stating reasons, in a written form. This was furnished, but a change of
 Government occurred. Mr. Disraeli, since his accession to office, has re-
 ceived a deputation on the subject, consisting of Sir H. Rawlinson, Dr.
 Hooker, and Admiral Sherard Osborne, but no answer has yet been returned

--to their application.
         Third Resolution. " That the Council be requested to consider the pos-
            sibility and expediency of making arrangements for the constitution
          of an Annual Museum for the exhibition of specimens and apparatus
             on a similar footing to tliat of the Sections, and similarly provided
             with officers to superintend the arrangements."
     The Council, in accordance with the desire of the General Committee, have
 provided a room, and appointed a Committee, consisting of the General and
 Assistant General Secretaries, Professor Redfern, Mr. Ewart (one of the

 Local Secretaries), and Mr. Ray Lankester, to make the necessary arrange-

 ments for the reception and due exhibition of specimens and apparatus illus-

--trative of Papers to bo read at the Meeting.
        Fourth Resolution. "That the Council of the British Association be
             requested to communicate with the authorities in charge of the St.
             Gothard's Tunnel, with the view of obtaining permission for the
             Committee on Underground Temperature to take observations on
              temperature during the progress of the works."
          ----

          REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.     xlix

    Steps are being taken in pursuance of this Eesolutiou.

    The Council have had under their consideration the advisability of laying
down some systematic rule to govern the election of Members of Council,
and they recommend to the General Committee the adoption of the following
regulations, which are in reality little more than a definite expression of the

general practice of past years :

   (1) The Council shall consist of

                  1. Tlie Trustees.

              2. The past Presidents.
              3. The President and Vice-Presidents for the time being.
              4. The President and Vice-Presidents elect.
              5. The past and present General Treasurers, General and Assistant

                         General Secretaries.

              6. The Local Treasurer and Secretaries for the ensuing Meeting.
               7. Ordinary Members.
   (2) The Ordinary Members shall be elected annually from the General
                Committee.

   (3) There shall be not more than twenty-five Ordinary Members, of whom

               not more than twenty shall have served on the Council, as Ordi-
               nary Members, in the previous year.

  (4) In order to carry out the foregoing rule, the following Ordinary Mem-

                bers of the outgoing Council shall at each annual election be

       --ineligible for nomination : 1st, those who have served on the

              Council for the greatest number of consecutive years ; and, 2nd,
               those who, being resident in or near London, have attended the

       --fewest number of Meetings during the year observing (as nearly

              as possible) the proportion of three by seniority to two by least

                 attendance.

   (5) The Council shall submit to the General Committee in their Annual

            Report the names of the Members of General Committee whom

              they recommend for election as Members of Council.
   (6) The Election shall take place at the same time as that of the Ofiicers of

                 the Association.

   In order to assist the consideration of this question, the Council have
appended to this Report a list of the Ordinary Members of Council, showing

the date of election in each case.

   The Council have added the following list of names of gentlemen present at
the last Meeting of the Association to the list of Corresponding Members :

II Signer Guide Cora.           Dr. A. Shafarik, Prague.
Dr. Felix Klein.                Professor J. Lawrence Smith, Louis-
Baron von llichthofen, Berlin.
                                    ville, U. S.

  In consequence of the Nomination to the Presidency of Section D of

Professor Redfern, who was appointed Local Secretary by the General
Committee at the last Meeting at Bradford, the Council have nominated

Professor G. Fuller to be a Local Secretary.

   The Council have to announce that Mr. "W. Spottiswoode has notified to
them that he is unable to continue to hold the office of General Treasurer.
The Council have received this announcement with great regret, a regret
which they feel wiU be shared by the Association. Mr. Spottiswoode has
occupied the post of General Treasurer for the last thirteen years, and has
invariably promoted the interests of the Association with untiring zeal and

ability.                          d

   1874.
--REPORT 1874.

   After much consideration, they have resolved to recommend Dr. A. Wil-
liamson as Treasurer in the place of Mr. W. Spottiswoode.

    The General Committee will remember that Bristol has been selected as
the place of Meeting for next year. The CouncU understand that an in-
vitation to hold a subsequent Meeting at Glasgow wUl be presented to the

General Committee.

    The CouncO. cannot close their Eeport without making some mention of
the irreparable loss which the Association has sustained in the death of the

late Professor Phillips.

    He, in conjunction with Dean Buckland, Canon Vernon Harcourt, and

others, founded the Association in 1831, and, from that time until his death,
his labours on its behalf were untiring.

   He acted as Local Secretary at the first Meeting at York ; he filled, from

 the following year to the year 1882, the ofHce of Assistant General Secretary;
 from 1862 to 1864 that of General Secretary; he was President in 1865;
 and, having seldom been absent from any of the Meetings, he presided last

 year at Bradford over the Geological Section.

    In Professor Phillips, eminence in his own branch of Science and Avide

 general culture, were united with unselfish sympathetic nature, a genial
 kindly manner and with a singularly happy tact in the conduct of affairs.
 It was this rare combination of qualities which guided the Association
 through its early difficulties to the success it has at present achieved, and

which now makes his loss felt as one which can never be filled up.

            PROFESSOR OF NAXURAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE ROYAL INSTITUTION,

                                       PRESIDENT.

An impulse inhereut in primeval mau turned his thoughts and questionings

betimes towards the sources of natural phenomena. The same impulse, in-
herited and intensified, is the spur of scientific action to-day. Determined
by it, by a process of abstraction from experience ^^-c form physical theories
which lie beyond the pale of experience, but which satisfy the desire of the
mind to see every natural occurrence resting upon a cause. In forming their
notions of the origin of things, our earliest historic (and doubtless, we might

add, our prehistoric) ancestors pursued, as far as their intelligence permitted,

the same course. They also fell back upon experience, but witli this differ-

--ence that the particular experiences which furnished the weft and woof of

their theories were drawn, not from the study of nature, but from what lay
much closer to them, tlie observation of men. Their theories accordingly took
an anthropomorphic form. To supersensual beings, which, " however potent
and invisible, were nothing but a species of human creatures, perhaps raised
from among mankind, and retaining all human passions and appetites"*,
were handed over the rule and governance of natural phenomena.

    Tested by obser^'ation and reflection, these early notions failed in the long
run to satisfy the more penetrating intellects of our race. Far in the depths

of history we find men of exceptional power differentiating themselves from

 the crowd, rejecting these anthropomorphic notions, and seeking to connect
natural phenomena with their physical principles. But long prior to these
purer efforts of the understanding the merchant had been abroad, and ren-
 dered the philosopher possible; commerce had been developed, wealth
 amassed, leisure for travel and speculation secured, while races educated
 under different conditions, and therefore differently informed and endowed,
 had been stimiilated and sharpened by mutual contact. In those regions
 where the commercial aristocracy of ancient Greece mingled with its eastern
 neighboiirs, the sciences were born, being nurtui-ed and developed by free-

 thinking and courageous men. The state of things to be displaced may be
 gathered from a passage of Euripides quoted by Hume. " There is nothing

                                  * Hume, ' Natural History of Religion.'

in the world ; no glory, no prosperity. The gods toss aU into confusion

mix every thing mth its reverse, that all of us, from our ignorance and un-
certainty, may pay them the more worship and reverence." Now, as science

demands the radical extirpation of caprice and the absolute reliance upon
law in nature, there grew with the growth of scientific notions a desire and

determination to sweep from the field of theory this mob of gods and demons,
and to place natural phenomena on a basis more congruent with them-

selves.

   The problem which had been previously approached from above, was now

attacked from below ; theoretic effort passed from the super- to the sub-
sensible. It was felt that to construct the universe in idea it was necessary

--to have some notion of its constituent parts of what Lucretius subsequently

called the " First Beginnings." Abstracting again from experience, the

leaders of scientific speculation reached at length the pregnant doctrine of
atoms and molecules, the latest developments of which were set forth with

such power and clearness at the last meeting of the British Association.

Thought no doubt had long hovered about this doctrine before it at-
tained the precision and completeness which it assumed in the mind of

Democritus*, a philosopher who may well for a moment arrest our attention.
" Few great men," says Lange, a non-materialist, in his excellent ' History of
Materialism,' to the spirit and to the letter of which I am equally indebted,

" have been so despitefully used by history as Democritus. In the distorted
images sent down to us through unscientific traditions there remains of him
almost nothing but the name of ' the laughing philosopher,' while figures of
immeasurably smaller significance spread themselves out at full length before

--us." Lange speaks of Bacon's high appreciation of Democritus for ample

illustrations of which I am indebted to my excellent friend Mr. Sped-

ding, the learned editor and biographer of Bacon. It is evident, indeed,

that Bacon considered Democritus to be a man of weightier metal than
either Plato or Aristotle, though their philosophy "was noised and cele-
brated in the schools, amid the din and pomp of professors." It was not
they, but Genseric and Attila and the barbarians, who destroyed the atomic
philosophy. " For at a time when all human learning had suflered ship-

wreck, these planks of Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy, as being of a
lighter and more inflated substance, were preserved and came down to us,

 while things more solid sank and almost passed into oblivion."
    The son of a wealthy father, Democritus devoted the whole of his in-

herited fortune to the culture of his mind. He travelled everywhere ; visited

 Athens when Socrates and Plato were there, but quitted the city without
 making himself known. Indeed, the dialectic strife in which Socrates so
much delighted had no charm for Democritus, who held that "the man who
 readily conti-adicts and uses many words is unfit to learn any thing truly

 right." He is said to have discovered and educated Protagoras the sophist,

 being struck as much by the manner in which he, being a hewer of wood,
 tied up his faggots as by the sagacity of his conversation. Democritus re-
 turned poor from his travels, was supported by his brother, and at length
 wrote his great work entitled ' Diakosmos,' which he read publicly before

 the people of his native town. He was honoured by his countrymen in

 various ways, and died serenely at a great age.
    The principles enunciated by Democritus reveal his imcompromising anta-

 gonism to those who deduced the phenomena of nature from the caprices of the

--gods. They are briefly these : 1. rrom nothing comes nothing. Nothing that

exists can be destroyed. All changes are due to the combination and sepa-

ration of molecules. 2. Nothing happens by chance: Every occurrence has

its cause from which it follows by necessity. 3. The only existing things

are the atoms and empty space ; all else is mere opinion. 4. The atoms are

infinite in number, and infinitely various in form ; they strike together, and

the lateral motions and whirlings which thus arise are the beginnings of

worlds. 5. The varieties of all things depend upon the varieties of their

atoms, in number, size, and aggregation. 6. The soul consists of fine, smooth,

round atoms, like those of fire. These are the most mobile of all. They

interpenetrate the whole body, and in their motions the phenomena of life

arise. The first five propositions are a fair general statement of the atomic

philosophy, as now held. As regards the sixth, Democritus made his fine

smooth atoms do duty for the nervous system, whose functions were then

unknown. The atoms of Democritus are individually without sensation;

they combine in obedience to mechanical laws ; and not only organic forms,

but the phenomena of sensation and thought are the result of their com-

bination.

That great enigma, " the exquisite adaptation of one part of an organism

to another part, and to the conditions of life," more especially the construc-

tion of the human bodj% Democritus made no attempt to solve. Empedocles,
a man of more fiery and poetic nature, introduced the notion of love and

hate among the atoms to account for their combination and separation.

Noticing this gap in the doctrine of Democritus, he struck in with the pene-

trating thought, linked, however, with some wild speculation, that it lay in

the very nature of those combinations which were suited to their ends (in

other words, in harmony with their environment) to maintain themselves,

while unfit combinations, having no proper habitat, must rapidly disappear.
Thus more than 2000 years ago the doctrine of the " survival of the fittest,"
which in our daj', not on the basis of vague conjecture, but of positive know-

ledge, has been raised to such extraordinary significance, had received at all

events partial enunciation *.

   Epicurus t, said to be the son of a poor schoolmaster at Samos, is the

next dominant figure in the history of the atomic philosophy. He mastered

the writings of Democritus, heard lectures in Athens, went back to Samos, and

subsequently wandered through various countries. He finally returned to

Athens, where he bought a garden, and surrounded himself by pupils, in the

midst of whom lie lived a pure and serene life, and died a peaceful death.

Democritus looked to the soul as the ennobling part of man ; even beauty

without understanding partook of animalism. Ejucurus also rated the spirit

above the  body                         the  pleasure  of  the  body was  that  of  the  moment,  while
                                     ;

the spirit could draw upon the future and the past. His philosophy

was almost identical with that of Democritus; but he never quoted

either friend or foe. One main object of Epicurus was to free the world

from superstition and the fear of death. Death he treated with indifference.

It merely robs us of sensation. As long as we are, death is not ; and when
death is, we are not. Life has no more evil for him who has made up his
mind that it is no evil not to live. He adored the gods, but not in the ordi-

nary fashion. The idea of divine power, properly purified, he thought an

elevating one. Still he taught, " Not he is godless who rejects the gods of

the crowd, but rather he who accepts them." The gods were to him eternal

and immortal beings, whose Jblessedness excluded every thought of care or
occupation of any kind. Nature pursues her course in accordance with ever-
lasting laws, the gods never interfering. They haunt

"The lucid interspace of world and world
  Where never creeps a cloud or moves a wind,
  Nor ever falls the least wliite star of snow,
  Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans,
  Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar

  Their sacred everlasting calm" *.

Lange considers the relation of Epicurus to the gods subjective ; the indi-

Wecation probably of an ethical requirement of his own nature.    cannot

read history with open eyes, or study human nature to its depths, and fail

to discern such a requirement. Man never has been, and he never will

be satisfied with the operations and products of the Understanding alone

hence physical science cannot cover all the demands of his nature. But the

history of the efi'orts made to satisfy these demands might be broadly de-

--scribed as a history of errors the error in great part consisting in ascribing

fixity to that which is fluent, which varies as we vary, being gross when we are

gross, and becoming, as our capacities widen, more abstract and sublime. On

one great point the mind of Epicurus was at peace. He neither sought nor

expected, here or hereafter, any personal profit from his relation to the gods.

And it is assuredly a fact that loftiness and serenity of thought may be pro-

moted by conceptions which involve no idea of profit of this kind. " Did I

not believe,"' said a great man to me once, " that an Intelligence is at the

myheart of things,  ]ife on earth would be intolerable." The utterer of these

words is not, in my opinion, rendered less noble but more noble, by the fact

that it was the need of ethical harmony here, and not the thought of personal

profit hereafter, that prompted his observation.

There are persons, not belonging to the highest intellectual zone, nor yet

to the lowest, to whom perfect clearness of exposition suggests want of depth.

They find comfort and edification in an abstract and learned phraseology.

To some such people Epicurus, who spared no pains to rid his style of every

Hetrace of haze and turbidity, appeared, on this very account, superficial.

had, however, a disciple who thought it no unworthy occupation to spend his

days and nights in the effort to reach the clearness of his master, and to whom

the Greek philosopher is mainly indebted for the extension and perpetuation of

his fame. Some two centuries after the death of Epicurus, Lucretius t wrote
his great poem, " On the Nature of Things," in which he, a Eoman,

developed with extraordinary ardour the philosophy of his Greek prede-

cessor. He wishes to win over his friend Memnius to the school of Epi-

curus ; and although he has no rewards in a future life to offer, although his
object appears to be a purely negative one, he addresses his friend with the

heat of an apostle. His object, like that of his great forerunner, is the

destruction of superstition ; and considering that men trembled before every

natural event as a direct monition from the gods, and that everlasting

torture was also in prospect, the freedom aimed at by Lucretius might

perhaps be deemed a positive good. " This terror," he says, *' and dark-

ness of mind must be dispelled, not by the rays of the sun and glittering

shafts of day, but by the aspect and the law of nature." He refutes the

notion that any thing can come out of nothing, or that that which is

once begotten can be recalled to nothing. The first beginnings, the

atoms, are indestructible, and into them alt things can be resolved at

last. Bodies are partly atoms, and partly combinations of atoms ; but the
atoms nothing can quench. They are strong in solid singleness, and by their

denser combination, all things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring

Westrength. He denies that matter is ininnitely divisible.  come at length

to the atoms, without which, as an imperishable substratum, aU order in" the
generation and development of things would be destroyed.

The mechanical shock of the atoms being in his view the all-sufficient

cause of things, he combats the notion that the constitution of nature has

been in any way determined by intelligent design. The interaction of the
atoms throughout infinite time rendered aU manner of combinations possible.

Of these the fit ones persisted, while the unfit ones disappeared. Not after

sage deliberation did the atoms station themselves in their right places, nor

did they bargain what motions they should assume. Prom all eternity they

have been diiven together, and after trying motions and unions of every kind,

they fell at length into the arrangements out of which this system of things
has been foi'med. "If you wiU. apprehend and keep in mind these

things, nature, free at once, and rid of her haughty lords, is seen to do all
things spontaneously of herself, without the meddling of the gods "*.

   To meet the objection that his atoms cannot be seen, Lucretius de-

scribes a violent storm, and shows that the invisible particles of air

act in the same way as the visible particles of water. "We perceive,

moreover, the diflfereut smells of things, yet never see them coming to our

on the fingers, becomes thinner ; a water drop hollows out a stone ; the
ploughshare is rubbed away in the field ; the street pavement is worn by the

feet ; but the particles that disappear at any moment we cannot see. Nature

acts through invisible particles. That Lucretius had a strong scientific

Aimagination the foregoing references prove.  fine illustration of his power

iu this respect is his explanation of the apparent rest of bodies whose atoms

are in motion. He employs the image of a flock of sheep with skipping

lambs, which, seen from a distance, presents simply a white patch upon the

green hill, the jiimijing of the individual lambs being quite invisible.

His vaguely grand conception of the atoms falling eternally through space

suggested the nebular hypothesis to Kant, its first propounder. Far beyond

the limits of our visible world are to be found atoms innumerable, which have

never been united to form bodies, or which, if once united, have been again

dispersed, falling silently through immeasurable intervals of time and space.
As everywhere throughout the All the same conditions are repeated, so must
the phenomena be repeated also. Above us, below us, beside us, therefore,

are worlds without end ; and this, when considered, must dissipate every

thought of a deflection of the universe by the gods. The worlds come and
go, attracting new atoms out of limitless space, or dispersing their own

particles. -The reputed death of Lucretius, which forms the basis of Mr. Ten-

nyson's noble poem, is in strict accordance with his philosophy, which was
severe and pure.

the tirst of thein and the last, the hiiniau iutellect was active in other fields

than theirs. Pythagoras had founded a school of mathematics and made

his experiments on the harmonic intervals. The sophists had run through

their career. At Athens had appeared Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle,

who ruined the sophists, and whose yoke remains to some extent unbroken to

the present hour. Within this period also the School of Alexandria was

founded, Euclid wrote his 'Elements,' and made some advance_ in optics,

Archimedes had propounded the theory of the lever, and the principles of

liydrostatics. Astronomy was immensely enriched by the discoveries of Hippar-

chus, who was followed by the historically more celebrated Ptolemy. Ana-
tomy had been made the basis of Scientific medicine; and it is said by Draper*

that vivisection had begun. In fact the science of ancient Greece had

already cleared the world of the fantastic images of divinities operating

capriciously through natural phenomena. It had shaken itself free from that

fruitless scrutiny " by the internal light of the mind alone," which had vainly

sought to transcend experience and reach a knowledge of ultimate causes.

Instead of accidental observation, it had introduced observation with a purpose

iustruments were employed to aid the senses ; and scientific method was ren-

dered in a great measure complete by the union of Induction and Experiment.
Why"What, then, stopped its victorious advance ?
                                                  was the scientific intel-

lect compelled, like an exhausted soil, to lie fallow for nearly two millenniums

before it could regather the elements necessary to its fertility and strength ?

Eacon has akeady let us know one cause ; Whewell ascribes this stationary

period to four causes--obscurity of thought, servility, intolerance of disposition,
enthusiasm of temper ; and he gives striking examples of eachf. But these

characteristics must have had their antecedents in the circumstances of

the time. Eome, and the other cities of the Empire, had fallen into moral

putrefaction. Christianity had appeared, offering the gospel to the poor, and,

by moderation if not asceticism of life, practically protesting against the
profligacy of the age. The sufferings of the early christians and the extra-

ordinary exaltation of mind which enabled them to triumph over the dia-

bolical tortures to which they were subjected+, must have left traces not
easily effaced. They scorned the earth, in view of that " building of God,
that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." The Scriptures

which ministered to their spiritual needs were also the measure of their
Science. When, for example, the celebrated question of antipodes came to

be discussed, the Bible was with many the ultimate court of appeal. Augus-
tine, who flourished a.d. 400, would not deny the rotundity of the earth; but

he would deny the possible existence of inhabitants at the other side,
" because no such race is recorded in Scripture among the descendants of
Adam." Archbishop Boniface was shocked at the assumption of a " world

of human beings out of the reach of the means of salvation." Thus reined
in, Science was not likely to make much progress. Later on the political and

theological strife between the Church and civil governments, so powerfully

depicted by Draper, must have done much to stifle investigation.

   Whewell makes many wise and brave remarks regarding the spirit of the

Middle Ages. It Avas a menial spirit. The seekers after natural knowledge
had forsaken that fountain of living waters, the direct appeal to nature by

observation and experiment, and had given themselves up to the remanipula-

tioii of the notions of tlicir predecessors. It M"as a time when thought had
become abject, and when the acceptance of mere authority led, as it always

does in science, to intellectual death. Natural events, instead of being
traced to physical, were referred to moral causes ; while an exercise of the
phantasy, almost as degrading as the spiritualism of the present day, took the

place of scientific speculation. Then came the mysticism of the Middle Ages,
Magic, Alchemy, the Neo-platonic philosophy, with its visionary though
subhme abstractions, which caused men to look with shame upon their own

bodies as hindrances to the absorption of the creature in the blessedness of the

Creator. Finally came the Scholastic philosophy, a fusion, according to
Lange, of the least-mature notions of Aristotle with the Christianity of the
west. Intellectual immobility was the result. As a traveller without a

compass in a fog may wander long, imagining he is making way, and find

himself after hours of toil at his starting-point, so the schoolmen, haviug
tied and untied the same knots and formed and dissipated the same clouds,
found themselves at the end of centuries in their old position.

   With regard to the influence wielded by Aristotle in the Middle Ages, and
which, though to a less extent, he still wields, I would ask permission to

make one remark. When the human mind has achieved greatness and given

evidence of extraordinary power in any domain, there is a tendency to credit
it with similar power in all other domains. Thus theologians have found
comfort and assurance in the thought that Newton dealt with the question of
revelation, forgetful of the fact that the very devotion of his powers, through

all the best years of his life, to a totally different class of ideas, not to speak

of any natural disqualification, tended to render him less instead of more
competent to deal with theological and historic questions. Goethe, starting
from his established greatness as a poet, and indeed from his positive dis-
coveries in Natural History, produced a profound impression among the
painters of Germany, when he published his ' Parbcnlehre,' in whiih he
endeavoured to overthrow Newton's theory of colours. This theory he
deemed so obviously absin-d, that he considered its author a charlatan, and
attacked him with a corresponding vehemence of language. In the domain
of natural history Goethe had made really considerable discoveries ; and wc
have high authority for assuming that, had he devoted himself wholly to
that side of science, he might have reached in it an eminence comparable
with that which he attained as a poet. In sharpness of observation, irj the
detection of analogies hoAvever apparently remote, in the classification and

organization of facts according to the analogies discerned, Goethe possessed
extraordinarjr powers. These elements of scientific inquiry fall in Avith the
discipline of the poet. But, on the other hand, a mind thus richly endowed

in the direction of natural history, may be almost shorn of endowment as

regards the more strictly called physical and mechanical sciences. Goethe

was in this condition. He could not formulate distinct mechanical concep-

tions ; he could not see the force of mechanical reasoning ; and in regions
where such reasoning reigns supreme he became a mere ignis futuus to
those who followed him.

    I have sometimes permitted myself to compare Aristotle with Goethe, to
credit the Stagirite with an almost superhuman power of amassing and syste-
matizing facts, but to consider him fatally defective on that side of the mind in
respect to which incompleteness has been just ascribed to Goethe. Whewell
refers the errors of Aristotle, not to a neglect of facts, but to " a neglect of
the idea appropriate to the facts ; the idea of Mechanical cause, which is
Force, and the substitution of vague or inapplicable notions, involving only
                           ADDRESS.      Ixxiii

relations of space or emotions of wonder." This is doubtless true ; but the
word " neglect '' implies mere intellectual misdirection, whereas in Aristotle,

as in Goetlie, it was not, I believe, misdirection, but sheer natural incapacity

which lay at the root of his mistakes. As a physicist, Aristotle displayed

what we should consider some of the worst attributes of a modern physical

--investigator indistinctness of ideas, confusion of mind, and a contident use of

language, which led to the delusive notion that he had really mastered his

subject, while he had as yet failed to grasp even the elements of it. He put
words in the place of things, subject in the place of object. He preached

Induction M^thout practising it, inverting the true order of inquiry by passing

from the general to the particular, instead of from the particular to the

general. He made of the universe a closed sphere, in the centre of which he

lixed the earth, proving from general principles, to his own satisfaction and

to that of the world for near 2000 years, that no other universe was possible.

--His notions of motion were entirely unphysical. It was natural or unnatural,

better or worse, calm or violent no real mechanical conception regarding it

lying at the bottom of his mind. He affirmed that a vacuum could not exist,
and proved that if it did exist motion in it would be impossible. He deter-

mined a priori how many species of animals must exist, and shows on
general principles why animals must have such and such parts. When an

eminent contemporary philosopher, who is far removed from errors of this

kind, remembers these abuses of the a priori method, he will be able to make

allowance for the jealousy of physicists as to the acceptance of so-called

a priori truths. Aristotle's errors of detail, as shown by Eucken and Lange,

were grave and numerous. He affirmed that only in man we had the beating

of the heart, that the left side of the body was colder than the right, that
men have more teeth than women, and that there is an empty space at the

back of every man's head.

There is one essential quality in physical conceptions which was entirely

wanting in those of Aristotle and his followers. I wish it could be ex-

pressed by a word untainted by its associations ; it signifies a capability of

being placed as a coherent picture before the mind. The Germans express

the act of picturing by the word vorstellen, and the picture they call a

WeVorstelliing.  have no word in English which comes nearer to our

requirements than Imagination, and, taken with its proper limitations, the

word answers very well ; but, as just intimated, it is tainted by its associations,

and therefore objectionable to some minds. Compare, with reference to this

capacity of mental presentation, the case of the Aristotelian, who refers the
ascent of water in a pump to Nature's abhorrence of a vaciium, with that of
Pascal when he proposed to solve the question of atmospheric pressure by the
ascent of the Puy de Dome. In the one case the terms of the explanation

refuse to fall into place as a physical image ; in the other the image is di-
stinct, the fall and rise of the barometer being clearly figured as the balancing

of two varying and opposing pressiires.

During the drought of the Middle Ages in Christendom, the Arabian intel-

lect, as forcibly shown by Draper, was active. With the intrusion of the Moors

into Spain, he says, order, learning, and refinement took the place of their

opposites. When smitten with disease, the Christian peasant resorted to a

shrine, the Moorish one to an instructed physician. The Arabs encouraged

translations from the Greek philosophers, but not from the Greek poets.
They turned in disgust " from the lewdness of our classical mythology, and

denounced as an unpardonable blasphemy all connexion between the impure

Olympian Jove and the Most High God." Draper traces still further than

"Whewell the Arab elements iu our scientific terms, and points out that the

uuder garment of ladies retains to this hour its Arab name. He gives examples
of what Arabian men of science accomplished, dwelling particularly on Alhazen,

who was the first to correct the Platonic notion that rays of light are emitted
by the eye. He discovered atmospheric refraction, and points out that we
see the sun and the moon after they have set. He explains the enlargement of

the sun and moon, and the shortening of the vertical diameters of both

these bodies, when near the horizon. He is aware that the atmosphere

decreases in density with increase of elevation, and actually fixes its height at
581 miles. In the Book of the Balance Wisdom, he sets forth the connexion

between the weight of the atmosphere and its increasing density. He shows

that a body^ will weigh differently in a rare and dense atmosphere : he

considers the force with which plunged bodies rise through heavier media.

He understands the doctrine of the centre of gravity, and applies it to the inves-
tigation of balances and steelyards. He recognizes gravity as a force, though he

falls into the error of making it diminish simply as the distance increased, and of

making it purely terrestrial. He knows the relation between the velocities,

spaces, and times of falling bodies, and has distinct ideas of capillary attrac-

tion. He improved the hydrometer. The determination of the densities of

bodies as given by Alhazen approach very closely to our own. " I join,"
says Draper, in the pious prayer of Alhazen, " that in the day of judgment
the All-Merciful will take pity on the soul of Abur-Eaihan, because he was

the first of the race of men to construct a table of specific gravities." If all
this be historic truth (and I have entire confidence in Dr. Draper), well may
he " deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe has
contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the Mahomme-

duns"*. .
   The strain upon the mind during the stationary period towards ultra-

terrestrial things to the neglect of problems close at hand, was sure to
provoke reaction. But the reaction was gradual ; for the ground was

dangerous, a power being at hand competent to crush the critic who went too

far. To elude this power and still allow opportunity for the expression of
opinion, the doctrine of " twofold truth" was invented, according to which an
opinion might be held " theologically," and the opposite opinion " philoso-

phically" t. Thus, in the thirteenth century, the creation of the world in six
days, and the unchangeableness of the individual soul, which had been so di-
stinctly affirmed by St. Thomas Aquinas, were both denied philosophically,

but admitted to be true as articles of the Catholic faith. When Protagoras
uttered the maxim which brought upon him so much vituperation, that

" opposite assertions are equally true," he simply meant that human beings
differed so much from each other that what was subjectively true to the one
might be subjectively untrue to the other. The great Sophist never meant
to play fast and loose with the truth by saying that one of Iavo opposite
assertions, made by the same individual, could possibly escape being a lie.

It was not " sophistry," but the dread of theologic vengeance that generated
this double dealing with conviction ; and it is astonishing to notice what

lengths were possible to men who were adroit in the use of artifices of this

kind.

   Towards the close of the stationary period a word-weariness, if I may so

express it, took more and more possession of men's minds. Christendom had
become sick of the School philosophy and its verbal wastes, which led to no

issue, but left the intellect in everlasting haze. Here and there was heard
the voice of one impatiently crying in the wilderness, " Not unto Aristotle,

not unto subtle hypothesis, not unto church, bible, or blind tradition, must

wc turn for a knowledge of the universe, but to the direct investigation of
nature by observation and experiment.'' In 1543 the epoch-making work
of Copernicus on the paths of the heavenly bodies appeared. The total

crash of Aristotle's closed universe with the earth at its centre followed as

a consequence ; and " the earth moves " became a kind of watchword among
intellectual freemen. Copernicus was Canon of the church of Frauenburg
in the diocese of Ermeland. Por three-and- thirty years he had withdrawn

himself from the world and devoted himself to the consolidation of his great

scheme of the solar system. He made its blocks eternal ; and even to those
who feared it and desired its overthrow it was so obviously strong that

they refrained for a time from meddling with it. In the last year of the life

of Copernicus his book appeared : it is said that the old man received a copy

of it a few days before his death, and then departed in peace.
    The Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno was one of the earliest converts

to the new astronomy. Taking Lucretius as his exemplar, he revived the

notion of the infinity of worlds; and combining with it the doctrine of

Copernicus, reached the sublime generalization that the fixed stars are suns,
scattered numberless through space and accompanied by satellites, which bear

the same relation to them that our earth does to our sun, or our moon to our
earth. This was an expansion of transcendent import ; but Bruno came closer

than this to our present line of thought. Struck with the problem of the gene-
ration and maintenance of organisms, and duly pondering it, he came to

the conclusion that Nature in her productions does not imitate the technic

of man. Her process is one of unravelling and unfolding. The infinity of
forms under which matter appears were not imposed i;pon it by an external
artificer ; by its own intrinsic force and vii'tue it brings these forms forth.
Matter is not the mere naked, empty capacity which philosophers have
pictured her to be, but the universal mother, who brings forth all things as
the fruit of her own womb.

   This outspoken man was originally a Dominican monk. He was accused

of heresy and had to fly, seeking refuge in Geneva, Paris, England, and Ger-

many. In 1592 he feU into the hands of the Inquisition at Venice. He
was imprisoned for many years, tried, degraded, excommunicated, and handed

over to the Civil power, with the request that he should be treated gently and
" without the shedding of blood." This meant that he was to be burnt; and
burnt accordingly he was, on the 16th of Febniary, 1600. To escape a
similar fate Galileo, 3-3 years afterwards, abjured, upon his knees and Avith

his hand upon the holy gospels, the hehoceutric doctrine which he knew to be
true. After Galileo came Kepler, who from his German home defied the
power beyond the Alps. He traced out from preexisting observations the
laws of planetary motion. Materials were thus prepared for Newton, who

bound those empirical laws together by the principle of gra-sdtation.
    In the seventeenth century Bacon and Descartes, the restorers of philo-

sophy, appeared in succession. Diff'erently educated and endowed, their
philosophic tendencies were different. Bacon held fast to Induction, be-
lieving firmly in the existence of an external world, and making collected
experiences the basis of all knowledge. The mathematical studies of Des-
cartes gave him a bias towards Deduction ; and his fundamental principle

was much the same as that of Protagoras, who made the individual man the

measure of aU things. " I think, therefore, I am," said Descartes. Only
Ixxvi  --REPORT 1874.

his own identity was sure to him ; and the development of this system would

have led to an idealism in which the outer world would be resolved into a
mere phenomenon of consciousness. Gassendi, one of Descartes's contem-

poraries, of whom we shall hear more presently, quickly pointed out that the

fact of personal existence would be proved as well by reference to any other

act as to the act of thinkiug. I eat, therefore I am ; or I love, therefore I

am, would be quite as conclusive. Lichteuberg showed that the very thing
to' be proved was inevitably postulated in the first two words, " I think ;" aud
that no inference from the postulate could by any possibility be stronger

than the postulate itself.
   But Descartes deviated strangely from the idealism impHed in his funda-

mental principle. He was the first to reduce, in a manner eminently capable

of bearing the test of mental presentation, vital phenomena to purely mecha-
nical principles. Through fear or love, Descartes was a good churchman ; he
accordingly rejects the notions of an atom, because it was absurd to suppose
that God, if he so pleased, could not divide an atom ; he puts in the place
of the atoms small round particles and light splinters, out of which he builds

the organism. He sketches with marvellous physical insight a machine, with
water for its motive power, which shall illustrate vital actions. He has made

clear to his mind that such a machine would be competent to carry on the
processes of digestion, nutrition, growth, respiration, and the beating of
the heart. It would be competent to accept impressions from the external
sense, to store them up in imagination and memory, to go through the internal
movements of the appetites and passions, the external movement of limbs.

He deduces these functions of his machine from the mere arrangement of

its organs, as the movement of a clock or other automaton is deduced from

its weights aud wheels. "As far as these functions are concerned," he

says, " It is not necessary to conceive any other vegetative or sensitive soul,
nor any other principle of motion or of life, than the blood and the spirits
agitated by the fire which burns continually in the heart, and which is in

nowise different from the fires which exist in inanimate bodies. Had Des-

cartes been acquainted with the steam-engine, he would have taken it, instead
of a fall of water, as his motive power, and shown the perfect analogy whicli
exists between the oxidation of the food in the body and that of the coal in

the furnace. He would assuredly have anticipated Mayer in calling the

blood which the heart diffuses, " the oil of the lamp of life ;" deducing all

 animal motions from the combustion of this oil, as the motions of a steam-

engine are deduced from the combustion of its coals. As the matter stands,

however, and considering the circumstances of the time, the boldness, clear-
ness, aud precision with which he grasped the problem of vital dynamics

constitute a marvellous illustration of intellectual power*.
    During the Middle Ages the doctrine of atoms had to all appearance

vanished from discussion. In all probability it held its ground among sober-
minded and thoughtful men, though neither the church nor the world was

prepared to hear of it with tolerance. Once, in the year 1348, it received
distinct expression. But retraction by compulsion immediately followed

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and thus discouraged, it slumbered till the 17th century, when it was revived
by a contemporary and friend of Hobbes of Malmesbury, the orthodox
Cathohc provost of Digne, Gassendi. But before stating his relation to the

Epicurian doctrine, it will be well to say a few words on the effect, as regards
 science, of the general introduction of monotheism among European nations.

" Were nio╗," says Hume, " led into the apprehension of invisible intelli-

gent power by contemplation of the works of Nature, they could never possibly

entertain any conception but of one single being, who bestowed existence and

order on this vast machine, and adjusted all its parts to one regular system."

Referring to the condition of the heathen, who sees a god behind every

natural event, thus peopling the world with thousands of beings whose caprices

are incalculable, Lange shows the impossibility of any compromise between

such notions and those of science, which proceeds on the assumption of never-

changing law and causality. "But," he continues, with characteristic

penetration, " when the great thought of one God, acting as a unit upon the

universe, has been seized, the connexion of things in accordance with the law

of cause and effect is not only thinkable, but it is a necessary consequence

of the assumption. For when I see ten thousand wheels in motion, and

know, or believe, that they are all driven by one, then I know that I have
befoi-e me a mechanism, the action of every part of which is determined by

the plan of the whole. So much being assumed, it follows that I may inves-

tigate the structure of that machine, and the various motions of its parts.

For the time being, therefore, this conception renders scientific action free."

In other words, were a capricious God at, the circumference of every wheel

and at the end of every lever, the action of the machine would be incalculable

by the methods of science. But tlie action of all its parts being rigidly

determined by their connexions and relations, and these being brought into

play by a single self-acting driving wheel, then, though this last prime mover

may elude me, amI still able to comprehend the machinery which it sets

in motion. AVe have here a conception of the relation of Nature to its

Author, which seems perfectly acceptable to some minds, but perfectly

intolerable to others. Newton and Boyle lived and worked happily under

the influence of this conception ; Goethe rejected it with vehemence, and the

same repugnance to accepting it is manifest in Carlyle*.

The analytic and synthetic tendencies of the human mind exhibit them-

selves throughout history, great writers ranging themselves sometimes on the

one side, sometimes on the other. Men of warm feelings, and minds open to

the elevating impressions produced by nature as a whole, whose satisfaction,

therefore, is rather ethical than logical, lean to the synthetic side ; while

the analytic harmonizes best with the more precise and more mechanical

bias which seeks the satisfaction of the understanding. Some form of pan-

theism was usually adopted by the one, while a detached Creator, working

more or less after the manner of men, was often assumed by the other.

Gassendi, as sketched by Lange, is hardly to be ranked with either. Having

formally acknowledged God as the great first cause, he immediately dropped

the idea, applied the known laws of mechanics to the atoms, deducing

thence all \-ital phenomena. He defended Epicurus, and dwelt upon his

purity, both of doctrine and of life. True he was a heathen, but so was

did not know the true religion. He thought that the gods neither rewarded

nor punished, and adored them purely in consequence of their completeness

the slave. The errors of Epicurus shall be corrected, the body of his truth

Goethe, on the other hand, sang

                           " Ihm ziemt's die Welt im Innern zu bewegen,

                                  Natur in sich, sich in Natur zu hegen."

retained ; and then Gassendi proceeds, as any heathen might do, to build up

the world, and all that therein is, of atoms and molecules. God, who

created earth and water, plants and animals, produced in the first place
a definite number of atoms, which constituted the seed of all things.
Then began that series of combinations and decompositions which goes on
at present, and which wUl continue in future. The principle of every
change resides in matter. In artificial productions the moving principle
is different from the material worked upon ; but in nature the agent
woi-ks within, being the most active and mobile part of the material
itself. Thus this bold ecclesiastic, without incurring the censure of the
church or the world, contrives to outstrip Mr. Darwin. The same cast of
mind which caused him to detach the Creator from his universe led him also
to detach the soul from the body, though to the body he ascribes an influ-
ence so large as to render the soul almost unnecessary. The aberrations of
reason were in his view an affair of the material brain. Mental disease is
brain-disease but then the immortal reason sits apart, and cannot be

touched by the disease. Q'he errors of madness are errors of the instru-

ment, not of the performer.

   It may be more than a mere result of education, connecting itself probably

with the deeper mental structure of the two men, that the idea of Gassendi,
above enunciated, is substantially the same as that expressed by Professor
Clerk Maxwell at the close of the very able lecture delivered by him at
Bradford last year. According to both philosophers, the atoms, if I imder-
stand aright, are fre-pand materials, which, formed by the skill of the Highest,
produce by their subsequent interaction all the phenomena of the material
world. There seems to be this difference, however, between Gassendi and
Maxwell. The one 2^ostulatcs, the other inferx his first cause. In his
" manufactured articles," as he calls the atoms. Professor Maxwell finds the
basis of an induction, which enables him to scale philosophic heights con-
sidered inaccessible by Kant, and to take the logical step from the atoms to

their Maker.
    Accepting here the leadership of Kant, I doubt the legitimacy of Maxwell's

logic ; but it is impossible not to feel the ethic glow with which his lecture
concludes. There is, moreover, a very noble strain of eloquence in his de-

--scription of the stedfastness of the atoms : " Natural causes, as we know,

are at work, which tend to modify, if they do not at length destroy, all the
arrangements and dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. But

though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur
in the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems

evolved out of their ruins, the molecules out of which these systems are

-- --built the foundation stones of the material universe remain unbroken and

unworn."
    The atomic doctrine, in whole or in part, was entertained by Bacon,

Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Newton, Boyle, and their successors, until the
chemical law of multiple proportions enabled Dalton to confer upon it an

entirely new significance. In our day there are secessions from the theory,
but it still stands firm. Loschmidt, Stoney, and Sir William Thomson

have sought to determine the sizes of the atoms, or rather to fix the
limits between which their sizes lie ; while only last year the discourses of
Williamson and Maxwell illustrate the present hold of the doctrine upon

the foremost scientific minds. In fact, it may be doubted whether, wanting

 this fundamental conception, a theory of the material universe is capable of

scientific statement.

.

   Ninety years subsequent to Gassendi the doctrine of bodily instruments,

as it may be called, assumed immense importance in the hands of Bishop

Butler, who, in his famous ' Analogy of Eeligion,' developed, from his own

point of view, and with consummate sagacity, a similar idea. The Bishop

still influences superior minds ; and it will repay us to dwell for a moment on

his views. He draws the sharpest distinction between our real selves and our
bodily instruments. He does not, as far as I remember, use the word soul,

possibly because the term was so hackneyed in his day as it had been for many

generations previously. But he speaks of "living powers," "perceiving"

or "percipient powers," "moving agents," "ourselves," in the same sense

as we should employ the term soul. He dwells upon the fact that limbs
may be removed, and mortal diseases assail the body, the mind, almost
up to the moment of death, remaining clear. He refers to sleep and to swoon,
where the " living powers " are suspended but not destroyed. He considers

it quite as easy to conceive of existence out of our bodies as in them ; that

we may animate a succession of bodies, the dissolution of all of them having

-- --no more tendency to dissolve our real selves, or " deprive us of living faculties
    the faculties of perception and action than the dissolution of any foreign

matter which we are capable of receiving impressions from, or making use of
for the common occasions of life." This is the key of the Bishop's position
" our organized bodies are no more a part of ourselves than any other matter

around us." In proof of this he calls attention to the use of glasses, which
" prepare objects " for the " percipient power " exactly as the eye does. The

eye itself is no more percipient than the glass, is quite as much the in-

strument of the true self, and also as foreign to the true self, as the glass is.

" And if we see with our eyes only in the same manner as we do with
glasses, the like may justly be concluded from analogy of all our senses."

Lucretius, as you are aware, reached  a precisely opposite conclusion                                                                                            and
                                                                                                                                                              ;

it certainly would be interesting, if not profitable, to us all, to hear what he

would or could urge in opposition to the reasoning of the Bishop. As a brief

discussion of the point will enable us to see the bearings of an important

question, I will here permi-t a disciple of Lucretius to try the strength of
the Bishop's position, and then allow the Bishop to retaliate, with the view of
rolling back, if he can, the difficulty upon Lucretius.

The argument might proceed in this fashion :

    "Subjected to the test of mental -pvesentation (VorstcUmig) your views,

most honoured prelate, would present to many minds a great, if not an in-
superable difficvdty. Ton speak of 'living powers,' 'percipient or perceiving

powers,' and ' ourselves ;' but can you form a mental picture of any one of these

apart from the organism through which it is supposed to act ? Test yourself
honestly, and see whether you possess any faculty that would enable you to
form such a conception. The true self has a local habitation in each of us

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

thus localized, must it not possess a form ? If so, what form ? Have you

ever for a moment realized it? When a leg is amputated the body is

divided into two parts ; is the true self in both of them or in one ? Thomas
Aquinas might say in both ; but not you, for you appeal to the conscious-

ness associated with one of the two parts to prove that the other is forei"n

matter. Is consciousness, then, a necessary element of the true self? If

so, what do you say to the case of the whole body being deprived of con-
sciousness ? If not, then on what grounds do you deny any portion of the

true self to the severed limb? It seems very singular that, from the
beginning to the end of your admirable book (and no one admires its
sober strength more than I do), you never once mention the brain or

nervous system. You begin at one end of the body, and show that its
parts may be removed without prejudice to the perceiving power. What

if j'ou begin at the other end, and remove, instead of the leg, the brain?

The body, as before, is divided into two parts; but both are now in the

same predicament, and neither can be appealed to to prove that the other

is foreign matter. Or, instead of going so far as to remove the brain
itself, let a certain portion of its bony covering be removed, and let a

rhythmic series of pressures and relaxations of pressure be applied to the

soft substance. At every pressure ' the faculties of perception and of ac-
tion,' vanish ; at every relaxation of pressure they are restored. Where,
during the intervals of pressure, is the perceiving power? I once

had the discharge of a large Leyden battery passed unexpectedly through

me : I felt nothing, but was simply blotted out of conscious existence
for a sensible interval. Where was my true self during that interval?

Men who have recovered from lightning-stroke have been much longer

in the same state ; and indeed in cases of ordinary concussion of the

brain, days may elapse during which no experience is registered in con-
sciousness. Where is the man himself during the period of insensibility ?
You may say that I beg the question when I assume the man to have been

unconscious, that he was really conscious all the time, and has simply for-

gotten what had occurred to him. In reply to this, I can only say that no

one need shrink from the worst tortures that superstition ever invented if only

so felt and so remembered. I do not think your theory of instruments goes

Aat all to the bottom of the matter. telegraph-operator has his instruments,

by means of which he converses with the Avorld ; our bodies possess a ner-
vous system, which plays a similar part between the perceiving power

and external things. Cut the wires of the operator, break his battery, de-

magnetize his needle : by this means you certainly sever his connexion with

the world ; but inasmuch as these are real iustrumcnts, their destruction does

not touch the man who uses them. The operator sui'vives, and hcl-nows that
he survives. What is it, I would ask, in the human system that answers to this
conscious survival of the operator when the battery of the brain is so dis-
turbed as to produce insensibility, or when it is destroyed altogether?

   "Another consideration, which you may consider slight, presses upon me with

some force. The brain may change from health to disease, and through such

a change the most exemplary man may be converted into a debauchee or a

Mymurderer.  very noble and approved good mastei' had, as j'ou know,

threatenings of lewdness introduced into his brain by his jealous wife's philter

and sooner than permit himself to run even the risk of yielding to these base

promptings he slew himself. How could the hand of Lucretius have been

thus turned against himself if the real Lucretius remained as before ? Can
the brain or can it not act in this distempered way without the intervention

of the immortal reason ? If it can, then it is a prime mover which requires

only healthy regulation to render it reasonably self-acting, and there is no

apparent need of your immortal reason at all. If it cannot, then the im-

mortal reason, by its mischievous activity in operating upon a broken instru-

ment, must have the credit of committing every imaginable extravagance and

crime. I think, if you will allow me to say so, that the gravest consequences

are likely to flow from your estimate of the body. To regard the brain

--exercise have a perfectly transcendental value and significance to forget

all tills does, I think, open a way to innumerable errors in our habits of

life, iind may possibly in some cases initiate and foster that very disease, and

consequent mental ruin, which a wiser ajipreciation of this mysterious organ

would have avoided."

I can imagine the Bishop thoughtful after hearing this argument. He was

not the man to allow anger to mingle with the consideration of a point of

tills kind. After due reflection, and having sti'engthened himself by that

honest contemplation of the facts which was habitual with him, and which

--includes the desire to give even adverse facts their duo weight, I can

suppose the Bishop to proceed thus : " You will remember that in the

' Analogy of Religion,' of which you have so kindly spoken, I did not profess

to prove any thing absolutely, and that I over and over again acknowledged

and insisted on the smallness of our knowledge, or rather the depth of our

Myignorance, as regards the whole system of the universe.       object was

to show my deistieal friends, who set forth so eloquently the beauty and

beneficence of Nature and the Euler thereof, while they had nothing but

scorn for the so-called absurdities of the Christian scheme, that they were

in no better condition than we were, and that, for every difficulty found upon

our side, quite as great a difficulty was to be found upon theirs. I will now
with your permission adopt a similar line of argument. You are a Lucrctian,

and from the combination and separation of insensate atoms deduce all ter-

restrial things, including organic forms and their phenomena. Let me tell
you in the first instance how far I am prepared to go with you. I admit that

you can build crystalline forms out of this play of molecular force ; that the

diamond, amethyst, and snow-star are truly wonderful striictures which are

thus produced. I will go further and acknowledge that even a tree or flower

might in this way be organized. Nay, if you can show me an animal without

sensation, I will concede to you that it also might be put together by the suit-

able play of molecular force.

   " Thus far our way is clear, but now comes my difficulty. Your atoms

ai'e individually without sensation, much more are they without intelligence.

May I ask you, then, to try j-our hand upon this problem. Take your dead

hydrogen atoms, your dead oxygen atoms, your dead carbon atoms, your dead

nitrogen atoms, your dead phosphorus atom?, and all the other atoms,

dead as grains of shot, of which the brain is formed. Imagine them separate

and sensationless ; observe them running together and forming all imaginable

combinations. This, as a jiurely mechanical process, is secahle by the mind.

But can you see, or dream, or in any way imagine, how out of that mecha-

nical act, and from these individually dead atoms, sensation, thought, and

emotion are to arise? Are you likely to extract Homer out of the rattling

of dice, or the Differential Calculus out of the clash of billiard-balls?

I am not all bereft of this Vorsfelluiif/s-Knift of which you speak, nor am I,
like so many of my brethren, a mere vacuum as regards scientific know-

lodge. I can follow a particle of musk until it reaches the olfactory

nerve ; I can follow the waves of sound until their tremors reach tho

water  of the  labyrinth, and set  tho  otoliths  and  Corti's  fibres in  motion

I can also visualize the waves of ether as they cross the 03-0 and hit the retina.

Nay more, I am able to pursue to the central organ the motion thus im-

parted at the periphery, and to see in idea the very molecules of the brain thrown

can be derived. You may say, or think, that this issue of consciousness

from the clash of atoms is not more incongruous than the flash of light
from the union of oxygen and hydrogen. But I beg to say that it is.

For such incongruity as the flash possesses is that which I now force

upDn your attention. The flash is an aff'air of consciousness, the objec-
tive counterpart of -which is a vibration. It is a flash only by your
interpretation. You are the cause of the apparent incongruity; and i/on are
the thing that puzzles me. I need not remind you that the great Leibnitz
felt the difficulty which I feel, and that to get rid of this monstrous deduc-
tion of life from death he displaced your atoms by his monads, which were
more or less perfect mirrors of the universe, and out of the summation and

--integration of which he supposed all the phenomena of life sentient, in-

--tellectual, and emotional to arise.

    '* Your difiicnlty, then, as I see you are ready to admit, is quite as great as
mine. You cannot satisfy the human understanding in its demand for logical
continuity between molecular processes and the phenomena of conscious-
ness. This is a rock on which materialism must inevitably split whenever it

pretends to be a complete philosophy of life. What is the moral, my Lucretian?

You and I are not likely to indulge in ill-temper in the discussion of these
great topics, where we see so much room for honest diff'erences of opinion.

But there are people of less wit, or more bigotry (I say it with humility)
on both sides, who are ever ready to mingle anger and vituperation with such
discussions. There are, for example, writers of note and influence at tlic

present day who are not ashamed to assume the ' deep personal sin ' of a
great logician to be the cause of his unbelief in a thcologic dogma. And
there are others who hold that we, who cherish our noble Bible, wrought as

it has been into the constitution of our forefathers, and by inheritance into
us, must necessarily be hypocritical and insincere. Let us disavow and dis-
countenance such people, cherishing the unswerving faith that what is good
and true in both our arguments will be preserved for the benefit of humanity,
while all that is bad or false will disappear."

    I hold the Bishop's reasoning to be unanswerable, and his liberality to be
worthy of imitation.

    It is worth remarking that in one respect the Bishop was a product of
his age. Long previous to his day the nature of the soul had been so
favourite and general a topic of discussion, that, when the students of the
Italian Universities wished to know the leanings of a new Professor, they
at once requested him to lecture upon the soul. Aboiit the time of Bishop
Butler the question was not only agitated but extended. It was seen by

the clear-witted men who entered this arena that many of their best

arguments applied equally to brutes and men. The Bishop's arguments

were of this character. He saw it, admitted it, accepted the conse-

quences, and boldly embraced the whole animal world in his scheme of im-

mortality.

   Bishop Butler accepted with unwavering trust the chronology of the Old
Testament, describing it as " confirmed by the natural and civil history of

the world, collected from common historians, from the state of the earth, and
from the late inventions of arts and sciences." These words mark progress
and they must seem somewhat hoary to the Bishop's successors of to-day*.

It is hardly necessary to inform you tliat since his time the domain of the

naturalist has been immensely extended--the whole science of geology, with

its astounding revelations regarding the life of the ancient earth, having been

mmdcreated. The rigidity of old conceptions has been relaxed, the public

being rendered gradually tolerant of the idea that not for six thousand, nor

for sixty thousand, nor for six thousand thousand thousand, but for aeons em-

In-acing untold millions of years, this earth has been the theatre of life and

death. The riddle of the rocks has been read by the geologist and palaeon-

tologist, from subeambrian depths to the deposits thickening over the sea-

bottoms of to-day. And upon the leaves of that stone book are, as you know,
mkstamped the characters, plainer and surer than those formed by the
                                                                                      of

history, which carry the mind back into abysses of past time compared with

Avhich the periods which satisfied Bishop Butler cease to have a visual angle.

The lode of discovery once struck, those petrified forms in which life was at

one time active, increased to multitudes and demanded classification. They

were  grouped  in genera, species, and  varieties,  according to  the degree          of

                                                                                   ^

similarity subsisting between them. Thus confusion was avoided, each

object being found in the pigeon-hole appropriated to it and to its fellows of

similar morphological or pliysiological character. The general fact soon

became evident that none but the simplest forms of life lie lowest down, that

as we cHmb higher among the superimposed strata more perfect forms

appear. The change, however, from form to form was not continuous, but
-- "Aby steps some small, some great.   section," says Mr. Huxley, "a

hundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen species of Am-

monite, none of which passes beyond its particular zone of limestone, or clay,

into the zone below it, or into that above it." In the presence of such facts

it was not possible to avoid the question :--Have these forms, showing,
though in broken stages and with many irregularities, this unmistakable

general advance, been subjected to no continuous law of growth or variation?

Had our education been purely scientific, or had it been sufficiently de-

tached from influences which, however ennobhng in another domain, have

always proved hindrances and delusions when introduced as factors into
the domain of physics, the scientific mind never could have swerved from the

search for a law of growth, or allowed itself to accept the anthropomorphism
which regarded each successive stratum as a kind of mechanic's bench for

the manufacture of new species out of all relation to the old.'

   Biased, however, by their previous education, the great majority of
naturalists invoked a special creative act to account for the appearance

of each new group of organisms. Doubtless there were_ numbers who

were clear-headed enough to see that this was no explanation at all, that

in point of fact it was an attempt, by the introduction of a greater
difficulty, to account for a less. But having nothing to offer in the

way of explanation, they for the most part held their peace. Still the
thoughts of reflecting men naturally and necessarily simmered round the

question. De Maillot, a contemporary of JS^ewton, has been brought into
notice by Professor Huxley as one who " had a notion of the modifia,bility of
living forms." In my frequent conversations with him, the late bir Bcn-

iamiu Brodie, a man of highly pliilosophic mind, often drew my atten-

tion to the fact that, as early as 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather was the

pioneer of Charles Darwin*. In 1801, and in subsequent years, the ctlc-

bratcd Lamarclc, who ]n-oduced so profound an impression on the public mind

through the vigorous exposition of his views by the author of the * Vestlgea
of Creation,' endeavoured to show the develoiiment of s^jecies out of changes
of habit and external condition. In 1813 Dr. Wells, the founder of our

present theory of Dew, read before the Itoyal Society a paper in which, to
use the words of Mr. Darwin, " he distinctly recognizes the principle of

natural selection ; and this is the first recognition that has been indicated."
The thoroughness and skill with which Wells pursued his work, and the
obvious independence of his character, rendered him long ago a favourite

with me ; and it gave me the liveliest pleasure to aliglit upon this additional
testimony to his penetration. Professor Grant, Mr. Patrick Matthew, Von

Buch, the author of the ' Vestiges,' D'llalloy, and others*, by the enunciation
of opinions more or less clear and correct, showed that the question had been

fermenting long prior to the year 18.58, when Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace
simultaneously but independently placed their closely concurrent views upon

the subject before the Linnean Society.

    These papers were followed in 1859 by the publicatioi\ of the first edition
of * The Origin of Species.' All great things come slowly to the birth. Coper-

nicus, as I informed you, pondered his great work for thirty-three years. New-
ton for nearly twenty years kept the idea of Gravitation before his mind ; for

twenty years also he dwelt upon his discovery of Fluxions, and doubtless would
have continued to makeit tlie object of his private thought had lie not found that
Leibnitz was upon his track. Darwin for two and twenty years pondered the
problem of the origin of species, and doubtless he would have continued to do so

Ahad he not found Wallace upon his track t. concentrated, but full and power-

ful epitome of his labours was the consequence. The book was by no means an
easy one ; and probably not one in every score of those who then attacked it had
read its pages through, or were competent to grasp their significance if they
had. I do not say this merely to discredit them ; for there were in those
days some really eminent scientific men, entirely raised above the heat of
popular prejudice, willing to accept any conclusion that science had to offer,
provided it was duly backed by fact and argument, and who entirely mistook
Mr. Darwin's views. In fact the work needed an expounder; and it
found one in Mr. Huxley, I know nothing more admirable in the way of

scientific exposition than those early articles of his on tlic origin of species.

He swept the curve of discussion through the really significant points of tlie

subject, enriched his exposition with profound original remarks and
reflections, often summing u]) in a single pithy sentence an argument which
a less compact mind would have spread over pages. But there is one
impression made by the book itself which no exposition of it, however
luminous, can convey ; and that is the impression of tlie vast amount of
labour, both of observation and of thought, implied in its production. Let
us glance at its principles.

    It is conceded on all hands that what are called varieties are continually

produced. The rule is probably without exception. No chick and no child

is in all respects and particulars the counterpart of its brother and sister

and in such differences we have " variety " incipient. No naturalist could tell
how far this variation could be carried ; but the great mass of them held that

never by any amount of internal or external change, nor by the mixture of both,

   * In 1855 Mr. Herbert Spencer (' Principles of Psycliologv,' 2nd edit. vol. i. p. 405)
expressed " the belief that life under all its forms has arisen bV an unbroken evolution,
and through the instrumentality of what are cnlled natural causes."

   t The behaviour of Mr. Wallace in relation to this subject has been dignified in the

highest degree.
ADDRESS.  IXXXV

could the offspring of the same progenitor so far deviate from each other as to
constitute different species. The function of the experimental philosopher is
to combine the conditions of nature and to produce her results ; and this

was the method of Darwin*. He made himself acquainted with what could,
without any manner of doubt, be done in the way of producing variation.

--He associated himself with pigeon-fanciers bought, begged, kept, and

observed every breed that he could obtain. Though derived from a
common stock, the diversities of these pigeons were such that " a
score of them might be chosen which, if sho'wn to an ornithologist,
and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly be ranked
by him as well-defined species." The simple principle which guides
the pigeon-fancier, as it does the cattle-breeder, is the selection of some
variety that strikes his fancy, and the propagation of this variety by
inheritance. With his eye still directed to the particular appearance
which he wishes to exaggerate, he selects it as it reappears in succes-

sive broods, and thus adds increment to increment until an astonish-
ing amount of divergence from the parent type is effected. The breeder

in this case does not produce the dements of the variation. He simply

observes them, and by selection adds them together until the required

result has been obtained. " No man," says Mr. Darwin, " would ever
try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some

slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter until ho saw a pigeon

with a crop of itnusual size." Thus nature gives the hint, man acts

upon it, and by the law of inheritance exaggerates the deviation.
   Having thus satisfied himself by indubitable facts that the organi-

zation of an animal or of a plant (for precisely the sonic treatment applies to
plants) is to seme extent plastic, he passes from variation under domesti-

cation to variation under nature. Hitherto we have dealt with the adding

together of small changes by the conscious selection of man. Can Nature
thus select? Mr. Darwin's answer is, "Assuredly she can." The number
of living things produced is far in excess of the number that can be sup-
ported ; hence at some period or other of their lives there must be a struggle
for existence ; and what is the infallible result ? If one organism were
a perfect copy of the other in regard to strength, skill, and agility, external

conditions would decide. But this is not the case. Here we have the

fact of variety offering itself to nature, as in the former instance it offered

itself to man ; and those varieties which are least competent to cope with
surrounding conditions will infallibly give way to those that are most com-

petent. To use a familiar proverb, the weakest comes to the wall. But the
triumphant fraction again breeds to overproduction, transmitting the qualities
which secured its maintenance, but transmitting them in different degrees.

The struggle for food again supervenes, and those to whom the favourable

quality has been transmitted in excess will assuredly triumph. It is

easy to see that we have here the addition of increments favourable to

the individual still more rigorously carried out than in the case of
domestication ; for not only are unfavourable specimens not selected by
nature, but they are destroyed. This is what Mr. Darwin calls "Natural
Selection," which " acts by the preservation and accumulation of small
inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being." "With this
idea he interpenetrates and leavens the vast store of facts that he and others

    * The first step only towards experimental demonstration has been taken. Expeii-
 ments now begun might, a couple of centuries hence, furnish data of incalculable value,
 which ought to be supplied to the science of the future.

Wehave collected.  cannot, without shutting our eyes through fear or pre-

judice, faU to sec that Darwin is here dealing, not with imaginary, but

with true causes ; nor can we faU to discern what vast modifications may be

produced by natural selection in periods sufficiently long. Each individual

increment may resemble what mathematicians call a " differential " (a quan-

tity indefinitely small) ; but definite and great changes may obviously be pro-

duced by the integration of these infinitesimal quantities through practically

infinite time.

   If Darwin, like Bruno, rejects the notion of creative power acting after

human fashion, it certainly is not because he is unacquainted with the num-

berless exquisite adaptations on which this notion of a supernatural artificer

has been founded. His ]jook is a repository of the most startling facts of
this description. Take the marvellous observation which he cites from Dr.
Criiger, where a bucket with an aperture, serving as a spout, is formed in
an orchid. Bees visit the flower : in eager search of material for their combs
they push each other into the bucket, the drenched ones escaping from their

involuntary bath by the spout. Here they rub their backs against the viscid
stigma of the flower and obtain glue ; then against the pollen-masses, which

are thus stuck to the back of the bee and carried away. " When the bee, so

provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a second time, and is

pushed by its comrades into the bucket, and then crawls out by the passage, the

pollen-mass upon its back necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid

stigma," which takes up the pollen ; and this is how that orchid is fertilized.
Or take this otlier case of the Catasefum. " Bees visit these flowers in order
to gnaw the labellum ; in doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering,
sensitive projection. This, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration

to a certain membrane, wliich is instantly ruptured, setting free a spring, by

which the pollen-mass is sliot forth like an arrow in tlie right direction, and

adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the bee." In this way the fer-

tilizing pollen is spread abroad.

It is the mind thiis stored with the choicest materials of the teleologist

that rejects teleology, seeking to refer these wonders to natural cases.
They illustrate, according to him, the method of nature, not the " technic "

of a man-like Artificer. The beauty of flowers is due to natural selection.

Tliose that distinguish themselves by vividly contrasting colours from the

surrounding green leaves arc most readily seen, most frequently visited
by insects, most often fertilized, and hence most favoured by natural selection.

Coloured berries also readily attract the attention of birds and beasts, which
feed upon them, spread their manured seeds abroad, thus giving trees and

shrubs possessing such berries a greater chance in the struggle for existence.

   With profound analytic and synthetic skill, Mr. Darwin investigates the

cell-making instinct of the hive-bee. His method of dealing with it is re-

--presentative. He faUs back from the more perfectly to the less perfectly

developed instinct from tlio hive-bee to the humble bee, which uses its

own cocoon as a comb, and to classes of bees of intermediate skill, endea-

vouring to show how the passage might be gradually made from the lowest

to. the highest. The saving of wax is the most important point in the

economy of bees. Twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are said to be
needed for the secretion of a single pound of wax. The quantities of nectar

necessary for the wax must therefore be vast ; and every improvement of
constructive instinct whicli results in the saving of wax is a direct profit
to the insect's life. The time that would otherwise be devoted to the making
of was is now devoted to the gathering and storing of honey for winter food.
ADDRESS.  IxXXvii

 He passes from the humble bee with its rude cells, through the McUpona

 with its more artistic cells, to the hive-bee with its astonishing architecture,
 The bees place themselves at equal distances apart upon the wax, sweep
 and excavate equal spheres round the selected points. The spheres intersect,
 and the planes of intersection are built up with thin laminae. Hexagonal
 colls are thus formed. This mode of treating such questions is, as I have

said, representative. He habitually retires from the more perfect and com-

plex, to the less perfect and simple, and carries you with him through

 stages of perfecting, adds increment to increment of infinitesimal change,

and in this way gradually breaks down your reluctance to admit that the

exquisite climax of the whole could be a result of natural selection.
    Mr. Darwin shirks no difficulty ; and, saturated as the subject was with his

own thought, he must have known, better than his critics, the weakness as well

 as the strength of his theory. This of course would be of little avail were hir

object a temporary dialectic victory instead of the establishment of a truth
which he means to be everlasting. But he takes no pains to disguise the
weakness he has discerned ; nay, he takes every pains to bring it into the

strongest light. His vast resources enable him to cope with objections started
by himself and others, so as to leave the final impression upon the reader's mind

tliat, if they be not completely answered, they certainly are not fatal. Their
negative force being thus destroyed, you are free to be influenced by the vast posi-
tive mass of evidence he is able to bring before you. This largeness of knowledge

and readiness of resource render Mr. Darwin the most terrible of antagonists.
Accomplished naturalists have levelled heavy and sustained criticisms against

--him not always with the -view of fairly weighing his theory, but with the

express intention of exposing its weak points only. This does not irritate

him. He treats every objection with a soberness and thoroughness which

even Bishop Butler might be proud to imitate, surrounding each fact with
its appropriate detail, placing it in its laroper relations, and usually giving
it a significance which, as long as it was kept isolated, failed to appear.

This is done without a trace of ill-temper. He moves over the subject

with the passionless strength of a glacier ; and the grinding of the rocks
is not always without a counterpart in the logical pulverization of the ob-
jector. But though in handling this mighty theme all passion has been

stilled, there is an emotion of the intellect incident to the discernment of new
truth which often colours and warms the pages of Mr. Darwin. His success

has been great ; and this imi)lies not only the solidity of his work, but the

preparedness of the public mind for such a revelation. On this head a
remark of Agassiz impressed me more than any thing else. Sprung from a
race of theologians, this celebrated man combated to the last the theory of
natural selection. One of the many times I had the pleasure of meeting him

in the United States was at Mr. Winthrop's beautiful residence at Brookline,

near Boston. Eising from luncheon, we all halted as if by a common impulse

in front of a window, and continued there a discussion which had been started
lit table. The inaple was in its autumn glory; and the exquisite beauty of

the scene outside seemed, in my case, to interpenetrate without disturbance

the intellectual action. Earnestly, almost sadly, Agassiz turned, and said to

radical significance, is the doctrine of the Consorvatiou of Energy, the ulti-

--mate philosophical issues of which are as yet but dimly seen that doctrine

which " binds nature fast in fate " to an extent not hitherto recognized,

exacting from every antecedent its equivalent eonse(iuent, from every con-

sequent its equivalent antecedent, and bringing vital as well as physical

phenomena under the dominion of that law of causal connexion which, so far

as the human understanding has yet pierced, asserts itself everywhere in nature.
Long in advance of all definite experiment upon the subject, the constancy

and indestructibility of matter had been affirmed ; and all subsequent expe-

rience justified the affirmation. Later researches extended the attribute of

indestructibility to force. This idea, applied in the fii'st instance to inorganic,

rapidly embraced organic nature. The vegetable world, though drawing

almost aU its nutriment from invisible sources, was proved incompetent to

generate anew either matter or force. Its matter is for the most part trans-

muted gas ; its force transformed solar force. The animal world was proved
to be equally inicreative, all its motive energies being referred to the com-

bustion of its food. The activity of each animal as a whole was proved to bo

the transferred activity of its moleciiles. Tbe muscles were shown to be

stores of mechanical force, potential until unlocked by the nerves, and then
resulting in muscular contractions. The speed at which messages fly to and

fro along the nerves was determined, and found to be, not as had been previ-

ously supposed, equal to that of light or electricity, but less than the speed

of a flying eagle.

   This was the work of the physicist: then came the conquests of Ihe

comparative anatomist and physiologist, revealing the structure of every

animal, and the function of every organ in the whole biological series, from
the lowest zoophyte up to man. The nervous system had been made the
object of profound and continued study, the wonderful and, at bottom, entirely
mysterious controlling power which it exercises over the whole organism,

physical and mental, being recognized more and more. Thought could

not be kept back from a subject so profoundly suggestive. Besides the

physical life dealt with by Mr. Darwin, there is a psychical life presenting

Howsimilar gradations, and asking equally for a solution.  arc the diff'ercnt

grades and orders of Mind to be accounted for ? What is the princijile of

growth of that mj'stcrious power which on our planet culminates in Eeason ?

These are questions which, though not thrusting themselves so forcibly

upon the attention of the general public, had not only occupied many
reflecting minds, but had been formally broached by one of them before the

' Origin of Species ' appeared.

   With the mass of materials furnished by the physicist and physiologist in
his hands, Mr. Herbert Spencer, twenty years ago, souglit to graft upon this
basis a system of psychology ; and two years ago a second and greatly ampli-
fied edition of his work appeared. Those who have occupied themselves
with tho beautiful experiments of PJateau will remember that when two

spherules of olive-oil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water of tlic
same density as the oil, are brought together, they do not immediately
unite. Something like a pellicle appears to be formed around tlic drops,
the rupture of wliic-h is immediately foUoAved by the coalescence of the
globules into one. There are organisms whose vital actions are almost
as purely physical as that of these drops of oil. They come into contact

and fuse themselves thus together. Prom such organisms to others a shade

higher, and from these to others a shade higher still, and on through an
ever ascending series, Mr. Spencer conducts his argument. There are U\o
                             ADDRESS.  Ixxxix

--obvioua factors to be here taken into account the creature and the medium

in which it lives, or, as it is often expressed, the organism and its en-
vironment. Mr. Spencer's fundamental principle is, that between these two
factors there is incessant interaction. The organism is plaj-ed upon by the

environment, and is modified to meet the requirements of the environment.

Life he defines to bo "a continuous adjustment of internal relations to ex-

ternal relations."

   In the lowest organisms we have a kind of tactual sense diffused over thu

entire body ; then, through impressions from without and their correspond-
ing adjustments, special portions of the surface become more responsive to

stimuli than others. The senses are nascent, the basis of all of them being
that simple tactual sense which the sage Democritus recognized 2300 years
ago as their common progenitor. The action of light, in the first instance,

appears to be a mere disturbance of the chemical processes in the animal

organism, similar to that which occurs in the leaves of plants. By degrees

the action becomes localized in a few pigment-cells, more sensitive to light

than the surrounding tissue. The eye is here incipient. At first it is merely

capable of revealing differences of light and shade produced by bodies close

at hand. Pollowed as the interception of the light is in almost all cases by

the contact of the closely adjacent opaque body, sight in this condition

becomes a kind of " anticipatory touch." The adjustment continues ; a slight

is incipient, and, through the operation of infinite adjustments, at length

reaches the perfection that it displays in the hawk and eagle. So of the

other senses; they are special differentiations of a tissue which was originally

vaguely sensitive all over.

With the development of the senses the adjustments between the organism

and its environment gradually extend in space, a multiplication of expe-

riences and a corresponding modification of conduct being the result. The

adjustments also extend in time, covering continually greater intervals.

Along with this extension in space and time the adjustments also increase

in speciality and complexity, passing through the various grades of brute

life, and prolonging themselves into the domain of reason. Yery striking

are Mr. Spencer's remarks regarding the influence of the sense of touch

upon the development of intelligence. This is, so to say, the mother-tongue

of all the senses, into which they must be translated to be of service to
the organism. Hence its importance. The parrot is the most intelligent of
birds, and its tactual power is also greatest. From this sense it gets know-

ledge unattainable by birds which cannot employ their feet as hands. Tlie

--elephant is the most sagacious of quadrupeds its tactual range and skill, and

the consequent multiplication of experiences, Avhich it owes to its wonderfully

adaptable trunk, being the basis of its sagacity. Feline animals, for a similar

--cause, are more sagacious than hoofed animals, atonement being to some

extent made, in the case of the horse, by the possession of sensitive prehensile

lips. In the Primates the evolution of intellect and the evolution of tactual

appendages go hand in hand. In the most intelligent anthropoid apes we
find the tactual range and delicacy greatly augmented, new avenues of know-
ledge being thus opened to the animal. Man crowns the edifice here, not only
in virtue of his own manipulatory power, but through the enormous extension

of his range of experience, by the invention of instruments of precision, whicli

serve as supplemental senses and supplemental limbs. The reciprocal action of

these is finely described and illustrated. That chastened intellectual emotion

to which I have referred in connexion Фith Mr. Darwin is not absent in Mr.

Spencer. His illustrations possess at times exceeding vividness and force
and from his style on such occasions it is to be inferred that the ganglia of
this Apostle of the Understanding are sometimes the seat of a nascent

poetic thriU.

   It is a fact of supreme importance that actions the performance of which at

first requires even painful effort and deliberation, may by habit be rendered

automatic. Witness the slow learning of its letters by a child, and the subse-

quent facility of reading in a man, when each group of letters which forms a

word is instantly, and without effort, fused to a single perception. Instance
the billiard-player, Avhose muscles of hand and eye, when he reaches the per-

fection of his art, are unconsciously coordinated. Instance the musician, who,

hj practice, is enabled to fuse a midtitude of arrangements, auditory, tactual

and muscular, into a process of automatic manipulation. Combining such

facts with the doctrine of hereditary transmission, we reach a theory of

AInstinct.     chick, after coming out of the egg, balances itself correctly, runs

about, picks up food, thus showing that it possesses a power of directing its

movements to definite ends. How did the chick learn this very complex

coordination of eye, muscles, and beak ? It has not been individually

taught ; its personal experience is nil ; but it has the benefit of ancestral

experience. In its inherited organization are registered all the powers

which it displays at birth. So also as regards the instinct of the hive-bee,
already referred to. The distance at which the insects stand apart when
they sweep their hemispheres and build their cells is " organically remem-

bered." Man also carries with him the physical texture of his ancestry, as

weU as the inherited intellect bound up with it. The defects of intelligence

during infancy and youth are probably less due to a lack of individual expe-

rience than to the fact that in early life the cerebral organization is stiU

incomplete. The period necessary for completion varies with the race, and

Avith the individual. As a round shot outstrips a rifled one on quitting the
muzzle of the gun, so the lower race in childhood may outstrip the higher,

liut the higher eventually overtakes the lower, and surpasses it in range. As

regards individuals, we do not always find the precocity of youth prolonged to

mental power in maturity; while the dulncss of boyhood is sometimes stiikingly

contrasted with the intellectual energy of after years. Newton, when a boy,

was weakly, and he showed no particular aptitude at school ; but in his

eighteenth year he went to Cambridge, and soon afterwards astonished his

teachers by his power of dealing with geometrical in-oblems. During his

quiet youth his brain was slowly preparing itself to be the organ of those

energies which he subsequently displayed.

   By myriad blows (to use a Lucretian phrase) the image and superscription

of the external world are stamped as states of consciousness upon the organ-
ism, the depth of the impression depending upon the number of the blows.
\yhen two or more phenomena occur in the environment invariably together,
they are stamped to the same depth or to the same relief, and indissolu-

bly connected. And here we come to the threshold of a gi'eat question.

Seeing that ho could in no Avay rid himself of the consciousness of Space and
Time, Kant assumed them to be necessary " forms of intuition," the moulds

and shapes into Avhich our intuitions are thrown, belonging to ourselves
solely and without objective existence. With unexpected power and success

Mr. Spencer brings the hereditary experience theory, as he holds it, to bear
upon this question. " If there exist certain external relations which are

--experienced by all organisms at all instants of their waking lives relations

--which are absolutely constant and universal there will be established an-
ADDRESS.  XCl

Rwering internal relations that arc absolutely constant and universal. Such

relations wo have iu those of Space and Time. As the substratum of all

other relations of the Non-Ego, they must be responded to by conceptions
that are the substrata of all other relations in the Ego. Being the constant
and infinitely repeated elements of thought, they must become the automatic

--elements of thought the elements of thought which it is impossible to get
--rid of the ' forms of intuition.' "

   Throughout this application and extension of the "La^iv of Inseparal)lc Asso-

ciation," Mr. Sjienccr stands wpon his own ground, invoking instead of the

experiences of the individual the registered experiences of the race. His
overthrow of the restriction of experience to the individual is, I think,
complete. That restriction ignores the power of organizing experience fur-
nished at the outset to each individual ; it ignores the different degrees of
this power possessed by different races and by chfferent individuals of the same

race. Were there not in the human brain a potency antecedent to all expe-

rience, a dog or cat oiight to be as capable of education as a man. These
predetermined internal relations are independent of the experiences of the

individual. The human brain is the " organized register of infinitely nu-

merous experiences received during the evolution of life, or rather during the

evolution of that series of organisms through which the human organism has

been reached. The effects of the most uniform and frequent of these expe-
riences have been successively bequeathed, principal and interest, and have
slowly mounted to that high intelligence which lies latent in the brain of the
infant. Thus it happens that the European inherits from twenty to thirty
cubic inches more of brain tlian the Papuan. Thus it happens that faculties,
as of music, which scarcely exist in some inferior races, become congenital
iu superior ones. Thus it happens that out of savages unable to count up
to the number of their lingers, and speaking a language containing only nouns
and verbs, arise at length our l^ewtons and Shakespeares."

    At the outset of this Address it was stated that x^hysieal theories which lie
beyond experience are derived by a process of abstraction from experience.
It is instructive to note from this point of view the successive introduction of
new conceptions. The idea of the attraction of gravitation was preceded by
the observation of the attraction of iron by a magnet, and of light bodies by
rubbed amber. The polarity of magnetism and electricity appealed to the
senses ; and thus became the substratum of the conception that atoms and
molecules are endowed with definite, attractive and repellent poles, hj the
play of which definite forms of crystalline arcliitecture are produced. Thus
molecular force becomes structural. It required no great boldness of thought
to extend its play into organic nature, and to recognize iu molecular force
the agency by which both plants and animals are built up. In this way out
of experience arise conceptions which are wholly ultra-experiential. K'one
of the atomists of antiquity had any notion of this play of molecular polar
force, but they had experience of gravity as manifested by falling bodies.
Abstracting from this, thej- permitted their atoms to fall eternally through
empty space ; Democritus assumed that the larger atoms moved more rapidly
than the smaller ones, which they therefore could overtake, and with which
tliey could combine. Epicurus, holding that empty space could offer no
resistance to motion, ascribed to all the atoms the same velocity ; but he seems
to have overlooked the consequence that under such circumstances the atoms
could never combine. Lucretius cut the knot by quitting the domain of physics
altogether, and causing the atoms to move together by a kind of volition.

    AYas the instinct utterly at fault which caused Lucretius thus to swerve

from his own principles ? Diminishing gradual! j' the number of progeni-
tors, Mr. Darwiu comes at length to one " primordial form ; " but he docs
not say, as far as I remember, how he supposes this form to have been in-
troduced. He quotes with satisfaction the words of a celebrated author

and divine who had "gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a con-

ception of the Deity to believe He created a few original forms, capable of
self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required

a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws."

What Mr. Darwin thinks of this view of the introduction of life I do not

know. But the anthropomorphism, which it seemed his object to set aside,

is as iirmly associated with the creation of a few forms as Avith the creation

Weof a multitude.  need clearness and thoroughness here. Two courses and

two only are possible. Either let us open our doors freely to the conception

of creative acts, or, abandoning them, let us radically change our notions of

Matter, If we look at matter as pictured by Democritus, and as defined

for generations in our scientific text-books, the notion of any form of life

whatever coming out of it is iitterly imimaginable. The argument placed

in the moiith of Bishop Butler suffices, in my opinion, to crush all such ma-

terialism as this. But those who framed these definitions of matter were

not biologists but mathematicians, whose labours referred only to such acci-

dents and properties of matter as could be expressed in their formulae. The

very intentness with which they pursued mechanical science turned their

thoughts aside from the science of life. May not their impei-fect definitions

be the real cause of our present dread ? Let us reverently, but honestly,

look the question in the face. Divorced from matter, where is life to be

found? Whatever our faith may say, out hnowlalge shows them to be indis-

solubly joined. Every meal we eat, and every cup we drink, illustrates the

mysterious control of Mind by Matter.

Trace the line of life backwards, and see it approaching more and more to

Wewhat we call the purely physical condition.  come at length to those

organisms which I have compared to drops of oil suspended in a mixture of

Wealcohol and water.  reach the profor/encs of Haeckel, in which we have " a

tj'pc distinguishable from a fragment of albumen only by its finely granular

character." Can vc pause here ? We break a magnet and find two poles

Wein each of its fragments.  continue the process of breaking, but, however

small the parts, each carries with it, though enfeebled, the polarity of the whole.

And when we can break no longer, we prolong the intellectual vision to the

polar molecules. Arc we not urged to do somethincj similar in the case of

life ? Is there not a temptation to close to some extent with Lucretius, when ho

affirms that " nature is seen to do all things spontaneously of herself without

the meddling of the gods"? or with Bruno, when he declares that Matter is

not " that mere empty ca]jacity which philosophers have pictured her to be
but the universal mother who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own

womb " ? Believing, as I do, in the continuity of N'ature, I cannot stop

abruptly where our microscopes cease to be of use. Here the vision of the
mind authoritatively supplements the vision of the eye. By an intellechial

necessity I cross the boundary of the experimental evidence, and discern in
that Matter which we, in our ignorance of its latent powers, and notwitii-

standing our j^rofessed reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered m ith

opprobrium, the promise and potency of all terrestrial Life.

If you ask me Avhether there exists the least evidence to prove that any

form of life can he developed out of matter, without demonstrable antecedent

life, my reply is that evidence considered perfectly conclusive by many has
                                                                        ADDRESS.     Xciii

been adduced                                                            and that were some of us who have pondered this question to
                                                                     ;

follow a very common example, and accept testimony because it falls in with

our belief, we also should eagerly close with the evidence referred to. But

there is in the tnie man of science a wish stronger than the wish to have his

beliefs upheld ; namely, the wish to have them true. And this stronger wish

causes him to reject the most plausible support if he has reason to suspect

that it is vitiated by error. Those to whom I refer as having studied this

question, believing the evidence offered in favour of " spontaneous genera-

tion" to be thus vitiated, cannot accept it. They know full well that the
cliemist now prepares from inorganic matter a vast array of substances which

иwere some time ago regarded as the sole products of vitality. They are in-

timately acquainted with the structural power of matter as evidenced in the
phenomena of crystallization. They can justify scientifically their belief in

its potency, under the proper conditions, to produce organisms. But in reply

to your question they will frankly admit their inability to point to any satis-

factory experimental proof that life can be developed save from demonstrable

antecedent life. As already indicated, they draw the line from the highest

organisms through lower ones down to the lowest, and it is the prolongation

of this line by the intellect beyoud the range of the senses that leads them

to the conclusion which Bruno so boldly enunciated*.

The " materialism " here professed may be vastly different from what you

suppose, and I therefore crave your gracious patience to the end. " The ques-
tion of an external world," says Mr. J. S. Mill, " is the great battle-ground

of metaphysics " f. Mr. Mill himself reduces external phenomena to " possi-
bilities of sensation." Kant, as we have seen, made time and space "forms "
of our own intuitions. Fiehtc, having first by the inexorable logic of his un-

derstanding proved himself to be a mere link in that chain of eternal causa-

tion which holds so rigidly in nature, violently broke the chain by making

nature, and all that it inherits, an apparition of his own mind J. And it is by
no means easy to combat such notions. For when I say I see you, and that

I have not the least doubt about it, the reply is, that what I am really con-

myscious of is an affection of                                          own retina.  And if I urge that I can check

my sight of you by touching you, the retort would be that I am equally trans-

gressing the limits of fact ; for what I am really conscious of is, not that

you are there, but that the nerves of my hand have undergone a change.

All we hear, and see, aud touch, and taste, and smell, are, it would be urged,

mere variations of our own condition, beyond which, even to the extent of a
hair's breadth, we cannot go. That any thing answering to our impressions

exists outside of ourselves is not Si, fact, but an inference, to which all validity

would be denied by an idealist like Berkeley, or by a sceptic like Hume.

Mr. Spencer takes another line. With him, as with the uneducated man, there

is no doubt or question as to the existence of an external world. But he dif-

fers from the uneducated, who think that the world really is what conscious-

ness represents it to be. Our states of consciousness are mere si/mbols of an

outside entity which produces them and determines the order of their

succession, but the real nature of which we can never know Д. In

fact the whole process of evolution is the manifestation of a Power abso-
lutely inscrutable to the intellect of man. As little in our day as in the days

of Job can man by searching find this Power out. Considered fundamentally,

then, it is by the operation of an insoluble mystery that life on earth is
evolved, species differentiated, and mind unfolded from their prepotent
elements in the immeasurable past. There is, you will observe, no very

rank materialism here.

   The strength of the doctrine of evolution consists, not in an experimental
demonstration (for the subject is hardly accessible to this mode of proof),
but in its general harmony with scientific thoiight. From contrast, more-

over, it derives enormous relative strength. On the one side we have a

theory (if it could with any propriety be so called) derived, as were the

theories referred to at the beginning of this Address, not from the study

--of nature, but from the observation of men a theory which converts tlie

Power whose garment is seen in the visible universe into an Artificer,

fashioned after the human model, and acting by broken efforts as man is
seen to act. On the other side we have the conception that all we see

--around us, and all we feel Avithin us the phenomena of physical nature
--as well as those of the human mind have their unsearchable roots in a

cosmical life, if I dare apply the term, au infinitesimal span of which is

offered to the investigation of man. And even this span is only knowablc

Wein part.  can trace the development of a nervous system, and correlate

with it the parallel phenomena of sensation and thought. "We see with un-
doubting certainty that they go hand in hand. But we try to soar in a

vacuum the moment we seek to comprehend the connexion between them.
An Archimedean fidcrum is here required which the human mind cannot

command ; and the eftbrt to solve the problem, to borrow a comparison from
an illustrious friend of mine, is like the effort of a man trying to lift himself

by his own waistband. All that has been here said is to be taken in connexion

with this fundamental truth. When " nascent senses " are spoken of, when

" the differentiation of a tissue at first vaguely sensitive all over " is spoken

of, and when these processes are associated with " the modification of an

organism by its environment," the same parallelism, without contact, or even

approach to contact, is implied. Man the object is separated by an impassable

gulf from man the suhjecf. There is no motor energy in intellect to carry it

without logical rupture from the one to the other.

Further, the doctrine of evolution derives man, in his totality, from the in-

teraction of organism and environment through countless ages past. The

--Human Understanding, for example that faculty which Mr. Spencer has
--turned so skilfully round upon its own antecedents is itself a result of the

play between organism and environment through cosmic ranges of time. Never

surely did prescription plead so irresistible a claim. But then it comes to

pass that, over and above his understanding, there arc many other things ap-

pertaining to man whose prescriptive rights are quite as strong as those of the

understanding itself. It is a result, for example, of the play of organism and

environment that sugar is sweet and that aloes are bitter, that tlic smell of

Bays, further experiments are needed. Such experiments have been since made by Mr.

Spalding, aided, I believe, in some of his observations by the accomplished and deeply
lamented JLady Amberly ; and they seem to prove conclusively tluit the chick does not
need a single moment's tuition to enable it to stand, run, govern the muscles of its ejes, and

hcnhane differs from the perfume of a rose. Such facts of consciousness

(for which, by the way, no adequate reason has yet been rendered) are

quite as old as the understanding ; and many otlier things can boast an

equally ancient origin. Mr. Spencer at one place refers to that most

-- --powerful of passions the amatory passion as one which, when it first

occurs, is antecedent to all relative experience whatever ; and wc may pass

its claim as being at least as ancient and valid as that of the understanding.

hut in so doing you deride accidents of form merely, and fail to touch the

immovable basis of the religious sentiment in the nature of man. To yield

this sentiment reasonable satisfaction is the problem of problems at the pre-

sent hour. And grotesque in relation to scientific culture as many of the

the forms of a force, mischievous, if permitted to intrude on the region of
objective Inoivledge, over which it holds no command, but capable of adding
in the region oi poetry and emotion, inward completeness and dignity to man.

    Feeling, I say again, dates from as old an origin and as high a source as
intelligence, and it equally demands its range of jjlay. The Avise teacher of
humanity will recognize the necessity of meeting this demand rather than of

resisting it on account of errors and absurdities of form. "What we should
resist, at all hazards, is the attempt made in the past, and now repeated, to

found upon this elemental bias of man's nature a system which should exer-
cise despotic sway over his intellect. I have no fears as to such a consumma-
tion. Science has already to some extent leavened the world: it will leaven
it more and more ; and I should look upon the light of science breaking in upon
the minds of the youth of Ireland, and strengthening gi-adually to the per-

fect day, as a surer check to any intellectual or spiritual tyranny which now

threatens this island, than the laws of princes or the swords of emperors.

"We claim, and we shall wrest, from theology the entii'e domain of cosmo-

logical theory. All schemes and systems which thus infringe upon the
domain of science must, in so far as tlicy do this, submit to its control, and
relinquish all thought of controlling it. Acting otherwise proved disastrous
in the past, and it is simply fatuous to-day. Every system which would
escape the fate of an oi-ganism too rigid to adjust itself to its environment

must be plastic to the extent that the growth of knowledge demands. When

this truth has been thoroughly taken in, rigidity will be relaxed, exclusive-

ncss diminished, things now deemed essential will be dropped, and elements
now rejected will be assimilated. The lifting of the life is the essential

point ; and as long as dogmatism, fanaticism, and intolerance are kept out

various modes of leverage may be employed to raise life to a higher level.

   Science itself not unfrequently derives motive power from an ultra-
scientific source. Some of its greatest discoveries have been made under the
XCvi  REPORT --1874'.

stimulus of a non-scientific ideal. This was the case among the ancients, and

it has been so amongst ourselves. Maj-cr, Joule, and Colding, Avhose names

are associated with the greatest of modern generalizations, were thus influ-
enced. With his usual insight, Lange at one place remarks, that " it is not

alwaj-s the objectively correct and intelligible that helps man most, or leads

most quickly to the fullest and truest knowledge. As the sliding body upon

the brachystochrone reaches its end sooner than by the straighter road of the

inclined plane, so through the swing of the ideal we often arrive at the naked

truth more rapidly than by the more direct processes of the understanding."

Whewell speaks of enthusiasm of temper as a hindrance to science ; but he

means tlie enthusiasm of weak heads. There is a strong and resolute enthu-

siasm in which science finds an ally ; and it is to the loM'ering of this

fire, rather than to the diminution of intellectual insight, that the lessening

productiveness of men of science in their mature years is to be ascribed.
ilr. Buckle sought to detach intellectual achievement from moral force. He

gravely erred ; for without moral force to whip it into action, the achieve-

ments of the intellect would be poor indeed.

It has been said that science divorces itself from literature ; but the state-

Ament, like so many others, arises from lack of knowledge.  glance at the
--less technical writings of its leaders of its Helmholtz, its Huxley, and its
--Du Bois-Reymond would show what breadth of literary culture they com-

mand. Whore among modern writers can you find their superiors in clear-

ness and vigour of literary style ? Science desires not isolation, but freely

combines with every effort towards the bettering of man's estate. Single-

handed, aud supported not by outward sympathy, but by inward force, it has

built at least one great wing of the many-mansioned home which man in his

totality demands. And if rough walls and protruding rafter- cuds indicate

that on one side the edifice is still incomplete, it is only by wise combination

of the parts required with those already irrevocably built that we can

hope for completeness. There is no necessary incongruity between what

has been accomplished and what remains to be done. The moral glow of

Socrates, which we all feel by ignition, has in it nothing incompatible with
the physics of Anaxagoras which he so much scorned, but which he would
hardly scorn to-day. And here I am reminded of one amongst us, hoary, but

still strong, whose prophet-voice some thirtyyears ago, far more than any other

of this age, unlocked whatever of life and nobleness lay latent in its most gifted

--minds one fit to stand beside Socrates or the Maccabean Eleazar, and to dare

--and suffer all that they suffered and dared fit, as he once said of Pichte, " to

have been the teacher of the Stoa, and to have discoursed of Beauty and

Virtue in the groves of Academe." With a capacity to grasp physical prin-

ciples which his friend Goethe did not possess, and which even total lack of

exercise has not been able to reduce to atrophy, it is the world's loss tliat lie,

in the vigour of his years, did not open his mind and sympathies to science,

and make its conclusions a portion of his message to mankind. Marvel-

--lously endowed as ho was equally equipped on the side of the Heart and of
--the Understanding he might have done much towards teaching us how to

reconcile the claims of both, and to enable them in coming times to dwell

together in unitj of spirit and in the bond of peace.

And now the end is come. With more time, or greater strength and

knowledge, what has been here said might have been better said, while

worthy matters here omitted might have received fit expression. But there

would have been no material deviation from the views set forth. As regards

myself, they arc not the growth of a day ; and as regards yoii, I thought you

surrounding you, and in relation to which some adjustment on your part may be
Anecessary.
             hint of Hamlet's, however, teaches us all how the troubles of

common life may be ended ; and it is perfectly possible for you and mc to pur-

chase intellectual peace at the price of intellectual death. The world is not

without refuges of this description ; nor is it wanting in persons who seek their

shelter and try to persuade others to do the same. The unstable and the

weak have yielded, and will yield to this persuasion, and they to whom

repose is sweeter than the truth. But I would exhort you to refuse the

--offered shelter, and to scorn the base repose to accept, if the choice be

forced upon you, commotion before stagnation, the leap of the torrent before

the stillness of the swamp. In the course of this address I have touched on

--debatable questions, and led you over what will be deemed dangerous ground
   and this partly with the view of telling you that as regards these questions

science claims unrestricted right of search. It is not to the point to say that

the views of Lucretius and Bruno, of Darwin and Spencer, may be wrong.

Here I should agree with you, deeming it indeed certain that these views

will undergo moditication. But the point is, that, whether right or wrong,

we claim the right to discuss them. For science, however, no exclusive

claim is here made                                                                                 you are not urged to erect it  into  an  idol.  Inexorable

advance of man's understanding in the path of knowledge, and those un-

quenchable claims of his moral and emotional nature which the understanding

can never satisfy, are here equally set forth The world embraces not only a

-- --Newton, but a Shakspeare not only a Boyle, but a Raphael not only a
--Kant, but a Beethoven not only a Darwin, but a Carlyle. Not in each of
--these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are not opposed, but supple-

mentary not mutually exclusive, but reconcilable. And if, unsatisfied with
them all, the human mind, with the yearning of a pilgrim for his distant

home, will still turn to the Mystery from which it has emerged, seeking so

to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith, so long as this is done, not

only without intolerance or bigotry of any kind, but with the enlightened

recognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable, and that

--each succeeding age must be held free to fashion the mystery in accordance

witii its own needs then, casting aside all the restrictions of Materialism, I

would affirm this to be a field for- the noblest exercise of what, in contrast

with the hyiowing faculties, may be called the creative faculties of man.

Here, however, I touch a theme too great for me to handle, but which will

assuredly be handled by the loftiest minds when you and I, like streaks of

morning cloud, shall have melted into the infinite azure of the past.

           THE STATE OF SCIENCE.

Tenth Report of the Committee for Exploring Kent's Cavern, Devon-

   shire, the Committee consisting of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.,
   F.R.S., Sir John Lubbock, Bart., F.R.S., John Evans, F.R.S.,

   Edward Vivian, M.A., George Busk, F.R.S., William Boyd
   Dawkins, F.R.S., William Ayshford Sanford, F.G.S., John Ed-
  ward Lea, F.G.S., and William Pengelly, F.R.S. [Rejjorter).

Before entering on this, their Tenth Report, the Committee desire to express

their deep sense of the great loss they have sustained in the decease of Pro-

fessor Phillips. No member was more regular in his attendance at the meet-

ings of the Committee, or felt a livelier interest in the investigation with

which they are charged. On March 18, 1874 (little more than a month

before his lamented death), though suffering from a severe cold, he visited

the Cavern, when he carefully inspected those branches of it which have been

explored, and expressed his admiration of the clearness and importance of

the evidence bearing on the question of human antiquity which had been

obtained.

The Ninth Keport, presented to the Association at the Bradford Meeting,

brought the work up to the end of August 1873, when the Committee were

engaged in the Exploration of the " Long Arcade." From that time the in-

vestigation has been pursued, without intermission, in the manner uniformly

observed from the commencement, and which was described in detail in the

Pirst Report (1865). The work has been performed in the most satisfac-

tory manner by the workmen mentioned last year (George Smerdon and John

Clinnick) ; the Superintendents have visited the Cavern daily, and have

exercised the same care as heretofore in accurately recording the results

from day to day.

The interest felt in the exploration by the inhabitants and visitors of Tor-

quay has suffered no abatement ; and the Superintendents have had the plea-

sure of conducting a large number of persons through the Cavern, including

the Rev. Dr. Callaway, Bishop of Kaffraria, Rev. T. BuUivan, Rev. C. Chapman,

Rev. S. C. Davis, Rev. W. W. FoUett, Rev. W. M. Kingsmill, Rev. W. H.

    During a meeting at Torquay of the South-western Branch of the British
Medical Associatiou, the Cavern was visited by a large party of the members,
attended by the Superintendents, including Dr. Aldridge, Dr. Baker, Dr. S.
Budd, Dr. Dalby, Dr. EUery, Dr. Finch, Dr. Harris, Dr. Henderson, Dr.
Hudson, Dr. L. Shapter, Dr. "W". E; Woodman, and Messrs. L. Armstrong,

C. Parsons, C. Pridham, G. T. Eolston, C. H. Eoper, W. K. Spragge, A. J.

Wallis, and J. Woodman.
    The Cavern was also visited, under the guidance of the Superintendents,

by Messrs. W. E. Blatch, A. B. Hill, A. D. Hill, W. E. Hughes, andJ.Mor-

ley, members of the Birmingham Natural-History and Microscopical Society,

during a scientific visit of that body to South Devon.
    Besides the foregoing, a large number of visitors have been conducted by

the Guide to the Cavern, appointed by the proprietor. Sir L. Palk, Bart., but

who is placed under the directions of the Superintendents of the Exploration.

In such cases the visitors are taken through those parts of the Cavern which
have been explored, but not into the branches which have not been examined,

 or where the work is still in progress.

    During May 1874 an arrangement was made with the Superintendents by

 Professor Alfred Newton, F.E.S., of Magdalen College, Cambridge, for Mr.

 H. H. Slater, one of the Naturalists to the Eodriguez Transit Expedition, to
 spend some time in the cavern studying the mode of exploration followed

 there, it being not improbable that he might have to explore some very inter-

 esting caves which exist in the island, and where, instead of intelligent men, he

 would probably have only half savages to dig for him. Mr. Slater reached Tor-
 quay on June 1st, when every thing was done to facilitate his purpose, and

 he spent some days watching the men at work.

     Live rats continue to present themselves in the Cavern from time to time,

 and sometimes prove to be very troublesome. On Tuesday, October 7, 1873,

 one, which had been seen by the workmen, carried off six caudles in the course

 of the afternoon, having detached them from a nail at a spot believed to have

 been inaccessible even to rats, and which had been used for the purpose during
 a period of three years without any previous loss. Gins were at once set for

 the marauder, and he was captured on the following Friday. On the 29th of

 the same month, another, between the hours of nine and one, ate through

 the basket in which one of the workmen had placed his dinner of bread and

 meat, and carried off every thing but the bread, the whole of which was left.

 A large number have been captured during the last twelve months.

    It may not be out of place to remark that during the summer months

bees have frequently been seen and beard in the innermost brandies of the
Cavern, very far beyond any glimmering of daylight.

  --The Long Arcade. It was stated in the Ninth Report (1873) that the

*' Long Arcade," after extending about 50 feet beyond the point reached by
the excavators at the end of August 1873, terminated in a large chamber
termed by Mr. MacEnery the *' Cave of Inscriptions," and sometimes the " Cul-
de-sac." On carefully perusing Mr. MacEnery's " Cavern researches," how-
ever, it was found that he regarded a large mass of Stalagmite on which are
numerous inscriptions, and which it is proposed to call " The Inscribed Boss
of Stalagmite," as being in the Cave of Inscriptions, and not, as the Superin-
tendents considered, in the Long Arcade. In other words, he held that the
line of junction of the two branches was on the north-east of the Inscribed
Boss, whilst they drew it some distance on the south-west. To prevent
ambiguity, it has been decided to adopt Mr. MacEnery's boundary and to re-
gard the Long Arcade as extending from the south-west corner of the Sloping
Chamber to, but not beyond, the Inscribed Boss. Thus defined, it stretches
for about 225 feet in a tolerably straight line towards the south-south-west,
varies in height from about 10 to 20 feet (the measurements being taken
from the bottom of the excavations made by the Committee), and from 5 to
nearly 20 feet in width.

   Besides being the only passage to the Cave of Inscriptions, which may be

regarded as its expanded prolongation, it throws off three branches on the left
or eastern side and one on the right. Of the former, the first, or most north-
erly, is the " Charcoal Cave " described in the Eighth Report*, the second is

known as "Underhay's Gallery," and the third, a few feet further south, con-
sists of two successive and considerable chambers, termed 'и' The Labyrinth "
and " The Bear's Den." The branch on the other, or right, side, which it is
proposed to name " Clinnick's Gallery," is at the inner extremity of the

Arcade.

    So far as this branch of the Cavern is concerned, Mr, MacEnery's re-
searches entirely ceased about 12 feet before reaching the end of the Arcade,
and throughout the remaining area the " Granular Stalagmite " (that which
covers the " Cave-earth ") was everywhere continuous, and varied from 12 to
30 inches in thickness. Its surface was occupied with large natural " Basins,"
some of them 12 inches deep, such as have been described in previous Re-
ports f. Whilst the excavation was in progress several points of interest
connected with the Basins were noted :

   1st. The Stalagmite forming their walls was harder and tougher than that
surrounding them, whilst that composing their bottoms was comparatively
soft and friable.

    2nd. Their walls were traceable through the entire thickness of the Stalag-
mitic Floor ; in other words, during the entire deposition of the Floor, Basins
had existed in it, the bottom rising with the walls but at a slower rate.

   3rd. The water which filled them in rainy seasons passed down through
the bottom in 3 or 4 hours at most.

   4th. Immediately beneath most of the Basins there was an almost conti-
nuous interspace of about half an inch vertically between the bottom of the
Stalagmite and the top of the Cave- earth, caused, no doubt, by the finer par-
ticles of the deposit being carried by the percolating water through interstices
to a lower level.

   It happened that, the exploration of that part of the Arcade in which the

Uasins were thus numerous was carried on during a very wet season, when the
water passing through the Stalagmitic Floor, as just mentioned, caused two
or three slips in the Cave-earth and the " Breccia." The largest of these fell

during the night of January 8th-9th, and in the fallen matter a tooth of
Bear, a vertebra, fragments of bone, and a well-rolled flint nodule were found.
It is, of course, impossible to say whether this nodule belonged to the era of
the Cave-earth or that of the more ancient Breccia. This is to be regretted,
as it is the only specimen of the kind which up to this time the Cavern haa

yielded.

   The " Crystalline Stalagmite " (that wtich lies between the Cave-earth
above and the Breccia below, when all these occur in the same vertical sec-
tion) was also occasionally met with in situ, and always beneath the granular
or less ancient variety. In some instances there was a space between them
filled with the true Cave-earth with its characteristic bones and coprolites,
whilst in others the two Stalagmites were in immediate contact. Where the
older variety did not exist the Cave-earth lay at once on the Breccia.

   The only noteworthy objects found in the Granular Stalagmite were a tooth
of Bear, fragments of bone, one considerable " fijid " of coprolites, and charred
wood on two occasions. The following is the complete list of objects of in-
terest found in the Granular Stalagmite throughout the entire length of the
Long Arcade from 1871-2 to February 23rd, 1874, when its exploration

--closed : 2 teeth of Hyaena, 1 of Bear, 1 of Deer, a large vertebra, fragments

of bone on several occasions, several specimens of charred wood, a flint tool or

"core" (No. 5990), and a piece of black flint.
    Since the period at which the Ninth Report closed the iindisturbed Cave-

earth in the Long Arcade has yielded a considerable number of bones and
fragments of bone and 63 teeth (30 of Hyaena, 24 of Bear, 4 of Horse, 3 of

Mammoth, and 2 of Fox).
    The total number of Teeth found by the Committee in undisturbed Cave-

earth in the Arcade from fii'st to last was about 340, which may be distributed

as shown in the following Table :

 matter of this kind found in a single day was sufficient to fill a very large

 basket.

     The followiug specimens of flint and chert, found in the Long Arcade since
 the end of August 1873, belong to the Cave-earth era :

     No. 6304 is merely a flint chip so angular as to render it improbable that
 since its dislodgment from the nodule it has been in any Avay exposed to the
 action of flowing water. It was found in the first foot-level, with 2 teeth
 of Eear, bone chips (one of them being burnt), and 11 balls of coprolite, on
 December 13, 1873.

    'No. 6324, found December 30th, 1873, in the second foot-level, beneath
 the Ploor of Granular Stalagmite from 2 to 2-5 feet thick, is a very symmetrical
 tongue-shaped tool, fashioned with much labour out of a chert nodule, and is
 worked to an edge all round the perimeter except at the butt-end, where
 portions of the original surface remain on both faces. It is 3'8 inches long,
 2-3 inches in greatest breadth, 1"5 inch in greatest thickness, and convex on
both faces, from each of which several flakes have been struck. Its era can-
not be determined with perfect accuracj-, since it occurred at or near the
junction of the Cave-earth and the Breccia, where, unfortunately, thej^ were
not separated by Stalagmite. The fact that it was fashioned out of a
nodule and not out of a flake, suggests that it belonged to the Breccia ; and
this finds some support from its occurrence in the second foot-level, for though
the Cave-earth occasionally attained this depth in the inner part of the

Arcade, it did so but rarely. On the other hand, its symmetrical outline and

comparatively high finish are equally suggestive of the Cave-earth or less
ancient period.

   The presence of man in the Cave-earth of the Arcade was also indicated by

several bones having the appearance of the action of fire. Specimens of this
kind were met with on six different occasions.

    Without including those found in the materials dislodged by their pre-
decessors, the Committee have met with a total of 27 implements of flint
and chert in Cave-earth which they found intact in the Long Arcade.

   From the end of August 1873 to the end of July 1874 a considerable
number of bones and 149 teeth of Bear, but no known remnant or indication
of any other kind of animal, were found in the Breccia in the Arcade, making
a total of about 200 teeth of this genus met with in this oldest deposit of the
Cavern deposits, so far as is known at present, in the branch of the Cavern
now under notice. Though several good specimens were obtained, none of
them require special remark or description.

   The same deposit yielded 10 tools, flakes, and chips of flint and chert

during the year just closed.
    No. 6186 is a chert pebble, displaying some chipping, but not sufficient to

convert it into a useful tool. It was found in the third foot-level, without
any other object of interest, September 2, 1873.

   No. 6192 is a rude flake of flint, retaining a portion of the original surface
of the nodule, and distinctly showing the " bulb of percussion." It was
found alone, in the fourth or lowest foot-level, September 10, 1873.

   No. 6201, a chert pebble, which has undergone some chipping and pro-
bably subsequent rolling, was found by itself in the second foot-level, Sep-
tember 18, 1873.

   No. 6204 is simply a chip which has the appearance of having been arti-
ficially struck off a flint nodule, the original surface of which it retains on
one face. It was found, with a few fragments of bone, in the third foot-level,
September 23, 1873.
--6 REPOHT 1874'.

   No. 6291, a piece of coarse chert, having the form of a horseshoe-shaped
scraper, is about 2-1 inches long and broad, and "7 inch in greatest thickness.
The hinder end is sharply truncated, and the " bulb of percussion " is -well
developed near it on the inner face, but everywhere else its margin is a thin
edge. It was found alone, in the fourth foot-level, November 29, 1873.

    No. 6292, found on the same day and in the same "parallel" and "level"
as No. 6291, but about 3 yards on the left of it, is a portion of a white"flint,
probably a " core " from which flakes had been struck. It retains a part

of the original surface of the nodule. No other object was found near it.

    No. 6299 is a rude flake of chert having little or nothing about it suggestive
of an artificial origin. It has undergone the metamorphosis so frequently
observed in Cave flints, by which it has acquired a granular chalky texture
and has lost a part of its weight. It was found without any other object,
in the third foot-level, December 8, 1873.

    No. 6358, a coarse chert tool, which has also been metamorphosed, is of a
very irregular nondescript form, and remains partially surrounded with
Breccia. It was met with in the second foot-level, February 3, 1874, and
was unfortunately broken by the workmen, but has been repaired.

    No. 6364, a rather rude flake of coarse chert which has been rolled since

it was struck off, retains much of the original surface of the nodule, and,
though perhaps not intentionally fashioned as a tool, may have been utilized.
It was found, with a tooth of Bear, bones and fragments of bone, in the third

foot-level, February 14, 1874.
    No. 6367, an angular chip of flint, was found, with 2 teeth of Bear and

fragments of bone, in the fourth foot-level, February 23, 1874.
    The entire number of noteworthy specimens of flint and chert (most of

which, at least, have been made and used by man) which the Committee have
found in the Breccia in the Long Arcade amounts to 27.

    The materials which Mr. MacEnery had dug up and cast aside in that part
 of the Arcade explored during the period over which the present Report ex-
 tends were found on examination to contain 13 teeth of Hyaena, 9 of Bear,
 8 of Horse, 2 of Deer, 1 of Ox, several bones, numerous lumps of coprolite,
 and 1 flint flake (No. 6328). The specimens thus overlooked or neglected
 by the earlier explorers, which have been recovered bj"" the Committee in the
 Long Arcade from first to last, are 63 teeth of Hyaena, 15 of Horse, 9 of Bear,
 7 of Bhrnoceros, 4 of Deer, 3 of Ox, 1 of Elephant, 1 of Fox, numerous por-
 tions of bones and of antlers, a large quantity of faecal matter, and 9 tools and
 flakes of flint and chert.

  --UnderJicn/s Gallery. Atabout 185 feet from the entrance of the Long Arcade

 in the Sloping Chamber there is in the left or eastern wall, as already stated,
 a small lateral branch, to which the Superintendents have given the name of
 " Underhay's Gallery," after the late Mr. John Underhay, who for some years
 was Sir L. Palk's guide to the Cavern. Before the Committee commenced its
 exploration its mouth was almost closed with the large masses of limestone
 mentioned in the Ninth Eeport as Ij'ing in wild confusion beyond "The
 Bridge" *. Notwithstanding this, Mr. Underhay and his son forced a passage
  into the Gallery several years ago, even though after passing the entrance they
 must have found the Granular Stalagmitic Floor within a foot of the roof in
  certain places. They contrived, moreover, to bring back several small bones,
 which j)roved to be phalanges of human feet, which they had found on and in

  the Floor.

   The Gallery extends about 20 feet in a south-easterly direction, varies
from 2-5 to 7 feet in width, and, when measured from the bottom of the ex-
cavation made by the Committee, from 7"5 feet at the entrance to less than

6 feet in height within. The roof and walls have the appearance of an old

watercourse, and are worn smooth, with but little of that fretted character so

prevalent in some other branches of the Cavern. Near the mouth there are

four circular holes in the right wall, about 6 inches in diameter, which look

like the mouths of " flues," but are found to extend not more than a foot

Ainto the rock and to run into one another.  Floor of the Granular Sta-

lagmite, never exceeding 10 inches in thickness, extended from the mouth to
16 feet within it, where it " thinned out." Beneath it there were, in certain

places, chiefly adjacent to the left wall, remnants of the Crystalline Stalag-

mite in siftt ; but the greater part of this older Floor had, as in many other

parts of the Cavern, been broken up by some natural agency.

"With rare exceptions, a thin layer of Cave-earth lay at once on the Breccia

without any Stalagmite between them. In the Breccia itself, however,

there were numerous fragments or blocks of Stalagmite which cannot but be

regarded as remnants of a Floor still older than the Crystalline Stalagmite

found on the Breccia. Similar indications of this Floor, of what may be

called the third order of antiquity, have frequently been met with elsewhere

in the Cavern, and mentioned in previous Eeports *. The Breccia was ex-

tremely hard, and had to be split out with wedges to the depth of 2 feet.

This, added to the contracted dimensions of the Gallery, rendered the work

probably the most severe that has been experienced in the Cavern from the

commencement.

Though the human bones found by Mr. Underhay on and in the Granular

Stalagmite, as already mentioned, did not appear, from their aspect or specific

gravity, to be of an antiquity equal to that of the Cave-hyaena and his con-

temporaries, the Superintendents, in the hope of finding some further traces

of the skeleton, very carefully watched the progress of the work ; and on

reaching Mr. Underhay's very limited diggings, they met with a series of bones

also on and in the Stalagmite, some of which were certainly human, whilst

others were as clearly infra-human. The whole were at once forwarded to
Mr. George Busk, F.R.S. &c., a member of the Committee, who has been so

good as to forward the following report on them. They were all numbered

   When the very contracted character of this Gallery, prior to its excavation
by the Committee, is borne in mind, it is difficult to understand how the

remains were introduced. There were neither potsherds, nor charcoal, nor,
in short, any thing suggesting that the bones were the remnants of a body
disposed of by cremation, such as were met with in the Charcoal Cave *; nor
were there any marks of teeth on the bones such as might have been ex-
pected had they been taken thither by a carnivorous animal, or the relics of

a skeleton buried or secreted there, of which all other portions had been
carried off by some carnivore.

   The commingling of a few specimens of a more ancient type with the
comparatively recent human and ovine remains was no doubt produced by
Mr. Underhay's diggings at the spot.

   Besides the foregoing specimens no object of interest was found in
connexion with the Granular Stalagmite.

   The Cave-earth in Underhay's Gallery yielded 2 balls of coprolite, numerous
bones, and 94 teeth ; of which 61 were those of Hyaena, 22 of llorse, 4 of
llhinoceros, 4 of Pox, 1 of Bear, 1 of Lion, and 1 probably of Wolf.

   The following specimens of flint and chert were also met with in the Cave-

earth :

   No. 6234, a mere angular chip of drab-coloured flint, was found, with
1 tooth of Hyaena and one of Rhinoceros, in the first foot-level, October 14,

1873.

    Nos. -H-^^^T), -g-^e y, and y-^\g- are three small fragments of flint (two of them
angular and the third subangular), having no appearance of having been
artificially formed, and were found, with 7 teeth of Hyaena and 1 of Fox,
part of a jaw of Fox, part of a skull, and a gnawed bone, in the first foot-
level, November 10, 1873.

    No. 6289 is a small bit of flint, found, with 15 teeth of Hyaena, 7 of Horse,
1 of Bear, and a few bones, lying 07i the Cave-earth in the innermost part of
the Gallery, beyond the point at which the Granular Stalagmite had thinned

out.

   The Breccia in Underhay's Gallery produced several bones, 115 teeth of
Bear, and the following specimens of flint and chert :

   No. 6220, an irregular flint chip, which has been somewhat rolled, was
found, with three teeth of Bear and fragments of bone, in the second foot-

level, October 30, 1873.
    No. -iv-Tj^^T ^^ apparently a flint " core," which retains a portion of the original

surface of the nodule, and was found, with three teeth of Bear, also on
October 30, 1873, and one foot below No. 6220.

    No. -jr^y is a rolled flake of chert found with No. y-jVy
   No. 6279 is a flake of chert still imbedded in the Breccia, and was found,
with bone fragments, in the second foot-level, November 17, 1873.
    No. 6281 is a small flake of chert, found, with three fragments of teeth of

Bear and jneces of bone, in the fourth foot-level, November 18, 1873.
   The Breccia in this Gallery also yielded a piece of iron-ore and a small

piece of umber.

 --The Inscribed Boss of Stalac/mite. Though inscriptions exist in various

parts of the Cavern, the huge mass of Stalagmite, standing at the point whore
the Long Arcade, the Cave of Inscriptions, and Clinnick's Gallery meet, is,
with the exception perhaps of the " Crj-jit of Dates"*, more thickly scored
with names, initials, and dates than any other equal area within the Cavern.
Indeed it seems to have been the spot where visitors usually left their

names. Those alone who were sufliciently adventurous and expert to get
beyond the " Lake" could leave a proof of the fact in the Crypt. The Boss,
which may be described as a frustum of an oblique cone, measures 43 feet

in basal circumference and 14 feet along the slant side, which, forming an
angle of 70░ with the horizon, gives a vertical height of fully 13 feet. The
cubic contents are probably not less than 630 cubic feet of Stalagmite. Its

base consists of the Older or Crystalline Stalagmite, and the upper portion
(without any intervening Cave-earth) of the Granular variety, which not only
surmounted and completely encased the former, but, by flowing in vast sheets,
formed the thick Granular Floor spreading far and without a break in every

direction.

   The inscriptions occupy its outer or most accessible semi-surface, where in
certain places they form quite a network. Letters of all sizes, from some
fully three inches in height to others as smaU as ordinary writing, cross each
other and add to the difficulty of decipherment. Some of them were cut
with great care and finish, and must have occupied a large amount of time,

whilst others were but hasty scratches.
   It seems to have been somewhat fashionable to surround the inscriptions

with rectangular parallelograms, varying from 6-5 to 3-75 inches in length
by 5-5 to 3-5 in breadth. In, at least, one or two cases the cutting of the
parallelogram preceded that of the inscription, as the latter extends beyond
the space intended. Kot unfrequently several names occur together, whether
within a parallelogram or not, and in each such case the entire work seems
to have been performed by the same hand, The following, which are the

most legible, may suffice as examples :

   Of the foregoing names, No. 10 may perhaps be that of Mr. J. A.

DELUC, F.R.S. &c. He visited Torquay in October 1805, but, as the

following passage in his ' Geological Travels ' shows, does not appear to
have entered the Cavern at that time. Speaking of the " limestone strata,"
between Babbicombe and Tor Baj's, he says, " There is, as I was told, a

succession of caverns within this mass, resembling those of the Mendip hills,
which I shall hereafter describe : the Caverns here have the name of Kent's
Cave"*. This appears to be the only mention he makes of the Cavern. The
inscription is in comparatively small capitals, which, though no great pains
appear to have been bestowed on them, are very distinct, and stand imme-

diately above the parallelogram containing the inscription No. 1.

   The name of Champernowne (No. 9) is that of a well-known. Devonshire
family, now represented by A. Champernowne, Esq., F.G.S., of Dartington
House, near Totnes, the seat of his ancestors for many generations. It is
worthy of remark, perhaps, that the mother of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, born
near Torquay, the half-brother of Sir Walter Ealeigh, was a Champernowne.
In the inscription, however, the name is Gilbart, not Gilbert. Whether
" Staplyn," also in No. 9, is the name of a person or of a place, there seems
to be no mode of determining ; but it may be observed that " Staple " is the
name of a hamlet in the parish of Dartington.

    Some of the names inscribed on the boss are no doubt those of persons of

the immediate neighbourhood. " W. Wish " (No. 13) was the name of one
of the principal builders at Torquay when Mr. MacEnery's Cavern researches

were in progress, and he had a nephew named "James Wish" (No. 14).
The name of " Lear" (No. 15) is very prevalent in the adjoining parish of
St. Mary Church.

    It must be unnecessary to add that every care has been taken to preserve
this Boss with its inscriptions uninjured.

  --The Cave of Inscriptions. Though the principal entrance to Clinnick's

Gallery is between the Inscribed Boss of Stalagmite and the right wall of the
Long Arcade, a second, but smaller one, opens out of the Cave of Inscriptions
immediately beyond the Boss ; in fact the original entrance was partially filled,
and thus converted into two, by the Boss. As the smaller of the two
entrances was the more convenient for excavating the GaUery, it was
decided to complete the exploration of the Cave of Inscriptions so far as to
render this entrance available, that is i;p to 16 feet from its commencement.
Mr. MacEnery had not broken ground in any part of this area, and the
Granular Stalagmitic Eloor was everywhere intact and continuous from the
slopes of the Inscribed Boss. The Crystalline Stalagmitic Eloor lay beneath
it, and, as already stated, formed the base of the Boss without any inter-
mediate deposit ; but towards the left or remote wall of the Cavern there
was a space between them filled with a wedge-like layer of Cave-earth.
Not unfrequently, however, the lower or older Stalagmite had been broken.
In some instances the severed portions were not dislodged, whilst in others
 considerable masses had been removed by some natural agency, and were

 not always traceable.
    In this commencement of the Cave of Inscriptions the Cave-earth yielded

20 teeth, of which 11 were those of Bear, 5 of Elephant, 3 of Hyaena, and
 1 of Horse. There were also several bones, of which 6 had been burnt and a
few gnawed ; and a considerable quantity of coprolitic matter was met with
in 14 distinct " finds."

The following specimens of flint and cliert were also found in the Cave-

earth in this branch of the Cavern :
    JS'o. 6378 is a mottled, grey, angular flake of chert, 2-3 inches long,

1-5 inch broad, -3 inch thick, very concave on the inner face, and has had
several flakes struck ofi^ the outer face. There is little or no evidence of its
having been used, and it was found, with two specimens of plates of Elephant
molars, 2 teeth of Bear, gnawed bones, 1 burnt bone, and 5 lumps of copro-

lite, in the first foot-level, March 6, 1874.
   No. 6382, a small grey flint flake or chip, with the "bulb of percussion"

strongly marked, was found in the first foot-level beneath a cake of stalag-
mite 12 inches thick, with 3 teeth of Bear and 11 balls of coprolite, March

11, 1874.
   No. 6384 is a rudely lanceolate flake of grey flint, 2-2 inches long, -9 inch

in greatest breadth, -3 inch in greatest thickness, slightly concave on the inner
face, reduced to an edge along both lateral margins, having two ridges
extending its entire length on the outer face, and has been but little, if at
aU, used. It was found, with 4 teeth of Bear, fragments of bone, and a

coprolite, in the first foot-level, March 13, 1874.

   No. 6390 is a small flint flake, 1-4 inch long, -8 inch in greatest breadth,
и3 inch in greatest thickness, slightly concave in both directions on the inner

face, strongly carinated on tlae other, sharply truncated at each end, reduced
to an edge on the lateral margins, one of which is broken or jagged, of a
light drab colour on the sui'face and to some depth below it, but retaining
the original almost black colour at the centre. It was found in the first
foot-level beneath 10 inches of stalagmite, with 1 tooth of Bear, 2 fragments
of burnt bone, and 4 lumps of coprolite, March 24, 1874.

   No. 6399 is a nearly white flint of fine texture, 2-9 inches long, varying

from '7 to "9 inch broad, '5 inch in greatest thickness, sharply truncated at
the butt-end, round-pointed and blunt at the other, sharp and unworn at the
lateral margins, longitudinally concave on the inner face, and having a
strong central ridge on the other extending from the butt-end nearly two

thirds of its length, where it bifurcates in consequence of the dislodgment
of a small flake, which has left an uneven surface. At the butt-end there is
on one of the slopes a portion of the original surface of the nodule about an
inch long, and the " bulb of percussion " is well developed near the point.
It was found, with 2 fragments of bone and 2 lumps of coprolite, in the first
foot-level beneath a layer of Granular Stalagmite 24 inches thick, on April

1, 1874.
   No. 6435 is a grey flint flake, 1-5 inch long, -7 inch broad, -35 inch in

greatest thickness, which it attains along one of its lateral margins, sharply

truncated at one end, round-pointed and blunt at the other, where, on the
inner face, the " bulb of percussion " presents itself, reduced to a thin edge
along one of its lateral margins, where there are indications of its having

been used as a scraper. On its outer face it has, for a short distance near

the middle of its length, a central ridge which bifurcates towards each end.

It was found in the first foot-level on May 28, 1874.

Nothing was met with in          the Crystalline  Stalagmite                                                but the Breccia

beneath it yielded remains of Bear as usual, including numerous bones

and fragments of bone and 91 teeth, but, so far as is known, no trace of

any other animal.

The foUowiag specimens of flint and chert were also met with in this

oldest of the Cavern deposits :
ON Kent's cavern, devonsiiiiie.  13

   No. 6375 is a large rude flake of a very rough flint nodule, -which has
undergone sufiicieut metamorphosis to produce a granular texture and render
it capable of being scratched with a knife, but without any marked loss of
weight. Its form is rudely quadi-ilateral with the angles rounded oft'. The
inner face displays the " bulb of percussion " near the truncated butt-end,
but elsewhere has a tendency to flatness. The outer face retains a large

portion of the original surface of the nodule. It is 4-25 inches long,

3 inches broad, l-S inch in greatest thickness, and was found in the fourth
or lowest foot-level, with 2 teeth of Bear and a small flint pebble, March 3,

1874.

   No. 6388 is a bluish-grey flint of somewhat coarse texture, 2 inches long,
и7 inch broad at the truncated butt-end, whence it tapers to a point at the
other, -4 inch in greatest thickness, slightly concave on one face and very
strongly ridged on the other. It was found, with 2 teeth of Bear and frag-
ments of bone, in the second foot-level, March 17, 1874.

    No. 6392, an irregularly shaped flake or chip of pinkish drab chert,
2-2 inches long, 1-8 inch broad, and -3 inch in greatest thickness, was
found, without any other object of interest, in the third foot-level, March 25,

1874.
   No. 6396 is a subtriangular flake of coarse chert, 1-8 inch long, 1-1 inch

in greatest breadth, -4 inch in greatest thickness, nearly flat on one face
and has a strong curvilineal ridge on the other. It was found, with frag-

ments of bone, in the first foot-level, March 31, 1874.
    No. 6455 is a small specimen, or rather a portion of one, it having been

broken in extracting it from the matrix. It is -9 inch long, scarcely
и5 inch broad, and -2 inch in thickness, which it retains to each of its
lateral margins. It was found, with fragments of bone, in the fourth
foot-level, June 19, 1874.

  --ClinnicJc's Gallery. As already stated, the Long Arcade throws off a

lateral branch at its inner extremity, at its junction with the Cave of
Inscriptions and in the right wall. Its principal entrance is about 225 feet

from the mouth of the Arcade. It was left entirely untouched by Mr. Mae-
Enery; but in 1846 the Torquay Natural-History Society appointed a
Committee of three of its Members, including the two Superintendents of
the present work, to make some very limited researches in the Cavern.
That Committee broke ground in three dift'erent places, and found flint
implements in each. One of the spots selected was the smaller or innermost
of the two mouths of this Gallery, immediately behind the Inscribed Boss of
Stalagmite. Mr. Yivian, speaking of the flint tool found there, says, " In
the spot where the most highly finished specimen was found the passage was
so low that it was extremely difficult, with quarrymen's tools and good
workmen, to break through the crust; and the supposition that it had
been previously disturbed is impossible"*. The specimens found during
those researches are now in the Museum of the Torquay Natural-History

 Society.

    The work on that occasion was performed as in all previous cases : the
excavated materials were examined by candlelight as they were dug out,
and then thrown on one side, but not taken out of the Cavern to be re-

examined by daylight. The excavation was about 7-5 feet long, 5 feet
broad, and penetrated to a depth of not more than 2 feet below the bottom
of the Granular Stalagmitic Floor. The materials then cast aside have been

--taken out of the Cavern by j'our Committee, and the following objects found

in it: 7 teeth of Bear, 1 of Fox, and 13 lumps of coprolite. Before its
removal, the surface of the mass was carefully examined to ascertain what
thickness had been reached by the Stalagmite which, as the Superintendents
well knew, had been accreting on it since its lodgment in the spot it had
occupied for 28 years, beneath one of the overhanging walls of the Cavern :
the result was a film of the thickness of writing-paper only, and limited to

two examples of from 2 to 3 square inches each. When your Committee

began the exploration of this Gallery, they supposed it likely to prove but a
very small affair ; but at the end of July 1874 three months' labour had been
expended on it, and it is still unfinished. The Granular Stalagmitic Floor
so very nearly reached the Hoof as to lead to the conclusion that the entire
Gallery was exposed to view ; but as the work advanced the space between
the Floor and lloof became steadily greater, until John Cliunick, the work-

man after whom the Gallery is named, was able to force himself through the

low tunnel, and to enter a chamber which he speaks of as being large and
beautifully hung with Stalactites.

   This Gallery, uji to the point at present explored, must have had a
perfectly continuous floor of Granular Stalagmite before it was broken in
1846, as already stated. It varied from 14 to 30 inches in thickness ; and
at about 3 feet from the base of the Inscribed Boss there rose from the Floor
another, in the form of a tolerably regular paraboloid, which, though dwarfed
by its gigantic companion, M'oidd have arrested general attention elsewhere.
It measured 10 feet in basal circumference, 3 feet in height, and had to be
blasted in order to effect its removal, when it was found to be pure stalag-
mite throughout.

   Up to 18 feet from the entrance of the Gallery a small quantity of Cave-

earth uniformly presented itself, beneath which lay the Breccia occasionally
separated from it by remnants of the Crystalline Stalagmite in situ ; but at
the point just mentioned the upper Stalagmite rested immediately on the
lower, and that on the Breccia ; and this condition has been retained iip to
the present time, that is through an area 16 feet long. The Committee,
however, are not unprepared to find Cave-earth, at least in the form of
" pockets," between the two Floors, with its characteristic remains, as the
work progresses, as was the case in the " South-west Chamber" *.

    The Cave-earth in Clinnick's Gallery yielded 8 teeth of Ilyajua, 2 of Fox,
a tolerable number of bones, 13 "finds" of coj)rolite, and the following
specimens of Hint and chert :

    No. 6401 was a rather large chert implement broken into several pieces
by a blow of the workman's tool. It was found, with a tooth of Hya?na, in
the first foot-level, on which the Granular Stalagmite was 24 inches thick,
on April 7, 1874.

    No. 6426 is a small white flint flake, 1-3 inch long, 1 inch broad, -3 inch
in greatest thickness, nearly flat on one face, strongly ridged rather near
the margin on the other, blunt at the ends, but reduced to a thin edge
everywhere else ; one margin is nearly straight, whilst the other is an almost
circular arc, giving the specimen a semicircular form. It has undergone

the prevalent mctamorpliosis, and was found in the first foot-level, May 12,

1874.

   The Breccia in this Gallery had produced, up to the end of July 1874^
86 teeth of Bear, numerous bones, including a large portion of a skull
(No. 6458), and the following specimens of flint and chert:

   Ko. 6403 is a pinkish drab flake of chert, somewhat pentagonal in form,

about 2*1 inches long, 1-5 inch broad at what may be regarded as its front

edge, '45 inch in greatest thickness, and pi'obably an efficient " scraper." It

was found alone in the fourth foot-level, April 15, 1874.
    No. 6415, a pinkish drab flake of chert, 2-2 inches long, 1 inch broad,

и35 inch in greatest thickness, with the "bulb of percussion" on the inner
face, which is concave in both directions, whilst the outer face is convex and
retains the original surface of the nodule on about one third of its length.
It does not appear to have been used, but a considerable part of its margins
are concealed by portions of the Breccia. It was found, with 3 teeth of

Bear, in the first foot-level, April 28, 1874.

   No. 6427 is an irregidar pentagon in form, 2-9 inches in length, 2*4 inches
in greatest breadth, -9 inch in greatest thickness, nearly flat on one face,
which shows the "bulb of percussion," and convex on the other, whence
several flakes have been dislodged leaving conchoidal facets. It was
probably reduced to a thin edge along each of its sides except one ; and it
seems to have been pretty much used. It was found, with fragments of

bone, in the fourth foot-level. May 14, 1874.

    No. 6462 is a rough irregular flake, 2*4 inches in length, 1*2 inch in
greatest breadth, and "5 inch in greatest thickness. It was found, with a Bear's
tooth and a few fragments of bone, in the first foot-level, July 13, 1874.

    Noi gi[Vr' *^« finest stone implement found in the Breccia since the Ninth
Report was presented, has, on that account, been reserved for the last to be
here described. It was found April 23, 1874, in the fourth or lowest foot-
level, with 1 tooth of Bear, fragments of bone, and a small chert flake (f^-j)
which had probably been rolled. It measures 4-5 inches in length, 3 inches
in greatest breadth, 1-1 inch in greatest thickness, is very convex on one
face, slightly so on the other, retains a portion of the original surface near
the butt-end, and is rudely quadrilateral in form with the angles rounded oflp.
Several flakes have been s"truck off each face ; the edge to which it lias been
reduced along its entire margin, except at the butt-end, is by no means
sharp ; its surface is almost entirely covered with an almost black, probably
manganesic, smut, whilst a slight chip near the pointed end shows it to
consist of a very light-coloured granular chert. Several lines, betokening
planes, probably, of structural weakness or perhaps of fracture, entirely
surround it. If it has really been fractured, it must have occurred where
the tool was found, and the parts have been naturally reunited without being
faulted. Its character, as well as its position, shows that this fine implement

belonged to the era of the Breccia.
    This specimen is of considerable interest, both on account of the lines which

cross its surface and of the position it occupied.

   Amongst the flint implements found in Brixham Cavern, that known as

No. 6-8 has attracted considerable attention, and has been described and
figured by Mr. John Evans, F.R.S., P.G.S., a member of the Committee, both
in his * Ancient Stone Implements ' * and in the " Report on the Explora-

    * 'Ancient Stone Implements, &c. of Great Britain,' by John Evans, F.R.S., F.S.A.,

--tion of Brixham Cave"*. It was found in two pieces the first on the

12th of August, 1858 ; the second, 40 feet from it, on the 9th of the following
September ; and it was not until some time after the latter date that the late
Dr. Falconer discovered that the two fragments fitted each other, and, when
reunited, formed a massive spear-shaped implement. The lines on the
Kent's Cavern implement just described (g^Vr) ^^^w that it had either been
fractured where it was found, or, what seems more probable, that it is
traversed by planes of structural weakness, such that a slight blow would
break it into two or more pieces, which a stream of water would easily
remove and probably separate, and thus produce a repetition of the Brixham

 case.

    The Kent's Cavern tool was found in a small recess in the wall, just
within the outer or wider entrance of Clinnick's Gallery, a very few feet
from the Inscribed Boss of Stalagmite, and, as has been already stated, in

--the fourth foot-level of the Breccia that is, at the greatest depth in the oldest

of the Cavern deposits to which the present exploration has been carried
and is thus wonderfully calculated to take the mind step by step back into

antiquity.

    First, very near the spot occupied by the specimen there rises a vast
cone of Stalagmite, which an inscription on its surface shows has under-
gone no appreciable augmentation of volume during the last two and a

half centuries.

   Second, prior to that was the period spent in rearing the greater portion
of this cone, which measures upwards of 40 feet in basal girth, reaches a
height of fully 13 feet, and contains more than 600 cubic feet of stalag-

mitic matter.

   Third, still earlier was the era during which the Cave-earth was intro-
duced, in a series of successive small instalments with protracted periods of

intermittence, when the Cavern was alternately the home of man and of the
Cave-hya3na, and the latter dragged thither piecemeal so many portions of
extinct mammals as to convert the Cave into a crowded palaeontological

Museum.
    Fourth, further back still was the period during which the base and

nucleiis of the cone or boss was laid down in the form of Crystalline

Stalagmite.

   Fifth, and earliest of all, was the time when materials, not derivable from
the immediate district, were carried into the Cavern through openings now
probably choked up, entirely unknown, and the direction in which they lie

--but roughly guessed at when, apparently, the Cavern-haunting Hyaena had

not yet arrived in Britain. At an early stage in this earliest era man

occupied Devonshire ; for prior to the introduction of tlie uppermost four
feet of the Breccia one of his massive unpolished tools, rudely chipped

out of a nodule of chert, found its way into a recess in the Cavern, and

having a character such as to show that it must have lain undisturbed
in the same spot until it was detected by a Committee of the British

 Association.

    It may be of service before closing this Eeport to show, in a tabular form,

the distribution of the dilferent kinds of lEammals in the Cave-earth in
 various branches of the Cavern.

in a paper published during the progress of those experiments Beilstein and
Kupffer state that the substance boUs at 195░. (4) Ilesiiious substances not
volatile at 350░. (5) " Blue oils " boiling at near 300░ and upwards.

    Absinthol differs from its isomeride myristicol (boiling at 212░ to 218░, or
about 15░ higher) in that it is not appreciably polymerized by continued
rectification; like this substance, however, it is dehydi'ated by hot zinc
chloride fornaiug cymene, thus,

the yield of cymene is, however, but small (20 to 25 per cent.), most being

converted into a non-volatile resinous mass.

When treated with phosphorus pentasulphide absinthol loses the elements

of water, cymene resiilting ; the yield of this hydrocarbon is not much greater

than when zinc chloride is used : a portion of the absinthol also becomes

converted into cijmyl-sulphliydrate, Cj^Hj^ . SH, apparently identical with that

obtained from camphor by similar treatment ; camphor and absinthol, there-

fore, are identical in so far as the action of pentasulphide of iihosphorus is

concerned. The production of cymene from absinthol in this way has also

been observed by Beilstein and Kupffer, who, however, did not observe the

simultaneous production of cymyl-sulphhydrate.           pure sample of this

 --A' II. Oil of Citeonella (AndrojJogoaScJioenanihus).

oil was found to consist mainly of an oxidized substance boiling at near 210░,

but altered by continued heating, becoming somewhat resinizcd and partially

losing the elements of water. This substance gave numbers on combustion

agreeing with those calculated for the formula C,,,JEj^O ; therefore it is iso-

meric, not with camphor, myristicol, and absinthol, but with cajejnitol from

oil of cajeput. (Gladstone found iii a sample of citronella a body termed by

him eitronellol, boiling pretty constantly at 199░-205░, which gave numbers

agreeing sharply with the formula Cj(,H,|.0 ; essential oils not improbably

differ in the character of their ingredients with the season, age of plant, &c.)

When two equivalents of bromine are cautiously added to this oxidized

substance combination takes place, much heat being evolved ; the resulting

dibromide breaks up on heating into water, hydrobromic acid, and cymene,

thus,

       C,AsBr,0=H,0 + 2H Br + C.^H,,,

a considerable amount of resinous by-products being also formed.
   "When treated with phos2)horus pentasulphide, the first action is the removal

of the elements of water, a terpcue or a mixture of terpenes boiling between
160░ and 180░ being formed, thus,

                  C,,,R,0=KO + nH
                                                                                                                                           16 >

polyraerides of terpenes boiling at about 250░ and upwards are also produced
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

by a further action the terpene becomes partially converted into cymene,
sulphuretted hydrogen being evolved, thus,

   When heated with zinc chloride the oxidized constituent of citroneUa-oil

is decomposed, a mixture of hydrocarbon being apparently formed, amongst
which a terpene boiling between 170░ and 180░ predominates ; nine tenths
of the substance are, however, converted into a resinous non-volatile mass.

   Phosphcirus pentacloloride forms a chlorinated product which splits up on

heating, forming hydrochloric acid, a terpene boiling between 168░ and 173░
and polymerides of higher boiling-point, the reactions being

     C,,,H,30+PCl,=HCl+POCl3 + C,,,H,Cl

and

             C,,,H,,C1=HC1 + C,,,H,.             .

  --III. Oil of Cajeptjt. The " cajeputene hydrate " of Schmidt (the " caje-

putol " of Gladstone) was approximately isolated from resinous higher boiling
substances simultaneously present in the oil by fractional distillation, and
boiled between 176░ and 179░, or more than 30░ lower than the isomeric
substance from citronella-oil ; like its isomeride, it combined with two equi-
valents of bromine, evolving much heat, and forming a dibromide splitting iip

by heat into hydrobromic acid, water, and cymene, thus

     C.,,H,,Br,0=2HBr-FH,0 + C,,,H,,.

The yield of cymene, however, was much greater with the cajeputol dibro-

mide than with the citroneUa product, 100 parts of Cj,,II,,0 from cajeputol
yielding about 67 parts of cymene, and 100 of that from citroneUa less than
half as much.

    "With phosphorus pentasulphide cajeputol behaves just as its isomeride,
forming first a terpene and then cymene, the elements of water being first
abstracted, and then two equivalents of hydrogen removed.

 --IV. Action of Phosphoeus Pentasulphide on Teepenes. In order to prove

that the cymene formed when pentasulphide of phosphorus acts on the pro-

ducts C,jII,j,0 from citroneUa and cajeput oils is reaUy produced from a terpene
first generated, the action of phosphorus pentasulphide on other terpenes was
examined, oil of turpentine (boUing at 159░) and hesperideue (boiling at 178")
being chosen as being near the extremes of the range of boiUng-points of the
terpenes as a class. In each case most of the hydrocarbon was converted
into a resinous mass ; torrents of sulphuretted hydrogen were evolved, and
some cymene formed, the yield being about 30 per cent, with oil of turpen-
tine, and 40 per cent, with hesperidene ; in these eases evidently the cymene
is formed by the reaction

                          C,,,H,, + S=H,S + C,H,,.

In each case a trace of cjonyl-sulphhydrate appeared to be formed.

 --Y. Examination of vakiotts Cymenbs. The cymenes obtained as above

described were carefuUy examined in the way detaUed in last year's Eeport

all seemed to be identical with each other and with each of the eight kinds
of cymene formerly examined as described in that Report. The following

numerical values were obtained :

     A Cymene from absinthol and zinc chloride.

a little cymene formed, as above stated, by the further action of the phosphorus
pentasulphide, and II. yielding on combustion carbon 86"55, hydrogen 12-81,
agreeing more nearly with the formula Cj^Hi^ than with C,,,Hjg, which requires
carbon 88-24, hydrogen 11-76.

   The physical properties of the three oxidized bodies agree tolerably well
with the previous determinations.

   The three specimens of citronellol are certainly not identical, for that with

the lowest boiling-point rotated the polarized ray very strongly to the left.

The intermediate one was without circular polarization, and that with the
highest boiling-point showed a very little right-handed rotation.

   The experiments made so far appear to indicate that many of the consti -

tuents of essential oiLs are closely related to the hydrocarbon cymene, this
body being as it were the central form of matter from which terpenes and
their derivatives of the forms C^^H^fi and Cj^Hj^O are all derived by various
operations. As yet no reasonable pi-ospect of success has appeared in the
attempt to determine the different amounts of energy involved in those ope-
rations which yield isomeric products (e. g. in the operations whereby cj'mene
is converted into camphor, myristicol, or absinthol, or into terebene, hespe-

ridene, myristicene, &c.), one great difficulty in the way being the almost

impossibility of obtaining absolutely pure homogeneous substances to operate
upon.

Second Beport of the Sub-Wealden Exploration Committee, the Com-

  mittee consisting of Henry Willett, F.G.S., R. A. C. Godwin-
  Austen, F.Ф.S., W. ToPLEY, F.G.^., T.Davidson, F.R.S., Prof.
   J. Prestwich, F.R.S., Prof. Boyd Dawkins, F.R.S., and Henry
  Woodward/ F.i?./S. Drawn tip by Henry Willett and W. Topley.

At the Meeting at Bradford the General Committee granted Б25 in aid of the

Sub-Wealden Exploration.

In August 1873, 290 feet, at a diameter of 9 inches, had been bored ; and

it was during the Bradford Meeting that Mr. Pejton, F.G.S., discovered

Linr/ida ovalis in a core at the depth of 290 feet from the surface, indicating

that at such a depth the boring was traversing Kimmeridge Clay. The slow

rate of advance by the old system of boring was most disheartening; and at a

Committee Meeting held 7th November, 1873, a definite tender having been

obtained from the Diamond Kock Boring Company, it was accepted. This

Company forthwith energetically commenced, ably performed, and completed

it to a depth of 1000 feet on June 18th, 1874, at a cost of over .Б1400 for the

additional 700 feet. The funds being by this time exhausted, at a Committee

Meeting it was considered by the Members to be very important that the

work should not be abandoned, and a Subcommittee (consisting of Professor

Ramsay, LL.D., F.R.S., Director- General of the Geological Survey of England,

John Evans, Esq., F.R.S., President of the Geological Society, and Prof.

Joseph Prestwich, E.R.S., Ex-President of the Geological Society) was ap-

pointed  to  draw  up  a  fresh  appeal  to  the  public  for  additional  subscriptions
                                                                                                                              ;

and Mr. Willett was urged to continue in office as Honorary Secretary and

Treasurer. An interview also for Professor Ramsay and Mr. Willett with the

Chancellor of the Exchequer was obtained by the Secretary of the Treasury,

at which a grant of the public money in aid of the prosecution of this enter-
g^ REPORT 1874.

prise was solicited on the ground that it was of national importance, and that
such an exploration had been recommended by a Parliamentary Committee
(Coal Commission). In response a Treasury Minute was received to the effect

that a maximum grant of Б1000 would be recommended to Parhament, Б100

of which is to be paid for every 100 feet bored beyond the first 1000 feet*.
This recognition will, it is hoped, induce the Members of the General Com-
mittee of the British Association, at the Meeting at Belfast, to vote a liberal
grant in aid on similar conditions ; for under the most favourable calculation
from Б3000 to Б4000 (including the cost of lining-tubes) will be needed ere
 2000 feet (or Palaeozoic strata) are reached.

    No favourable opportunity having presented itself for observing the under-

 ground temperature, owing to the constant obstruction in the hole, these ex-
 periments are postponed until the bore-hole shall be lined.

     The cost of the lining-tubes will approximate Б500, towards which it is
 proposed to apply the grant which it is hoped will be made at Belfast.

When the last Keport upon the Sub-Wealden Boring was read at the

Bradford Meeting of the Association, a depth of 300 feet had been attained,

but no good fossils had been observed, and no certain information could be

given as to the age of the beds traversed. The only point certainly esta-
bUshed was that the higher beds of the boring, as well as the " Ashburnham

Beds" of the neighbouring district, belonged to the Purbecks; but how

deep the Purbecks extended, and what was the age of the underlying strata,

were points then undecided.

  We are still in some uncertainty as to the first point. Some imperfect

specimens of Estherm (Oyclas) were observed by Mr. Peyton at about 100

feet from the surface, but no other fossils were noticed until the Kimmeridge

Clay was reached. It is then only by the lithological characters of the

Aintermediate strata that we can form any idea as to their age.  detailed

section of the strata was given in the last Report, and specimens are still

Wepreserved at the boring.  should probably not bo far wrong in as-

eigning the beds down to the depth of 180 feet to the Purbecks, and re-

garding all between that depth and 290 feet as Portlaud. This classifica-

tion places the gypsum and associated gypseous marls with tlie Purbecks,

the sandy beds (sometimes almost a sandstone) and all the beds containing

chert nodules with the Portland. Almost at the base of the Portland beds

there are some veins of gypsum in pale shale. Some of the Portland sand or

sandstone is rather greenish in colour.

At the last Meeting of the Association some specimens of the strata tra-

versed were shown, including pieces of clay from the lower part. After the

Report was read this clay was broken up by Mr. Peyton, who noticed some

fragments of fossils which Prof. Phillips recognized as Linyula ovalis, a
characteristic sheU of the Kimmeridge Clay in England, but which was then

unknown in the Boulonnais. Shortly after this, Mr. Peyton, in examining

the cliffs near Boulogne, was fortunate enough to find there several examples

of the same species.

* The grant was subsequently matlc by the Ilouse of Commons.

   At the end of last year (1873), the contract with Mr. Bosworth (then the
contractor) having expired, the work was handed over to the Diamond Eock
Boring Company. By their system of boring long cores of strata are brought

up, of which the mineral character and fossil contents can be ascertained with

great accuracy*.

The boring is now (August 1874) 1030 feet from the surface, but the lowest

17 feet of core are not yet extracted. The strata from about 350 feet to
1013 feet have been examined with care, and many thousands of fossils or

fragments of fossUs have been observed. The greater part cannot be deter-
mined at aU ; in a large number of instances the genus only can be ascertained

but several hundred specimens can be with certainty assigned to their

respective species. I have to thank Mr. Etheridge for much assistance in

determining the fossils. Mr. G. Sharman and Mr. E. T. Newton have also

kindly given me their aid. To Mr. Davidson I am also much indebted ; he

has looked over and named the Brachiopoda, and has drawn specimens of

Lingula ovalis and Discina latissima from the boring for the forthcoming

Supplement to his ' Monograph on the Brachiopoda,' published by the Palaeon-

tographical Society.

The greater part of the cores have been broken up on the spot, and the

fossils sorted out for more detailed examination in London. In this task I

have often had the assistance of Mr. "Willett and Mr. Peyton. Some of the

cores have been broken up and examined by Mr. Willett at Brighton.

The      greater part of the strata traversed below 290 feet is clay                                                                                                                                                                                                generally it
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

is rather calcareous, and from 640 feet downwards there are bands of cement-

stone. The higher part of the Kimmeridge Clay is rather sandy, but no beds at

all approaching a sandstone in character have been observed in that formation.

The middle and lower part of the Kimmeridge Clay contains much petro-
leum ; at some horizons there is so much that the shale will burn. The petro-
leum shales of the lower part are generally very fossiliferous ; but those of

higher portions are often very bare of life.

The Oxford Clay often contains much petroleum, and it also is very fossili-

ferous.

Generally in England the Coral Eag comes between the Kimmeridge and

Oxford Clays ; this is also the case in the Boulonnais. Occasionally, however,

in England the two clays come together without the intervention of the Coral

Eag. This appears to be the case in the boring. An Oxford-Clay fossO.

{Ammonites Sedf/ivicJcii, Pratt) was observed at 972 feet from the surface.

ABelow this several imperfect specimens of ornate Ammonites occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                  good

occur in the Oxford Clay, but I believe have not yet been recorded from tho

Kimmeridge Clay of England.

With regard to the exact point at which the Kimmeridge Clay leaves off

Weand the Oxford Clay begins there is some doubt.  must be guided in

this case by palfeontological evidence, assigning all those strata to Oxford

Clay which contain fossils only hitherto known from that formation, and

Wedoing the same with the Kimmeridge Clay.    have seen that an Oxford-

Clay fossil (Ammonites SedgwicJcii) occurs at 972 feet. Grypliaa virgvJa,

meridge Clay. Between 950 feet and 972 feet we have no good palaeonto-
logical evidence. The fossils which occur here are the following :

Avicula. 952 feet.                           Ostrea. 953, 965 feet.
Cardium striatulum. 961, 952 feet.           Pecten arcuatus. Sow. 952 feet.
C. striatulum, yar. lepidum, Sauv. et Biff.  Astarte (a smooth species). 956 feet.
                                             Thracia depressa. 965 feet.
   967 feet.                                 Ammonites biplex ? 957, 969 feet.
Nucula. 951, 952 feet.                       Tornatella. 967 feet.
Lingula, resembling L. ovalis, Sow.

All of these (excepting perhaps Tornatella) occur in the Kimmeridge Claj*.

Thracia depressa is very characteristic of the Kimmeridge Clay, but it also

ranges downwards to the Great Oolite. It occurs at 965 feet in a soft dark
clay, which ranges with much the same characters from 963 feet to 976 feet

and as it is this clay which (at 972 feet) contains Ammonites SedgwicJcii, we

can hardly take a boundary at this point. Above this there are 5 feet of

unfossiliferous sandy clay, and then come 8 inches of hard, dark grey, heavy,

and sandy clay, with much petroleum. Just above this there is a little hard

sandy clay, containing a layer of a smooth form of Astarte, and above that

some soft dark clay.

If we have to fix upon a definite line, it would probably be advisable to take

it just below the soft clay last named, at 956 feet. One reason for doing this

is, that at 965 and 972 feet there are sometimes well-marked signs of a dip
across the bore-hole ; sometimes this is shown by the layers of fossils lying
obliquely ; and at 965 feet it was very distinctly shoM'n by a layer, 1 inch

thick, of light-coloured clay ; the dip of this was about 10░.

The dips in these places are not owing to an unconformity, because the

layers of fossils just above and just below are quite horizontal. But nothing

of the sort has been observed in the true Kimmeridge Clay ; and this is one

reason, though a very slight and untriLstworthy one, for taking the boun-

dary above these beds. Higher up in the Kimmeridge Clay there have been

cores breaking obliquely, which at first look lilce inclined strata ; but in all

such cases careful examination has shown that these appearances are due to

thin veins of carbonate of lime.

   It was stated above that Orypheea virgula is solely a Kimmeridge-Clay[shell.

In Damon's ' Geology of Weymouth ' it is stated that this shell occurs in

the Oxford Clay of that district ; but in the Atlas of Plates which accompa-

nies the Handbook, a figure is given as Gryphaia (Ostrea) virgula, which is

Wecertainly not that shell, nor one in any way resembling it.   must therefore

conclude that the true Gryphcea virgula has not yet been found in the Oxford

Clay of Weymouth.

In the Sixth and Seventh Quarterly Reports, Modiola pectinata, Sow., appears

amongst the lists of fossils. Purther examination of these shells has shown

that, although they resemble the shell figured under that name in PhiUips's

' Geology of Oxford,' they are really distinct from the shell figured by Sowerby.

Sowerby's shell is really a Mytilus, and as such he described it {Mytilus

pectinatus) ; whilst the shells of the boring are certainly Modiolce. They

somewhat resemble the Mytihis Mornsii of Sharpe, originally figured from

specimens from the Sub-Cretaceous limestone of Portugal, but which also occurs

in the Kimmeridge Clay of Wootton Bassett and in the Boulonnais. , They are,

however, distinct from this, and must be regarded as a new species. In
the Museum of Practical Geology there is an unnamed specimen of this

species from the Kimmeridge Clay of HartweU.

Dr. Lycett has kindly examined some specimens of Trigonia from tho

boring. Amongst them he recognized a young form of Trigonia Juddiana,
                    ON THJi SUB-WEALDEN EXPLOHATION.           25

WeLyc, and another species which is apparently new.   have also observed

some specimens of a small elongated ribbed Astarte which appears to be new.

In the Sixth Report Astarte alicaa, Phil., was mentioned, and in the

Seventh lleport Astarte Aittissiodorensis, Cotteau. More careful examination of

a greater number of specimens has shown that these names cannot be retained.

The small ribbed Astartes of the boringVary a little in size and in the number

and character of their ribs ; but it seems preferable to regard them all as slight

varieties of the Astarte Mysis of De Loriol. The ribs are always less in

number than in the true Astarte Autissiodorensis.
   Considerable difficulty has occurred in naming the Cardiums. The French

palaeontologists have founded several species upon what most English palaeon-
tologists would regard as simply varieties of the original Cardium striatuhim
of Sowerby. In the higher part of the boring the Cardiums are large,
and may with tolerable certainty be referred to C. striatuhim. In the lower

part, both in the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays, the shells are smaller.

MM. Sauvage and Eigaux have described similar shells from the Kimmeridge
Clay of the Boulonnais as Cardium le-pidum. It may perhaps be advisable

to retain this name, regarding the shell, however, as a variety of C. striatuhim

and not a distinct species.

The following is a list of all the fossils hitherto observed. Those species

which occur in both the Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay are marked

On the Recent Progress and Present State of Systematic Botany.
                      By George Bentham,, F.R.S.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in eicienso.]

--It is now some years beyond half a century since I took up the pursuit of

systematic botany at first as a mere recreation, rather later as a study either

subservient to or as a diversion from others which my then social position

rendered more important, but for the last forty years as the main occupation

myof life. During that long period the science has undergone various

vicissitudes. At one time generally regarded as constituting the whole or

nearly the whole of botany, subsequently reduced by some to a mere tech-

nical cataloguing of names, it became the fashion, especially among physio-

logists, who arrogated to themselves the exclusive title of scientific botanists,

to sneer at it as a trivial amusement ; it has now again vindicated its im-

portance, especially since, by the promulgation of the great Darwinian

theories, it has become absolutely necessary to include in it, not only the

life-history and distribution of races, but also the results at least of the

investigations of physiologists and palaeontologists, whilst physiologists

themselves have but too frequently been led astray by their neglect of the

labours of scientific systematists. Having in my early days personally con-

versed with one of Linnaeus's active correspondents (Gouau of Montpellier),

having received many useful hints on the method of botanical study from

the great founder himself of the ISTatural System (Antoine Laurent de

Jussieu), having been honoured with the intimacy of the chief promoters

and improvers of that system (Auguste Pyrame De CandoUe, Robert Brown,

Stephan Endlicher, John Lindley), having enjoyed the friendly assistance

either personally or by correspondence of almost every systematic botanist

of note of this nineteenth century (whether followers or, in earlier days,

antagonists of the Jussieuan methods), I had from the first taken some part

in the controversies which ensued, and always watched them with an in-

terested eye. And now at the close of my career I had sketched out a

myreview of the position this,   special branch of the science, lias occupied

myin relation to the others for  valedictory address to the Linnean Society.

My premature resignation of the Presidency having rendered unnecessary

the dravving-up of that address, I have put my notes into a form which I

have thought might not be unacceptable to the Association, as some compli-

ance with the request made to me at its Meeting at Cambridge in 1833.

Before the days of Linnaeus, the attempts to scale and explore the steep

and rugged acclivities of the Parnassus of Science on the side of Natural

History, and especially in the district of Systematic Botany, had been many,

but vague and unsuccessful. Some general ideas of the direction to be
28 iiEi-oRX-- 1874.

followed had, indeed, been formed by Eay, and after him by Touruefort,

Allioni, and others of undoubted eminence; but it was reserved for the

master-mind of the immortal Swede to mark out a clear, safe, and definite

road along the first great ascent, and to fix on its summit, by the establish-

ment of genera and species upon sound philosophical principles, a firm stage

to serve as a basis and starting-point for further progress and exploration.
Such further progress under the guidance of the same principles was indeed

contemplated and to a certain degree sketched out by Linnaeus himself, but

the territory forming the next acclivity was too little known to disclose the
best paths for ascending it. Among the eight or ten thousand species

known to Linna3us, chiefly from the northern hemisphere or from the Cape of

Good Hope, a sufficient number of genera were exhibited to him in their

entirety to enable him to fix the relations of genus and species ; but of the
higher groups, the orders or natural families, too large a proportion were as

yet undiscovered or were too sparingly represented to encourage any imme-

Adiate attempt to define them.  further knowledge of the territory was

necessary in order to clear the ground for its regular ascent, and yet it was

necessary to ascend in order to eifect its survey ; as a temporary assistance,

therefore, Linnajus devised the scaffolding, known under the name of the

sexual system, with its artificial and easy though frail ladders, the twenty-

four classes and their sudsidiary orders.

AThe progress was now wonderfully rapid.   very few years doubled the

number of plants known, and after the commencement of the present

century new discoveries and more accurate studies of those previously known

were being published in all parts of Europe in an increasing ratio. It was,

however, rather earlier, and not long after the death of Linnaeus, that

Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, following in the footsteps of his uncle Bernard,

with a methodical mind yielding but little to that of the great Swedish master,

having all the advantages of the additional materials at his disposal, and

having to start from the elevated platform so firmly established by his pre-

decessor, was enabled, in his ' Genera Plantarum ' (begun in 1778 and

finally published in^l789), to carry the high road up the next rising, marking

it out perhaps at first rather vaguely, but upon principles so sound that it

was warmly taken in hand by the French school in the first instance, soon to

be followed up in this countiy, and later and less willingly in Germany.

Among the earliest and most important contributors to the perfecting the

 work were Eobert Brown and the elder De CandoUe ; and their labours had
^ already been sufficiently advanced to enable me, when I first came upon the

 stage, to avail myself of the road thus established and ascend with ease to

the higher platform. The great Linncan thoroughfare to species and genera

had long been universally followed, and my apprenticeship to the science,
from 1817 to my first botanical publication in 1826, was entirely under the

guidance of De Candolle's ' Flora ' and ' Theorie ;' so that I had no occasion to

make use, or even to take any notice, of the Linnean scaffolding and ladders.

myI never learnt the twenty-four classes till after the publication of  ' Cata-

logue des Plantes indigenes des Pyrenees et du Bas Languedoc' Easy as

they were supposed to be, I found, for purposes of reference, alphabetical

indexes still. easier.]

   Towards the close of this same year (1826), in which I had thus entered

my name in the roll of working botanists, I returned to England after a

twelve years' residence in France ; and although logic, law, and law-making

mywere at first the chief subjects of  studies and publications, I gradually

gave up more and more time to botany, and having spent two vacations
RECENT PROGRESS OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.  20

among the naturalists of Germany, I had by the year 1832 become acquainted

not only with the principal continental botanists, but also with the practical
working of the botanical establishments of Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Munich, and

Geneva ; and as this was a period when the gradual substitution of natural

to artificial systems had given a general impulse to the scientific study of
plants, I take this year as the starting-point for comparing the state of syste-

matic botany with that of future periods.

   In France, under the guidance of De CandoUe of Geneva, and of Brongniart,
the younger Jussieu, and other Professors of Paris, it was now universally
taught, and it had become generally acknowledged, that the main object of
systematic botany was not the finding out the name of a plant, but the
determining its relations and affinities, the making us thoroughly acquainted

with its resemblances and differences, with those properties which it pos-

sessed in common with others or which were peculiar to itself, whether

these properties consisted in outward form, inner structure, physical con-
stitution, or practicable applicability to use, all of which had to be taken into

account in the formation of orders, genera, and their subdivisions. As text-
books, De CandoUe had developed his ' Theorie ' into the five volumes of his
' Cours de Botanique ' (' Organographie Vegetale,' two vols., 1827, and ' Phy-

siologic Vegetale,' three vols., 1832), while Richard, in the successive editions

of his ' Elements de Botanique,' then in general use by teachers of the science,
vras substituting an elaborate exposition of the natural orders for the some-
what modified Linnean classes he had in the first instance adopted ; and for
practical use, although De CandoUe's admirable ' Flore Frangaise ' was
already out of print, Duby's synopsis of it and a few local floras drawn
up under the natural method had expelled from the market all technical
works which adhered to the sexual classification. For the general botanist,
De CandoUe's ' Prodromus ' had already reached its foiirth volume, describing
under the natural arrangement about 19,000 species, or nearly one third of
those then known *.

    In England considerable progress had also been made in the substitution of

the scientific instead of the technical arrangement of plants for study, but only

among the more advanced followers of the science. Owing in a great mea-
sure to the influence and persevering labours of Sir James Smith, whose pos-

session of the Linnean collections and long Presidency of the Linnean Society
gave him great and generally acknowledged authority in the country, the
cataloguing of plants under the twenty-four classes -was stiU adhered to in
our botanical schools and examinations, and in the standard British floras as

weU as in aU local ones. But this was not to be of long duration. The
great advances made by Robert Brown, although better known on the Con-

tinent than at home, were beginning to have their influence in England
also. The example and teaching of Sir William (then Dr.) Hooker, whose
vast collections and library had already, from the liberal use he made of them,
become of national importance, had caused the natural method to be regarded
 as the only one for illustrating exotic botany and for the useful arrangement
of herbaria. Lindley had commenced that series of works which more
than any others tended to that final acceptance of the natural method in this
country which it had obtained in France. The first edition of his ' Intro-
duction to the Natural System ' was published in 1830 ; and he was much

    * For further details on the origin and progress of this great work I may refer to an

 article I contributed to the 'Natural- History Review' for October 1864, and to that

engaged in' the preliminary labour of a ' Genera Plantarum ' he coutemplated.

Monographs also of individual natural orders or large genera which De Can-

doUe alwaj'S strongly recommended, not only as the best exercise for young

botanists, but as the best means of promoting the science for those whose

circumstances prevented their undertaking more general investigations, were

in some instances being prepared in England as on the Continent. Hooker,

Greville,  Arnott,  and  others  had devoted special works  to  Ferns and Mosses
                                                                                                                                               ;

Lindley had made considerable progress with his ' Genera and Species of

Orchideae,' and at his suggestion I had taken up the Labiatae. Even for the

British flora S. E. Gray's ' Natural Arrangement ' and Lindley's ' Synopsis

were  intended  to bring the     natural  orders  into  use by our local  botanists
                                                                                                              ;

but owing to defects in form and to the want of any artiticial Clavis, neither

of these works was calculated to overcome the prejudices then prevailing in

favour of the Linnean classes.

In Germany the progress had been slower. The country abounds in those

plodding minds which revel in the working out minutioe of detail, and, to find

their way, are satisfied with a sexual, alphabetical, or any other artificial

index, as well as in pure speculators, who, in developing the conceptions of their
brain, will not bo bound by any system. The advantages of the natural
method were long in overcoming the force of habit, kept up as it was by

the number of works which the German press supplied for the use of

collectors and technical botanists. The most important of these took
the form of new editions of Linna;us's ' Systema Vegctabihum ' or of his
' Species Plantarum.' The last two of these had a very general circulation
in the botanical world: Sprengel's, completed in four volumes from 1817 to
1820, would have been useful from its compactness had it been a conscientious
compilation, and actually served for the aiTangement of herbaria in the charge of
mere librarians *; but it was so carelessly and recklessly worked out as to be
soon rejected by all true botanists who attempted to use it. Eoemer and
Schultes's ' Systema,' continued through eight volumes from 1817 to 1830, was
the result of great labour and was generally accurate in detail, and would
have been really useful had it been brought to a conclusion within a short
time. But by the time it had reached the end of Hexandria, the progress
of De Candolle's ' Prodromus ' had even in Germany driven it out of the

market, leaving it, in its incomplete state, nothing but a long succession of
disconnected genera, the confusion of which was stiU further increased by a

series of ' Mantissas ' and first and second Additamenta to ' Mantissas.' Neither
the ability of the younger Schultes, the author of the last two and best
volumes (Hexandria), nor the arguments of Eoemer (who in the preface

justified the use of the sexual system, first on the authority of Linnaeus,

secondly because it was easy, and thirdly because, like nature, it never changed)
could any longer sustain the crumbling fabric. The Natural Orders were
becoming generally taught, and BartHng, in his ' Ordines Naturales Plantarum,'
1830, had proposed one of those speculative rearrangements of the Jussieuan
and Candollean Orders which have since been so frequently indulged in to
so little purpose. But as yet there was no flora of the country or other
practical work calculated to place the natural or scientific method within

reach of the beginner.

    Other more distant countries showed still fewer outward signs of the spread

of the philosophical teaching of botanical systems, which, however, through
the influence especially of Erench works, was gradually gaining ground in

RECENT PROGRESS OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.  31

Sweden, Eussia, and North America, whilst in Southern Europe Spain and

Italy, which during the preceding half century had produced so many emi-
nent botanists in various branches, seemed now disposed to limit themselves

to local floras and the sexual classes.

   We may take as the next period in the progress of systematic botany the

seventeen years that elapsed from 1832 to 1859, during which the advance
had been wonderfully successful. The change from the technical to the scien-

tific study of plants, which during the preceding period had been working its

way through so many obstacles, was now complete. The Linnean platform,
established on the relations of genera and species, had now been so long and

60 universally adopted as the basis or starting-point, that the credit due to
its founder was almost forgotten in the triumphant destruction of the sexual

scaffolding he had erected for the ascent of the higher stages, and now com-
pletely superseded by the progress of the Jussieuan roads, although it was
chiefly by the consistent following out the principles laid down by Linnaeus
himself that the change had been effected. No would-be botanist was allowed

any longer to eschew the labour of the methodical study of plants, or to
indulge in the belief that tlieir technical sorting constituted the science. At
every stage he was taught that plants must be grouped upon a pliilosophical

study of their affinities, whether morphological, structural, or physiological.
The natural orders, as well as genera, were exhibited to him in every work
prepared for his use. Their exposition formed part of the admirable text-

books of the De Candolles (father and son), Adrieji de Jussieu, Lindley, and

others ; Endlicher's ' Enchiridion ' and, above all, Lindley's ' Vegetable

Kingdom ' exhibited the rich stores of knowledge disclosed by their study.
As systematic guides, Endlicher's ' Genera Plautarum ' was complete, and
De Candolle's ' Prodromus ' for Dicotyledons and Kunth's ' Enumeratio ' for
Monocotyledons were far advanced, the gaps being also partially filled up by
numerous monographs of various degrees of merit ; whilst in Cryptogams the
works of Hooker, Mohl, Mettenius, Montague, Fries, Tulasne, Berkeley,
Agardh (father and son), Harvey, Thuret, Kiitzing, and many others were
already showing that for their discrimination and study it was no longer suffi-
cient to rely upon outer characters alone, but that their inner structure and
physiological changes must be taken into account ; and monographs or
" species " of Ferns, Mosses, Hepaticae, Lichens, Fungi, and Algae, arranged
upon principles more or less philosophical, were prepared for the use of the
student in these several branches. For more local botanists and amateurs
most European countries, and a few distant ones, had now their standard
floras in a more or less advanced state, arranged according to the natural
method, the more important of which I shall presently have occasion to

refer to.

    It would seem, therefore, that at this advanced stage of our progress the
guide-posts indicative of the principal paths had become so firmly established,
the principles upon which plants should be scientifically classed so clearly
laid down and so far carried into practice, that little remained to be done
towards completing the survey of the territory, towards a general distribu-

tion of species according to their natural affinities, beyond the more accu-
rate delineation of details and the interpolation of newly discovered species,
and that the systematic botanist could already look towards that summit,
upon reaching which his labours in aid of the general advance of the science
might come to a close. But there was a rock a-head which had long been
looming in the distance, and which on a nearer spproach opposed a formidable

obstacle, to most minds apparently insurmountable. What is a species ?
32 REPORT--1874.

 and what is tlie meaning of those natui-al afliuities accordiug to which species
 are to be classed ? were questions which in 1859 it was generally thought vain
to discuss, or the answers to which, given to us by doctrinal teachers, unsup-
ported by or independent of facts, it was considered as sacrilegious to doubt.

We were taught, and some may still believe, that every species, such as we

now see it, was an original creation, perpetuated through every generation

within fixed limits which never have been and never will be transgressed.

We were less authoritatively told that resemblances of different species were

owing to their having been formed upon one plan variously modified. To the
question why they were so modified, the ready answer was, such was the will
of the Creator ; and in order not to suppose that that will was influenced by
mere caprice, it was suggested that the modifications were either to suit the
plant to the circumstances it was placed in, or to remedy defects in the
original plan, or we were simply told that the subject was beyond our powers

of comprehension *.

    One consequence of this apparent impossibility of proceeding further in the
investigation of the causes of afllinities and of this necessity of taking species
as separate creations in enormous numbers, with resemblances and differences
in endless variety according to the inscrutable will of the Creator, was the
encouragement it gave to arbitrary classifications and interminable disputes

as to the limits of individual species. It was, indeed, generally admitted that
plants should be arranged in genera, orders, &c., in groups of higher and
higher grades according to the importance of the characters they had in com-
mon, and that the test of species was the persistence of its characters through

two or more generations ; but there were no means of estimating the import-
ance or value of characters except by such vague standards as the number of
species in which they had been observed to prevail, no means of determining
what degree of variation and persistence actually distinguished the species
from the variety. The botanist who affirmed that JRnbus frutlcosus, Draha
verna, or Sphagnum palustre were each one very variable species, and he who
maintained that they were collective names for nearly four hundred, for at
least two hundred, or for some twenty separately created and invariably pro-
pagated species, had each arguments in their favour to which no definite
reply could be given ; and systematic botany was in too many cases begin-
ning to merit the reproach of German physiologists, that it was degenerating
into an arbitrary multiplication and cataloguing of names and specimens, of
use to collectors only, and serving as impediments instead of aids to the
extension of our scientific knowledge of the vegetation of the globe.

   It is true that long before the period under consideration some indications
by which this great obstacle to further progress might be surmounted had

In my frequent intercourse during the above period with foreign botanists, I heard

more than one German Professor affirm tliat a type-form was created for each natural

order (the common clover, for instance, being that for Papilionaceje), that Nature set to

work to modify this type-form in framing species of a more complicated structure, till,

tired of the exertion, she next produced new species by the simple omission of some of

Athe complications.  French botanist of great eminence, to account for the number of

plants in cultivation which are not known to exist in a wild state, observed that we could

not suppose that man would have been created without a simultaneous creation of plants

for him to cultivate for food, quite independent of the wild vegetation which existed before

him for the food of animals. And many other still wilder theories were propounded to

account for facts inconsistent with the presumed independent creation and absolute fixity

of species. The bsst authorities went no further than defining affinity as correspondence

of charasters, physiological or structural, and estimating the value of characters and the

importance of peculiarities or modifications of character according to their known connexion

with the phenomena of life.

been vaguely given, and the theory of a common descent of modern species

had been broached, or generally proposed as a solution of some of the dif-

ficulties ; but not in a manner suiRciently plausible to overcome the prejudices
against following up any such track, nor supported by facts and observations

sufficient to awake the attention of the more anxious pursuers of the science.

It was reserved for the publication of the ' Origin of Species' in 1859 to

mark out a practicable path by which the higher summits might be attained.

The doctrine of evolution of species, according to laws originally fixed,

instead of arbitrary intervention upon each and every occasion, was in this

remarkable work clearly traced out, supported by powerful arguments, and

founded upon facts and observations the accuracy of which no one could

doubt; and a way was thus opened up to a pinnacle, which in a wonderful

degree enlarged the range of vision of those who had the courage to follow

its propounder up the giddy height. It was immediately and successfully

taken to by several of the most eminent of our naturalists accustomed to

philosophical  deductions  from  ascertained  facts                            it was blindly accepted, but
                                                                            ;

misused, by some German and ItaUan speculators, who, in their hurry to

adopt Darwinism before they well understood it, and in their eagerness to

go beyond the point to which the road had been securely marked out by

the author, or to diverge into by-paths which led to precipices and pitfalls,

added to the alarm of the timid ; whilst it was not only shunned, but de-

nounced as fraught with the utmost danger by the great majority who were

Weaccustomed to place tradition above reasoning.                               systematists hesitated

at first to advance in a direction so contrary to that which we had deter-

minately followed for so long a period ; but after a careful study of the facts

and arguments upon which the new course was founded, and of the guide-

posts which had been set in it, we most of us have felt but little doubt of

its safely leading us over difficulties, which we had so long reckoned as in-

surmountable, into a vast and entirely new field of observation, calculated

to give a stability to the results of our labours, of which we had hitherto
formed no conception. The last of the eminent observers of nature who

persistently maintained the independent ci-eation and absolute fixity of spe-

cies (the late distinguished Professor Agassiz) has recently gone from among

us ; and it may now be given as a generally received doctrine, that all natural

methods must be founded on affinities as dependent on consanguinity. Fifteen

years have sufficed to establish a theory, of which the principal points, in as

far as they affect systematic botany, may be shortly stated as follows :

That although the whole of the numerous offspring of an individual plant

resemble their parent in aU main points, there are slight individual differ-

ences between them.

That among the few who survive for further propagation, the great majority,

under ordinary circumstances, are those which most resemble their parent,

and thus the species is continued without material variation.

That there are, however, occasions when certain individuals with slightly

diverging characters may survive and reproduce races in which these diver-

gences are continued even with increased intensity, thus producing Varieties.

That in the course of an indefinite number of genei-ations circumstances

may induce such an increase in this divergency, that some of these new races

will no longer readily propagate with each other, and the varieties become

New Species, more and more marked as the unaltered or less altered races,

descendants of the common parent, have become extinct.

That these species have in their turn become the parents of groups of spe-

cies, i. e. Genera, Orders, &c., of a higher and higher grade according to the

1874.                                                                          D

remoteness of the common parent, and more or less marked according to the

extinction or preservation of unaltered primary or less altered intermediate

forms.

    As there is thus no difference but in degree between a variety and a
species, between a species and a genus, between a genus and order, all disputes
as to the precise grade to which a group really belongs are vain. It is left
in a great measure to the judgment of the systematist, with reference as
much to the use to be made of his method as to the actual state of things,
how far he should go in dividing and subdividing, and to which of the grades
 of division aud subdivision he shall give the names of Orders, Suborders,

 Tribes, Genera, Suljgenera, Sections, Species, Subspecies, Varieties, &c., with
 the consequent nomenclature. In the limitation of his orders, genera, spe-
 cies, &e. he must carefully observe those cases where the extinction of races

 has definitely isolated groups having a common parentage ; and in other

 cases where the preservation of intermediate forms has left no such gaps, he
 is compelled to draw arbitrary lines of distinction wherever it appears to be

 most convenient for use. In the pre-Darwiuian state of the science we were

 taught, and I had myself strongly urged, that species alone had a definite exist-
 ence, and that genera, orders, &c. were moz-e arbitrary, established for prac-
 tical use, and founded on the combination of such characters as appeared the
 most constant in the greater number of species, and therefore the most im-
 portant ; we must now test our species as well as genera or other groups, by

 such evidences as we can collect of affinity derived from consanguinity.

     In valuing these evidences, in estimating the comparative value of cha-

 racters, a new difficulty has arisen, that of distinguishing the two classes of
 characters to which Professor Flower has appropriately given the names of

 essential and adaptive, the former the result of remote hereditary descent,
 the latter the more recent effect of external influences. This distinction is
 often the more difficult, as the essential ones are often only to be found in
 embryos, in the early stages of organs, or are merely indicated by slight
 rudiments requiring close observation to detect them; whilst the adaptive
 ones, of comparatively small systematic importance, are often developed in
 external form, in ramification, spinescence, foliage, &c., and are the most
 striking to the eye. One consequence is, that the systematist of the present

--day sees more and more the necessity of preparing a double arrangement of

 his genera, species, and other groups a natural one according to the best
  evidences of affinity for the purpose of scientific study, aud an artificial clavis
 by which the student can be led to identify genera or species by the more

 readily observed characters, which may only form part, or be but chance

  accompaniments, of the essential ones. The greatest change, however, which

  the adoption of the doctrine has effected in the methodical study of plants
  is the having rendered it necessary, in the case of everj- genus or other group,
  to take into account and specially to estimate the value of all the characters

 --observed- -no one can be taken as so absolute as to obviate the need of con-

  sidering others, no one can be passed over as theoretically wortliless ; and
  whilst this adds immensely to the labour of the systematist and to the calls
  on his judgment, it gives equal increase to the value of the results obtained.

      The principal works through which the systematic botanist contributes to

 --the scientific studj^ of the vegetable kingdom are: 1. General treatises or

  descriptive reviews of the natural orders (Ordines Plantarum) ; 2. Methodical
  ennmeration aud descriptions of genera (Genera Plantarum); 3. Methodical
  enumei'alion and descriptions of species (Species Plantarum) ; 4. Monographs
  of separate orders or genera, subgenera or species ; 5. Floras of separate

countries or districts ; G. Detached and miscellaneous specific descriptions.

Before considering how far the works now complete or in progress answer

our requirements under each of these heads, a few general remarks are sug-

gested with regard to the languages in use.

   In the pursuit of my systematic studies, and especially in the preparation

of my reports and addresses to the Linnean Society, I have had to consult or

refer to botanical publications in no less than fifteen different languages *.

This, to say the least of it, entails the use of a scries of dictionaries which

but a small number of botanists can have access to ; and many an important

observation or discovery recorded remains, for this reason alone, long un-

known to the general botanist. That works intended for the use of the

beginner or local amateur, or exclusively teaching the well-known botany of

a particular country, should be in the familiar language of the country, is a

rule that every one Avill admit the expediency of ; but for purely scientific

treatises and technically descriptive works which all botanists may have to

take cognizance of, and for which the commercial demand may be too limited

to ensure their translation into various languages, it is essential that that

one should be selected which is most likely to be intelligible to the greater

number of students of all countries. With this view Latin had been very

generally adopted during the last and the early portion of the present cen-

tury. It was taught in all European schools, and served even as a vehicle

for general interchange of ideas between the votaries of science of diff'ereut

countries where the study of modern languages was exceptional ; and even
now it is found to be the best suited for technical diagnoses and descriptions

from its concise character and from its susceptibility of being subjected to tech-

nical forms, without jarring upon the conventionalities of living languages

in familiar use. Every botanist must still, therefore, learn to read, and every

descriptive botanist to draw vip, these Latin formulae, notwithstanding the

character of dog-Latin which the scholar may be disposed to charge them

"with ; but general descriptions, treatises, and discussions require a language

Amore thoroughly understood and in familiar use for other purposes.  clas-

sical education is now much less common than it was, and almost unknown

in some countries where science is eagerly pursued. Modern languages are,

on the other hand, much more frequently taught for general use ; and there

are three which at the present day every botanist ought to understand, and

--in one of which he ought to be able to write all three having a rich lite-

rature in every branch to repay the labour of learning them, independently

of science ; these are, French, English, and German.
   French has long been considered the one among modern languages

forming the nearest approach to a common one ; it is easy, comparatively

simple in construction, not overburdened with redundant words, and, above

all, is readily broken up into short phrases, an invaluable qualification for

clearness of methodical exposition. It has long been the recognized diplo-

matic language, and the first foi'eign one taught in most European schools;

and although within my own recollection national animosities may have

from time to time throM'n it into disfavour in Germany and Eastern Europe,

yet it always appears to recover its prestige there in general society. At

the meetings of the botanists of various nations congregated at Florence last

May it was the general medium of intercourse, although the Frenchmen

present were in a very small minority. And in every branch of science or

literature to 'nhich I have paid more or less attention, it possesses more

instructive elementary works, more readily intelligible treatises and clear

expositions of abstruse subjects, than any other language I am acquainted

with. For the botanist, therefore, as Avell as for all naturalists, its study is
still, and I believe will long remain, of first-rate importance.

    The English language has of late years been recommended by more than

иone continental naturalist for general adoption as a vehicle for international

scientific intercourse. It partakes of some of the advantages of both the
French and the German. Though less brilliant, it oflTers more variety than
the former, it is less involved than the latter, and it appears to be capable

of giving more precision and force to argument than either. It is now the

national language of the largest proportion of the civilized population of the
globe, and its use continues steadily to spread out of Europe generally, and

to a certain extent among European naturalists and other educated classes,
especially in eastern and northern Europe. They begin to admit the neces-
sity of consulting our untranslated treatises and memoirs, and our German
and east European botanical correspondents, at least, accept English letters
as readily as French. In southern Europe French is still much more gene-

rally understood ; but even there the objections to the extended use of our

language for botanical works have now, I believe, lost much of their force.
    The German is a more difficult language, much more difficult, indeed, for

the Latin nations of southern and western Europe than for ourselves. Its
construction is involved, its extraordinary copiousness occasions a strain upon
the memory ; but it affords great facilities for giving expression to minutely

distinguished details, whether of fact or of thought. It may thus frequently

 give greater solidity to their theoretical expositions than the French, but is

infinitelj' more difficult to translate ; and to those who are not thoroughly

 used to its intricacies it seems to foster, if not to create, confusion of ideas.

Germany has now, however, so long included so many publishing centres of

 scientific importance, and its language has been so generally used by Scan-
 dinavian and Sclavonian, as well as by their own naturalists, that a sufficient
 acquaintance with it, to study the very numerous works it produces, can no
 longer be dispensed with by the general botanist.

    The Dutch language, notwithstanding the number of scientific working
 naturalists the coimtry has fostered, both at home and in its Malayan colo-
 nies, has too limited a range to be generally studied, and is not likely to
 extend. It is much to be regretted, therefore, that it should have been so
 much made use of for works intended for the use of others as well as of their
 own Subjects. Some of the late Professor Miquel's most valuable essays
 (that, for instance, on the vegetation of Sumatra with relation to its physical
 conditions) remain a sealed book for the botanical community at large. I
 perceive now, however, that their more important papers in the ' Ai-chives
 Neerlandaises ' and some other journals are being printed in French as well
 as in Dutch, and we must hope that so commendable a practice may in future

 be generally adopted.

    The Scandinavian nations, Denmai'k and Sweden, whose men of science

 have included a large proportion of the most eminent naturalists, have always

  felt the objections to the publication of the results of their labours in their

 own language. Linnaeus conducted his foreign correspondence and edited all
 such works as were intended for foreign use in Latin, and his example was
 much followed. In the first half, however, of the present century, both

 Danes and Swedes began to indulge more in the use of their native languages,
 and some important essays, especially on geographical botany' and on the
  cryptogamic section of systematic botany, have appeared in that disguise.
RECENT PROmiESS OP SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.  37

More recently the botanical papers in the Copenhagen Transactions and
Journals are frequently accompanied by a French abstract ; and in Sweden
some of their Natural-History memoirs, such as Morell's ' Monograph of
Spiders,' have been printed exclusively in English. German is also a lan-
guage very generally understood by Swedish men of science, more so amongst
some of them than French or English ; and it cannot be too strongly recom-
mended to them to bear in mind that, at the present day, the study of
Swedish and Danish is not usually treated as more necessary to the general

botanist than that of Dutch.

    Still less is it the case with the Russian language, which, notwithstanding

its poetic beauty, its conciseness, and many other intrinsic advantages,

besides the extent of territory over which it is officially spoken, is far too
uncongenial with those of Western Europe to give any prospect of its being
generally learnt, and the publication in it of any works intended for foreign
circulation cannot be too strongly deprecated. The Academy of Sciences of
St. Petersburgh and the principal Natural-History Society of Moscow accord-
ingly admit in their Transactions and Bulletins memoirs in French, German,
or Latin ; but still there are a few important ones issued by these bodies as
well as by a second Moscow Society, and others at Kazan and Odessa, entirely
in Russian. These are of course ignored by the rest of the botanical world
untU translated or abstracted in one of the western languages. Such is also
the fate of the fortunately very few botanical papers which I have met with
in Polish, Bohemian, and Hungarian publications.

   The Portuguese and Spaniards, with the vast possessions they formeiij'
held in America, where their languages have persisted as national, and those

they still retain (the former in tropical Africa, the latter in the Philippines

and West Indies), have in their time done good work in botany, and have
generally had the good sense to publish in Latin. There are some floras,
however, of their present or former colonies, more used by foreigners than
by themselves, which are entirely in their own languages. But these
languages, are, I believe, not now spreading further, and in America, at least,
English is gaining upon them for business transactions. For the Portuguese

language 1 have little sympathy, for it has always appeared to me harsh and

disagTeeable ; but one cannot but feel some regret that so noble and powerful
a language as the Spanish should now be applied to so little purpose.

   Italian botanical publications are rather numerous and of some importance,
especially in physiological and theoretical botany (their floras are mostly in
Latin) ; the language is also so generally and deservedly admired in a literary
point of view, and so far from difficult to those who are acquainted with
Latin and French, that some knowledge of it might be recommended to
botanists. Yet such general acquaintance with it ought not to be too much
relied upon ; and Italian botanists will do well in continuing to resort to
Latin or Frencb for such works as are intended for the use of foreigners.

And, lastly, with regard to modern Greek, we can only hope that its use wiU

be closely restricted to purposes of local instruction, which is indeed the
character of the few botanical publications I have seen in that language.

  We may now proceed to consider the principal works in systematic botany

recently published or now in progress, under the several heads above

enumerated.

1. Okdines Plantaetjm, or General Expositions of the Orders and Sub-
       orders constituting the Vegetable Kingdom.

   It is to these ' OrdLnes Plantarum ' that we are now obliged to limit our

.

demands for single general histories of all plants. Alph. de CaadoUe, in the
" Reflexions " above referred to, has shown hovf hopeless it is to expect the

completion of any single ' Species Plantarum,' even if limited to the technical

elaboration of the 1.50,000 or more species and subspecies now known, and
a ' Genera Plantarum' has now become a long and tedious labour. But wo

have a right still to hope that a general account of the Vegetable Kingdom,
such as pre-Linnean botanists used to edit, but keeping pace with our

advanced knowledge, may still be issued from time to time, in a single volume,

as the work of a single author, provided he limit himself to the higher groups,
to orders and suborders in number not above a few hundred, neglecting the
lower groups, genera, and species, except for illustration or exemplification.

   In such a work we should expect, for each order or other group illustrated,

the following particulars :

   A(1) diagnosis or short indication of its most important or most generally

prevailing character.

   A(2) more detailed technical description of its general characters, with

indication of known exceptions.

   A(3) discussion of its affinities, including an indication of the line of

demarcation adopted for its separation from the orders into which it may
pass insensibl)', as well as of such aberrant or isolated forms as may lie
betwt n it and some order otherwise separated by a wide gap.

    (4) Its geographical distribution and the modifications of its characters
 which prevail in difi'erent countries.

     (5) Its connexion with extinct forms.
     (6) Its properties and applied relations, industrial, economical, or phar-

 maceutical.

     Such a general history of plants is so useful not only to all classes of
 botanists, but to the followers of other brandies of natural and other science,
 that it is most desirable that it should be drawn up in one or more of the
 most widely diffused modern languages, and accompanied by well-selected

 explanatorj' illustrations.

   We have two works which have fulfilled tlie greater number of the above

 conditions, bringing the science down to the comparatively recent periods

--when they were first prepared : Lindley's ' Vegetable Kingdom,' published

 in 184-5, in English, somewhat modified in Endlicher's ' Enchiridion Botani-

 cum ' in Latin in 1846, and reissued by the author, with many additional
 notes, in 1853 ; and Le Maout and Decaisue's ' Traite de Botanique,' pub-

 lished in French in 1 868, translated into English by Mrs. Hooker, with
 considerable additions and some modifications by Dr. Hooker, in 1873.

     Lindley's ' Vegetable Kingdom ' was chiefly founded upon a large number

 of original observations, notes, and other materials he had collected and
 partly worked up in contemplation of a ' Genera PJantarum,' a work which the
 increasing calls upon his time and thoughts obliged him in the first place to

 postpone, and which he finally gave up on the appearance of the first parts

  of Endlicher's ' Genera.' These materials were elaborated with great care
 into his * Natural System of Botany,' 2nd edition, 1836, and afterwards

  extended, chiefly by compilation, but always under the guidance of his very

  extensive practical knowledge of plants, into the ' Vegetable Kingdom,'
 which long remained a most valuable resume of all that was important to

 know of the 303 orders into which the subject matter was divided. This
 work, however, is now nearly thirty years (or the greater part of the original

  matter nearly forty years) old, and is thrown quite out of date by the great
  progress the science has made during that period. The present proprietors

this would scarcely be fair to the memory of the talented author. There are

many errors in it which he would have corrected and which must be cor-

rected, there are many views which he would now have modified and which

must be modified, but it would be impossible to tell to M'hat extent he would

have admitted such corrections and modifications ; and they at any rate would

bear so important a part upon the whole plan, that the new editors would

not be justified in issuing the altered work under the sanction of his name.

--It must be in a great measure rewritten, as will clearly appear on conside-

ration of the following particulars :

The technical characters of each order would be carefully checked in

every particular. They were often taken from some one or two genera sup-

posed to be typical, and in some instances have been proved inapplicable even

to the great bulk of the order, or to have been founded wholly on error. In

many cases they may require considerable extension as to particulars which

have proved to be more important than they were originally estimated.

The affinities given require reconsideration throughout. Lindley insisted

on the principle, which was at that time generally prevalent amongst the

first naturalists, that affinity was no more than correspondence in structure,

more or less modified in proportion to its connexion with the phenomena of

life, and that an absolute scale of the relative value of characters founded on

their degree of constancy could be drawn up, so as to form a practical test of

natural afiinities ; and it was from an adherence to this rule that, in grouping
his orders, he was led to dissociate such natural allies as Apocyneae and

Asclejnadese or Ericaceae and Vacciniese in order to class them with others
universally acknowledged to be more remote. The new light thrown on the

subject by the doctrine that affinity is the result of consanguinity, would,

there is very little doubt, have been taken fullj^ advantage of bj^ Lindley

himself. He would have acknowledged that there is no character whicn
may not be of very different importance in different orders or genera, or even

in different countries in one and the same order or genus, and that the true

characters of all natural assemblages are not so extremely simple as he then

beheved them to be (see ' Yeg. Kingd.' Introd. p. xxix). The adoption of
this theory would entail the rewriting and extending the important para-

graphs introduced by Lindley immediately after the technical characters of

each order, and destined to indicate the most generally constant features and

the most important aberrant forms exhibited in it, and tlieir connexion, near

or distant, with other orders or isolated genera or species.

Geograjihical distribution has, since Lindley wrote, acquired great impor-

tance with reference to natural method, as well as forming now an essential

item in tlie general history of plant-races. Although never neglected in the

'Vegetable Kingdom,' it requires much further development, with a resume

of such evidences as the recent progress of the science has collected, respect-

ing the presumed origin and extension of the several orders. And to this

should be added a reference to the localities and the presumed geological

periods among the remains of which well-authenticated representatives of

any order may have been found. This, however, should only extend to the

few cases where the evidences are really satisfactory. The numerous

palseontological identifications derived from impressions of leaves only, upon

which so many expositions of ancient distribution have been founded, are

for the most part mere guesses, more likely to lead astray by giving a false

support to preconceived theories than to supply any sound data for the

history of plant-races.
--40 REPORT 1874.

The properties and applied relations, the " qualitates et usus " of Endli-

cher's 'Enchiridion,' are very fully exhibited by Lindley, and would only

require revising in conformity with the advance of the science of applied

botany, much promoted of late by various important works and essays, and

in no small degree by the establishment of the Kew Museum.

   The sequence of orders adopted in the ' Vegetable Kingdom ' is a very
objectionable one. The practical convenience of following the CandoUean

sequence in its main features, until some other one shall have been pro-

pounded which shall prove to be such an improvement as to ensure its

general adoption, has been too clearly brought forward by Dr. Hooker and

others to make it necessary for me to repeat the reasons adduced. Lindley

felt its defects, as we all do, but failed in his repeated attempts to remedy

them. He was, indeed, so little satisfied with any of the four different
systems he successively proposed, that he adopted none of them for his own

herbarium, in which he arranged the orders alphabetical^. Brongniart's

arrangement has found its way into a few French works, and Endlicher's

into a few German ones ; but the very numerous ones proposed by other
French, German, and Swedish systematists have rarely been followed by more

than the individual authors, and many of them have only been broached in

text-books without ever having been put into practice. The Candollean

series is so generally adopted in floras, that these attempts to interfere with

its universality have hitherto only ^iroduced confusion.

   To sum up, it appears to me that the most useful work a competent
botanist could now apply himself to would be a new ' Vegetable Kingdom,'

founded on that of Lindley, but extended and modified according to the

above suggestions.

   Le Maout and Decaisne's ' Traite de Botanique ' is an excellent and most
valuable work, biinging down the science, in most respects, to the year

1868, taking well the place of Lindley's ' Vegetable Kingdom,' and now our

standard history of plants. With great original merit it is still further im-

proved by Hooker's notes and additions, including a rearrangement of the

293 orders according to the Candollean sequence ; and the illustrations, many
of them original, from Decaisne's own drawings, may be thoroughly depended

upon for that most essential of all qualities, their correctness. Yet in some

respects it seems to require rewriting, which of course could not be done by

an editor. Independently of a few oversights and accidental errors, there

are some partial views which are more or less out of date, and the general

principles followed are essentially pre-Darwinian. How far the French

authors may or may not be prepared to adopt the theory of evolution does

not appear, it is not in any manner alluded to ; but the old doctrine that
affinities are to be determined by a calculation of resemblances, estimated

according to a fixed scale of the relative value of characters, is as absolutely

insisted upon by Decaisne and Le Maout as it was by Lindley, and is to a

certain degree practically carried out in this and others of the principal

aiithor's excellent systematic works, with the usual result. Some of the
groupings of species or genera, which, when tested by the value assigned

a priori to the characters used, ought to be highly natural, have proved, on

the contrary, to be purely artificial. This, however, is not frequently the

case with Decaisne                                                                                                  he knows too well how to appreciate natural affinities to
                                                                                                                 ;

follow strictly in practice the rules so stringently inculcated in theory.

1 can scarcely include Baillon's ' Histoire des Plantes ' amongst methodical

' Ordines Plantarum,' for there is no method in it ; it is rather a series of

essays or notes on the principal genera of various orders taken at random.

intended, in the first instance, to illustrate Payer's views on organogenesis,

and thence enlarged into desultory reviews of the orders, exhibiting in many
iustances undoubted talent, containing a number of shrewd observations,

accompanied by beautiful illustrations, and followed by technical characters
of genera, in which but very little is original, being mostly transcripts from
our ' Genera Plantarum' and some other works. The result is a work not sufii-
ciently concise, exact, or methodical for scientific reference, too much encum-

bered with technical matter for general popular use, although it may well

adorn a scientific drawing-room table. It was begun in 1867, and four
volumes and a half are now completed. These, however, scarcely embrace
one sixth of the vegetable kingdom ; and if the same plan is followed
throughout, the work must ultimately extend to some five and twenty to

thirty volumes. An English translation is in progress, two volumes being

already published. That BaiUon shoiild have undertaken so cumbersome a
work, with so little of that clear method for which his countrymen are justly
celebrated, is the more to be regretted, as the theory of organogenesis, which

it has been his great object to develop, is one of the greatest aids recently
introduced into the investigation and determination of natural affinities,
wherever it has been critically appKed and properly checked by other classes

of observations.

2. Genera Plantarum, or Systematic Descriptions of aU the Genera con-

        stituting the Vegetable Kingdom.

   This is the utmost extent to which we can expect to see all known plants

methodized and described within the limits of a single work by a single
author ; and even in that work they can only be treated of scientifically and
technically for the use of the botanist, without the generalities and accessory
details which adapt the ' Ordines Plantarum ' to a wider circulation . Taking
for genera those groups of species, those plant-races of an intermediate grade
between the order and the species, which appear to be the best defined in
the present state of nature, and to which the generic nomenclature can be
applied with the greatest practical advantage, we should estimate them as
rather above eight thousand for Phenogams and vascular Cryptogams, and at
least a thousand more for cellular Cryptogams. Such a work can still be
brought within the compass of about three manageable volumes. Indis-
pensable as it always is for the working botanist, the demand for it would

never be sufiicient to admit of its being simultaneously issued in the three
generally diffused modern languages, and it therefore usually has been, and

will still be, most usefully drawn up in botanical Latin.
    Since the introduction of the natural method, there have been but two

good complete ' Genera Plantarum,' the original one of Jussieu in 1789 and
that of Endlicher, with its supplements ranging over the five years from
 1836 to 18-10 ; the latter was the work of a clear methodical head, applied
with great care and assiduity to a stock of materials very fair for the time,
and the general plan is good. But it was necessarily in a great measure a

compUatiou, and it affords no means of judging how far the characters given

 had been confirmed by actual observation. This would have been the more

useful, as it is evident that in many cases ordinal characters are repeated
 under each genus upon no other authority than that the genus had been
 referred by its proposer to the order in question. The work had, moreover,
 become quite out of date ; and the need of a new one was so much felt, that

 Dr. Hooker and myself undertook the preparation of a ' Genera Plantarum
 on a i)lan which long experience had led us to hope might be an improved

oue. The first part was published in 1862, and the whole of the first
volume (completing the Polypetalous Dicotyledons) was, with the aid of a
supplement, brought down to the year 1867. The first half of the second
volume, issued last year, contains nearly half the Gamopetalous Dicotyledons,
the remainder of which, completing the second volume, will, wa hope, be in
the printer's hands early next winter. Monochlamydous Dicotyledons and
Monocotyledons will probably fill a third volume.

   The plan which we have set to ourselves has been to prefix to each volume

a methodical diagnosis or short conspectus of the most striking characters of
the several orders contained in the volume, and under each order to give the

following particulars :

    (1) The general characters of the order.

   A(2) short sketch of its geographical distribution.

   An(3) equally abridged sketch of its affinities.
   (4) An enumeration of the aberrant forms observed in individual genera,
an addition which is, I believe, here introduced for the first time, we having

both of us long felt the want of it in general works.

  A --(5) conspectus of the genera that is, a short and as much as possible

contracted exposition of the most salient characters of each genus, as a guide

to the determination of plants. Where the order is large enough, or hetero-
morphous enough, to be subdivided into distinct suborders or tribes, the

tribual characters are given in this conspectus ; and where the tribes are
numerous, as in Leguminosoe, Umbellifei'ie, Kubiaceae, and Composite, a short
conspectus of them precedes that of the genera. This arrangement into
tribes has been everywhere thoroughly investigated, and in the case of most

of the large orders entirely recast.

   (6) An enumeration of genera which are either so nearly allied that they

might be supposed to belong to the order, or which have been erroneously
included in it, or have been so imperfectlj- described as to be wholly doubtfal.

    (7) Then follow the detailed characters of each genus, with an evaluation
of its extent, its geographical distribution, a full synonymy, references to
plates illustrating it, and such occasional notes as appeared necessary on
affinities, on genera confounded with it, or in our opinion unadvisedly sepa-
rated from it. Where the genera are sufficiently large or varied, the characters
of its primary sections are entered into.

   We have taken care to indicate the genera, very few in number, of

which we have been unable to examine any specimen, and the characters
which we have not personally investigated, indicating always the sources
whence those we give have been taken ; and we have also thought it neces-

sary to pay particular attention to the typographical details of the work, an

element of clearness which is sadly neglected in many German and some

French systematic works.

3. Species Plantaktjm, or Systematic Enumeration and Descriptions of all

       known species.

    In the above-quoted article in the ' Natural-History Review ' for October
 1864, I gave a sketch of the last attempts made to pulilish a complete ' Spe-
 cies Plantarum,' including a detailed history of the great work of modern

 days, De Candolle's ' Prodromus,' which I need not now repeat. This work
has now been brought to a conclusion by the issue, last autumn, of the

 seventeenth volume, forty-nine years after the publication of the first. Its

 celebrated originator began in 1818 a ' Systema Vegetabilium,' with aU the

details of the so-called new editions of Liuna}us, but drawn up and arranged

accorJiug to the principles of the uataral method. After the issue of the
second volume iu 1821, he fouud himself obliged to give up the task as
already far beyond the means of a single life, and substituted an abridged
' Prodromus,' which he long continued, almost unassisted, at first with a vague

idea of its being preliminary to a more detailed work. As that hojje was
finally extinguished, and especially since the elder De Candolle's death, the
' Prodromus ' has been gradually extended into a series of concise monographs
by different authors, differing much in merit, but drawn up as nearly as

--could be according to one plan, and uniformly printed in the successive

volumes of a single work the younger De Candolle, besides working up
many of the orders himself, having gone through the tedious labour of edit-
ing them, giving to the botanical world a splendid monument of industry
and perseverance, which will long be of great practical utility. It is now

 nominally complete, but only as to Dicotyledons, and the first volumes are

 quite out of date. They are, however, to a certain degree, supplemented by
 Walpers's ' Repertorium ' and 'Annales ;' and the botanist has thus, in thirty
 volumes, a very fair repertoiy of all described Dicotyledons up to a recent
 date. For Monocotyledons he has only Kuuth's ' Enumeratio,' which extends
 to little more than half the class, having been put an end to by the author's

 death in 1850. For the remaining portion of Monocotyledons, for Crypto-

 gams, and for all recently discovered species or recent methodizations of old
 ones, he must have recourse to detached monographs and floras, which are
 henceforth likely to be his only resoui'ce for the history of species. Alphouse

 de Candolle, in the above-quoted " Keflexious," has shown how little chance

 there is of a uniform ' Species Plantarum ' being again undertaken with any

 prospect of its being brought to a successful conclusion. He calculates that

 it would require fifteen or sixteen years' labour of some five-and-twenty
 botanists, working under the direction of about eight to ten editors, a com-

 bination which it is highly improbable will ever be practically brought to

 bear. His calculations may, however, be a little overcharged. He supposes

 that each botanist would not work up more than 300 species in a year
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

 that may be the case in a monograph when every detail is to be gone through
 from personal observation, but this would not now be necessary in a general

 ' Species Plantarum,' which would be most useful as a concise methodical com-

 pilation. Much of the labour expended on the ' Prodromus' and on detached
 monographs and floras need not be repeated. As pre-Linnean synonyms,
 upon which so much time was formerly expended, have now been generally
 given up, so, for post-Linuean synonyms, there would now be no use in

 repeating those given in the ' Prodromus ' and other works compiled from,
 unless where errors have been detected ; and this alone would save a great

 deal of time, labour, and expense. And with regard to the greater number

  of the orders or genera contained in the recent volumes of the ' Prodromus
 and the best modern monographs and floras, a careful and intelligent
  abridgment of the specific characters without reexamination is all that would

  be necessary.
     It might be useful to consider what would be the requisites of any such

  abridged 'Species Plantarum' or 'Synopsis,' restricted within limits which
  should render it possible, at least as to phenogamous plants.

    We might expect it to follow the sequence of orders the -most generally

  adopted, that of the ' Prodromus' and of our ' Genera Plantarum,' with such

  slight modifications only as the progress of science has rendered necessary,

  without attempting hypothetical improvements.

     To each order and to each genus should be given short diagnostic cha-

racters, abridged from tlie last ' Genera Plantarum ' or other best sources,

selecting chietiy those which are most essential and contrasted, but including
also the most striking or the most general amongst the adaptive ones, and a

general indication of geographical range, with careful reference to the works
where more details are to be found.

Where the orders or genera are large, a synopsis or conspectus of the

principal divisions and subdivisions would be useful.
   To each species should be given :

(1) The name.

   (2) The diagnosis, specific character, or abridged description, which are

but different names for the same thing, and which it appears to me would

be always more satisfactory in the nominative than in the ablative case.
After the example of LinuEeus, and based upon the doctrine of the fixity of

species, it has been almost universally the custom to distinguish the specific
diagnosis and description, the former to contain the absolutely distinctive

characters (any deviation from which would exclude a plant from the spe-

cies), the latter to aid the student in identifying a plant by the enumeration

of characters which, though general, might vary in the same species, or

which it may possess in common with other species. In order to mark the
more strongly this difference, the diagnosis, when in Latin, has been given

in the form of the ablative absolute, the description in the ordinary nomina-

tive form. There is, however, nothing really absolute in nature. There is

no class of characters which may not occasionally admit of exceptions ; and

although care should be taken to select the most important and constant
ones, yet, in some instances, those which are generally discarded as too

variable for a diagnosis, such as dimensions, colour, &c., may yet be most

useful, or even essential, for the distinction of species or even of genera.

WeThese diagnoses, moreover, to be useful should be short.  cannot now

restrict them to the twelve-word law of Linnaeus, but a twelve-line ablative

diagnosis is an absolute nuisance.

   (3) Eeferenee to the source whence the diagnosis is taken, to the work
where a further description, the synonymy, and history of the species are to
be found, and to any plates where it may be satisfactorily represented and

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

all further synonymy should be avoided, except where it may be necessary

to refer to descriptions, names, or modifications published since the one

specially abstracted from.

(4) The habitat of the species.

    (5) Occasional notes on affinities or other points in the history of the

species should be very sparingly indulged in, and only when they may assist

essentially in the provisional determination and elucidation of a' plant. All
discussions on doubtful points and all details shoiild be reserved for mono-
graphs or separate papers, where alone they can really tend to the advance-
ment of the science.

   Each volume of the ' Synopsis ' would of course be accompanied by a full
index of genera, species, and such synonyms as it may have been found

necessary to give.

   The whole work would be so indispensable to botanists of all nations, that,

like the ' Genera Plantarum,' it should be entirely in botanical Latin, which,
moreover, from the number of conventional expressions to which a technical
meaning has been assigned, is specially suited for short diagnoses.

   No new species should be first published in this ' Synopsis.' Nothing has

tended more to produce confusion in systematic botany than the publication
of real or supposed new species, with short diagnoses, unattended by any full

description or detailed indications of its affinities. &c. However carefully
the diaguosis may be woi'ded so as to distinguish the species from those
previously published, it would bo insufficient for its identification, and full
descriptions would be inadmissible from the plan of the work. At the same

time it is to be expected that the author, in preparing the ' Synopsis,' should

meet with new forms, which he may be desirous to make known, in order
to render his work as complete as possible. But his course should be to give

their full history in a separate monograph, to which, when published, he

could refer in the ' Synopsis.' He should here not only thus avoid all addition

to the numerous puzzles with which the science is overloaded from insuffi-
cient description, but strictly abstain from all mention of manuscript and
other names which, according to the recognized rules of nomenclature, are

not admitted as sufficiently published.

   The grade of plant-race to which the specific name and diagnosis should

be attached, would be the species in the Linuean sense, which, though not
susceptible of a strict definition, is pretty generally understood amongst

botanists, whether they may designate it as a true species, a Linuean, or a
compound species. The ' Synopsis' might also distinguish marked varieties

whose admission or rejection as species might be doubtful ; but the innume-
rable forms variously termed varieties, subspecies, or critical species should
be passed over in silence, as their admission would simply render a general
work impossible, and a more partial one comparatively useless. The enume-
ration and distinction of the various forms of Brasska campestn's and oleracea,

of Pisnm sativum, Viola tricolor, &c. may be serviceable to the agriculturist
or gardener, that of the forms of Hubus fruticosus may be interesting to

the investigator of the flora of a limited district, but they are only useless
encumbrances to the general systematist as well as to the naturalist in other

branches who would have to make use of the ' Synopsis ; ' and the names and
diagnoses of two hundred forms of Draha verna would be a simple nuisance,

of no use whatever to any one*.

   Taking the species, therefore, in the Linnean sense, we should, with Alph. de
CandoUe, estimate the number of Phenogams now published, or in the course

   * The mode of dealing with species which in the present state of vegetation pass into
each other through a series of interiuediate forms which canaot fairly be supposed to be

hybrids, is well disoussed by JJageli in a series of papers in the ' Sitzungsberichte ' of the

Munich Academy for 1866, the result of careful observation chiefly of the genus Hiera-

cium. After admitting liimself to have been originally a firm believer in the fixity of

species and a strong advocate of the hybrid jjarentage of the large number of intermediate

forms observed, he acknowledges his conversion to the doctrine of evolution. " In the
present state of the science " he sees " no other possibility than the assumption that the

spec'es of Hieraciiini have arisen by transmutation either from extinct or from still sur-
viving forms, and that there are stiU persistent a great number of the intermediate stages

(races) formed either by the original differentiation of the extinct species, or in the course

of the transformation of one yet living species into the diverging forms." Sitciingsbcr.

1866, i. 330.

In a subsequent paper he shows that the genus Hieraciuvi affords instances of great

diversity in the degree to which differentiation has attained and in the definiteness of the

species estabhshed by the extinction of intermediates. He instances, amongst those to

--which he would in their present state assign the rank of species :

1. Aggregate forms, such as H. pilosella, which cannot as yet be sepai-ated into distinct

groups. H. Hop]-)canum, Schult., H. Pelleferianum, Merat, H. pseiidopiloseUa, Jen., are

not yet sufficiently isolated by the disappearance of intermediate forms to be ranked as

species.

2. Forms which, by the disnppearance of closely allied ones, have attained sharper and

more fixed limits, and yet between which isolated intermediates may still be found, are

exemplified 'oy H. auricula, H. auranfiacum. and H. pilosella, or by H. muroruni, H. vil-

Ontostim, and H. glaii.ciou.  the other hand, it is uncertain whether the relations of

Aand 120,000.  competent botanist would readily get through three or four

thousand in a year. In the ' Flora Australiensis ' I had no difficulty in pre-

paring a thousand to twelve hundred in the year, and that was all original

work, entailing the personal examination of every species often in numerous

specimens, and a long and tedious investigation of synonyms. Such a com-

pilation as I have above characterized would require, it is true, a competent
knowledge of plants and occasional verifications ; but still the labour would be
reduced by at least two thirds ; and 300 species a month, with a month or six
weeks' vacation, would be no great strain upon the mind. Thus three or four
botanists might complete the synopsis of ten thousand species in the year

and the general synoptical enumeration of all known Phenogams would not

be beyond the range of possibility, however little chance there may be of my

living to see it commenced.

Cryptogamic details require the cooperation of more special botanists, who

have already furnished us with monographs or synopses of some of the

primary groups. In Ferns, Hooker's ' Species Filicum ' is very complete, and

is brought down to the present day by his ' Synopsis Filicum,' edited by Baker,
of which a new edition is now ready. For Mosses, the last general work

is Carl Mueller's ' Species Muscorum,' completed in 1851, since which date
the number of species described has been at least doubled. Modern musco-

logists have, however, so much lowered their generic and specific standards,

that they have placed the study of this most interesting class of plants almost

Abeyond the reach of the general botanist.  monographer who would boldly

reestablish the species according to Linnean principles, and group them in a
manageable number of genera, treating the lower grades as subspecies only,

disencumbering the binomial nomenclature from them, would render a gi-eat

service to science. In Hepaticse there has been no general ' Species ' since that

of Gottsche and Lindenberg, begun in 1844, and, by means of supplements,
brought down to 1847. Lichens are still more in arrear. Nylnnder began,
indeed, a new ' Synopsis ' in 1867, but it has never been continued. In Alga?,
Agardh's ' Species Algarum,' commenced in 1848, was completed in 1863;
and Kiilzing's Thycologia' and ' Species Algarum,' issued in 1849, have,
through the nineteen volumes of his ' Tabula,' been brought down to 1869.
The enormous class of Fungi is much more complicated, and their sludy much
more specialized than any other branch of systematic botany; and although
mycologists, no more than phenogamists, have at present any general com-
prehensive systematic work, they have the advantage of Streinz's 'Ncmen-
clator,' a convenient general index to the i.umeroiis detached monographs
and papers descriptive of fungi.

KECENT PROGRESS OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.  47

Species and primary varieties instead of limiting himself to orders and tribes.
They are at the present day amongst the most important botanical works.
They are required by the systematist for the identification of plants, and by
the general naturalist as the source whence he is to derive the data he requires

respecting individual species in theoretical, geographical, physiological, or

applied botany. This preparation has been recognized as the best exercise
for the young botanist ; and monographs of difficult ordei's have been re-
ceived as most valuable contributions from some of the most eminent heads of

the science.

   Our requirements for a complete monograph are analogous to those we

--expect in ' Ordincs ' and ' Genera Plantarum,' methodical arrangement, tech-

nical diagnoses and descriptions, indications of geographical distribution,
" qualitates et usus," and occasional notes on affinities and systematic limits,
including an investigation of synonyms, well selected illustrations adding
always to the practical value. The technical diagnoses and descriptions for
the use of the systematist ought invariably to be drawn up in botanical Latin

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

the more general matter would usually be more readily written, and often
much more intelligible, in one of the three general modern languages.

    This similarity required in the histories of orders, genera, and species
has not, however, been hitherto generally acknowledged, and could not even
have been admitted so long as it was believed that there was an essential

--difl'erence between the groups between the definite fixity of species and

 the moi'e arbitrary limitation of genera and orders. In early systematic
works, therefore, whilst the definitions of orders and genera were single

--and in ordinary phraseology, it was thought necessary, in the case of species,

 to give a double definition a diagnosis containing the supposed fixed

 characters, by which the species could be absolutely tested, and therefore
 expressed in the ablative absolute, and a description admitting all classes of
 characters in the ordinary form of phraseology. As the number of species
 increased, greater extension Avas habituallj* given to both diagnosis and de-
 scription, till the}' became unwieldy for use, without some short indication
 of the most striking points to be attended to. This has been done in two
 ways, either by prefixing to the group of species described a tabular clavis or
 a short conspectus of the contrasted characters to which attention is specially
 called, or by italicizing them in the long diagnosis. The former course en-
 tails often the useless repetition of the same characters tliree times over, in
 the clavis, in the diagnosis, and in the description ; the latter, seeing that the
 italicized words are usually adjectives, often occasions confusion and loss of

 time in searching for the substantives to which they belong. Now that it is

 laid down that there is no more absolute fixity in a species than in an order
 or genus, the complication is no longer necessary ; there is no more need of an
 absolute test in the one case than in the others. In all we want a short

 indication of the most prominent contrasted characters for approximate or
 preliminarj" determination, prefixed to the detailed description for subsequent

 verification.

  --These short characters are given in three difi"erent forms : 1st, a tabular

 clavis, more or less on the dichotomous principle, as is now frequently exem-

 plified in local floras ; 2nd]y, a conspectus prefixed to the whole group of
  species; 3rdly, the short character prefixed to each description. In
  elaborate monographs, where the descriptions are long, the conspectus is pro-
  bably the most satisfactory form ; in more concise ones, where the descrip-
  tions are short, the tabular clavis will be found more useful. In synopses,

  where the descriptions are reduced to occasional notes or limited to new
--48 REPORT 1874.

Bpecles, tlie short characters or diagnosia (which, I think, should never be

omitted) would form the body of the work, and the notes and descriptions,

when they occur, should be given under each diagnosis.

It should always be borne in mind by the monographist that the great test

of the quality of a descriptive work lies in short descriptions, diagnosis, and

conspectus or clavis. Any tyro with a little practice can draw up long descrip-

tions oi specimens, fairly detailing every organ ; but the selecting the characters

necessary to give a good idea of a sjiecies in a short description requires a

thorough knowledge of the subject and a methodical mind. Still more diffi-

cult is it to prepare a good clavis. After half a century of experience in using

as well as in making these keys, I find that I have failed in some of those on

which I had spent the greatest pains ; and in some floras I have met with

tabular keys which are in many respects rather impediments than aids to the

determination of plants. At the same time a successful clavis or contrasted

--conspectus is an excellent test of the quality of a method of the appropriate

grouping into genera, sections, and species.

Really good monographs are not very numerous, and several of them not

very recent. Some of the best among complete monographs have proceeded

from the French school ; and I may refer as models to liichard's Conifers,

Adrien de Jussieu's Malpighiacese, Decaisne's Mistletoe and Lardizabalete,

Weddel's Urticefe, Tulasne's Monimiace^, and others. Their illustrations also,

as well as some of the German ones, far exceed our own in neatness, clearness,

and correctness of analytical detail. For more concise and technical mono-

graphs some of the recent volumes of the ' Prodromus ' aftbrd good examples.

Amongst the worst I have had occasion to refer to are De Vriese's detailed

monograph of Goodenovieae and Steudel'smorc concise synopsis of Glumacese.

The Germans have of late years done but little in this respect beyond what

has been incidental to the ' Flora Brasiliensis.' In England the principal recent

ones have been Hiern's Ebenaceas, remarkable for the scrupulous care with

which the minutest details have been worked out, and Miers's Menispermaceae,

the value of which we fully recognize, although we do not accept the low

grades to which he assigns the rank of genera and species respectively. Some

good partial ones have appeared in the Swedish and Danish as well as our

own Transactions ; and we have had excellent Russian and North- American

monographic memoirs, limited, however, to plants of their own territories,

and therefore scarcely coming under the present head.

The orders now most in need of the labours of able and methodical mono-

graphista are, in the first place, the Monocotyledon ous ones. The largest of

them, that  of  the Orchideae, was once well  worked  up by Lindley                                                                but the
                                                                                                                                ;

enormous additions made to it since thesfe curiously diversified plants have

been brought into fashion by horticultui'ists have thrown the ' Genera et

Species Orchidearum ' quite out of date. The next two in point of number,

Graminere and Cyperaceae, have been imdertaken chiefly by Germans ; and if

Trinius, Kunth, and jSees von Esenbeck had partially cleared up the confusion

which prevailed among them, Steudel has in a great measure contributed to
throw them into a worse chaos than before. Munro, who has long made the

Graminere a subject of special study, has as yet only published his monograph

of BambusesE. In Cyperaceae, Bockelcr's desultory descriptions of those of

the Berlin Herbarium are sometimes perhaps rather obstacles than aids to

a general systematic acquaintance with the order. Masters's monograph of

Restiaceao is limited to the African species. Klatt's Irideae do not very well

bear the test of practical use. Martius's splendid work on Palms requires

already much supplementing. Baker is now rendering good service in working
       RECENT PROORESS OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANV.                                 49

up the Liliaceous groups ; but some of the remaiuiug orders appear to have

becu almost entirelj' neglected.

   Among Dicotyledons the orders which I would particularly recommend as

the subject of specific monographs are those which are contained in the first

volume of the ' Prodromus,' and more especially such as comprise a large
number of plants from the temperate and mountain-regions of the northern

hemisphere (e. g. llanunculacefe, Cruciferoe, many genera of Papilionacea?,

Rosacea, &c.) ; and this not only, for the purpose of methodizing the data sup-

plied by the numerous writers on local floras, but with a view to the careful
and intelligent, but merciless excision of the overwhelming numbers of races
of lower grades which have, to the great detriment of science, been allowed
to rank with those legitimately deserving the name of species. Tropical and

southern orders are so much within the scope of the great floras now in

course of publication, that special monographs, except as connected with those

works, are not in such immediate demand.
   Monographs of variable or ill-defined species have also their importance, if

worked out with a view to ascertaining the extent to which, and the circum-
stances under which, a species varies or is connected with others, and not
for the sole purpose of dividing and subdividing it into races of a lower grade,
to receive the same binomial nomenclature as the normal or compound species.
Such a monograph should comprise the history of the species throughout the
area it occupies, the investigation of the modifications which its several organs
undergo in different localities, of the extent to which the divergencies are
carried out under .different circumstances, of the relative numbers (that is, of
the frequency or rarity) of the divergent forms, of the extraneous circum-

stances (such, for instance, as the vicinity of allied species &c.) which may be

--supposed to have influenced these divergencies every thing, in short, which

might tend to show whether the variability is an indication of a progressive
differentiation of a flourishing race, or a temporary result of hybrid fertiliza-
tion, or the immediate effect of climatological or other conditions affecting the
individual rather than the race. The working out such a monograph in
some one or two species would be highly instructive to the general botanist,
and the data obtained might consolidate the foundations of more general

speculations. It may even be useful to define and to give subordinate names

to those varieties which approach the state of distinctness which might entitle
them to rank as species ; but the technical defining of the slight diversities of
form assumed by a species in a limited locality, however constant those varie-

ties may there be found, can be of little interest but to the inhabitants of that

locality, and the giving them names as of species to be receivecl by general
botanists is only adding to the encumbrances with which the science is over-

loaded, without a single corresponding advantage.

5. Floras, or Histories of the Plants of particular countries or districts.

    Floras, like monographs, are histories of plants so limited that the author

can descend to species ; but the limit is geographical instead of systematic.

The general requirements as to their contents are the same as in respect of
Ordines Plantarum and Monographs, but with greater variety in the details,
according to the class of persons for whose use they are intended. If the
country of which the flora is given is large and the civilized inhabitants com-
paratively few, the work is chiefly useful to the general botanist, and requires

special attention to the technically systematic portion in botanical Latin.

Where the geographical extent is more limited, or the science generally cul-

tivated amongst its inhabitants, the general description and history should be

1874.                                         T'
--50 REPORT 1874.

more extended, and the local language may be admitted or preferred accord-

--ing to circumstances. The more botany is cultivated in a country, the more

variety mey be given to its floras a scientifically morphological one for a

text-book in classes, an easy descriptive one for the beginner and amateur, a
very fully detailed one for study at home, an abridged synopsis for a com-
panion in the field. In all, correctness and clearness of method and language
are the first qualities requisite; and -wherever any instruction or information
beyond the means of determining plants is the object, geographical distribu-
tion (without as well as within the special area of the flora) is a most essen-
 tial point to be attended to. It is to local floras that the general botanist
 must have recourse for most of the data he requires for the investigation of
 the history and development of plant-races ; and his reliance upon the cor-

 rectness of the facts supplied depends much upon the intrinsic evidence of a

 careful comparison on the part of the author of his plants with those of coun-
 tries adjoining to or otherwise connected with his own. It tends also vei-y

 much to enlarge the ideas of a local botanist to learn how very widely spread

 are species which he has been accustomed tacitly or expressly to consider

 rare local creations, and how very differently plants may be distributed or

 varied in other countries from what he has observed at home. Exotic dis-
 tribution is, however, a point very little attended to in many of our best
 modern floras. I well recollect the interest that it gave to the first in which
 I met with it, Cambessedes's enumeration of the plants of the Balearic
 Islands, published in 1827 ; but his example was but rarely followed. More
 recently, I believe, I was the first to introduce it into British floras. Dr.
 Hooker has paid particular attention to it in all his systematic works ; it is
 one of the conditions introduced by the late Sir WUliam Hooker in his plans
 for the series of Colonial Floras, and has been partially attended to by some of

 the contributors to the great work on Brazilian plants. "We may hope, there-

 fore, to see it gradually included in the standard continental floras, as well as

 in more local ones. It is gratifying to observe that in that of Dorsetshire,
 just published by Mr. Manscl-Pleydell, special indications are given of the
  species which extend to the opposite coast of Normandy.

    In several of my Linnean Addresses, especially in those of 1866 and 1871,

  as well as in two articles in the ' Natural-History Review ' (one on Maxi-

 mowitz's "Amur Flora" in April 1861, the other on "South-European
 Floras " in July 18G4) I had occasion to enter into many details relating to

  the Floras recently published or in progress, which it would be superfluous

 now to repeat. I may only state generally that those of the central and

  northern States of Europe are well kept up. Lange and "WUlkomm's
  Prodromus of Spanish Plants has very recently made a step in advance by

 the issue of the first part of the third and last volume, which it may be hoped
 will be now soon complete. Parlatore's Italian Flora gives no such pro-

  mise, though it still di-ags its long pages slowly on. The vegetation of the
  eastern portion of the vast Russian empire is being thoroughly and scienti-
  fically investigated by Maximowitz. Boissiers much-wanted ' Flora Orien-

  talis ' has reached the end of Polypetala; in its second volume, and a third is

  said to be far advanced. The still more important * Flora Indica ' is at

  length fairly afloat ; two parts, by various authors, under the enlightened
  editorship of Dr. Hooker, are on sale, and a third is nearlj^ ready. The

  'Flora Australiensis ' reached its sixth volume last summer ; and if health and

  strength be spared me, I hope to complete the seventh and last next summer.

  Weddell is, I understand, preparing the third and last volume of his ' Chloris

  Andina ;' and that splendid monument to systematic botany, the great 'Flora
RECENT PROfiRESS OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANY.  51

Brasiliensis,' thanks to the munificent patronage of the Emperor and his

Government, and to the unwearied zeal and energy of the present able editor,
Dr. Eichler, has so far advanced, that its completion, once thought hopeless,

may now be fairly reckoned on at no distant period.

    Turning to the desiderata in this branch of systematic botany, besides the
completion of the above-mentioned works in progress, and of the remaining

colonial floras begun or contemplated according to the plans of Sir W. Hooker,
there are three which are much in need of a thorough investigation and re-

working up on sound scientific as well as practically useful principles. These
are the European, the Eussian, and the North- American. The three together
comprise the whole vegetation of the temperate and cold zones of the northern
hemisphere, by far the most extended continuous flora of the globe, and the
most closely connected with what we know of the vegetation of the latest
preceding geological periods. Its present continuity, with only a gradual
east-and-west change in the northern portion, but more and more marked
divergencies as it recedes from the arctic regions, and the evidences we have
of that continiiity having been as great at a former period and in some
instances perhaps yet wider extended, would suggest that it ought to be
treated as one whole. That would, however, be too great an undertaking for
a single hand; and there are other advantages in dividing it into three
separate floras, provided the three are carried out according to one plan, with
a uniform estimate of specific and generic grades, and each one always in close*
connexion with the other two. The different materials which each of the
three investigators would have to work upon would require some differences
in their treatment, besides that each one ought to be an inhabitant of
the region he investigates, so as to have some personal experience of its

living flora.

   The writer of the European flora would be much more bewildered by a

superabundance of data than at a loss on account of any deficiency. His first
great difficulty would arise from the enormous number of names published

by local botanists, and the consequent call upon him to carry out on a large
scale that judicious excision of insufiiciently differentiated species which I
have above tirged in the case of monographs. His work would be more in
the hands of the general than of the local botanist, and conciseness, method,
and accuracy would be more important than minuteness of detail. Innova-
tion would be avoided unless upon very strong grounds. The most useful
sequence to be adopted in the present state of the science would be, without

doubt, the CandoUean, the genera and species restricted to the higher grades
sanctioned by the best modern monographists and other systematists. In the

majority of cases he would have little difliculty in this respect ; and when he
comes to such involved genera as Eaminculus, Hieracium, Ruhus, &c., where
there are really so many indefinite species, he would limit his specific names
and descriptions to the ' Hauptformen ' of Nageli, which one set of botanists
may designate as Linnean or legitimate and another as compound species.
Isolated intermediate forms, whether hybrid and evanescent or more or less

constant, and a few of the principal subspecies, varieties, critical or, in the

Jordanian view, true species, may require mention by name, with a few
descriptive notes where the low gTade may be doubtful ; but the great majority
may be dismissed with a general statement of their having been proposed by
dozens or by himdreds, as the case may be, with a careful indication, however,

in so far as possible, of the degree in which the species admitted have been

observed to vary, and of any difference in this respect in different parts of
the area of the flora. The language of such a European flora should be,

                                                                         e2
53 REPORT-- 18r4.

without doubt, botanical Latin for the technical descriptions ; French or

English might be better suited for the occasional notes and geographical

distribution.

    This geographical distribution would be a most essential feature in the
general flora of Europe, which exemplifies the gradual extinction southwards

of the arctic plants, and eastwards of a very interesting western flora, whilst
a certain number of Asiatic plants enter its eastern limits, but fail to reach

the western States ; and much interest attaches to the botanical connexion of

the Pyrenean and Alpine floras with the north and with each other. Accu-

rate data are much wanted for the inquiry into the history of the dispersion

 of plant-races, their origin, progress, decline, and final extinction ; and to

 supply these data all general floras will be expected to record for each species

 the area it occupies within the flora, distinguishing the localities where it is

 most common and the direction in which it becomes rare, and its ultimate

 limits if within those of the flora, or if not, noting generally its extension

 into adjoining regions in identical or representative forms. For the European

--flora the limits are well marked on three sides: To the westward, the Atlantic

 opposes an insurmountable obstacle to any gradual extension of European
 plants, except in the extreme north. To the south, the Mediterranean and
 Black Seas and the ridge of the Caucasus give a good natural boundarj- ; for

 though many of the European forms are still prevalent on the African coasts

 and in Asia Minor, yet they are very soon arrested southwards by climato-
 logical conditions. To the north, the limits of the European flora are those
 of all vegetation. To the east only is there no definite limit, and an arbitrary
 line must be drawn to separate it from the North-Asiatic region ; that of the
 Ural, though no better marked botanically than physically, is on the whole
 the most convenient.

     For the Kussian, or rather the North-Asiatic, flora (for it ought to include
 or to be drawn up in close connexion with that of Japan) a methodical and

 geographical work, by one who should have the intimate acquaintance with

 the vegetation and the sound views of Maximowitz, would be a great booii.
 Here, again, the northern limits are those of all vegetation, and the southern
 ones at present fairly defined by the comparatively unexplored mountain-
 masses of Central Asia, beyond which the northern plants are replaced by a
  totally diff'erent vegetation ; but besides the actual continuity with the Euro-
  pean flora to the westward, there is a close connexion with that of North

 --America to the cast, notwithstanding the definite limits interposed by the

  Pacific a connexion which has been already exhibited by Asa Gray from an
  American point of view, and by Maximowitz on the part of East Russia and
 Japan, but still requires a much fuller development. Ledebour's 'Flora
 Eossica ' would form a very good basis for the new work : it is the best

  complete flora of so large a tract of country which we possess ; but it now

  requires a thorough revision, with the insertion of the numerous additions
  made by recent explorations, and the geographical data must be entirely
  remodelled and extended to meet the above-mentioned requirements. With
  regard to the Japanese flora, abundant materials have been collected and
  published in various works, chiefly by Dutch botanists ; but the absence of
  all method in Miquel's ' Prolusiones,' where they profess to be enumerated,
  renders that work of little use to the general botanist, and a geographical
  flora is very much needed. The connexion, indeed, between Asia and America
  cannot be studied without constant reference to Japan.

     For the North-American flora we must look to Asa Gray. The Americans

Weto render them almost useless to the general botanist.  cannot even

approximately tix upon the boundary-line to separate the North-American

from the very different Mexican flora to the south-west. Northward it

should, if it is wished to make it really instructive, extend, like the two other

goreat floras, to the limits of vegetation ; eastward and westward the Atlantic
and Pacific afford definite boundaries. But the comparative degree in which

the external connexion with Europe and Asia is broken off by the two oceans,

the causes of the difference observed, as further illustrated by recent palajon-

tological discoveries, the effect of the north-and-south ridge of mountains and

other causes in separating eastern and western races within the territory, and

many other important elements in the history of plants can only be satisfac-

torily investigated with the aid of such a comprehensive, methodical, and

geographical flora as we are in hopes the distinguished Harvard-University

botanist is now preparing.

6. Specific Descriptions, detached or miscellaneous.

   Had I to report only on the progress,"and not on the present state also, of

systematic botany, I should here stop, for the great majority of recent detached

and miscellaneous descriptions are almost as much impediments as aids to the

progress of the science. I have too often in my Linnean Addresses, espe-

cially in those, of 1862 and 1871, animadverted on the mischief they produce

to enter now into any details ; I can only lament that the practice continues,

and is even rendered necessary by considerations not wholly scientific. Hor-
ticulturists must have names for their new importations. It is due to tra-

vellers who, under great perils and fatigues, have contributed largely to sup-

plying us with specimens of the vegetation of distant regions that the results

of their labour should be speedily made known ; it is even important to
science that any new form influencing materially methodical arrangements

should be published as soon as ascertained. But all this is very different
from the barren diagnoses of garden -catalogues, and the long uncontrasted
descriptions hastily got up for the futile purpose of securing priority of name.

I own that I have myself erred in the want of sufficient consideration in the

publication of some of the species of ' Plantae Hartwegianae ; ' and some descrip-

tive miscellanea, even by men who stand very high in the science (such as

Miquel's ' Prolusiones,' above referred to, and Baron von Mueller's ' Frag-
menta'), are rendered comparatively useless from their utter want of method.

Whilst, therefore, discouraging as much as possible aU such detached publi-
cations of new species, I would admit their occasional necessity, but suggest

the following rules as the result of a long practical experience :

   No detached description of a new species should be ventured upon unless

the author has ample means of reviewing the group it belongs to ; and if any
doubts remain of its substantive validity, he should refrain from giving it a

name till those doubts are cleared up.
   The description, when given, should be full, but contrasted, and accom-

panied by a discussion of affinities with previously known species, and an
indication of the place the new one should occupy in the several monographs

and floras in which it would be included.

   An illustration of the new plant, with analytical details, should never be

neglected where circumstances admit of it.

   In conclusion, if I am correct in the views I have taken of the desiderata
--54 KEPORT 1874.

under the six heads above detailed, I hope it may be admitted that, notwith-

standing recent progress, there is still a wide field open" for the researches of
the systematic botanist, and that his branch of the science is not the mere
child's play or herbarium amusement it has been charged with ; for no
thorough knowledge of plants can be satisfactorily obtained or success-
fully communicated without scientific method, and no such method can be
framed without a thorough study of the plants methodized ia every point
of view.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Pye-Smith^ Dr. Brunton
    (Secretary) , and Mr. West, appointed for the purpose of investi'

   gating the Nature of Intestinal Secretion.

Foe some time the opinion has prevailed among physiologists that the nervous
system not only exerts an influence upon the calibre of the vessels supplying

glands with blood for secretion, but that the secreting cells themselves arc
excited to action by nervous stimuli. So firmly, indeed, has this opinion been
held, that Pfliiger's discovery of nerves terminating in the secreting cells has
been almost universally accepted, notwithstanding his failure to demonstrate
these structures to others. Partly, no doubt, this belief has been due to the
high personal consideration in which this distinguished physiologist is justly
held, but it is also due in part to the conviction which prevails that such
structures must exist.

   A distinct proof to this effect has been afforded by the researches of

Heidenhain, on the effect of atropia upon the secretion of the submaxillary

gland.

   When one of the nerves going to this gland (viz. the chorda tympani) is

--stimulated, two effects usually follow : First, the vessels going to the gland '

dilate, the blood flows quicldy through them, and a free supply of lymph is
poured out into the lymph-spaces surrounding the gland ; secondly, the cells
of the gland absorb this lymph, convert it into saliva, and pour it out into the

 duct of the gland.
     If the animal be partially poisoned with belladonna (or its active principle

 atropia), or if atropia be injected into the vessels of the gland itself so as to
exert its poisonous action upon the branches of the chorda tympani ending
 in the gland, a very different result talies place.

   When the nerve is then irritated the vessels dilate as before, the blood

 pours rapidly through them, but not a drop of saliva is secreted. That part
 of the chorda tympani which acts on the vessels has not been affected by the
 poison, but those fibres which go to the secreting cells and stimulate them
 to secrete have been paralyzed by it.

     It is obvious, however, that the salivary secretion is only exceptionally
 induced by dii-ect irritation of the chorda tympani nerve, lying as this does
 far below the surface and well protected from external influences. Usually

 secretion is induced reflexly from the mucous membrane of the mouth or
 tongue, the impression made by sapid substances upon the sensory nerves of
 those parts being transmitted up to the brain and then reflected outwards
 along the chorda tympani to the gland.

             ON THE NATURE OV INTESTINAL SECRETION.      55

   There is, however, yet a third way in which secretion may be induced, and

that a somewhat extraordinary one, viz. by paralysis of certain nerves going

to the gland instead of by irritation. What the cause of this secretion is
has not been clearly made out, but the secretion itself is distinguished by its

profusion and long continuance. It has not yet been ascertained whether

Wethis kind of secretion is arrested by atropia or not.  propose to ascertain

this in future experiments ; but as the question did not lie directly within
the limits of our present investigation (although closely connected with it),

we have not as yet attempted to solve it. There are, then, three ways in

--which secretion may be induced in the salivary glands : 1st, by direct irri-

tation of the secreting nerves ; 2nd, by reflex irritation of these nerves; and

3rd, by paralysis of nerves.

  We have entered thus fully on the physiology of secretion in the submaxil-

lary gland, because in it alone has the secreting process and the action of

nerves upon it been at all fuUy studied.
   Regarding secretion in the intestines very little is known, but it is probable

that the process is performed in much the same way as in the salivary

glands.

The reasons for this belief are as follows :

1st. When the process of digestion is going on and the food is present in

the intestines, their vessels are fuUer than at other times, just as they are in

the salivary glands.

2nd. Stimulation of the mucous surface of the iutestire induces secretion of

intestinal juice, just as stimulation of the mucous meiabrane of the mouth

induces a flow of saliva.

3rd. Section of all the nerves going to the intestine produces a profuse

secretion of intestinal juice, which at once reminds us of the paralytic secre-

tion observed in the submaxillary gland after section of its nerves.

   This secretion of the intestine was first discovered by Moreau, who isolated

a loop of intestine by means of ligatures, and then divided aU the nerves

passing to it on their course along the mesentery. On examining the intes-

tine after four hours, the loop which had previously been empty was dis-

covered to be filled with fluid.

   This fluid was investigated chemically by Professor Kiihne, now of Heidel-
berg, who found it to be neither more nor less than very dilute intestinal juice

and almost identical in composition with the rice-water fluid which is poured

from the intestines so abundantly in cholera (Kiihne and Parkes).
   The intestinal secretion can therefore be excited like the salivary one:

1st, reflexly by stimulation of the mucous membrane of the intestine ; and
2nd, by division and consequent paralysis of all the nerves jjassing to the

intestines.

Unlike the salivary secretion, however, it has not yet been induced by

direct stimulation of the secreting nerves ; and, indeed, these nerves are not yet

known. It is not improbable, however, that they are extremely short, and

are situated in the wall"- of the intestine itself, in which, indeed, the who^e

apparatus necessary to secretion would appear to be contained. This consists
of the secreting glands, vessels, and nerves. The nerves immediately inducing

secretion are probably the ganglia contained in Meissner's plexus, the

short afferent fibres passing to these from the intestinal mucous membrane,
and the short secreting fibres passing from them to the intestinal glands.

   Tlie stimuli which excite secretion, when applied to the intestinal mucous

membrane, are of various sorts.

Mechanical stimulation, such as tickling the surface .of the mucous racm-
              ----

56 и                        --KEPoRT 1874'.

branes, at once excites it. The application of dilute hydrochloric acid and
induced electrical shocks have a similar effect. Sulphate of magnesia and

other purgatives, however, instead of exciting secretion at once, do so only

after an interval; and for some time it was supposed that they did not excite
secretion at all. The experiments of Moreau, in which he injected magnesium
sulphate into a loop of intestine and left it there for four hours, showed that
the failure of previous experiments was due to their having applied it to
the intestine for too short a time. These experiments were repeated by

Vulpian, and also by Brunton, with similar results.

   Your Committee, starting from the facts we have briefly enumerated,

endeavoured to ascertain, first, whether other neutral salts have a similar
effect to magnesium sulphate on intestinal secretion ; secondly, whether any
other compounds have the power of preventing such action ; and thirdly, what

are the nerves which regulate this secretion during life.
   Sekies I. Action of other neutral salts on intestinal secretion. The

method adopted in each case was as follows :

A cat was chloroformed and an opening was made through the abdominal

Awall in the middle line.   coil of small intestine was then drawn out

through the opening, and four ligatures were tied round it at a distance of

10 centimetres (4 inches) from each other, so as to isolate three pieces of

intestine from each other and from the remainder of the intestinal tube.

The measured quantity of solution was then injected into the middle loop,
either by a very fine Wood's syringe, when the fluid was quite clear, or

by making a puncture in the middle loop close to one end, inserting the

nozzle of a syiinge, and then after the injection of the fluid tying another

ligature roi;nd the intestine close to the wound so as to prevent the exit of

any fluid. This proceeding hardly diminished the length of the loop by

Qmore than 3 millimetres of an inch).

   The intestine was then returned to the abdominal cavity, the wound sewn

up, and the animal allowed to recover. After about four hours it was killed
by a blow on the head with a hammer; the abdominal cavity was opened and

the intestine examined.

Experiments were made with potassium acetate, chlorate, ferrocyanide,

iodide, sulphate, neutral tartrate, with sodium acetate, bicarbonate, chloride,

phosphate, and sulphate, as well as with tartrate of potash and soda. [For

particulars see Series I. and Table I. in Appendix.]

From these it appears that several of the other neutral salts possess a

similar action to that of magnesium sulphate, though none are so constant or

so marked in their action.

The amoimt of secretion obtained from similar pieces of intestine with

similar quantities of the salts differed considerably in different experiments.

The caiise of this we have not yet determined. It is not improbable that it

depends to some extent on the stage of digestion when the injection was

made ; but this we purpose to ascertain hereafter,

WeSeeiis II,  next tested the effect of various drugs in preventing this

action of neutral salts, and for this pui-pose took a saturated solution of

magnesium sulphate as that of which the action is the most constant yet

ascertained.

In some eases we mixed the modifying agent with the magnesium sulphate

in order to obtain the local action of the drug on the mucous membrane, in
others it was introduced into the circulation by subcutaneous injection so as

to obtain its general action on the nervous system. The drugs tested in the
former way were :

   In none of these experiments was there any effect of the above drugs in
diminishing the average amount of secretion produced by magnesium sul-
phate. There appears, therefore, to be no action analogous to that of atropia
upon secretion of the submaxillary gland. For summary see Table II. in

Appendix.
    Direct ligature of the mesenteric veins produced profuse haemorrhage into

the loop of intestine, -without any apparent secretion.

   Series III. The last point we proposed to investigate was the precise

manner in which the nervous system influences secretion.

   We first repeated Morcau's experiment by dividing the filaments of nerve

in the mesentery which passed to a ligatured loop of intestine. In two

cases we obtained a negative result, owing probably to some of the smaller

fibres having escaped ; but in the third a more successful division was followed
by profuse secretion into the loop. This, therefore, is an effect common to cats
as well as to dogs and rabbits.

   We next divided both splanchnic nerves below the diaphragm ; and as this

produced no abnormal result on the intestine, we determined to excise the

 semilunar ganglia (dividing the splanchnics in the same operation).

    In 18 experiments we only once found any considerable secretion in the

 loop of intestine.

    The results on the vascularity of the intestines, their peristaltic movements
 and tonic contraction are given in detail in the Appendix, Series III.

     It would appear from these experiments that the splanchnic nerves are
 not the channel by which currents from the cord pass to the secretory appa-

 ratus of the intestine.

    What this channel is we hope to ascertain by further investigation, which
 we intend to apply not only to the secretion but also to the movements of

 the intestinal tube.

Report of the Committee on the Teaching of Physics in Schools, the

    Committee consisting of Professor H. J. S. Smith, Professor Clif-

   ford, Professor W. Gr. Adams, Professor Balfour Stewart, Pro-

    fessor R. B. Cltftox, Professor Everett, Mr. J. G. Fitch, Mr.

   G. Griffith, Mr. Marshall Watts, Professor W. F. Barrett,

   Mr. J. M. Wilson, Mr. Lockyer, and Professor G. C. Foster

     (Secretary) .

In view of the very great diversities in almost aU respects of the conditions
under which the work of different schools has to be carried on, the Com-
mittee considered that, in any suggestions or recommendations that they
might make, it would be impossible for them with any advantage to attempt
to enter into details. They have therefore, in the recommendations which
they have agreed upon, endeavoured to keep in view certain principles which
they regard as of fundamental importance, -^-ithout attempting to prescribe

any particular way of carrj-ing them out in practice.
   They have assumed, as a point not requiring further discussion, that the

object to be attained by introducing the teaching of Physics into general
school-work is the mental training and discipline which the pupils acquire
through studying the methods whereby the conclusions of physical science
have been established. They arc, however, of opinion that the fii'st and one

of the most serious obstacles in the way of the successful teaching of this

subject is the absence fi-om the pupils' minds of a fii"m and clear grasp of the
concrete facts and phenomena forming the basis of the reasoning processes
they are called upon to study. They therefore think it of the utmost im-
portance that the first teaching of all branches of physics should be, as far
as possible, of an experimental kind. "VThenever circumstances admit of it,
the experiments should be made by the pupils themselves, and not merely by

the teacher ; and though it may not be needful for every pupil to go through

every experiment, the Committee think it essential that every pupil should
at least make some experiments himself.

   For the same reasons, they consider that the study of text-books should
be entirely subordinate to attendance at experimental demonstrations or
--72 KKi'OKT 1874'.

lectures, in order that the pupils' first impressions may be got directly from

the things themselves, and not from -what is said abont them. They do not
suppose that it is possible in elementary teaching entirely to do without the
use of text-books, but they think they ought to be used for reviewing the
matter of previous experimental lessons rather than in preparing for such

lessons that are to follow.

  --With regard to the order in which the different branches of Physics can

be discussed with greatest advantage, considering that all explanation of
physical phenomena consists in the reference of them to mechanical causes,

--and that therefore all reasoning about such phenomena leads directly to the

discussion of mechanical principles, the Committee arc of opinion that it is
desirable that the school-teaching of Physics should begin with a course of
elementary mecJianics, including hydrostatics and pneumatics, treated from
a purely experimental point of view. The Committee do not overlook the
fact that very little progress can be made iu theoretical mechanics without
considerable familiarity with the technicalities of mathematics; but they
believe that, by making constant appeal to experimental proofs, the study of

mechanics may be profitably begun by boys who have acquired a fair know-
ledge of arithmetic, including decimals and proportion, and as much geometry
as is equivalent to the Pirst Book of Euclid. They believe that it will be
found sufficient to impart such further geometrical knowledge as may be

required (such, for instance, as a knowledge of the properties of similar tri-
 angles) in the first instance provisionally, without demonstration, during the

 course of instruction in mechanics.

    In reference to the order in which the other departments of Physics
 should be studied, the Committee do not think it possible to prescribe any
 one order that is necessarily preferable to others that might be adopted ; but
they consider it desirable that priority should be given to those branches in

 which the ideas encountered at the outset of the study are most easily appre-

 hended, and illustrations of wliich are most frequently met M'ith in common
 experience. On these grounds they suggest that the elementary parts of the
 science of heat may advantageously follow mechanics, that elementary optics

 (including the laws of reflexion and refraction, the formation of images,
 colour, chromatic dispersion, and the construction of the simple optical
 instruments) should come next, and afterwards the elements of electricity

 and magnetism*. When it is found possible to include in the work of a

 school a fuller or more advanced course of Physics than that here indicated,
 the Committee are of opinion that the discretion of the master, guided by
 the circumstances of the case, will best decide in what direction the exten-
 sion should take place ; they suggest, however, that an early place in the
 course should be given to elementary astronomy, both because it furnishes
 the grandest and most perfect examples of the application of dynamical
 principles, and because it promotes an intelligent interest in phenomena
 which, in their most superficial aspects, at least, cannot fail to arrest atten-
 tion, and familiarizes the mind with the wide range of application of physical

  laws.

     The Committee are strongly of opinion that no very beneficial results can
 be looked for from the general introduction of Physics into school-teaching,
 unless those who undertake to teach it have themselves made it the subject
  of serious and continued study, and have also given special attention to the
 best methods of imparting instruction in it. They therefore suggest that,

     * It should be stated that one member of the Committee did not approve of the order

  of subjects suggested in tlie text.

with a view to aflfording facilities to persons desirous of becoming teachers
of Physics, of familiarizing themselves with the most efficient methods and
of gaining experience in them, the Council of the British Association should

invite the leading teachers of Physics in the universities, colleges, and schools
of the United Kingdom to allow such persons, under suitable regulations, to

be present at the instruction given by them, and, when practicable, to act as
temporary assistants. The Committee do not hereby mean that aspii-ants to
the teaching function should be encouraged to drop in at random to hear a
lecture by any established teacher who may happen to be within reach ; the

kind of attendance they have in view would be systematic, and continued for
not less than some moderate period of time, such perhaps as two or three
months, agreed upon, at starting. They believe that the benefits which
might result from the adoption of such a plan are very great ; the advantages

to those who might avail themselves of it are obvious ; and while teachers of

established success would have a chance of spreading widely their methods
of instruction, and, in fact, of founding schools of disciples, the stimulus to

exertion, afforded by the consciousness that they were being watched by men

Avho were preparing themselves to occupy positions similar to their own,
would be of the most efficient kind.

Preliminary Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. Armstrono
   and Professor Thorpe, appointed for the purpose of investigatiiig
   Isomeric Cresols and their Derivatives. Drawn up by Dr. Henry E.
   Armstrong.

A NUMBER of isolated observations have shown that the so-called cresylic

acid from coal-tar contains both para- and ortho-cresol, but a satifactory

examination of the crude product which would enable us to say that it con-

sists  of these  two  modifications  alone  has  not  hitherto  been  made                        moreover,
                                                                                               j

supposing it to contain only these two isomerides, no method is at present

known by which it is possible to separate them and obtain each in a state of

purity. In conjunction with Mr. C. L. Field your reporter has therefore

sought, in the first place, to ascertain what are the constituents of ordinary

cresyhc acid ; and, in the second, to devise a method of separating the isomeric

cresols.

 --The method of examination employed is as follows : The cresylic acid is

heated with an equal weight of concentrated sulphuric acid for 15-20 hours

at about 100░ ; the resulting mixture of sulpho-acids is then thrown into

water and neutrahzed with baric carbonate, and to the solution separated

from the precipitated baric sulphate baric hydrate solution is added as long

as a precipitate is produced. The basic baric salt of paracresolsulphonic acid

thus precipitated is separated from the liquid, decomposed by a slight excess

of sulphuric acid, the excess of sulphuric acid is removed by plumbic car-

bonate and hydric sulphide, and the solution of paracresolsulphonic acid thus

obtained neutralized with potassic carbonate. On concenti-ating the result-

ing solution potassic paracresolsulphonate, C^ H^ SO^ K, 2OH2, separates out

almost in a state of purity.

The solution filtered from the basic baric salt is treated with sulphuiic

--74 REPORT 1874.

potassic carbonate is then added until a precipitate of baric carbonate no
longer forms. The solution then contains a mixture of potassic salts of very

different solubilities, which may be separated by fractional crystallization.

--PinaUy, three products are obtained: 1, potassic phenolparasulphonate

2, potassic phenolmetasulphonate ; 3, which is the most soluble portion,
more or less pure potassic orthocresolsulphonate. Hitherto no indication
has been obtained of the presence of the third isomeric cresol (metacresol) in
the coal-tar product ; but it is by no means certain, although probable, that

this modification is absent. Until characteristic derivatives of this cresol are

known this point must remain undecided.
   Having thus separated the sulpho-acids derived from the isomeric cresols,

it is easy to obtain the corresponding cresols in a state of purity ; aU that is
necessary for this purpose is to heat the sulpho-salt with hydrochloric acid
in sealed tubes at about 160░ during a couple of hours. The potassic para-
cresolsulphonate above referred to is thus resolved into paracresol and hydric
potassic sulphate; the orthocresolsulphonate into orthocresol and hydric
potassic sulphate. In order to purify the cresol thus separated, it is advan-
tageous first to distil it in a current of steam before it is distilled alone.
The orthocresol sei^arated from the sulpho-acid gave a large quantity of sah-
cylic acid on fusion with potassic hydrate.

  A number of derivatives of paracresol have already been prepared, but

their study is as yet by no means completed. On treatment with nitric acid,

paracresol yields a mononitrocresol of low melting-point and volatile in a
current of steam ; a second body, crystallizing in prisms and uou-volatilc,

which is formed simultaneously, is perhaps an isomeric compound. On further

treatment with nitric acid the volatile nitrocresol is converted into dinitro-
cresol (m. p. 81░) ; this dinitrocresol apparently cannot be converted by
further nitration into a trinitrocresol. Potassic paracrcsolsulphonate is
readily converted by the action of dilute nitric acid into potassic nitropara-
cresolsulphouate, which by the continued action of the acid is converted into
dinitrocresol (m. p. 81░). Potassic nitroparacresolsulphonate yields on treat-
ment with bromine a dibromonitrocresol, which appears to be isomeric with
that obtained on brominating the volatile nitroparacresol previously mentioned.

By the action of bromine jjotassic paracrcsolsulphonate is successively con-

verted into bromoparacresolsulphonate, dibromoparacresolsulphouate, and

finally into tribromocresol.

   Considerable quantities of the isomeric cresols having now been obtained

from coal-tar by the method above given, it is intended to institute a careful
comparative examination of their derivatives.

   No portion of the grant made to this Committee having been drawn, it is
requested that they be reappointed, and that the same sum be again placed

at their disposal.

Third Report of the Committee, consisting of Dr. James Bryce and
   William Jolly, appointed for the purpose of collecting Fossils from
   localities of difficidt access in North-western Scotland. Drawn up
    by William Jolly, Secretary.

The Committee are sorry to have still to report that no organic remains
have yet been discovered by them in any locality along the great limestone

strike of the N.W. Highlands, other than the Durness basin, from which the

fossils found by the Committee have alone been obtained. The Committee

have not been able personalljr to prosecute the search during the past year,

and the Secretary's official work as Inspector of Schools, which formerly

extended over the whole of the district of investigation, is now confined to

other localities ; so that the same active search and personal superiutendence

of diggings are not now possible. But they have the services of gentlemen

resident in the district, who are willing to prosecute the search. The Com-

mittee still hope that theii- labours will have successful results in some of

the localities hitherto barren, and this all the more certainly that fossils were

discovered by Mr. Peach at Inchnadamph on Loch Assyut.

The Committee beg to propose that the fossils already obtained from

this N.W. limestone should be submitted to Mr. Etheridge, Dr. Duncan,

Dr. Hicks, or other competent palseontologists, whose report would be

presented to the next Meeting of the Association, on the age and species of

the fossils, so as, if possible, to lead to a more certain determination of the

place in the geologic series of the rocks in which they are found, than was

possible with the few and imperfect specimens submitted to Mr. Salter

--in 1858. The fossils available for this examination consist of: (1) those

collected by the Committee; (2) those collected for Professor Nicol of

Aberdeen, and now deposited in the College Museum there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (3) those

submitted to Mr. Salter in 1858 and deposited in the Geological Museum in

Jermyn Street ; and (4) any others that may be obtained by the Committee

during the next year. These would form material for a more certain determi-

nation of the age of these fossils than has hitherto been possible, as they are
both more numerous and more perfect than those originally discovered by
Mr. Peach, which were submitted to Mr. Salter and figured in Sir Eoderick

Murchison's paper on the subject.

   The Committee would therefore propose their reappointment by the Asso-
ciation, for the purpose of arranging for this examination and Report, and

of prosecuting still further their search in this interesting and important

field.

The attention of your Committee during the past year has been mainly

directed to completing work previously commenced, and to the carrying out

of all measures likely to tend to still greater accuracy on the part of the

--observers.
   Position Seturns. It will be in the recollection of the members of the

Association, that as a partial substitute for the expensive, although most

important, practice of personal inspection of rain-gauge stations by our Secre-

tary, we issued (in 1872) to every observer a blank form, on which he was

Ato send full particulars respecting the position of his rain-gauge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           spe-

AV.'^rc in cliargo of others, concerning' which personal instruction was dosirahle.
Thereupon he was directed to proceed to the district and take such steps as
he thought most expedient for securing accurate observations at a moderate
cost. The following is an abstract of his reports :

   The returns from Wet Sleddale have at all times been sent with great
irregularity, and for two years none have been received. As a new station
had been organized at Shap, that at Wet Sleddale was abandoned. If, how-

ever, a good position and a good observer could be obtained in the Sleddale
valley, it would be very advantageous.

    At Mardale Green the gauge was found to be in perfect order, but the
measuring-rod had been broken and clumsily mended ; a new one was

supplied.

   At Measandbecks, Haweswatcr, the observer had been obliged to move the
gauge, and had placed it on ground sloping too precipitously ; it was removed
a few feet, so as to place it on a level plateau.

   The Matterdale Common and Gowbarrow gauges were not visited, as they

were repaired some time pi-eviously, and the observer reported them to be in

perfect order.

    Owing to the removal and subsequent death of the observer at the Green-
side Mines in Patterdale, the series of observations instituted there, which
embraced gauges at 500 feet, 1000 feet, 1550 feet, and 2000 feet, were
stopped. Aware of the great importance of accurate observations from that
locality, our Secretary visited it, and had the pleasure of finding that the
manager of the mines had resumed observations at 1000 feet, the gauge (a

very accurate one) being well placed.

    The gauges at Wythburn, Easedale Tarn, and Watendlath were in perfect
 order, and the observations made by the observers originally appointed.

    The observer of the gauge at Berkside, Helvellyn, died a few years back,
 and the gauge had become out of order ; the gauge was sent to Keswick for
repair, and a new observer instructed in the duties.

    The gauges at Seathwaite were in good order, except the large float one,
иwhich was repaired at Keswick.

   A new observer had been appointed to Kirkstone Pass, who consequently

 had not received personal instruction ; neither of his gauges was in perfect
 order, but both were put so, and the subsequent records are very satisfactory.

    The returns from Skiddaw, though carefuUy kept, have always been ex-
 cessively small for the altitude (1677 feet) of the gauge. This is probably
 due to its very exposed position on the S.W. flank of the mountain. In
 accordance with a suggestion by the observer (who is on the mountain in all
 weathers) a second gauge has been placed on Skiddaw, the new site being at

--the head of Whitbeck.
     Majy of Stat'wiis in operation. In consequence of the intimation conveyed
 to your Committee last year, they have discontinued entirely the issue of
 rain-gauges on loan, and have endeavoured to induce gentlemen to purchase
 gauges for themselves. "With a view to determining the districts in which

 additional gauges are most needed, a map was prepared, showing the site of
 every rain-gauge known to be in operation. It will be seen from it, that
 large as is now our field of operations, there are many districts in which all

 our efforts to obtain observers have been futile ; this is especially the case in

would be miTCii iraproYcd if it were possible to provide a travelling inspector.
At present tbe demands upon the time of our Secretary have been such that
he has not been able to visit any of these stations ; but he is still hoping
shortly to do so. With a view to lessening as far as possible the heavy cost
of travelling, yonr Committee purpose applying to the railway companies for

a ft-ee pass for their Secretary when travelling for such an essentially national

purpose.                                                               are glad

to say that Mr. Buchan has made very good use of the above ; the pressure

on his time has prevented his yet forwarding us the details of the examina-

tions of 35 stations visited and tested by him, and of numerous gauges tested

before issue ; but the work has been done, and the results are promised for

our next Eeport.

 --Eainfall of the British Isles during the years 1872 and 1873. The very

exceptional character of the rainfall of 1872 was mentioned in our last
Report ; but in accordance with a custom which has now prevailed for twelve

years, it was only incidentally referred to, the details being deferred until

the two years 1872 and 1873 could be published together. This course,
which was originally adopted with a view to economy in printing, has, in
the present instance, had the fortunate result of bringing together two very

--remarkable features, of each of which we must speak separately.
   Bainfcdl of 1872. Records of rainfall have been collected and discussed
in our previous Reports, which enable us to compare the total fall in any year

or years from 1726 to the present time with the mean fall. One of these

Tables (that facing page 286, British-Association Report, 1866) contains nine

long registers, extending over 140 consecutive years ; but the greatest excess
above the mean, even at a single station, was only 58 per cent, (at Oxford
in 1852). In 1872 this value was largely exceeded at a number of stations,
as is shown by Tables I. and II., whence it appears that at 14 stations out
of 115 (or 12 per cent.), it exceeded this previously unparalleled value. At

13 the excess was greater than 60 per cent., and it reached or exceeded 70

per cent, at the following stations :

No similar fall has occurred since 1726, and there is no evidence of such a

fall since rainfall observations were commenced nearly two centuries since.
Pull details respecting the monthly fall of rain in this very remarkable year
are given in the Appendix to this Report ; and we think it may be regarded
as fortunate that so extraordinary a fall has occurred at a period when (owing
largely to the operations of this Committee) the system of observation is in a

--state unprecedentedly near perfection.
    The liainfaU of 1873. If this year had stood by itself, it would merely
have been classed as a rather diy year, and would have soon passed into
oblivion. Coming, however, - immediately after such an exceptionally wet

year, it has produced the unusual result of giving two consecutive years, one

with twice the rainfall of the other, and in many instances with much more

than twice. How rare is this occurrence may be judged from the fact that

there is no case in the 140-years Table just referred to. The nearest ap-

proaches are, Chatsworth, in 1788 19-86 inches, in 1789 36-31 inches^ the

Aformer being 55 per cent, of the latter,      still nearer approach occurred at

Cobham, in Surrey, in 1851 and 1852, when the totals were 17'38 inches and

84-19 inches respectively, the former being 51 per cent, of the latter. In

Table III. no cases are admitted unless much more striking than the above.

The districts in which these exceptional ratios occur are (as might be ex-

pected) principally those in which the excess in 1872 was greatest ; but there

are also a few of which the explanation is not so obvious. It is very satis-

factory to feel that these two exceptional years have found in the British

Isles the most nearly perfect system of observation in the world.

   Your Committee cannot close their Report Avithout expressing, as far as
words can do so, the loss which they have sustained in the death of Professor
Phillips, one of the original members appointed in 1865, who, notwithstand-
ing the numerous other demands upon his time, was always as willing as he
was able to assist the Committee in any of the various difficulties which the

extent of their operations inevitably involve.

118 REPORT 1874,

On the Belfast Harbour. By T. R. Salmond, C.E.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in exfenso,']

                                 (Plates I.-III.)

It is with no small degree of diffidence that I have undertaken to draw

up an account of the Port and Harbour of Belfast, the subject being one

of considerable importance, and the materials at my disposal somewhat

meagre, at least so far as the ancient historj' of the harbour is concerned.

I have, however, endeavoured to prepare, in as concise a manner as possible,

a synopsis of the various improvements which have been effected in the

harbour, at  least  so far back  as the  sixteenth century                                                                 prior to which time
                                                                                                                        ;

the position of Belfast as a seaport or place of resort for shipping was rather

vague and indefinite, if we can judge from the fact that no mention whatever

is made of its existence as a harbour in any historical record prior to that
date. On examiiiatiou of the map of Belfast (vide Plate I.) which was
prepared as early as IGGO (perhaps one of the most ancient maps of the
town now extant), it will be seen that the old town was, as compared
with Belfast of the present, a very insignificant plaCe indeed. The limits of
the town were circumscribed by an extensive line of fortification, which
encompassed it on the north, south, and western sides only, it beii'ig bounded
on the east side by the river Lagan, the land entrances to the town being by
two gates called the North Gate and the Mill Gate. The North Gate was

situated in North Street, at its juncture with John Street, and the Mill Gate

was situated iu Mill Street, at a point about 330 yards from the entrance to

the Old Castle. It would, then, appear that the ramparts of the town ceased

at William Street and commenced at Mary Street, now called Corporation

Street, the interval between these points being bounded by the Lagan river

precluded the chance of land attack from the eastward side of the town.

--At this time Belfast only consisted of five streets High Street, Bridge

Street, Skipper's Lane, Waring Street, and North Street ; and the number of

houses then in existence were, exclusive of the Castle, 150, the greater

number of which were thatched houses of an inferior class.

Previous to the year 1637 the harbour appears to have been under no

regular system of government, and was assumed to be the property of the

Chichester family. The trade was at that time as insignificant as the harbour

itself, which was, in point of fact, a port of secondary importance to Carrick-

fcrgus, which was the only stronghold in the bay occupying the same position

relative to the latter town that Carlingford did in respect to Newry. Prior

to the date I have just mentioned, the Corporation of Carrickfcrgus enjoyed

the privilege of reserving to their use one third of all the Customs duties

payable on goods imported into that place, together with other trading mono-

polies. These immunities, however, the Earl of Strafford succeeded in pur-

chasing in 1637, since which time the commerce of this port has become a

Amatter of importance.  Custom House was then for the first time esta-

blished in Belfast, and the revenue business of the port removed from Carrick-

fcrgus. In the year 1729 the first legislative interference with the port took

place, when an Act, 3rd George II., was passed, which delegated to the

Sovereign and free burgesses of the town the conservancy of the harbour.

The Corporation of Belfast had the harbour-trust committed to their care,

and the reason assigned for appointing them as the conservancy was that, as

expressed in the Act, "The harbour had become extremely shallow, by

which means voyages have been prolonged, to the very great prejudice of
ON THE BELFAST HARBOUR.                                    119

trade, and His Majesty put to extraordinary expense and charge in keeping
officers longer on board the vessels trading to and from the said town than
would be needful had the said harbour and channel been preserved in the
same condition as it formerly was." This Act was, however, repealed in
1785 by the Act 25th George III. cap. 64, which appointed a separate Cor-
poration, giving to them the sole management of the affixirs of the port ; and
with the appointment of the Harbour Commissioners as a distinct body, the

substantial improvements of the port may bo said to have commenced.
   Among the first acts performed by the new Corporation were the removal

of several artificial fords, which formed bars across the Lagan, and also the
gradual deepening of the bed of the river by dredging; and in 1786 the
course of the old south channel was ordered to be marked with buoys and
perches down to the Pool of Garmoyle.

   In the year 1791 a graving-platform was erected for the repairing of smaU

craft ; and subsequently two graving or dry docks, which are at present in
existence, were constructed, the first of which (No. 1) was completed and

opened in the year 1800, and the second, now called No. 2 Dock, was opened

in the year 1826.
   These docks arc situated on the south-west side of Clarendon Dock, and are

found to be of great service for the repairing of vessels of small draft and
tonnage. Their general dimensions are as follow :

   In the year 1S26 Mr. John Ilcnnie reported upon tb.e state of the harbour
with a view to its being extended and improved, and in the year 1829 Mr.
Telford reported for a similar purpose. Mr. llennie again reported in 1829.

No action, however, was taken on either of these reports, and the improve-

ment of the harbour was consequently delayed until a report and ])lan had
been received from Messrs. Walker and Burgess in the year 1830, which plan
Avas adopted by the Commissioners, and received the royal assent in the year
1831. Obstacles were, however, thrown in the way of procuring the neces-
sary funds to carry out the work, and the result was an application to Parlia-
ment, in the year 1837, for a new Act, 1st Vic. cap. 76, which was acceded
to ; and the works dii-ected to be undertaken iu connexion therewith were :
--130 REPORT 1874,

   1st. The making of a new channel for the river Lagan, from Dunbar's
Dock to Thompson's Tower, cutting off the first bend of the old channel

nearest the town.

   2nd. The purchase of the existing quays and docks, which were private
property, and the widening and improving of the same.

   3rd. The continuation of the straight cut for the river as far as deep
water, cutting off the second bend of the river, so as to form a straight
channel from the town towards Garraoyle, and other works contemplated by

the Act.

   The first of the foregoing works, being the first section of the new channel,
was undertaken by Mr. Dargau, the contractor, and was completed and

opened in the year 1841, the cutting of the channel forming a very valuable
property called the Queen's Island, which contained an area of seventeen
acres of land. The entire cost of this work, including the purchase of pro-

perty, amounted to ^42,352.
    In the year 1842 the whole quays and wharves on both sides of the river,

together with Dunbar's dock (now called Prince's Dock), quays, timber-pond,
and nineteen acres of ground, the site for future docks, were all purchased
at a sum amounting to Б152,171; and a sum of nearly Б1000 was expended
in the improvement and permanent repair of Prince's Dock, the walls of which

were composed of timber and brickwork.

    In the year 1844 the construction of new quays was commenced on the

--county Down side of the harbour for a length of 2500 feet about 500 feet,

next the Queen's Bridge, being in front of an old wharf purchased from Mr.
Eatt, and the remaining portion on the slob land lying between it and the
Queen's Island. This work was called the Queen's Quay, in the construction
of which was expended the sum of Б31,167. It is composed of a faciiig of
timber securely tied buck by three rows of strong piles, which are connected
together with tic-rods of iron 1^ inch in diameter; the main jnles are
12 in. by 12 in., and the sheeting-piles are 7 inches in thickness, driven to
 a batter of 1 inch to a foot. The quay being formed, a landing-shed was
erected on it, 300 feet in length. The material used for filling in or backing
up the quay was mainly procured by the deepening of the river, which was
also considerably Avidened in front, a quantity amounting to about 524,175
tons of material being deposited in forming the quays.

    Among other works carried out at this time were a large pond for the

storage of timber on the east side of the Queen's Island, formed at a cost of

Б1878 ; and the lighthouse, erected on piles, which is situated on the Holy-
wood Bank, and wliich is used as a pilot station, was constructed at a cost of

Б1300.
    Having in the year 1844 secured possession of the old quays and other

property on the county Antrim side of the river, the construction of new
quays on that side was immediately proceeded with. The total length of
quayage erected at that time was 1375 feet, of which 713 feet was an

 increase, the remainder being the restoration of a portion of the old work.
These quays were formed of timber, and were carried out on the same plan

 as that adopted for the Queen's Quay.
    The total monies expended previous to the year 1847 on the various works

embraced in the Act of 1837, including the construction of the Holywood

Bank Light Station, amounted to Б238,740.
    In November 1846 a contract was entered into with Mr. "William Dargan

for forming the second section of the new channel, which was completed and

formally opened in the year 1849, when it received the title of Yictoria
ON THE BELFAST HARBOUR.  121

Channel. This, the second portion of the channel executed, lies between the
Twin Islands, which were formed by the material excavated from the bed of
the second cut, and cast up so as to form a sea-slope of about 4 feet horizontal
to 1 foot vertical, the channel faces of which slope were jirotected by a heavy
facing of stone-pitching. The length of this cut is about 3300 feet, the
width at top being about 450 feet, with a depth of about 23 feet at high
water, and the amount expended in its formation was .Б41,000.

    The next work of importance which was proceeded with was the rebuilding
of the county Antrim quays from tlie Queen's Bridge to Dunbar's or Prince's
Dock, and their extension, or the formation of new quays, from that point
to the Milewater Eiver, the latter portion being commenced and completed

--in the year 1847 the entire quays being handed over by the contractor,

Mr. Cranston Gregg, comi^lete during the year 1848, their cost being about
Б44,390. This work is composed of timber facing, similar to that adopted
on the Queen's Quay, and the entire designed with a view to having about
10 feet of water close to the quay at low tide.

    In the year 1847 the construction of a patent slip was commenced on the
south end of the Queen's Island. This slip is 560 feet in length, and
was designed so as to be capable of taking on vessels of 1000 tons burthen.
It is worked by a twcntj' horse-power steam-engine, with hauling machinery.
The cost of the entire work in connexion with the slip was about =Б10,753.
The work was completed and opened for traffic early in 1849. In the year
1847, owing to improvements then in contemplation and in course of
progress, it became necessary to procure a new steam-dredger in addition to
the one then in the Commissioners' possession. The new machine was con-
structed in that year by Messrs. Coates and Young, and was provided with a
twenty horse-power engine ; the cost of the new machine was .Б5200. The
way in which the dredgers were principally employed at this time was in
deepening of the river between the new wharves, and the material raised was
used for filling up the spaces between the old and new Ballymacarrett quays,
filling up the old town dock at the foot of High Street, and other old docks
on the county Antrim side of the harbour, and in backing \ip the new quay
of the first cut of the channel, now called Albert Quay.

    In the year 1847 a second timber-pond was constructed on the county
Antrim side of the river, and is situated convenient to Prince's Dock and
Albert Quaj\ This pond was made by Mr. Dargan in a field adjoining the
old pond, about 20,000 cubic yards of stuff being removed in its formation.

    The only additional works worthy of notice which were undertaken in the
year 1848 were the erection of a stoiie beacon on the tail of the west bank
at Garmoyle, at a cost of .Б218, and the construction of a wrought-irou
swing-bridge to span the entrance to the then Graving-Dock Basin, at a cost
of about =Б1351. These works were completed during the year 1849.

    In the year 1849, in order to meet the growing requirements of a very
important class of shipping, such as the moderate-sized vessels carrying
valuable cargoes from the Mediterranean and Baltic ports, it was determined
to extend the basin in front of the graving-docks. This work was proceeded
Avith, the basin being extended in a southward direction so as to form a dock,
which in 1 850 was designated the Clarendon Dock. In the same year, 1849,
the old tidal docks, situated at the foot of Waring Street and Great George's
Street, were filled up, and the spaces occupied by them thrown open to the

public.

   Prior to the commencement of the improvements embraced in the Act of
1837, the cost of dredging had always formed a large item in the annual
--122 EEPORT 1874.

expenditure of the Belfast Harbour. This had, however, considerably

increased during the four or five years just preceding the year 1849--as, in

addition to maintaining the original depth, the course of the river opposite

what was then called Eitchio's Dock was diverted from its natural channel
by the extension of the quays, and the entire space from the Queen's Bridge
to the Prince's Dock doubled in width, the depth of the water being at the

same time increased 5 to 7 feet.
   It was anticipated that the formation of the straight channel would obviate

the necessity of so much dredging as hitherto in the lower part of the river

and the fact that the upper section of it maintained its depth without dredging
from its opening in 1841 for a period of nine or ten years, confirms this view.
The increased depth, however, given to the river opposite the quays, being

much below its natural bed, will always require an additional amount of

dredging to prevent it from silting up, whicli would, of course, vary and
increase in extent as the sewerage of the town increases, if allowed to bo

discharged into the harbour.

   In the year 1850 the only works worthy of notice which were entered upon
were the erection of coal-offices, yards, and weighing-machines on Queen's
Quay, and six landing- or goods-sheds on Doncgall Quay, and contracts for

the erection of a stone wall on the north side of the Clarendon Dock.^
   In the year 1851 three lighthouses were constructed in the Channel,

between Garmoyle and the town of Belfast, and provided with accommodation

for resident lightkcepcrs in order to supersede the difficult and uncertain plan
previously resorted to, r. e. of attending to the Channel hghts (which Avcro

fixed upon perches) by means of a boat. One of the houses, a substantial
stone structure, is situated on the lower end of the East Twin Island, and

provided with a bright green light; one on the margin of the old Seal
Channel, provided with a red light ; and the other at the Pool of Ganuoylo
below the stone beacon and on the opposite side of the Channel, which is
provided with a green light. The two latter lighthouses are constructed on
the borders of the slob banks, and are composed of timber supported upon
strong piles, braced with wrought-iron tie-rods, the cost of tho three houses

being about Б741.                        was               , ,,                      ^i -

to the Prince's Dock at a cost of =:Б309, and a timber bridge across the entrance

to the Milewater Pdvor, thereby opening up an uninteiTU])ted traffic for foot
passengers from the Queen's Bridge to Thompson's embankment.

In the year 1854 a new Harbour Office was erected at the foot of Great
George's Street,, at a cost of =Б8306 ; and the only other new works carried
on in that year were the construction of a branch line of railway, com-
mencing at the main line, a short distance from the terminus of the Northern
Counties EaUway, running along the reclaimed ground purchased from Mr.
Thompson, and connected with the Albert Quay ; and a new street caUed
Whitla Street, running from the north end of Garmoyle Street to York

Street, opening up a connexion between the quays and the railway.

The' Harbour Commissioners having in the year 1854 obtained a Bill
empowering them to reclaim a large portion of the slob lands lying on the
county Down side of the river, consequently in the following year a com-

mencement was made upon that work, Mr. James Connor being appointed

contractor for the execution of a bank extending from the Queen's Island to

Conswater Eailway Bridge. This work was completed in 1858. This

portion of the reclamation included the part to be devoted to the purposes of

a public park, to be called Victoria Park.
            ON THE BELFAST IIAKBOUR.             123

In tho year 1858 a commencement was made towards the regular deepen-

ing of the navigable channel from the Holy wood Lighthouse to the upper end

of Donegall Quay. The improvement made by the dredging, which con-

tinued from 1858 to 1861, was such that vessels with a deep draft of water

were enabled to get up to the lower end of the Victoria Channel without

lightening their cargoes, as they liad hitherto done, two miles lower down tho

river, in order to enable them to take a berth at the quays or to enter tho

docks ; and steamboats were also enabled to reach their berths at all times

of the tide. Tho next works of magnitude which were undertaken by the

Belfast Harbour Commissioners were commenced in the year 1864, and con-

sisted of the construction of a floating dock and tidal dock on the county

Antrim side of the harbour, and a graving or dry dock and tidal basin on the

county Down side of the harbour. These may be said to be the first really

important works, apart from the deepening of the harbour, which were

undertaken since tho year 1847.

UnlOvO the previous mode of constructing the wharves vrith. timber, tho

Commissioners M'cre advised in these cases to resort to the use of stone as a

building material. On the county Antrim side of the harbour, where the

ground for foundations is of such a treacherous nature, the entire works had

to be buUt upon bearing or supporting piles. On the top of the piles a layer

of concrete two feet in depth was laid, on which the superstructure was

raised. The walls are generally of the section shown on the contract

drawing, and are built of rubble stonework, faced with random rubble. On
the county Down side of the river, the nature of the soil being firm hard

sand, no artificial foundation was necessary. On both sides, however, the

precaution has been adopted of driving a row of sheet piles, 6 inches thick,

along the face of tho work, to preclude the chance of the foundations being

undermined by dredging or other caiises.

These dock works, though commenced in tho year 1864, were not aU com-

pleted till the year 1871. Tho Hamilton Graving-Dock and Abcrcorn Basin

were, however, finished and formally opened by tho Lord Lieutenant in the

year 1867.

   The Abercorn Basin is 725 feet in length by 635 feet in breadth, having a
water-area of 12i acres. The average depth of water in that basin is now

about 11 feet at low water, and a canting space seciired in the harbour which

wlU allow a vessel of 600 feet in length to turn upon its own centre as a
pivot. The cost of this basin was Б23,163.

The Hamilton Graving-Dock is in length at top 470 foot, and at bottom

451^ feet. It is 84 feet 6 inches broad at coping, and 50 feet broad at

bottom. The coping is 15 feet above datum, and the level of sill at entrance

is 5-60 feet below datum. The entrance of the dock is GO feet in width, and

the depth of the dock is 22 feet 9 inches below coping. It is provided with

a caisson gate, which can be used as a bridge or road for horse-and-cart

Atraffic when set in place.  powerful engine and centrifugal pump, with

pumping machinery, is provided for clearing the dock of water -svhen requisite

for repairing vessels. The cost of this graving-dock, including mooring-

paals, paving, gas- and water-pipes, capstans, paals, &c., amounted to =Б33,756.

Of this, cБ2376 was expended on the caisson ; and a further sum of ,Б5140,

not included in the above, was expended on the engine and pumping

machinery and buildings in connexion therewith.

The works on the county Antrim side, comprising the Spencer Dock,

Dufferin Dock, and entrance-basin, were formally opened by Earl Spencer,

Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in the year 1872. The Spencer Dock is a tidal
124 REPORT-- 1874.

dock, 600 feet long by 550 feet broad, having a water-area of 7g acres, and

a quayage in length 1900 feet. The average depth of water in this dock is
14 feet below datum, and the coping is 15-6 feet above datum. The entrance

to the dock is 80 feet in width by 265 feet in length. The entrance- basin

has an area of 5 acres of water, with a quayage of 200 feet in length.

The Dufferin Dock is a floating dock, provided with gates, inside which

vessels with a draught of 22 feet can discharge afloat at all times of the tide.

The entrance to this dock is from the Spencer Dock, and is 60 feet in width

by 139 feet in length. The platform for gates is 14 feet below datum, and

the sill is 12 feet below datum. The dock is in length 630 feet by 225 feet

in width, having a water-area of 3j acres and length of quayage of

1045 feet.

The walls of these works arc all constructed of stone, the lower portion of

the clock from bottom x\p to datum-level being composed of hammerstone

ashlar, the stone being from the Scrabo quarries, county Down ; and the

portion above datum is composed of freestone hearting, with facing of

Dundonald whinstone, the coping being of Cornish limestone in large blocks.

The cost of these works amounted to Б95,334, including gates, mooring,

paals, chains, paving, &c. Simultaneously with the execution of these

M'orks, other incidental works, though of minor importance, were being

carried on. The Milewater Eiver was diverted into a new channel, and two

extensive timber-ponds, one of 5 acres and the other of 14 acres, formed

on the Antrim side of the harbour, chiefly by the excavations from the dock

works. The branch railway was diverted along Albert Quay, and a per-

manent line of tramwaj- laid connecting it with the Northern Counties

Kailway.

   The slob reclamation in county Down was being proceeded v/ith from year

to year; and in 1864 a carriage-road bridge was constructed across Conns-

water to connect the Victoria Park with the Ballymacarrctt reclaimed pro-

perty, at a cost of Б632.

   In 1807 a double line of tramway was laid along the south side of the

Abercorn Basin, and connected with the county Down llailway. A number

of goods-sheds were erected along the quays from time to time, and dock-

master's houses and other tenements, as required by the extension of the

harbour; and in the year 1871 a large pair of masting-sheers were erected

on the east side of Abercorn Quay, capable of lifting a weight of 50 tons

and masting the largest vessels afloat ; the cost of these sheers amounted to

Б2732, including foundations, engine-house, etc. In the same year (1871)
a line of tramway, commencing at the junction of the Central llailway at

Oxford Street and extending along the Antrim quays around Prince's Dock,

formed a junction with the Northern Counties branch of the quay's tramway

at the south end of the Duff"erin Dock. Owing to the extension of the hai'bour

works, it became necessary in the year 1870 to provide for extensive

Adredging.  contract was therefore entered into for a new steam -dredger

of 40 horse-power, capable of working in 26 feet of water, which was com-

pleted in the following year at a cost of Б7923, and a large number of new

scows were constructed in connexion with this machine. In the year 1872

an inclined discharging-slip was constructed at the lower end of the Queen's

Island, and provided with a hauling-engine and gearing for the purpose of

disposing of the dredging-material in the embanking of the county Down

reclaimed lands ; and for the transit of the stuff a locomotive engine and

stock of tipping-waggons were provided, by which means the material can be

both cheaply and expeditiously transported to any part of the county Down

property. In the same year, the Commissioners having secured by purchase
from Dr. Ritchie a large tract of slob land on the county Antrim side of the
channel north of Thompson's embankment, a commencement was made with
its reclamation from the sea. This work is still in course of progress, and
when reclaimed will afford a valuable parcel of ground for harbour exten-
sion, 95 acres in area. The embankment is being entirely formed of material
raised by the dredgers in deepening the harbour. The slope is formed on
the outside, at an inclination of 4 to 1, and is being securely protected by
stone-pitching. Having acquired the latter grounds, steps were at once
taken to form a large portion of it into a timber-pond, which was done by
enclosing an area of about 2G acres with a row of closely driven round larch-

piles.

In the year 1872 a work of considerable magnitude was commenced, and

is at the present time in course of progress ; it consists of the renewal of the

entire length of Albert Quay, and its further extension to the circular pier

Ahead of the Spencer Dock.  portion of this work for a length of 267 feet

is constructed of stone, in the same manner as that in which the other stone-

work of the docks is executed, the remainder being constructed of timber.

The entire length of the work is about G80 yards, which will give, besides

the renewal of the decayed portion of the Albert Quay, an additional length

of quayage of 207 yards. The timber-wharf is about 1776 feet in length by

25 feet in width at the top, is composed of three rows of bearing-piles of

creosoted pitch-pine timber, 12 inches square, the front row being 48 feet in

length, the middle row 43 feet, and the back row 40 feet. These piles arc

driven 5 feet apart, centres longitudinally, and between the piles in the front

and mid row sheeting-piles of the same timber 11 inches in thickness are

driven quite close together, the length of the front row being 37 feet, and

that of the middle row 32 feet. Tlie front and back rows of main piles are

secured together by diagonal braces. The platform is composed of strong

joists 12 inches by 6 inches, sheeted with timber planking 5| inches thick,

which is covered with a layer of bitumen, and paved with square setts.

The back of the wharf is sheeted with timber 4 inches in thickness, against

which is filled a backing of engine ashes and cinders, in order to secure the

least possible lateral thrust against the wliarf. The space iiuderneath the

wharf, between the front and back row of piles, is formed into a slight slope,

which is paved with pitching-stones, in order to prevent the abrasion of the

water from carrying away the soil ; and the front face of the wharf is cleaded

with open timber work to prevent the deposit and accumulation on the

slopes of bulky matters held in suspension by the water. Mooring-piles of

egreenheart timber, cuppd with cast-iron hoods, are driven every 60 feet apart

along the entire wharf to secure vessels to ; and a number of sets of strong

piles are driven 60 fe.et back from the wharf, and are connected with it by

strong tie-rods of wrought iron, in order to guard against the possibility of

the wharf being driven forward by any undue weight placed on the platform,

or by the weight of the materials by wliicli it is backed up. The piling of

this work is so designed that a depth of 16 feet at low water may be

secured by dredging without the risk of injuring the stability of the super-

structure, and by the setting back of the quay line as it is done a wat( r

space of about 335 feet in width will be provided in the river opposite tie

new wharf. This work is being carried on bj' Messrs. H. and J. Martin,

contractors, and will, when completed, cost about .Б50,000. During the

present year an extensive double line of tramway has been laid by the

Harbour Commissioners from the South Quay of the Abercorn Basin through
126 REPORT-- 1871'.

their property in Ballymacarrett, aud connected with the Central Railway

near the point where it crosses the county Down line. This tramway com-

pletes a system which opens np a thorough line of communication between

the county Antrim and county Down sides of the river, and affords a valu-

able means of transit of goods by rail from almost all quays in the harbour
to the County Down, Central, Ulster, and Northern Counties Railways, In
order to meet the rapidly increasing requirements of the trade of Belfast for
additional dock and harbour accommodation, I lately received instructions
from the Commissioners to jirepare plans and specifications for works of con-
siderable magnitude proposed to be carried out on the county Antrim side of
the harbour. The plans which I submitted were approved of by the Com-
missioners. They consist of a large wet dock 1200 feet in length, exclusive
of the entrance, and 280 feet in width, with a depth of 20 feet at low water.
This dock it is proposed to extend, when the trade of the port shall have
increased to such an extent as to warrant it, from where it is at present
shown to terminate to the foot of Corporation Square, an additional distance
of about 1250 feet, which would close the Clarendon Dock, and do away
with the two old graving-docks situate off that dock. The entire length of
the dock \\'hen completed would be 2450 feet, giving a water-area of about
 15|- acres, with two entrances, one where the present entrance to Prince's

Dock is situated, and one entering from the Spencer Dock ; and I may just
state that my reasons for recommending an open wet dock in preference to a

dock closed by gates are, that the moderate range of tide which exists in this
harbour being only 8 feet average, together with the improved modern
niechanical appliances for loading and discharging vessels, renders the rise

am fall of a few feet of tide an immaterial question either as regards time

 or i^pney ; and further, that with an open dock vessels will not require, as
 they" would with a close dock, to accumulate opposite the entrance to such
 an extent as to impede the general traffic in the outer or Spencer Dock, a
 free and open means of communication being maintained with the river,
 so that vessels can arrive and depart at all times of the tide. The gates
 and sluices of a close dock are also liable to derangement or accident, and
 tend under any circumstances more or less to limit the amount of traffic to

 the dock. .

    It is also proposed, in order to meet the demand for additional graving-
 dock accommodation, to construct, on the county Antrim side of the river, a

 dock of about GOO feet in length, capable of receiving the largest vessels

 built in or frequenting this port.

     Another extensive improvement, which has for some time occupied the

 attention of the Commissioners, is the formation of a new straight channel

 across the west bank, in continuation of the Victoria Channel, between the

 Twin Islands and "Whitehouse Roads ; and will, no doubt, when carried out, -

 afford great facilities (as compared with the present circuitory route) for
 vessels either entering or leaving the port, and lessen the risk of danger and
 delay consequent upon vessels taking the ground on the slob banks lying on
  either side of the present channel. I have thought it might be interesting,
 and have therefore appended detailed information as to the areas, &c. of
 the property at present in possession of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners.
 The total area of property on both sides of the harbour is 1008 a. 2r. 17 p.;
  of which 526 a. 1 r. 11 p. is on the county Antrim side, and ^^82 a. 1 r, 6 p.

 on the county Down side according to the oiiginal county boundary, 95 acres

 of the property on the county Antrim side being at present in course of
  reclamation. Of the above area about 470 acres have been reclaimed from

In their last Report the Committee described the results of a seriesof

experiments made with a view to determine the degree of accuracy to which

^-- ^it is possible to attain in gold-assaying. It was proved that the error was
included between the ^ and  parts of the portion of metal operated

upon. They recommended that a standard plate of pure gold, prepared by
the Chemist of the Mint, should be adopted as a basis for a new series of com-
parisons between the reports of different assayers ; but during the past year
the Committee have rejected this plate in favour of a second, which proved to

be of a sensibly higher degree of purity.

   Tliis new plate was submitted in December last to a jury of assayers, sum-

moned by the Goldsmiths' Company, and their certificate as to its purity is

published in the Report of the Deputy Master of the Mint for 1873, p. 58.

   Portions of this plate have since been sent by the Warden of the Standards,

to whom the custody of the trial plates is entrusted, to Mr. Du Bois of the

United States iMint, to M. Peligot at Paris, to the Chevalier Van Riemsdijk of

the Netherlands Mint, and to M. Stas at Brussels, as well as to the Assayers

of the Mints at Sydney and Melbourne.
    Only one Report has as yet been received, and the Committee therefore

considered that they were not in a position to proceed further with the

investigation before this Meeting of the British Association.
128 REPORT--1874.

Report of a Committee, consisting of Prof. A. S. Herschel, B.A.,
   F.R.A.S., and G. A. Lebour, F.G.S., on Experiments to determine
   the Thermal Conductivities of certain Rocks, showing especially the

    Geological Aspects of the Investigation.

Description and Results of the Experiments. By Prof. A. S. Herschel.

In the introductory notes on these experiments in the Transactions of the

Sections, p. 223, in the volume for ] 873 of these Keports, the list of rocka

selected and the manner of experimenting on them were described. With

the exception that sections of Calton trap-rock, of a great pj-ramid casing-

stone (nummulitic limestone), Caenstone (or Normandy building-limestone),

cannel-coal, chalk, and red brick were added to this list, and that the

apparatus received some small but very important improvements to make it

heat-tight, the material of the experiments, as well as the method of making

them, remained substantially the same as last year. Instead of a conical tin

vessel with 1 lb. of water, a cyHndrical one holding 2| lbs., with an internal

agitator and thermometer, was used as the cooler. The oi^ijosing surfaces

of the heater and cooler are faced with velvet, and are each encircled by a

caoutchouc collar, which in-ojocting a little beyond them clasps the circular

edge of the rock plate when it is placed between them ; two small slits in

each collar-edge allow the wires of a thermocouple to be introduced, touching

the rock-surfaces while the rock is being heated. AVith the view of traversing

the plate witli the thermopile in ditferent directions, the piece of stout

palladium wire (about 18 gauge), used as the electromotive element between

two iron wire terminations of a delicate reflecting galvanometer, was silver-

soldered to the iron wires at its two ends, all the wires being first rolled thin

and flat to some distance from the junctions. The scythe or scimitar-blade

shape generally given to the wire in rolling it thin was advantageous in the

construction, because instead of uniting the wires continuously in one straight

length and folding the points of junction upon opposite sides of the rock (thus

confining their range upon it to a single diameter or to one straight line),

advantage of the curvature was taken to connect the wires by superposition,

instead of by prolongation at their junctions, without ovcrl3'ing each other,

into two flat ogee-arches or merry-thought-like blades, between which the'

rock is held as in a forceps. The unrolled parts of the wires are bound very

firmly to a small square piece of wood, which acts as a handle to guide the

points of the forceps to vaiious parts of the rock-faces, while it keeps them

securely in their places, and also allows the small elastic pressure of the wires

to help to clasp the rock gently between the points of the thermoelectric

pincette without assistance from the velvet covers. After thus inserting a
rock section in the apparatus, protecting the rock and cooler from below with
a stout wooden screen, and from loss or gain of heat in other directions by

a suitably thick case of woollen stufl!" and a few bandages of similar mate-

rials, the rate of rise of temperature in the cooler, when agitated, was noted

by the average number of seconds taken by a delicate thermometer con-

tained in it to rise ^░ F. (one graduation on its stem), as soon as this rate

of rise was found to have become sensibly constant. About twenty minutes

were usually occupied in the beginning of an expenment with watching for

a steady condition of the thermometer-readings                                                                                                                                                                      and ten or  twelve minutes
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

more were required to ensure it, and to obtain the average rate of their

increase for the rock specimen under observation. The temperature-difler-
ence shown by the galvanometer at the same time at first rose rapidly to a

high maximum, and then descended very gradually to a fixed lower reading.

The pincette "was traversed to and fro over the rock-surfaces while the

thermometer was heing noted, and exhibited during these motions fluctu-

ations answering to about one or two Fahrenheit degrees on either side of

an average position ; corrected for zero of the scale, and reduced by trials

for this purpose between every two or three experiments to Fahrenheit

degrees, the temperature-difference thus found, divided by the quantity of

heat transmitted to the cooler jjer minute, gave the apparent thermal con-

ductivitj' of the plate. The results, in Peclet's units, were scarcely more

than one third of what Peclet and other earlier experimenters had obtained.

It was obvious that instead of marking the temperature-difference between

the two solid contact surfaces of the rock and velvet which they touched,

the points of the thermoelectric forceps showed the temperature of the fluid

air-bath in which those two surfaces are immersed. The extreme mobility of

this fluid medium, enabling it to pass to and fro through the velvet between

the plates of the heater and the cooler, while it equally insinuates itself

between the rock-surface and the thermopile that can only enter into actual

solid contact with each other (at least theoretically) at three points, controls

the temperature of the metallic thermometer far more powerfully than the

rock-face that it touches, and the real temperature-differences between the

rock-faces are accordingly completely masked. It is very probable that if

the velvet covers on the instrument are replaced by caoutchouc or soft wash-

leather, the source of this error will be very much reduced ; and although it

is certain that the confronting rock and leather surfaces will never have

actually the same temperature from the existence of a sensible quantity of

resisting air between them (so that, as before, the thermopile will not mark

the true rock-temperature-difforonce, but a mean between that difference

and a similar difference for the leather-faces), yet the range of this error

will be considerably smaller than in the experiments already made with
velvet covers, whose loose texture makes air-currents the principal medium

of heat-transmission through them. The comparative resiilts now obtained

are accordingly only subjoined with this Heport as first approximations,

from which the errors, anticipated last year as likely to arise from surface

characters of the rock sections, are as yet far from having been satisfactorily

removed.

To obtain the true rock-temperature-differences means were taken to

cement the thermopile-points to the rock with plaster, which it would be

desirable to adopt with as few samples as possible, on account of the tedious-

ness of the process, and the injury from using them thus as standards of

correction for the rest done to the beautifully worked surfaces of many of the

plates. If the correction found to be required can be restricted by the

mode of operating to a range of such small limits as to be applicable gene-
rally, without appreciable influence of the surface characters in making its

occasional departures from a mean value very sensible, then the reduction-

factor, found by absolute experiments with a few rocks of characteristically

rough and smooth or polished surfaces giving the true tcmperature-

difterence for a given heat-flow from the apparent one shown by the thermo-

couple placed simply between the rock and leather faces, will be admissible

(within the limits of error of the observations) to convert a list of apparent

conductivities, as just supposed to be obtained, from a mere comparative

table of relative conducting-powers to a table of absolute thermal conducti-

vities, in which the errors of the values given will certainly not be greater
than would in all probability have been committed had the direct method

of absolute measurement been applied separately to each specimen of the

list instead of only to a few rocks which furnish data for calculating the

absolute conductivities of the remainder. Circular disks of linen well wetted

with plaster of Paris (mixed with a little glue or white of egg) were laid over

the surfaces of two or three of the rocks, enclosing under them and against

the rock the two points of the thermopile-pincette, which were also first

dipped into plaster. When these had set quite hard under pressure, and were

thoroughly dried by a gentle heat, they were placed in the apparatus, and a

measurement of the absolute temperature-difference and accompanying heat-

flow was thus obtained, affording the real conductivity and a means of com-
parmg it with the apparent one found by similar observations of the same

rock when no plaster was used, and when the points of the thermopile

merely pressed against its surface. Thus the thermoelectric difference ob-

tained with the wire couples merely touching the surfaces of white statuary-

marble between velvet faces was 16░ ; while for the same heat-flow, when

the arms of the thermopile were firmly plastered to the marble plate, the

temperature-difference observed was only 6░-2*, being more than twice

and a half as large a difference in the former as in the latter case. With

whinstone the corresponding temperature-differences were 26░ and 8░-5, in
Athe proportion of very nearly 3:1.
                                                  similar experiment was made with

cannel-coal, of which the conductivity is much less than those of the last

mentioned rocks, the temperature-differences obtained being for the same

heat-flow  in  the  plain  and  plastered  plate  53░-4  and  39░-7                       in  the  proportion

of only 1-37: 1, a far smaller reduction than was observed in the two fore-

going cases. Care is, however, necessary to introduce wet plaster under as

well'as over the points of the thermopile in cementing them to the rock, that

air may be excluded and the junction may be solid--a precaution which was

omitted in this case, and plaster without size was used, which in drying

sometimes flakes off from the rock-surface, either entirely or in places, which

may render an experiment, as that on canacl-coal may not impossibly have

been from this cause, entirely valueless ; yet this result presents itself, with

many others met with in the investigation, as very well worth repetition,

with fresh precautions and with new arrangements, to guard against the

possibility of false conclusions.

   Adopting for the present, as probably not far from the truth, a common

reduction-factor of 2|- as the proportion in which the recorded tempcrature-

diftcrences of the plain rock-surfaces between velvet faces exceeded the true
temperature-differences of the surfaces of the rocks examined, and intro-

ducing some very small corrections for the thicknesses of the plates, the
thermal capacity of the metal cooler, &c., which are all probably (as well as

the allowance for heat-absorption in raising the temperature of the rock
plates very slowly during the observations) really negligible in comparison
with the uncertainty that attaches (except in one or two well-observed cases

of absolutely measured tcmperature-diflerences of the rock-faces) to the

great majority of the determinations from unknown peculiarities of surface-

contact and heat-transfer where air surrounds the thermopile, the following

   Speaking broadly, one may say that the lighter and more porous the rock

the greater its resistance to heat ; the more compact and crystalline the less
is this resistance. Of the specimens operated on, granite of averaged- sized
grain offered the least resistance to the passage of heat, and coal and plaster
of Paris were at the other end of the scale with the greatest resistance.

The intermediate grouping of the other substances is interesting, and may be

perhaps best understood by means of a mental diagram. Imagining a line
divided into nine equal parts, the ten points being marked A, B, C, D, E, F,

KG, H, I, respectively ; then, according to the resistances calculated from

the Table of conductivities given in the first part of the Report :

              A = Granite (with least resistance).

               B = Grit.

                  C=Chalk.

             =D Basalt.

              H=?J
             =I Shale.

                 K=Coal and plaster of Paris (highest resistance).

  Now between A and B Ave get five kinds of marble and Calton trap-rock,

and close to B, Kenton sandstone and Red Serpentine ; between B and C we

get Numnuilitic limestone, alabaster, and slate.

   When a much larger number of rocks have been experimented on we may

hope to fill up the gaps, and show the natural grouping still more strikingly;

and it will then become a question whether a scale somewhat of the nature

of that iust sketched out may not be constructed fully and accuratelj', which

to the geologist would afford a ready means of referring new observations

Ato their proper relative positions.  scale of this kind would become to the

physical geologist something analogous to what the scale of hardness is to

the mineralogist. Using even the imperfect one which is all we can arrive

at yet, I have translated, so to speak, some of the detailed sections of strata

in which underground temperatures have been observed into heat-resistance-

equivalents with such results as I ho])c to be able to embody in next year's

Report, showing how far the connexion which undoubtedly exists between

the conductivity of the various rocks and the tomperatui'es observed is dis-

turbed, altered, and, I believe, occasionally reversed by external conditions.

I have especially worked this out in the case of the South Hetton Colliery

section, which for the accuracy of the temperature observations and the

exactness of the boring records, together with considerable depth, is second to

none (see Brit. Assoc. Report, 1872, p. 132). In this case an evident rela-

tion is observable between the calculated conductivities and the thermometric

results. This case and the others, however, require considerably more working-

out before the result can be published.
ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE SETTLE CAVES.  1 ?i3

Second Report of the Committee, consisting of Sir John Lubbock,

   Bart., Prof. Hughes, Prof. W. Boyd Dawkins, Messrs. L. C. Miall

    and R. H. Tiddeman, appointed for the purpose of assisting in the

   Exploration of the Settle Caves {Victoria Cave). Drawn up by

    R. H. Tiddeman, Secretary.

The Committee have to record their deep sorrow at the loss sustained by the

death of one of their number, the late Professor Phillips, a loss so univer-
sally felt, that any remarks upon the matter would bo superfluous ; suffice it
to say that Professor Phillips took great interest iu the exploration, aud was

very anxious for its further prosecution.

   On the 18th of September tlie Committee with a select party of the Mem-

bers went to see the Cave aud the Cave Collection at the invitation of Mr.
John Birkbeck, Sen., and were most hospitably entertained by him and his
son, the Treasurer and Secretary to the Settle Committee. Although the
W'cather was very bad and dusk came on earlier than was convenient, enough
was seen to show the members of the expedition the chief bearings and diffi-

culties of the exploration. On their return, the Museum at Giggleswick

School was visited, and ranch satisfaction was expressed at the results already

obtained, Professor Phillips in particular being very warm in his admu-ation.

    At a Meeting of the Settle Committee held at Giggleswick on the 9th of
October, Sir J. P. Kay-Shuttleworth, Bart., in the chair, the further working
of the Cave was discussed, and it was decided that work should be recom-
menced so soon as subscriptions to the amount of Б100, inclusive of the As-
sociation grant, had been received. It was further proposed and agreed that
your Reporter should be entrusted with the scientific direction of the work.
There being a debt; of over .Б37 from the work of the preceding year, Mr.
John Birkbeck, Sen., one of the most energetic promoters of the work from
the commencement, generously paid that sum in order that the Committee
might start afresh unhampered by any liabilities.

    The Settle Committee have raised and expended in the course of the year,
besides the British-Association grant of .Б50, Б113 4s. 2>cl.

   On the 7th of October a most important communication was received from

Professor Busk. It was to the effect that a certain bone from the cave, which

had been in his keeping some time and had been doubtfully referred to

--elephant, was undoubtedly human a fibula of unusually clumsy build, and

in that respect not unlike the same bone in the Mentone skeleton. This

bone was exhumed by the Committee in May 1872, and was lying in juxta-

position with and under circumstances which left no doubt of its having been

contemporary with Ursus spelceus and ferox, Hycena, lihinoceros tichorhiniis.

Bison, and Cervus elaphus; also close by it were two small molars of Ek~

phas. It was at fii-st supposed that these were 2y>'"n{genius. Dr. Leith
Adams, however, during the past year expressed a doubt upon the determi-
nation, and after a careful comparison with type specimens in the British
Museum, pronounced them to be Elephas antiquum, an opinion in which Mr.
T. Davies concurs. Professor Busk, after examining them again does not
commit himself to a definite opinion, but thinks on the whole that they are
most likely aiUtqxms. The balance of opinion, therefore, strongly preponde-
rates in favour of Dr. Leith Adams's decision, and this is important as ex-
tending the range of that species. It had been before found at Kirkdale, but
was previously unknown in the north-west of England.

    On the 9th of December Professor Busk read a paper upon, the humau

fibula to the Anthropological Institute. He states that " there is nothing

in the condition of the bono opposed to its belonging to the most remote
antiquity, nor to its owner having been coeval with the extinct mammalia
(before mentioned), with whose remains the specimen, as to condition, difters
in no appreciable respect- Its interest, therefore, as representing one of the
earliest extant specimens of humanity, will be at once obvious. But in
another regard also it appears desirable that some notice of it should be placed
on record. The very iiausual form and thickness of the bone have caused
such great difficulty in its recognition as human, that it is well worth while
to draw attention to its peculiarities." Professor Busk proceeds to state that

after much hesitation he was induced to think, at the suggestion of Mr. James

Plower, that the bone in question might be referred to a small form of ele-
phant ; but considerable doubt remained on their minds untU Professor Busk
saw the Mentone skeleton at Paris, and noticing the thick and clumsy fibula
belonging to it, was at once struck with the apparent resemblance between
it and the Victoria-Cave bone. Following up this suggestion, Mr. James

Flower discovered in the Museum of the College of Burgeons a recent human

fibula of unusual thickness, which at once removed all doubt. The circum-
ference of the cave bone about the middle is 2"-2. The unusually thick
fibula with which Professor Busk compares it measures 2", whereas he con-
siders that ordinary full-sized human fibulas may be taken at from 1"*4 to

 1"'8. It is obvious, therefore, that the Settle specimen is unusually thick.
 Professor Busk expresses his opinion that it does not appear from the form of

 the bone that the corresponding tibia was platycnemic, but he hopes that

further exploration may clear up this and other interesting points. (Journal

 of the Anthropological Institute, vol. iii. No. 3, pp. 392-4.)
    This communication was of the greatest interest, for it had been some time

 before pointed out that there was much chance of the beds in which this bone
 occurred being preglacial, or at any rate of an age preceding that time when

 Scotland, a great part of Ireland, and the north of England were slumbering

 beneath a great sheet of ice similar to those which now cover the greater

 part of Greenland and enshroud a portion of the southern hemisphere.
    The Committee was decided by this in its course of work for the year. The

 question was one of such importance, that we felt the first thing to be done
 was to develop all the e\ddence that could be procured upon the question of
 whether these beds containing the older mammals and Man were of pre-

 glacial or interglacial age or not.

    In order that these operations may be the better understood, it is neces-

 sary briefly to recapitulate the order and succession of beds inside and out-
 side the cave. The three principal beds inside the cave are

                                     The Upper Cave-earth,
                                     The Laminated Clay,
                                     The Lower Cave-earth.

 These beds were described by your Keporter in a communication to the Settle-
 Caves Committee early in 1871, and subsequently to the British Association
 in 1872, but appeared in full in the ' Geological Magazine ' for January 1873,
 to which ho must refer for detailed description. In those communications
 reasons were given for thinking it probable that the laminated clay was ac-

 cumulated under glacial conditions from the muddy water of a glacier or an
 ice-sheet. Such water would penetrate hoUows in the rocks anywhere, and
 have a tendency to throw down its mud. Subsequent explorations have only
 served to confirm this view. First (in 1872) came the discovery of the Pleis'-.
             ON THE EXPLORATION OF THE SETTLE CAVES.              135

tocene fauna at some depth below the laminated clay, they never having been

found above it. Next, the exploration brought to light the existence of a

bed of glacial boulders resting on the denuded edges of the lower cave-earth.

The work of the past year has shown exceedingly well the extent and im-

portance of this bed, and further has brought to light the existence of several

well-glaciated small boulders in the laminated clay itself. This clay, so far,

has yielded no organic remains. It ranges quite across the cave, and is co-

extensive with the explorations so far as they have gone, and in one place

attains a thickness of 12 feet. It has been a horizon of great importance

from its continuity, distinguishing the earlier from the later beds. The latest

work in chamber J) (on the right), however, appears to show that it is di-

minishing in thickness as we go inwards in that direction. Besides the main
bed of it, many of the little chinks between fragments of rock in the lower
cave-earth have been filled up with it. This filling in may have occurred at

about the same time as the formation of the great mass above ; for certainly

glacial conditions imply amongst other things the running of much muddy

water, and wherever preexisting chinks occui-red, they would have much
chance of being filled up. Laminated clay of course may be, and often is,

formed under other than glacial conditions (that of the Victoria Cave, indeed,

bears a strong resemblance to the famous Nile-mud); but here its thickness and

the contrast it affords to the deposits above and below, taken with its extent,

seem to demonstrate a change and a long continuance of distinct physical

conditions.

It was noticed by those who visited the Victoria Cave last year that it is

approached by a narrow cutting on the right as you face it. This had been

made through a great thickness of "screes" or limestone talus ; and below that

talus, close to a large fallen block of limestone, which, with the face of rock

en the right, formed a natural arch about 7 feet high, were visible at that

time a few glaciated boulders. It was determined to expose these boulders

and follow them, noting their position and range ; but, in order to do this,

we were under the necessity of removing a great mass of talus. Moreover,

the " tip " of the old Avorkings had accumulated in the front to such an extent

Weas to seriously impede the operations.  therefore proceeded to remove a

large breadth both of the tip and of the talus. The removal of the tip was

of course mere mechanical labour, but the talus was removed with careful

searching for the following reasons.

In the first place, it occurred to us that if the boulders beneath the cliff

had fallen from that cliff, or from hollows in it, it was not improbable that

other boulders might be found at different heights in the talus.

Secondly, we thought that if the boulders at the bottom of the talus had

been deposited in their position in glacial times, and the talus represented

the wearing away of the cliff by frost and other atmospheric influences, we

might get a succession (an imperfect one, but still a succession) of the differ-

ent forms of life which had followed one another thi'ough that long period.

   Our first inquii-y established the fact that through this great thickness

(19 feet) of talus, from the base of the Roman layer which lies within the

first two feet of the surface down to the horizon where the boulders lie in a

great mass, not a single fragment of foreign rock, whether of Silurian grit,

of MiUstone-grit, or of limestone, other than that of which the cliff above is

composed, occm-red. The whole mass consisted of sharply angular fragments

of white limestone.  No rounded  forms  existed ;  nothing with   any of the
                                                                                                                                                                          .

deposit spoke of the slow wearing away of a cliff, free from drift, by the

ordinary effects of winter frosts and summer rain. The edge of the cliff, on

the retiring of the ice-sheet, was probably as free from glacial drift as we

now find it.

Our second inquiry, which proceeded simultaneously with the first, met

with only negative results. From the bottom of the Roman layer to the main

mass of the boulders we met with no bones whatever, nor with anj'' evidence

of man's presence*. If, through the long time represented by these 19 feet of

talus, animals existed in the neighbourhood, either they did not happen to

die at or to be carried to the spot excavated, or tlieir bones have been entirely

dissolved by the action of rain. The former seems the more probable alter-

native ; for if bones were dissolved, some remains of teeth at any rate would

probably survive. A few bones, however, were found u])on and among the

boulders ; these we have not yet had an opportunit)' to determine, and from

their position it is doubtful to what age they may belong, for it is quite pos-
sible that they may have been washed out of the sloping denuded edges of

the lower cave-earth on which the boulders rest. One appears to be a frag-

ment of a very large bone, and possibly may be elephant ; another is the

OS calcis of an ox.

   The Eoman layer, as the black band is with much reason called, contained

several different kinds of pottery, some coarse and black, others white, and

some red Samian Avare. Of bronze articles six were found : two were brace-

lets, one consisting of three strands of wire twisted, with the hook by which

it was fastened still remaining at one end ; a second was thicker, consisting

of five strands, but merely a fragment, only one fourth of what must have

been its entire length ; a band of thin bronze plate, which looks as if it

might have bound a sword- or dagger-sheath ; the bow end of a broken key

a scent-box or vinaigrette perforated with four holes, in appearance some-

thing like the top of a peppercaster, only one side of it remaining, together

with the hinge still in working order, and the loop by which it was sus-

pended round the fair neck of its wearer. Similar ornaments are figured in

' Eoman Antiquities, Mansion House,' by Mr. J. E. Price, F.S.A., to whom we

Aarc indebted for its identification.  sixth object was found amongst some

of the lloman laj^er which had been thrown over the tip, and is of doubtful

age. It is a circular plate 1| inch in diameter, with a hole in the centre and

two rivets at the back. It must have been afiixed to some perishable mate-

rial, for the rivets which project for some distance at their distal ends are

quite perfect. It seems to have some traces of silvering at its centre. During

the removal of the talus, the Eeporter found three rudely discoidal pieces of

Carboniferous gritstone, which appeared to have been roughly chipped to a

diameter of between 5 and 6 inches. They were red, and had evidently been

subjected to fire ; most probably they had been used as pot-boilers, and their
discoidal form was given to them that they might better fit the bottom of the

pot. They were from the upper portion of the talus, that containing the

pottery, but the exact position had been forgotten by the workmen.

As the summer advanced, the talus and overlying " tip " were so far re-

moved that it was determined to convene a Meeting of the Committee and

others to witness the removal of the last layers of talus and the uncovering

of the boulder-bod. Invitations for the 6th of July were issued to aU the

Committee, to all who had written papers on the cave, and some other

geologists.

     Of the British Association Committee, only Mr. MiaU and I were able to

attend ; Mr. John Birkbeck, Jun., represented the Settle Committee : we had

the valuable assistance of Messrs. Aveline, Dakyns, and otlicr gentlemen.

We were unfortunately deprived at the last moment of the valuable services

of Professor Kamsay, who had expressed his intention of being present, but

was prevented by public business.

   In the course of the 6th and 7th of July the boulders were quickly brought

to view and in great numbers ; we counted over two hundred, of dimensions

from a few inclies to 6 feet in diameter, besides numberless smaller ones
which it was not possible to preserve. Wherever a boulder was exposed it
was left hi situ, and the clearing away of the talus proceeded along the face

of the bed. In several places we found a little clay above the boulders ; but

it was apparently of very recent introduction, and had been washed into the
talus by the draining of Avaler from above before the workings had got down
to their present level. This was apparent from its containing blades of grass
and pieces of straw which had not rotted away.

    The boulders were found to be lying in an irregular layer from 3 to 4 feet

tbiek at bottom, dipping outwards from the cave in a direction W. 40░ S.,
and extending across its mouth at the level where we were then working

but at the north-western extremity of its range it curved round more to the
north, and therefore dijjped more westerly, showing in all a breadth of glacial
deposits of about 12 yards. The boulders consisted almost exclusivelj' of
blocks of Silurian grit and of Carboniferous Limestone in about equal num-
bers, but there were one or two of Carboniferous Sandstone. The form was
qviite enough to distinguish the Carboniferous Limestone boulders from the
sharply angular blocks of the talus; but, besides, many of them were of black
bituminous limestone, and not of the white limestone in which the cavern is
excavated. They were nearly all of well-marked glacial form, and most re-
tained glacial markings. One round pebble of limestone was found near the
base of the bed. The sites, dimensions, and arrangement of some of the

principal were noted with reference to a level datum-line running N. 40░ W.

from a mark upon the wail of rock on the right, and after the saction had
been well cleared of talus ; the boulders were marked (S) for Silurian and (L)
for limestone, and then photographed. Angular pieces of limestone, similar

to those in the lower cave-earth and in the talus, were mixed up with

boulders throughout, and the whole was filled in with mud, but much of it
appeared to be rather recent. The boulder-bed thinned away upwards, and

 is apparently thickening rapidly towards the dip ; doubtless it will be found

much thicker at a lower level.

In accordance with a suggestion from Professor Prestwich, a hole was dug

in front of the large fallen block which forms the arch already mentioned,

Aand the boulder-bed penetrated.  great many large and small boulders

were dug out of this hole. Beneath was a bed of angular gravel filled in

with clay a few inches thick. When washed, the small pieces of stone of

which it was composed were found to be really small boulders, many of

them scratched and bruised. Whilst wet it bore some resemblance to the

gravel which covers little cones of ice low down upon a glacier near the

moraine, and which ofi'ers such apparently good, but really bad foothold to
unwary travellers *. Below this were a few inches of yellow clay, which

Mr. Jackson, our Superintendent, says is similar to that which was found at

the bottom of the 12 feet of laminated clay in the 25-foot shaft in Chamber B.

This is an interesting point ; for if the laminated clay and the boulder-bed

are both^ of glacial age, it seems likely that this thin bed of yellow clay

--138 REPORT 1874.

beneath them may have been forming simultaneously inside and outside the
cave ; and these two spots, we believe, are the only places where we have
found distinctly ycUow clay during the explorations. Some small fragments

of bone were found beneath the yellow clay in ordinary cave-mud with an-
gular limestone, to all appearance lower cave-earth, similar to that more fully

exposed in the cave ; but we came down upon some very large blocks of

limestone, and did not think it advisable to enlarge the hole.
    This is the only vertical hole which the Committee have dug this year, and

it is shallow, not more than 4 feet deep. All our operations have been con-
ducted by digging out in horizontal layers, to avoid any confusion which
might arise from the falling in or mixing up of things of different ages in

vertical shafts.

   Those who were present at the uncovering of the boulders were unani-

mously of opinion that they had not fallen from the clilf in postglacial times,

for the following reasons :

    1. The cliff immediately above the cave is free from any boulder deposits

             for a considerable distance.

   2. The boulders lie at the base of all the talus, which must have been
           forming ever since glacial conditions declined, and no other falls of
            even isolated boulders have occurred throughout the whole thickness

              of screes.

   3. The boulders are so close beneath the cliff, that if all the limestone
         which has fallen from it and is now lying on the boulders could be
          restored to the cliff, it would project so much further forward, that
           the fall of the boulders from the cliff to their present position would

            be impossible.

   Professor Prestwich and Mr. Bristow, who were good enough to visit the

cave earlier in the year, both give it as their opinion that the boulders had
not fallen from the cliff, but were part of the ordinary drift deposit which
covers the bottom of the valley and lines the hill-sides up to the bottom of
the cliff's hard bJ^

   The important bearing of these questions upon the correlation and age of

the drifts of England and the antiquity of Man cannot be overestimated*.
If rightly interpreted, it may give the key to much that has hitherto been

imsatisfactory, and even contradictory, in Pleistocene geology.

   In conclusion, the Committee have much pleasure in offering their thanks
to the Settle Committee for the generous and liberal manner in which they
have carried on this important investigation, and to Mr. John Birkbeck, Jun.,

for his valuable services as Honorary Treasurer and Secretary from the com-
mencement.

   They have also to thank the following gentlemen for assistance kindly

--given : Professor Busk, Dr. Leith Adams, Mr. Franks, and Mr. T. Davies of

the British Museum.
   Your Committee propose that they may be reappointed.

        On the Industrial Uses of the Upper Bann River.
            By John Smyth, Jun., M.A., C.E., F.C.S.

[A communication ordered by the General Committee to be printed in cxfciiso.]

The river Bann rises in the Moiirnc Mountains and flows a distance of 85
miles, in a northerly direction, through Lough Ncagh into the North- Atlantic
Ocean at Coleraine. Its drainage-area, including that of its many tribu-
taries and the surface of Lough Ncagh, is 2345 square miles, and is surpassed
in Ireland only by that of the Shannon, which is 6946 square miles, and the
Barrow Nore and Suir, which is 3410 square miles. This area or rainfall
gathering-ground is well surrounded by mountains flanked by high table-
land, the descent from which is rapid. The banks of the various branches

of the Bann, therefore, ofi'er pecuharly favourable sites for mills, a fact which
has been well taken advantage of by the industrious inhabitants of this pros-

perous district, and, to a large extent, contributed to the establishment of the

linen trade in the north of Ireland. The principal branches or tributaries of
the Bann are the

. Although the Upper Bann drains a much smallei- area than either the

Blackwatcr or Maine, it is the most important and interesting in an econo-
mic and engiiieering aspect. For in that valuable work ' The Industrial

Besoijrces of Ireland,' published thirty years ago by Sir Robert Kane, he says
" The Upper Bann is the most fuUy economized river in Ireland," and refers
to it as of an example worthy of imitation in the application of engineering

science to the development of natural resources by the construction of its

reservoirs. I therefore proceed to describe what has already been done to
turn its natural advantages to good account and the result.

   The Upper Bann, from its source to the point where the water from the last
miU is returned to the river, is about 31 miles long, and drains an area of
134 square miles, or one seventeenth of that of the Banu-system. Trom this
point to Lough Ncagh, a distance of 10 miles, it is navigable, and forms with
the Cusher river and canal part of the Newry navigation. There is no record,
as far as I have been able to discover, of the time mills were first erected
on the Upper Bann. The weir-dams which are found in the old maps
bear the appearance of ancient construction ; and reference is made in ancient
leases to the repair of weir-dams and the necessity of grinding corn at the
manor mill. There is no doubt but that the establishment of the linen trade
on the river Bann is of very ancient date. It is stated that in the year 1772
there were 26 bleach-mills on the Bann, and the linens from that district were
weU known and highly esteemed in England and Scotland. The machinery
in these miUs was driven by undershot-wheels, which only give out about 25
per cent, of the theoretical useful efl'ect of the fall of water. About the year
1833, however, apphcation was made by Mr. Law, of Hazelbank mill, to the
late Sir William Pairbairn, F.li.S., the celebrated hydraulic engineer, who,
--140 REPORT 1874.

through a professional connexion with Ireland of fifty years, has so much

advanced the usefulness of the Upper Banu by improved mechanical and en-

gineering appliances ; unfortunately for the world that eminent and invalu-
able life has just terminated, after having accomplished more than the most

sanguine could hope to see realized in a lifetime. He put up an iron breast-

wheel, which gave great satisfaction and is still capable of doing good work.

It was at first used for driving linen beetling-machines, and was calculated
to give a useful effect equal to 60 per cent, of the theoretical power of the

water. He erected another of the same kind shortly after this at ^capatrick, to

drive beetling-engines and power-looms, and subsequently several others were
put up at different mills on the river by Mr. Boyd and the firm of Coatcs and

Young, of Belfast. In 1835 the principal miU-owners formed themselves into

a provisional Committee to take steps to procure a better and more regular
supply of water by the construction of reservoirs. They placed the matter

ill the hands of Sir AVilliam Fairbairn, who, assisted by J. F. Batcman, Esq.,
F.ll.S., surveyed the collecting-grounds of the river Bann and its several

tributaries, and made an excellent and most interesting report of the water-

bearing resources of the district. He recommended the construction of two

impounding reservoirs, Lough Island Heavy and Deer's Meadow, and one
auxiliary one, the Corbet Lough. The Bann lleservoir Company was then

formed, and Lough Island Eeavy first constructed according to the plans and

under the superintendence of Mr. Bateman, and was finished in the latter

part of the year 1839.

The Corbet reservoir M'as also constructed, but not to the full extent

contemplated, the embankment having been made to impound the water to
a dei^th only of 11 feet 3 inches instead of 18 feet. Much difliculty was

encountered in the worlc, which was not finished till the year 1847.

The Deer's-Meadow reservoir was abandoned, as the works were of a heavy

character, and the gathering-ground being small, it was feared there would not

Abe sufficient water to fill it.  detailed account is given of the works at

Lough Island Reavy by Mr. Bateman in the ' Transactions of the Institution

of Civil Engineers ' for 1841 or 1842, so it is not necessary to do more than
to describe a few specialities. The works arc most substantial, and the em-

bankments never showed any deficiency or weakness ; one peculiarity in their

construction is the use of a wall of peat on the water side of the puddle-wall

and another on the water face of the embankment. " Its application has been

most successful, as there has been no leakage through the embankment. I

have found peat used in this way in conjunction with clay puddle most effi-

cacious in mill-dams and river- courses, and for surrounding smooth iron pipes

in their passage through banks ; indeed the value of its use is well attested by

the prevalent practice of its traditional adoption in difficult cases in those

districts where it is procurable. Some experiments made to determine the

rationale of its action, showed that, like a sponge, it expands to fill the space

left by the shrinkage of the puddle ; if this space were not thus occupied,
water would trickle into the fissures and gradually wash soft material away.

   In the solid ground under the main embankment a culvert is built about

150 feet long, filled at the half of its length by a solid plug of masonry,

into which three iron pipes are inserted. These pipes are each 18 inches in

diameter ; one of these, which lies above the other two, is for use in cases of

emergency, only Tg feet long and closed (by a dead flanche) on the discharge

end; the others, which arc laid on the bottom of the culvert, are 82 feet long

and provided with sluice-valves. These valves are surrounded by an arched

chamber (an enlargement of the outer culvert), and are regulated, according
                     ON THE INDUSTRIAL USES OF THE UPPER BANN RIVER.  141

to the depth of water in the reservoir, to give the regular supply allowed to

tlic mills. The greatest depth to which the reservoir is filled over the level

of discharge of these pipes is 38^ feet; when this is the case the surface of

the lake is ahout 250 acres in extent. It was intended to have been 40 feet,

hut the works were not carried out to that extent. The culvert, as Mr.

Bateraan tells us in his paper, has given some trouble, since the superin-

tendent did not carry out the work in accordance with his designs, having

surrounded the arch with rubble-backing. The cement, which was made on

the ground from the specification of M. Vicat, just then published, gave way

under the water pressure, was washed out of the joints and allowed the

water to escape from the reservoir through the rubble-backing. Mr. Bateman

then had part of the backing removed and replaced by puddle, and the inner

joints of the tunnel caulked with oakum. This cured the evil for sometime;

but in a few years the leakage again appeared, and had increased so much in

1867 that Mr. Bateman was brought over to examine it. He recommended

as the only effectual remedy to the leakage to cut out the centre of the em-

bankment down to the culvert, take away the rubble-backing and all loose

material around the culvert, and erect perfectly water-tight waUs closely

connected with the existing masonry on each side of the puddle-ti'ench. As

it was then too late in the season to carry out this great work, he recom-

mended as a temporary expedient to repeat the measures adopted in 1839,

of puddling round the mouth of the inner culvert and caulking all its open

joints, also, if necessary, to make good the concrete under the invert. The

Directorsof the Bann Keservoir Company were unwilUng to incur the expense

of cutting out the centre of the embankment, as it would not only have cost

a large sum for the work, but also have stopped the rates for at least a year.

I was therefore requested to make the smaller work, recommended as tem-

porary, if possible so effectual in moderating or stopping the leakage as to

prevent recourse being had to the larger work. I had therefore a portion of

the bank excavated so as to expose about six feet of the culvert close to the

forebay or mouth, the concrete under the invert removed for about three feet,

and a close wall of fire-brick and Portland cement built under and around

the culvert, with which it was closely united. The excavation was then

made up with puddle and dry peat, so staunch as to prevent access of water

from the embankment to the backing of the culvert, and the old plan of

caulking and cementing the open joints prevented the water getting to it

through the inside of the arch. This caulking was not carried out as com-

pletely as I wished, since it was then so late in the season that further delay

in getting water into the reservoir would have been likely to entail serious

loss                 so only the points that showed weakness were attended to, and a lining
                  ;

of cement applied to the whole of the inner culvert.

The result was most satisfactory, asthe leakage was almost entirely stojiped,

and since then has given no trouble. The insignificant escape then left,

although somewhat increased by the softening of the cement in some of the

joints, may be stopped when a convenient opportunity occurs by caulking                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      or
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

the difficulty of the imperfect masonry may be got over by continuing the

iron pipes back to the mouth of the culvert, and securing them there by a

Asolid plug of masonry.  portion of this leakage is probably derived from a

Aspring, as it is harder than the water in the reservoir. more detailed descrip-

tion of these repairs may be found in a paper by me published in the ' Trans-

actions of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland,' vol. ix. p. .51.

   Lough Island Reavy reservoir is 430 feet above the sea- level, and is mainly

supplied from the Muddock river by a feeder of about one and a half mile
.142  REPORT-- 1871.

long, which leaves the river at a point 10 feet higher than the top level of
the reservoir, and three miles from its source on the Butter Mountain, There

are stop-sluices at the head or intake of the feeder to turn the water back

into the river when the reservoir is full. Another feeder from the Money-

scalp river supplies to the reservoir about one fourth the quantity derived
from the Muddock, and is also supplied with stop-sluices. This Moneyscalp

river runs to the sea at Newcastle. The whole rainfall gathering-ground of
Lough Island Eeavy, including the lake itself, is about five square miles.
The water from the pipes for the supply of the mills is delivered into an open
conduit, which is about one mile long, and joins the Muddock again about a
mile below the intake.

   The river Muddock is one of the most important branches of the Bann ; it
rises about 1200 feet above the top water-level of the reservoir, and conse-
quently falls nearly 400 feet per mile above the intake of the feeder. For
three miles below the reservoir the fall is about 40 feet per mUe, and from
that to its confluence with the river Bann (which is also three miles) the fall
is only 3 feet per mile. This last three miles of the river Muddock has been
a source of great trouble and expense to the Bann Reservoir Company, as it
is not only sluggish in its flow, but exceedingly tortuous, and consequently
continually siltiug-up. There is a difficulty in point of law as to whether
the riparian owners or the Reservoir Company should clean the river. This
question is at present being argued. The lleservoir Company did clean out
the river sixteen years ago, when they were in faidt in not putting down the
sluices at the intake of the Moneyscalp feeder when the reservoir was full
consequently in time of flood water flowed down the old Muddock river
which had never done so before the formation of the reservoir ; and the Com-
pany were held responsible under an arbitration and recommended to scour
the river. As they had no power over the banks of the stream, they were
obliged to pay large sums to the farmers for their use, and also for throwing
out on and removing from them the scourings and weeds, although by the
construction of the reservoir floods are caught which previously overflowed
these low lands for the greater part of the year. Since then some of the
banks have fallen in, and the weeds have increased so much as to form

with the siltings a serious obstruction to the discharge of sufficient water

for the miU supply, which in some places makes its way up the side drains,

and (where the back drains are not attended to) overflows grounds lower

--than the banks ; and actions have been taken against the Company. The

banks also are low indeed, for this three miles of the Muddock's course,
under the level to which floods sometimes rise in the Bann at its moutJi

consequently these floods make their way back and overflow to a great depth
large tracts of low land on each side. The outlet is through a narrow bridge,
and so, augmented by the Muddock's own floods, they are prevented from
running off rapidly and thus injure these lands, for which the Bann Reservoir
Company were obliged to pay damages.

    There is a great obstruction to the flow of the Bann at its confluence with
the Muddock, which if removed, and the channel of the Muddock altered for

 about fifty yards, so as to flow with instead of against the stream of the

 Bann, the Bann also widened and deepened for a short distance, and tlio iiar-
row Muddock bridge referred to above widened and deepened, the floods of
 the Bann might in a great measure be prevented from interfering with the
Muddock, and the drainage of the Muddock itself much improved. The
 Reservoir Company were at that time willing to unite with the proprietors
 of the land in carrying out this improvement, but the latter were not willing

to join. From the confluence of the Muddock to Kate's Bridge, a distance

of six and a half miles, there is 27 feet !) inches of unoccupied full. There

were two weir-dams on this reach, called Eonghan and Ballyroney ; the former
was taken down more than ten years ago, and the latter has become dila-

pidated since the mill was burnt a few years ago. From Kate's Bridge to

Aughnacloy or Ervin's Weir, a distance of two miles, there is one fall of

7 feet 3 inches occupied by a corn-mill and 2| feet of unoccupied fall. The

intake of the feeder to the Corbet reservoir from the Bann is about thirty

yards above Ervin's Weir, and is regulated by sluices 20 feet wide, which

admit a large quantity of water when the river is flooded. Outside these

sluices a stone ridge or sill, at a level 1|- inch below that of Ervin's Weir, is

built across the widened mouth of the feeder to regulate between the Bann

Keservoir Company and the mill-owners on this fall. On this sill the care-

taker daily measures the depth of water, and, when he finds it below the

standard, supplies the deficiency from the Corbet Reservoir ; when that is

exhausted he sends for a supply to Lough Island Keavy. The rainfall

gathering-ground of the Bann above this point is eighty square miles, and

there is a rain-gauge now kept there by the caretaker, who also keeps a

register of the depth of the daily flow of water over Ervin's Weir and the

daily height of water in the reservoir. The feeder is one and three eigliths of

a mile long and 24 feet wide. At its entrance to the reservoir there are

self-acting gates, which close when the water in the reservoir is higher than

that in the feeder. The area of the reservoir when fuU is 70 acres, and

the greatest depth of water above the lowest point of discharge 11 feet

3 inches. The sill at Ervin's Weir is 7 feet above the lowest point of dis-

charge, so the river raises the reservoir as much in excess of that height

Aas the floods rise above the sill.  small stream at the north-east end of

the reservoir makes it up to the top level in winter. The water from the

reservoir is discharged through three iron sluices 3 feet wide each, and capable

of being raised to a height of 1 foot : one only of these is now used. The

sluice-frame is secured in a strong water-tight wall in the centre of the em-

bankment, beliind which is an arched chamber, into which the water floM's,
and passes down a conduit, a quarter of a mile long and 20 feet wide, to the
river. There was only embankment required for this reservoir ; a considerable

portion of the feeder also required embanking. It cost more, in proportion

to the extent of the works, than Lough Island Eeavy, as the contractor was

not able to carry out his contract, and the Company were obliged to finish it

themselves. Lough Island Heavy cost for engineering works Б15,000, and

for land Б6000.       The  capital of the  Company is Б31,000                                                                                deducting the

reserve fund of Б1000, there remains Б9000 for the Corbet reservoir and

parliamentary expenses. The income of the Company is derived from the

falls, on which the charge is Б10 per annum per foot to linen-bleachers,

manufacturers, and spinners and flour-miUers, and Б.5 to corn-millers and

flax-scntch millers.

   The fall from the outlet at Lough Island Eeavy to the tail-race of the last
mill at Moyallen is 3.50 feet ; of this, 180 feet 2 inches arc occupied by mills,
and can be rated. Of this 180 feet 2 inches, 7 feet 3 inches are occupied by
the Linen Hill mill, about one and a quarter mile above the intake to the
Corbet reservoir, and G feet 4 inches by the Ardbrin Mill on Ervin's Weir at
the intake. The remaining fall of IGO feet 7 inches is below the outlet from
tke Corbet reservoir, and is divided over a distance of eleven and a Iialf miles

of the course of the Bann, passing the towns of Banbridge and Gilford, and
ending at Moyallen, below which the river is joined by the Newiy canal and
--144 REPORT 1874,

the Cusher river. Of tbis 166 feet 7 inches, 155 feet 4 inches are rated at

JIO per annum per foot fall, and 11 feet 3 inches at Бo. Linen Hill and

Ardbrin falls are also rated at Б5, and make the total income Б1675 8s. 4(/,

but Б224 lis. 8d. must be deducted from this for four falls unoccupied at

present, leaving a net sum of Б1450 16s. 8d. For so far the undertaking has
not paid the shareholders well, as the expenses connected with the Muddock

river sometimes absorbed the entire dividend ; latterly, however, the dividend

has amounted to above 3 per cent. ; and if the present litigation was favour-

ably settled and the falls more fully occupied, a fair return may be expected.

The recent material advance in the price of fuel and the expected opening of

the Banbridge Extension Railway should contribute to this end.

Lough Island Reavy reservoir has now been worked for thirty-four years,

and has weU borne out Sir WUliam Fairbairn's anticipations of its utility in

impounding water and giving out a supply to the mills. In his calculations,

as no extended rainfall observations had been made in that district, he

assumed the rainfall as 36 inches, which was the average for the whole of

Ireland. He deducted one sixth of the rainfall for absorption and evapora-

tion, and concluded there would be sufficient left to fill the reservoir once

and a quarter, on the average, in the year. I have, however, maintained

a rain-gauge at Lough Island Reavy since May 1861, and find the average

faU at a level of 6 feet above the top water of the reservoir is 46 inches.

That amount over the five square miles drainage-area of the lake yields

535,000,000 cubic feet, and the capacity of the reservoir filled to 38 feet

A6 inches above the outlet is 270,000,000 cubic feet.  rainfall of 23 inches,

if there were no loss, would fill the reservoir ; but it requires about 30 inches

to do so from the beginning of October till that of April (the season it is

generally filled), and the evaporation during the otlier six summer months is

Weabout four times as much.  may therefore assume the loss to be about

one third the whole rainfall, leaving sufficient to fill the reservoir one and

one third times. The rainfall must bo greater on the high ground than at

the gauge, so that only oue half the whole rainfall is probably available.

The Butter Mountain, from which most of the drainage is derived, is peaty,

which will account in some measure for the largo amount of absorption on

such steep ground. It is also to be remembered that the evaporation from

the surface of the reservoir is very great. At the intake of the Corbet reser-

voir, where the drainage from eighty square miles of mixed flat and moun-

tainous country passes down the river Bann, I found, on comparing the

quantity passed over Ervin's Weir with the average rainfall for the year

1872, the former to be only one fifth the latter, equal to a loss of four fifths

the rainfall by evaporation and absorption. This calculation can only be

taken as an approximation, since Ervin's Weir is not constructed for accurate

gauging, and I was obliged to deduct 20 per cent, from the calculated dis-

charges as a rough estimate of the loss from the absence of a level ridge

board and the broad and irregular surface of the weir ; besides, to obtain an

accurate idea of the amount of rainfall, returns should be obtained from a

number of gauges well placed over the varying surface of the country. This

inquiry as to the relative amount of rainfall and absorption in various

districts of country is very interesting, and more information on the subject

is desirable.

  A register of the daily height of the water in Lough Island Reavy has been

kept since 1847 by the caretaker. It shows that this reservoir has been of
great service to the mill-owners on the Upper Bann, as during twenty-six

years an average supplementary supply of about two fifths of the standard
       ON THE INDUSTRIAL USES OF THE UPPER BANN RIVER.  145

summer discharge allowed over Ervin's Weir, or about 30 cubic feet per

second (equal to two and a half horse-power to the foot fall at Sir William

Fairbairn's estimate of 12 feet in its best application to a water-wheel equal

to one horse-power), has been granted for 2663 days, or, on an average,
102 days yearly ; and the reservoir has only been empty 303 days, or, on an
average, eleven and a half days yearly. The Corbet reservoir has been of

much more service than its capacity would lead one to expect, as it may be

filled and emptied four or five times in each year by small floods in the river,

and all the Sunday's water can be sent into it and let down to the mills on

Monday and Tuesday. It is generally exhausted before the upper reservoir

is called upon, and keeps up a supply when there is a scarcity in frosty wea-

ther in winter ; and when a flood comes at the end of these short terms of
scarcity it is ready to receive it, and thus diminish the amount of back water

on the wheels. If its area were five or six times as great, it would be almost

that much more valuable, as so many floods pass when it is full ; for its

drainage-area is about sixteen times that of Lough Island Reavy. According
to the original plan, the embankment should have been raised so as to impound

the water to a depth of 18 feet instead of 11 feet 3 inches, and contain

46,783,440 cubic feet instead of 28,177,221 cubic feet; unless, however, the

intake from the river was at a much higher level, say at Linen Hill weir, it

would not be much advantage, for the drainage-area of the lake itself is

very small.

The register of the Corbet reservoir has not been kept so long or as accu-

rately as that of Lough Island Reavy, so it is not possible to show so well the

ser^dce it has done the mills ; from the average of three years, however, and

comparison with the register of Lough Island Reavj'^, I calculate it has given

120,000,000 cubic feet in the year, exactly one half that of Lough Island

Reavy, or a good supply for fifty-one days ; add this to the Lough Island

Reavy supply, and there is a total of 153 days of twenty-four hours each.

Sir William Fairbairn calculated that when all the reservoirs should be made

(including the Deer's Meadow and the fuU completion of the other two reser-

voirs), there would be a supply of 60 feet per second for 108 days of twenty-

four hours each year. Reducing it to 108 days, the supply really has been

44 cubic feet per second, which is very nearly in the same proportion to the

amount that can be impounded as his calculation was to that proposed to be

impounded. As the supply from the reservoirs has only failed, on an average,

eleven and a half days yearly, the standard water-power may be said to have

been almost constantly maintained. This constancy in the supply makes the

Upper Bann most valuable as a power ; indeed it is almost as good as steam-

power, but at a much less cost.

Whilst the average value of water-power in Ireland is about Б2 per horse-

power per annum, on the Bann it may be estimated at .Б4 where only ten

hours' work per diem is available, and Б7 where constant work is maintained
after paying the water tax. Steam-power on the Bann costs about Б0 per

annum per horse-power, calculating 4 pounds of coal equal to one horse-

power per hour. The first cost and maintenance of works necessary to render

these powers available would be greater in the case of steam than water.

More convenient mill sites can, however, be obtained for the application of

steam than water. On the Bann it is found more economical to work steam

and water in conjunction where much power is required, as advantage can be

taken of moderate floods to ease the steam ; this method of working is parti-

cularly applicable] to bleach-works, where the steam, after passing through

the cyhnder of a high-pressure engine, can be used for boiling and heating.

148 REPORT--1874,

   For the utilizatioa of the water-power of the Bann there are thirty-one
mill-falls (besides the two mentioned before, where the weirs have been taken
down) : eight of these are above the confluence of the Muddock, one of them
on the Rocky river and one on the Leitrim river (both important branches
of the Bann) ; the other six are on the Bann itself. As none of these derive
any advantage from the reservoirs, the Deer's Meadow not having been
made, their power is small and variable, and they are nearly aU occupied by
small corn- and scutch-mills. In the preceding Table (pp. 146 & 147) full
particulars are given of the remaining twenty-five falls, which are more
.important, inasmuch as, in addition to the Bann, they command the water
of the Muddock and the reservoirs.

   An inspection of the Table shows that the first four falls are at present

unprofitable to the Heservoir Company, as the rates annually struck on them
 are annually remitted on account of the mills not being worked. There are
several reasons for this : some of these are flax-scutching miUs and have been
burnt ; and as that is a bad biTsjness at present, and steam scutch-miUs can be
kept going by using the waste products of the scutching for fuel, there is no
inducement to put up new mills and pay the reservoir rate. Although the
rate is the same as below the Corbet reservoir, these falls are deprived of the
 advantages of that reservoir ; and the busiest season for both scutch- and
corn-mills is subsequent to the time the greatest use is made of Lough Island
Eeavy. They are at a distance from large and important towns, surrounded
by a poor part of the country, much of which is mountainous.

    The Banbridge Extension Railway is almost finished as far as Ballyroney
MiU, and runs close to the river all the way from Banbridge ; when it is
opened a great stimulus wiU be given to the trade of that part of the country,
 and, it is expected, capital drawn to it for the establishment of mills engaged
in permanent manufactures, such as have clustered themselves around Ban-

bridge. An improvement may therefore be looked for; and manufacturers,

 as they become alive to the fact that steam, although a very convenient, is a
 most expensive power, will gladly avail themselves of such a cheap and con-
 stant water-power as the Upper Bann offers.

   A consideration of what has been ah-eady done on the Upper Bann shows

 that had the Act of Parliament been such as, after forty years' experience, is

 now adopted for such works, and power over the various watercourses secured,
 much litigation would have been prevented, and the Bann Reservoir Company
 much more prosperous ; also, that many of the falls could be nearly doubled

 in value by unproved water-wheels.
    I hope this brief description of what has been already done on the Upper

 Bann may induce other districts, profiting by this experience, to econf)mize

 the vast amount of water-power that runs to waste in all parts of Ireland.
 Were such the case, it would go far to make up for the want of coal in that
 country, and much promote its industrial prosperity.

    The Upper Bann wa^ formerly celebrated for its trout-fishing, which has
 been much injured of late years by the discharge of flax steep-water into the
 river, instead of lifting the flax out of the water when the water is low. It
 is said if some improvements were made in the weirs, salmon would come up
 the river. Eels can be taken during floods, but are not much sought after.
 Pearls have been found in rare instances in the river. The water is exceed-
 ingly soft (about 5░, Clark's test), and pecuharly well adapted for bleaching,
 which is extensively carried on at the various establishments along the river.
            ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LABYRINTHODONTS.                149

Report of the Committee, consisting of Professor Huxley, LL.D.,

   F.R.S., Professor Harkness, F.R.S., Henry Woodward, F.R.S.,
   James Thomson, John Brigg, and L. C. Miall, on the Structure
   and Classification of the Labyrinthodonts . Drawn up by L. C.

   Miall, Secretary to the Committee.

                (Plates IV.-VII.)

In this, as in the preceding Report, the Committee have included the Permian

and Secondary Labyrinthodonts. Before their work had made much pro-

gress it was perceived that the Carboniferous species cannot be satisfactorily

studied alone.

The present Report treats of all the well-investigated species hitherto

recorded, and the Committee have not, therefore, recommended their own
reappointment. In laying down their commission, they desire to thank the
many friends who have assisted their labours. Professor Cope, Messrs.

Embleton and Atthey, Mr. T. P. Barkas, and the Natural-History Society of

Northumberland and Durham have forwarded publications on Labj-rintho-

donts ; the authorities of the Warwick and Bristol Museums, Mr. John Ward

of Longton, Mr. James Thorhson of Glasgow, Mr. George Maw of Broseley,
Mr. T. P. Barkas of Newcastle, and Mr. William Home of Leyburn, Wens-

leydale, have sent specimens for examination ; while Professor Cope and Mr.
Thomson have sent photographs from fossils in their possession. Every

facility for examination of Labyrinthodont remains has been afforded by
the officers of the various public museums visited ; and two members of
the Committee have had the advantage of inspecting a large part of the

valuable collection belonging to Mr. Thomas Atthey, of Gosfort-h, near New-

castle.

It does not appear necessary to prefix to the arrangement of the Laby-

rinthodonts here proposed any discussion of the opinions of previous writers

on this subject. In no classification that has yet appeared have ev^ one

Wefourth of the genera here recorded been noticed at all.  are sensible of

the great imperfection of the materials at our command, and can only regard

the present arrangement as a sketch to be fiUed in and corrected hereafter.

   Numerous fragments have occurred in the Keuper Sandstone of Warwick, which
indicate a species of 3Iastodonsaurus considerably smaller than M. c/iganteus. The

mandibular teeth are less conical than in the last-mentioned species ; they preserve

much of their thickness to near the apex, when they taper rapidly. Though some

parts of the fossils attributed to this species throw light upon the sti'ucture of the

Labyrinthodont skull, their zoological value is hitherto small, and the species can-

not be regarded as thoroughly established.

Differs from M. (jigantetis in its mucli smaller size, in the proportions and posi-

tion of the palatine foramina, which are relatively larger and wider, as well as more

posterior, and in the elongated choana. Von Meyer is disposed to refer it to Tre-

matosaurus but the great breadth of the fore part of the palatine foramen, and the
                                                     ;

numerous inner series of vomerine teeth, disposed as in Mastodonsaurus, oppose this

determination. The resemblance to Labyrinthodon (and in some points to Capito-

Asaurus) is considerable.  cast only of part of the palate is known.

   The mandible upon which the above genus is founded presents the following

--peculiarities : The external surface is strongly sculptured, and has mucous canals

similar to those of Mastodonsaurus. " The outer wall of the ramus swells out, sud-
denly, just behind the level of the articular cavity, and the upper edge of the supra-
angiilar process is, as it were, bent in by the development of this projection." The

outer sm-face of the postarticular process is clearly more convex than usual, but we

fail to detect in the text or woodcut of Prof. Huxley's memoir any really important
difference between this part of the jaw of Pacliygonia and the same part in Masto-
donsaurus.''^ The spleuial plate (of the articular bone) " exhibits minute, roimd,
crater-like elevations." Teeth transversely oval at the base, conical above, small,
regular ; 15 or 16 only, in the back part of the ramus, are known.

Elliptical in section at the base, conical above, slightly recm-ved, striate ; internal

structure similar to that oi Mastodonsaurus. Mandibular articulation. The articular

sm'face is produced inwards beyond the plane of the ramus, but the natiu-e of the

supporting mass is not known; a well- developed postarticidar process. Cranial

sculpture. The centre of each ossification is strongly pitted, and the margin radiately

sculptm-ed. Thoracic plates. The median plate resembles a Latin cross, with the

entering and salient angles rounded ; the short (posterior) arm is radiately sculptiu-ed

on the exposed sm-face ; the rest of the plate is nearly smooth ; the lateral plate

has a thickened and reflected external margin, a short, notched posterior side, and

a tapering anterior extremity. The scidpture is not Imown, but doubtless radiated

from the thickened postero-external angle.

This second species differs from T. Braunii in the somewhat broader form of the

skull, in the blunt anterior end of the palatine foramen, and in the backward posi-

tion of the orbit, which, instead of lying anterior to the centre of the palatine

foramen, falls in its posterior half. The orbits are not, however, so far back as in

Capitosaurus. The differences between the two species are not due to difference of

age                     for  T.  ocella  is the  smaller,  and yet  its  distinctive  pecrdiarities  are    such
                     ;

as increasing age would not diminish but exaggerate.

ternal articular buttress. Teeth. Much compressed, antero-po.'<teriorly, at the base,

so that in section they present the form of a rectangle, with the long sides perpen-

dicular to the axis of the jaw; above, the teeth gradually become conical; the

external surface exhibits numerous strife, but no conspicuous ridges ; the dentine

is much folded, but there are many intricacies of arrangement which no folding,

however complicated, can explain ; no pulp-cavity is visible, but the upper part of

the tooth has not yet been microscopically examined. Cranial sculpture. Similar

to that of Mastodonsaurus, but less sharply defined.

Skull (figure). Triangular, with rounded anterior end, back part not known ; the

upper surface is flat, with a median ridge in the anterior part. Palatine foratnina.

The separate existence of these foramina is doubtful. (Jlioance. Circular, distant.

Teeth (disposition). The premaxillary and maxillary teeth form a somewhat in-e-

gular series, the teeth being very unequal in size and relatively few in number

there is an internal row of vomerine and palatine teeth, including large tusks in

front, and diminishing in size somewhat irregularly behind ; mandibular teeth un-

equal. Teeth (structure). Conical, pointed, laterally compressed and recurved

towards the apex, somewhat angular at the base. " Transparent transverse sections

of the teeth exhibit a singularly beautiful and complex structure. The relatively

small pulp-cavity sends oft" primary radiating prolongations, which pass straight to

the circumference of the tooth, and at a small distance from it terminate by dividing

usually into two short branches, each of which gives off" from its extremity a wedge-

shaped pencil of coarse dentinal tubuli. These spread out from one another, and

terminate in a structiu'eless or granular layer, which forms the peripheral portion of

the dentine, and, from the small irregular cavities scattered here and there through

its substance, reminds one of the ' globular dentine ' of the human tooth. An

extension of this peripheral layer is continued towards the centre of the tooth,

between every pair of primary prolongations of the pulp-cavity. The short

secondary processes which are sent out from opposite sides of the primary prolonga-

tions of the pulp-cavity give oft" in the same way, fi-om their ends, pencils of con-

spicuous dentinal tubuli, the ends- of which terminate in the inward extensions of

the peripheral layer. The secondary processes of adjacent primary prolongations

alternate and, as it were, interlock with one another, so that the inward extension

Aof the peripheral layer takes a sinuous course between them.  thin layer of dense

and glassy enamel invests the tooth continuously, but sends no processes into its

interior ; and, of course, under these circumstances there can be no cement in the

interior of the tooth, nor can its sm-face be said to be plaited or folded. It will be

imderstood that this description gives merely the principle of arrangement of the

parts of the tooth ; its details could only be made intelligible by elaborate figures"*.

articular process and an internal buttress are present. Vertebra and ribs. There is

Skull (figure). An elongated isosceles triangle, with large rounded postero-lateral

expansions and short epiotic cornua ; coronal tract elevated, bounded on each side
by temporal depressions ; auditory openings indenting considerably the upper
siu'face. Orbits. Very large, irregular-oval, with cusps proceeding from the

posterior part of both inner and outer margins ; narrowed in front ; slightly
oblique, the long axes diverging forwards ; edges raised ; interorbital space less than
the transverse diameter of the orbit. External nasal foramina. Oval, lateral,

distant*. Choana. Marginal, distant, small, slightly posterior to the external nasal

foramina. Teeth (disposition). Premaxillary, three or four on each side, larger than

maxillary ; maxillary numerous, subequal palato-vomerine, large tusks before and

cal, striate, with opposite (anterior and posterior) cutting-edges ; a thin layer of

enamel invests the crown of the tooth, and descends low down upon the sides ; the

dentine forms a thick and compact internal lining to the cap of enamel in the upper

half of the tooth, occupying nearly all the space, and reducing the pulp-cavity to a

small fiattened cjdinder in the centre of the tooth ; in the lower half of the tooth
the pulp-cavity expands and the parietes become somewhat thinner ; at the same

point the dentine separates into numerous vertical lamellas, or folds, and a peripheral

layer of dentine appears                                                                                           towards  the  base of  the  tooth  the  imlp-cavity is  large,

occupying about one third of the diameter ; the dentinal lamelue are numerous,

irregular, rarely branched, and radiately disposed around the pulp-cavity ; the peri-

pheral layer of dentine occupies the outside of the tooth, and takes a sinuous coiu-se

along the centre of each lamella ; when seen in cross section, each tiun of the

sinuous lamella of peripheral dentine appears to be strengthened by a short out-

standing process, so that the lamella itself appears to be angulated dentinal tubules

comb pitting covers the chief part of the skull : there is a lyra consisting of two

grooves which occupy the summits of slightly elevated ridges in the preorbital

tract ; the grooves begin in the interorbital space, and pass forwards, diverging

regularly, to the maxillo-premaxillary sutiu-e ; they are connected in front by a

transverse groove : short maxillary grooves ; no malar grooves. Thoracic plates
have been described as those of Loxomma, but without satisfactory identification.

Vertebra;. Centi-a well ossified, biconcave ; spinous processes broad and lofty.
Ribs. Long, slightly cm-ved, strong.

* In the restoration of the skull of Loxomma given in last year's Report (t. i.) the ex-

ternal nai-es are incorrectly placed. They are shown by Mr. Atthey's fine specimen,

figured in the paper referred to below, to be external to the mucous grooves upon the pre-

maxilla. The same paper will enable us to rectify and complete the delineation of the

Wesutures upon the upper surface of the skull in this genus.                                                                                          cannot accept Messrs. Em-

bleton and Atthey's interijretation of the palate of Loxomma, which is foimded upon an

analogy with Crocodilia which we believe to be mistaken. The " palate-plates of the

maxiUaries " are true palatals, and no ectopterygoid exists in the Labyrinthodont skidl.

The apertures named by them " posterior nares " are probably vascular canals, and we

regard the foramina marked " Ap " in t. v. as the true ehoantc.

   SJmU (figiu-e). Triangular, with concave sides and obtuse snout ; occipital border
concave ; skull lofty in the occipital region, falling away gradually in front and

rapidly on the sides.
   Eichwald remarks that " the skull is distinguished by large temporal grooves,

similar to those of the Crocodilian Sauria, which serve for the reception and attach-
ment of the temporal muscles. These are observed in the Labyrinthodonts also,
but especially in the Enaliosauria, as in Nothosaurus and Sitnosaurus. Thus
Zygosaurus in this respect connects the Labyrinthodonts with the Enaliosam-ia and

Grocodilia"*.
   It does not, however, appear that Zygosaunis is fairly comparable as to the tem-

poral region of the skull with Grocodilia. It has doubtless wide postorbital depres-

sions, which probably served for muscular attachment ; and these depressions may
have been destitute of sculptiu-e, though in the only skull known the original sur-
face of this and other parts has been removed by fracture. The sutures are effaced,

and it is therefore impossible to say positively whether the supratemporal and post-
orbital ossifications, which best distinguish the upper siu-face of the Labyrinthodont
from that of the Crocodilian skull, were present in Zygosaunis or not. Probably

they were, and the temporal depressions of Zygosaurus would in this case much

resemble those of Lo.vonuna. There is only a distant similarity between the shallow
postorbital grooves of Zygosaunis and the vacuities circumscribed by bone which

occupy a large part of the temporal region in Nothosaurus and Simosaurus. Eich-

wald's remarks may refer to the depressions in the occipital tract of the skull,
though nothing quite similar is foimd in recent Grocodilia. The state of the speci-

Teeth (mandible of U. reticulatu^). Small, slightly curved, the apices apparently

abruptly pointed. Cranial sculpture. In U. reticulatus the surface of the cranial
bones exhibits " a coarse reticulated structure of elevated ridges or lines, which, fi-om
the elongation of the meshes in some of the bones, have the ajjpearance of strong,

&raised, parallel striae" (Plancock Atthey). Thoracic plates. Covered (in U. reti-

culatus) with " a minute reticulation of raised lines, which assume a radial disposi-

tion, as if from centres of growth" (Hancoclv & Atthey). Vertebrce. Probably

20 precaudal vertebrae, " with long and low, plate-like, neural spines, the faces of
which are striated, and the edges sen-ated, as in Keraterpeton''^ (Huxley) ; about 75
caudal vertebrae, their nem-al spines fan-like, narrow beneath, expanded and trun-

cated above, with distinct lateral striae and serrated superior edges ; chevron-bones
similar to the caudal neural spines, but broader and shorter; " up to and including

the thirty-sixth vertebra, the axes of the nem-al spines and subvertebral bones coin-

cide, or are parallel, both being vertical to the long axes of the vertebrae ; but in the
succeeding vertebrae the axes of both incline backwai'ds, and meet at a very obtuse

angle ; up to the forty-second vertebra the spines and subvertebral bones, though

gradually diminishing in antero-posterior extent, retain their strong grooves and
striatious and their frayed or notched edges ; but fiirther backward they first taper
towards their ends, and finally assume the characters of ordinary spinous processes "
(HiLxley). и Ribs. " Traces of numerous, short, curved, and stout ribs are visible in
the confused mass which occupies the dorsal region of the trunk " ( Huxley). Scutes,

A ventral shield composed of numerous oat-shaped scales, "2 inch long specimens

of the hind limb " (Huxley).

cula and capitula ; the anterior ribs .are rather larger than the posterior ones, and

are equal to about three of the vertebrae in length ; their ventral ends are rounded,
and no traces of sternal ribs are anywhere visible ; the ribs behind the posterior

limbs (in their present position) are shorter than the others." Fore limb. Radius

and ulna similar ; carpus unossitied ; five digits, the greatest number of phalanges

   Skull. In all the examples hitherto discovered the skiill was in an imsatisfactory
state of preservation. Prof. Huxley remarks concerning one of these that " the roof

of the skull is broad, and has an obtuse and rounded anterior end ; the ramus of the
mandible is strong, and has a curved lower contom*, its ai-ticular end being especially

curved up." Vertehrce. The number may have amounted to one hundred or more

centra elongate, contracted in the middle; spinous processes low, shorter antero-

posteriorly than the centra. Ribs. Long, nearly straight. Limbs. Probably want-

ing ; no trace of fore or hind limb has occm-red in any one of several specimens

patch of " palatal " (vomerine ?) teeth is sliowu in the centre of the palate and far forward.

   I " All the long bones, even the ribs, are hollow ; and the cavity is enclosed by a com-
pact wall of ahuost uniform thinness throughout each bone, indicative that such cavity was
not properly a meduUary one, in the sense of having been excavated by absorption after
complete consolidation of the bone by the ossifying process, but was posthumous, and due
to the solution of the primitive cartilaginous mould of the bone, which liad remained un-

changed by ossification in the living species. I conclude, therefore, that these hollow long
bones (and, indeed, the bodies of the vertebras seem only to have received a partial and
superficial crust of bone) were originally solid, and composed, like the bones in most
Batrachia, especially the Perennibranchiates, of an exteamal osseous crust, enclosing soUd
cartilage."-- Owen, Q. J. Geol. Soc. vol. xviii. p. 238 [1862].

Those on the maxillary and lower jaw are stout and short, placed in a close and
even series on the inner side of a ridge or plate of bone. Viewed from the side
they are of a spatulate form, and present a somewhat broad edge at top .... Viewed

in the opposite direction they are seen to be rery thick in a dhectiou transverse to
that of the jaw, and are wedge-shaped. There are about forty on each side of the

                                       APPENDIX.

    In this appendix are recorded various published genera, which are either
founded upon very imperfect examples or are insufficiently described by the

authors for the purposes of a classification. Hence some are not known to

be Labyrinthodonts at all ; others, while doubtless belonging to the order,
cannot be satisfactorily placed ; and a third class are of doubtful distinctness

from previously published genera. The genus Ichthyerpeton might fairly
have been placed in the appendix, for we know very little about it. The
reader will regard its insertion in a provisional group (p. 166) as a mere

suggestion, which may be adopted or discarded when more perfect specimens

have been brought to light.

   Some of the American descriptions have the air of rapid determinations
published to save priority. In the absence of figures, and without an oppor-
tunity of examining specimens, we have often been unable to recognize any
characters of systematic value in these genera and species. "When Prof.
Cope's detailed account of the Carboniferous Amphibia of Ohio shall appear*,
we hope that these difficulties mil be removed, and that the important Laby-

rinthodont fauna of the United States will then render its full service to

palaeontology.

                                   Amphibamus, Cope,

Skull broad. Orbits large, rounded. Preemaxilles each with 11 or 12 teeth.

"The integument of the head was squamous              The dentition is pleurodont;

the teeth are only visible on the mandible and the outer edge of the upper jaw

they are there of but one kind, small, closely set, acute-conic, not compressed,

hollow, and without any inflections of the enamel " f-

The dorsal vertebrae were originally described as opisthoccelianj, without traces

of ribs or transverse processes. " The impression of a sacral vertebra is distinctly

preserved." Centra of caudal vertebrae probably unossified ; of the neural spinous

processes of the caudal vertebrae " twelve very distinct impressions may be counted

to the sacral region ; the posterior are most slender, the median most elevated, the

anterior lower and of greater longitudinal extent." Inferior arches were probably

present in the caudal region.

'' The anterior limbs were short and weak." Humerus slender, not much dilated,

without condyles. Ulna and radius separate and slender. " The femiu- is slender,

much dilated distally, slightly curved in the posterior direction, and without con-

dyles        The tibia and fibula are one half the length of the femur, are slender,

most dilated proximally        The tarsus was probably cartilaginous  The num-

ber of phalanges is 3, 3, 4, 5, 4  The terminal phalanges are elongate acute."

A" few traces indicate that the dermal integument was covered, on the anterior

part of the body at least, with small and subangular scales, There have been ab-

dominal scales arranged in narrow imbricate series, directed inward and posteriorly.

Traces of plates are wanting, excepting a small fragment lying beside the cervical

vertebrae."

Professor Cope believes that the iris and pigmentum nigi-um of the eye are pre-

Aserved in the fossil.   median lenticular vacuity is " obviously the vertical pupil

of a nocturnal animal    These appearances cannot be explained on any suppo-

sition of artificial production."

   " This animal combines with its Batrachian, a few Lacertilian characters, having

some resemblance to Dawson's genus Hylonomus, and much aflinity with Prof.

;

X This was afterwards found to be erroneous. " There were actually, however, only
osseous neural arches present ; and I am now decidedly of the opinion that the vertebral

--cwitra were either cartilaginous or annuliform, as in Archegosaurus," Cope, Synopsis,

p. 8.

Wyman's Raniceps Lyellii. Its squamous integument and narrow nasal roof give

it the somewhat Lacertilian physiognomy, more especially Geccotian, in its hroad

cranium and orbits, its large marginal palpebral scales, and rather short digits. Its

true affinities are indicated by the presence of two premaxillaries, with a squamoso-

postorbital arch, as in Labyrinthodontia, some Batrachia Gradientia, and Crocodilia

its quadrato-jugal arch as in Labyrinthodontia and Batrachia Salientia ; its poste-

riorly directed oblique quadratum and lack of ribs, as in Batrachia Salientia ; its

probably short pelvis, short separate bones of the leg and forearm ; its opistho-

ccelian dorsal vertebrae, and long caudal neural spines, as in Batrachia Gradientia.

It is, then, the type of a group intermediate between the Labyrinthodontian and

Gradient Batrachians, distinguished from the former by the opisthocoelian vertebrae,

absence of ribs, and pleurodont dentition ; and from the lattei'by the scaly integu-
ment, absence of ribs, and structure of the nasal and prefronial regions. But one

genus of Salamanders, Glossolega, has a similar os quadrato-j:igale, and but a part

of one family, the Salamandridae, the postfronto-squamosal or posterior zygomatic

Aarch.  ribless type might, however, well exist among Gradientia, when we con-

sider the great difference between their development in Pleurodeles on the one hand

and Amphiuma on the other. From the Salientia the dentigerous mandible, squa-

mosal arch, form of vertebrae, sacrum and extremities, &c. widely distinguish it.
To the Batrachian orders Labyrinthodontia, Gradientia, Gymnophidia, and Salientia,

************the present may be added, under the name Xenorachia.
   " If we compare the peculiarities of this genus with those of the Batrachia of the
same period, we find it to be distinguished, independently of the ordinal characters,

from such genera as Osteophorus, Melosauncs, Sclerocephalus, Xestorrhytias, Baphetes,
and Brachyops, by the absence of the sculpturing of the cranial bones, the lack of
dermal shields, characteristic of most of these, and by the presence of cranial and

palpebral scales. The crania of the first genera are much more elongate, and imitate
those of some Crocodilia. Similar differences exist between the Illinois Batrachian
and Dendrerpetoii (Owen) ; the latter possesses also a double row of teeth. Hylo-
nomus (Dawson), supposed to possess Lacertilian affinities, exhibits ribs and bicon-
cave vertebrae. The ribs of Telerpeton will distinguish it also. The only genus as
yet known to approach closely that under consideration has been described by Prof.
J.Wym<in under the name oi Raniceps. This animal is only known from a study of

the inferior aspect of a portion of the skeleton ; nevertheless it is certainly different,
being nearly double the size, and having relatively longer and stronger anterior

limbs. The angles of the mandible appear to have been considerably more incurved
than in the. Illinois species. They may have belonged to the same genus ; in that
case the name here given will not prove superfluous, as the older appellation was

previously applied to a genus of Gadid Fishes."

   The fossil upon which this genus is founded is of considerable historical interest.
Upon it was based the first distinct assertion that the Carboniferous formation

yielded vertebrate remains of higher rank than those of fishes. Unfortunately the

only example known is somewhat obscure. It may prove to be identical with Ar-
chegosaurus ; if distinct, its generic characters are not yet apparent. Von Meyer

considered it distinct, and remarked its minute size, the absence of thoracic plates
and ribs, as well as certain diflerences of proportion between it and Archef/osauiits*.

The imperfect state of preservation deprives these considerations of much of their

weight.

by the maxillary bone, for an extent of 4a inches beyond the premaxillaries; and
this border shows still more distinct traces of alveoli, of a circular form, about a
line in diameter, and rather closely set in a single series. The fore part of the orbit
is very unequivocally displayed, the smooth under or inner surface of the bone
forming that part being entire ; and this shows the fore part of the orbit to be

formed, partly by the maxillary, partly by a lachrymal or prefrontal bone in close

--sutural union therewith, a structure which does not exist, to my knowledge, in any

recent or fossil fish with a dentigerous superior maxillary bone. Where the sub-

stance of the bone has been detached so far as to expose the exterior layer in con-

tact with the coal, as, e.g., on the frontal and part of the prefrontal bones, the ex-
terior surface of those bones is shown to have been impressed by subhemispheric

or elliptical pits, from 1 line to I5 line in diameter, and with intervals of half that

extent : and this coarsely pitted character agrees with that presented by the outer

surface of the similarly broad and flat crania of the Labyrinthodont Batrachia, e. g.

Tromitosm/rKS, Cupitosaurus, and Labyrinthodon proper  The traces of the

nostrils are less definite and satisfactory than the remains of the orbits ; but the

latter appear to me to be decisive against the piscine nature of the fossil." Owen.
   The teeth are conical and slightly curved, grooved below, and smooth towards

the tip. The peripheral dentine gives off simple, slightly undulating processes

towards the centre. Pulp-cavity rather large. If, as is probable, the section here

described was made in the upper part of the tooth, the structure has not a little

resemblance to that of Labyrinthodon leptoynathus.

pended. The few characters fui-nished seem to associate Chalcosaurus with the

   " The skull is of nearly equal length and breadth, which amount to 160 millims.,
not quite half a Paris foot. The hinder part appears to be injured ; the obtusely para-
bolic anterior end is well preserved. The regularly oval orbits are situated in the
middle of the anterior half of the skull. They appear to measure 29 millims. in
length and 20 millims. in breadth, and are hardly more than their own length
distant from each other. The margin of the [lower] jaw is set with a single row
of small teeth. Indications of siitures are present, which do not, however, suffice

to determine the composition of the skuU."

          ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LABYRINTHODONTS.           185

   The age of the deposit from which Chalcosaurus was derived is still somewhat
doubtful. Murchisou I'efers it to the Permian formation. Eiehwald, Ludwig, and
Geinitz dissent from this view, and regard it as either Triassic or as intermediate
between the Palaeozoic and Neozoic epochs. Summaries of the evidence will be
found in Naumann's ' Geognosie,' 2nd ed. p. 658, and in Von Meyer's ' Palaeonto-

graphica,' vol. xv. p. 98.

   " Vertebra and ribs osseous ; anterior limbs, thoracic shields, and abdominal arma-
ture apparently wanting. Teeth on the premaxillary bone, none on the maxillary.

Hyoid elements largely developed. An axial hyal with basihyal on each side,

closely united with the corresponding ceratohyal, at the end of which is an element
in the position of a stylohyal. Haemal or basal branchihyals three, the anterior
two each supporting one pleural branchihyal, and the third supporting one also.

proaching the median line, and with elongate pleural element. Urohyal not seen."

tured pectoral bones are present  The abdominal region is protected by a series of

scales which extend obliquely foi-wards to the medial line, where they meet, forming

chevrons         Most of the teeth are coarsely incised sulcate for perhaps their basal

half . . . .The aiBnities are thus obviously to Apateon, and it is not beyond possi-

bility that future investigations may prove it is the same."

The posterior pait of the upper surface of the skull is known. Dr. Leidy remarks

that in the arrangement of the cranial plates Dictyocephalus bears considerable
Aresemblance to Trematosaurus.
                                  radiate sculpture is conspicuous. The parietal

foramen is situate in the centre of the parietal suture. " The occipital outline of
the skull is much less sinuous than in Archegosavrus and Trematosaurtis, there being

only a moderate transverse concavity on each side between the mastoid and

tvmpanic lines, instead of a deep notch." The occipital condyles are figured as

close together.

"Breadth of the specimen in its present condition, '2^ in. Breadth of occiput

outline, about 2j in. Length of occipitals, 4^ lines ; breadth, 3f lines. Length of
parietals, 8i lines ; breadth anteriorly, 3| lines posteriorly, 3 lines."

   The teeth figured and described as possibly those of Dictyocephahis appear to be

Deinosaurian. The rib and "bone of the forearm" have no Labyrinthodont cha-

racters. The skull is doubtless that of a true Labyrinthodont, though we are unable

to assign it a definite place in the order.

   The upper surface only of the skull is known from an imperfect natural cast. " The
total length of the slcuU amounts to 207 millims., the breadth to 274 millims. The
length, as far as the hinder margin of the parietal tract, measures little more than
the breadth. The orbits lie in the posterior half of the skull, nearer the middle

than the hinder end ; they are nearly circular, and not noticeably oblique in posi-
tion ; their transverse diameter is to the longitudinal dimension as 2 to 3. The
external nasal foramina are more distant from the anterior end of the skull than
from the external margin ; they are somewhat less distant from each other than
the orbits, while the distance between the nasal foramina and the orbits is about

two fifths of the length of the skull. The nasal foramiaa are set obliquely, and
their length amounts to more than twice the breadth ; they lie for the most part
in the praemaxilla, and only behind are they bounded externally by the maxilla, in-
tarn illy by the nasal bone. The lachrymal is excluded from the nasal foramina as
well as from the orbits." The interorbital space is equal to once and a half
the transverse diameter of the orbit. The most distinctive feature which appears
in Von Meyer's description of the cranial bones is the presence of an azygous inter-
nasal bone. This is a narrow slip, somewhat shorter than the frontal, which lies

in its anterior half between the nasals, and in its posterior half between the frontals.

Von Me3'er proposes for this bone the name of " Zwischennaaenstirnbein " (inter-

naso-frontale or naso-froiitale). Duges has pointed out, in the skull of Coecilia, a
similarly placed bone, which he calls the ethmoid*. It is the "single frontal " of
Cuvier. The " facial fontanelle " of Z)ns?/ce/)s occupies precisely the same position.
The parietal foramen is situated a little behind the middle point of the parietal
suture. Von Meyer remarks that if the occipital border is perfectly preserved, it
must have been remarkably concave. Tlie cranial sculpture consists of deep pits
and furrows upon each bone ; no evidence of mucous grooves appears. Obscure

indications of an affinity with Loxomma, Melosaunis, and Zi/r/osaurus may be
traced in the skull of Osteophorus but we are not yet able to place it satisfactorily.

                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

Of its Labyrinthodont character and its generic distinctness we have no doubt.

   " The maxillary appears to extend posteriorly to a free termination, as in modern

Salamanders, and the supratemporal bone presents a very prominent, obtuse, arched
margin. This margin extends from the orbits on each side, and is inclined towards
the posterior part of the cranium. There is therefore no quadrato-jugal piece."
The median reo^ion of the mandible " exhibits a succession of shallow transverse
notches, enclosing thirteen obtuse elevations." " The orbits are remarkably small,
and situated probably near the middle of the longitudinal measurement of the
cranium."

genus of Acanthopterygii.
   This fossil is doubtless amphibian, but it does not exhibit indisputable Labyrin-

thodont characters. " The general form of the head resembles that of frogs ; it is
triangular, and its greatest breadth nearly equals its length." The quadrate extends
backwards beyond the occiput. Prsemaxillse with " small single-pointed teeth."

" The palatine bones could not be traced. The atlas is in close apposition with the

occiput, so that the articulating surfaces are not visible. The expansion of the

atlas indicates, however, that two condyles probably exist. No portions of the

hyoid bone or of branchial arches were recognized. The vertebrae are very imper-

fectly preserved, and are remarkably small in proportion to the size of the animal;

and though several of them are destroyed, it is estimated that about twenty existed

between the occiput and the pelvis. The transverse processes, if any exist, are not

visible ; nor is there e\-idence of ribs  A slightly raised outline appears to be

the only thing to indicate a scapular arch, but there are no details of structure. The

arm is better preserved, the humerus is much contracted in the middle as in Ba-

trachians generally ; the radius and ulna are separate as in Urodels, and not united

as in Anoura. In consequence of the displacement or concealment of some of the

phalanges, the number of fingers could not be ascertained with precision. There

were certainly foiu-, but a fifth is doubtful. It would be of great importance if a

fossil should be detected with five fingers, since no existing Batrachians have more

than four, while many of the supposed Batrachian footprints of the coal-formations

have five. The pelvis was destroyed^ but traces of the right and left femur and of

the right tibia remain."

   The fragment of cranial bones from the posterior pai-t of the skull figured in
' Saurier des Muschelkalkes ' has few distinctive features. The ridges which divide
the pits and furrows are flat and smooth, and the pattern of sculpture is unusually
large. The generic value of the fossil cannot be asserted. It is apparently nearly

allied to Mastodonsaurus.

   with the same, and taking measures for their preservation. Drawn

   up by the Rev. H. W. Crosskey, Secretary.

YoTJR Committee, in fulfilment of the duty entrusted to them, prepared and
distributed a schedule of questions having reference both to isolated erratic
boulders and groups of boulders, defining boulders as masses of rock trans-
ported by natural agency from some locality more or less remote. The sche-
dule was adapted from one issued by the Edinburgh Boulder Committee
(quoted in the last Report); but it was thought desirable to extend its scope
so as to include groups of boulders as well as isolated specimens, and to
place no limit of measurement to the definition.

   As far as possible also the schedule has been made complete, and the ques-

tions asked have been extended to details of considerable scientific importance.

ON THE ERRATIC BLOCKS OF ENGLAND AND WALES.                     195

    The Committee have reason to believe that inquiries are being made on its
behalf in many parts of the country, although the returns at present received

are not sufficiently complete to admit of systematic classification. It is felt,

indeed, that a classified arrangement of the facts can only be attempted when
the investigation approaches its termination. So many speculative theories

are involved in glacial geology, that the greatest service can be rendered by, in
the first instance, collecting the facts from every quarter, afterwards proceeding
to their classification, and finally pointing out the relation of the classified

facts to the various theories under discussion. This is the course which it is
intended to pursue.

   The Committee would respectfully ask Members of the Association who
have received schediiles to return them with the information desired.

   Districts in which boulders are rarest are of especial importance. The
evidence respecting the southward extension of the ice-sheet over England,
or the reach of the waters of the glacial sea, depends largely upon the facts
connected with their presence or absence ; while the method of distribution
of boulders over England and "Wales vnU. furnish the key for the solution of
many problems.

   The necessity for the work of the Committee is increased by the fact that
all over England and Wales the destruction of boulders is rapidly proceeding.
Fields are being cleared for agricultural purposes, while the boulders of many
districts furnish building-material out of which houses and bridges as well as
walls are constructed. It is not too much to say that, in the course of a few
years, some of the most curious and important facts connected with the cha-
racter and distribution of boulders (facts involving the explanation of many
of the phenomena of the glacial epoch) will remain simply matters of record
without any possible verification in the field. The importance of a careful
and thorough carrjdng out of the work of this Committee wiU be evident, how-

ever long and tedious it may prove to be.

   1. The isolated boulder lies in the division of Icornshaw in the town-
ship of Cowling, Sutton, in the parishes of Kildwick and Keighley. See

Ordnance Map (185) Yorkshire.

   2. At least 20 yards round and some 8 yards high above ground,
    3. Angular, but one or two rounded corners.
    4. The boulder nearly square, but very irregular. Its longest axis from

east to west.

    5. There are some marks, but more like what would appear from washings.

The markings are in the softer parts of the stone.
    G. Composed of Millstone-grit, and no rock similar excepting Hantjing

Stone Quarry. This stone is within 2 inches of south left-hand corner of

Ordnance Map (sheet 185). Hanging Stone Quarry is 4 to 5 inches north,

so will be near a mile off.

    7. Popularly known as Hitching Stone on Hitching Stone HiU.
    8. About 1175 feet above the sea.

     11. Perfectly isolated ; but within some few hundred yards there are others,

but of much smaller dimensions.
    12. On heath, and the bottom of stone may be imbedded.

                                                     Lancashire.

   Two large boulders are reported by Mr. Latham, which he describes as "ap-

parently granite," in the lane caUed Birkdale Cop, Scambrick, Lancashire.

One is much larger than the other, and is 2| x 7| x 7 yards, and lies about 2|

miles in a direct line from the coast of the Irish sea, and is only g of a mile from
the Moss, which lies between the sandstones on the coast and the clay land.
The other is in a brick -yard at Snape, Д of a mile more inland, and was found

in the clay.

                                          Midland District.

    In the Midland district the plan suggested by the Geological Section of the
Birmingham Natural-History Society, and described in the last Report, is
being actively carried out. The minuteness of detail attempted will necessarily

render the mapping of the district a work of considerable time. When com-
pleted, a map will exist in which the approximate number of boulders and

the character of the rocks of which they are formed wiU be shown, as well

as the effect of the configuration of the country on their distribution.

     It is necessary to record the general position of the boulders in order to

understand their geological meaning.
    In the Midland district, around Birmingham as a centre, the general po-

--sition of the boulders may be described in the following way : The softness

of the Bunter Sandstone of the district has prevented the preservation of gla-

cial striae to any extent ; but in one part (California near Harbome) they
have been observed upon the native rock. The striated rock is covered by a
thick clay containing boulders in the sense in which they occur in the oldest
Boulder-clay of Scotland, many being striated.

    Upon this old Boulder-clay, covering a glaciated surface, occurs gravel fol-
lowed by a thick clay with many boulders scattered through it, striated spe-
cimens being less common and less clearly marked.

    This is succeeded by sands and gravels, in which boulders of any size are

far less frequent and evidently worn. Over the surface of the groimd many i
boulders are spread, any sand and gravel which may at any time have sur-

rounded them having been washed away. These boulders have possibly been

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

mentioned to show that houlders exist over this district deposited at several

ages.

    (1) Boulders of the earliest ice period.
    (2) Boulders of the period of submergence, in the lower parts of the gla-

cial clays.

    (3) Boulders of the period of the reelevation of the land.

    These varieties have yet to be traced to their various sources ; and upon
this work members of the Committee are engaged. It is as impossible to
assign all boulders to one epoch of distribution as it is to assign aU glacial

    Mr. J. Plant reports both remarkable isolated boulders and groups of
boulders, and records one remarkable fact of especial importance. Below the
drift-clay, and quite distinct from the surface-boulders freely scattered over
the county, a group of boulders has been exposed in an excavation made in
the centre of Leicester, 25 feet deep, composed of rocks which Mr. Plaut
failed to recognize as British. This group, it is suggested, was deposited by
a stranded iceberg. The fact of the existence of groups of boulders belong-
ing to the earliest part of the glacial epoch and of foreign origin, points to
the submergence of the Midland district in. very early glacial times, and is
worthy of detailed investigation.

   Mr. Plant states that he looked over hundreds of the blocks as they lay
piled up on both sides of the roadway, and could not recognize one tenth as

"Forest Rocks." Many were dark hornblendic-looking masses, neither

dolerite or diorite, but fibrous or slaty rather than granular.

    All these patches of boulders (and, in the instance reported, Mr. Plant
registered five hundred blocks) are below the drift-clay, and quite distinct
from the surface-boulders that lie all over the country, either on the surface
or 1 to 3 feet below.

   5. Striations, sometimes only one side, in other cases two sides, and often at
right angles ; rarely seen on the granite or syenite, but on greenstone and slate.
Erratics of black basalt, not Leicestershire, occur at Hoby, towards Melton.

    10. Boulders occur on the surface, but generally seen in excavations of 1

or 2 feet; many have been uncovered in lowering the top of a hill or

widening or straightening the road.

6 to 7 feet long, 3 to 5 feet high, particularly in the Leicester forest district,

Anear Desford. They have been gradually broken up by gunpowder. large

water-colour representation of the Little John's Stone, made at the beginning
of the century, makes it 7 feet high. It is now much reduced. In a recent
uncovering of the granite of Mount Sorel a deposit of drift with boulders and
pebbles has been removed, about 8 feet in depth ; and the rock below shows
clearly that it was subject to the action of waves. It is rounded and worn

precisely as rocks upon modem shores.

    In this district a great change occurs. The drift-beds are reduced almost
 to beds of pebbles ; and local geologists give the name of boulders to speci-
 mens which in other parts would not be regarded as worthy of the name.
 Striations are faint and rare ; the grouping, however, is remarkable. They
 come from all parts of the compass (some possibly from Scandinavia) ; and
 metamorphic and volcanic rocks are numerous. Quartzose pebbles with
 Lower Silurian fossils are abundant; and it is a question of much interest to

 trace their origin.

    The Rev. P. B. Brodie makes the following report of groups of boulders :

                                                                  Ansivers,

     1. Groiips of boulders at Rowington, Hatton, Lapworth, Hazeler, Pack-

 wood, Knowle, Preston, Wroxall, Temple Balsall, Eddsone, Brown's Wood
 near Watton Wawen, Baddcsley.

    2. In Hatton and along line in gravel between Hatton Station and Wilm-
 cote many large angular flints occur, and a few flints and some hard chalk are
 scattered over fields, and in drift generally. One rounded boulder (Rowing-
 ton) measured 1| ft. X 2 ft., and 1 ft. in depth, the average size of large boul-
 ders. I have seen some still larger. Boulders are of all sizes (frequently as
 large as a man's head) and are numerous. The still larger boulders are not
 so frequent. One large block of granite. Other larger ones occasionally oc-
 cur, but I have not measured them. Scattered about here and there.

     3. Both rounded and angular.

    5. Have observed a few groovings and striations, but very faint and not
 numerous ; and on small pebbles in district referred to.

     6. (Ф) Rocks of the pame nature occur at Cumberland and Salop, Malvern.

   (5) I believe they are derived from all points of the compass, some pos-
sibly from Scandinavia, &c. Metamorphic and volcanic rocks are numerous.

The most abundant are the quartzites and siliceous pebbles (Budleigh-

Salterton pebbles) with fossils (Orthis reclux, Lingulce, &c.). Carboni-

ferous sandstones and mountain-limestones occiar. Not much Lias, and a few

pieces of oolite (Great Oolite and Cornbrash) with characteristic fossils.
In one small field in Rowington numerous oolitic rock-fragments with

chalk and flint and older rocks occur. Felstone (Cumberland or North Wales)

recognized ; volcanic rock (The "Wrekin, Salop) recognized ; peculiar amyg-

daloid granite (Malvern ?).

7. Primitive limestone, porphyritic greenstone, trap, volcanic grit, several

varieties of granite, syenite, hard siliceous gi'it (abundant), pebbles of quartz,

jasper agate (numerous), crystalline and schistose slate, sandstone pebbles,

felstone, dolerite (varieties of).

Chalk (hard and soft, the former predominates), Cornbrash, forest-marble.

Great Oolite, Lias, Magnesian limestone, Mountain-limestone, chert (Carboni-

ferous), Millstone-grit, Permian wood, Calymene in nodule (?), Lower-Silurian

AUfossiliferous pebbles.  the above are fossiliferous.

8. The height of the group above the sea is about 400 feet or more. Can-

not state this positively.

   9. In reply to No 1, many miles.

10. Sometimes exposed on surface in fields, and in the gravel (drift) pits

in district.

   It must be remarked that the stones called " boulders " in this communi-

cation are not of the same size and character as the glaciated boulders scat-

tered over Staffordshire and other neighbouring districts. Attention is called

to the quartzose pebbles with certain Lower-Silurian fossils which predominate

in the drift of this district. Orthis reduce, so common in Devon and Nor-

mandy, is the most frequent fossil in these pebbles, although fossils are few

and far between. The question raised is whether they really have drifted, or

whether an old Lower-Silurian centre once extended in^this direction.

                                                      Devon.

   Mr. Widger reports travelled boulders at Bishop's Steignton parish, Lind-
ridge Estate, Coombe Farm near Teignmouth, Devon, from 6 inches to 4
feet in diameter, 300 feet above the sea.

   That very great interest attaches to boulders in Devonshire, appears from
Mr. Pengelly's remarkable description of the granite boulder on the shore of
Barnstaple Bay, North Devon, given in last year's Report. It is hoped that
Mr. Pengelly wiU favour the Committee by carrying on his investigations
and contributing them to next year's Report.

                                                      Llanewst.

   Mr. Norris reports as follows :

   1. Boulder at Llanrwst, Gorphwysfa, co. Denbigh, one mile N.E. of town
next to Cae Brachina.

   2. (1) Conical stone, height 7 feet 6 inches, greatest circumference 10 feet,
tapers to a point. (2) Height 5 feet, cii'cumference 9 feet.

   3. (1) Angular siliceous conglomerate, rough fracture on two sides at right

angles, weathered in spurious conchoidal forms. (2) Fine-grained white fel-
spathic stone with somewhat slaty fissure ; rolled on two thirds of its surface,
weathered and fissured on the other.

    4. Moved.

  --;^(,te. Gorphwysfa is 336 feet above the sea-level on the western slope of

a hiU 500 to 600 feet high towards the vale of Conway. The soil of the hill
and neighbourhood is Boulder-clay on the Denbyshire grit and imperfect slates.
All the old walls and hedge-footings have boidders built into them ; and the

foundations of my own modern house include a large number, some from Pen-

y-bryn. At Qae-MeUor Farm near ten tons were removed from two acres
in rounded masses reaching a diameter of 3 feet of varica.

    6. Conglomerates. On the mountain-top opposite tliis, between Llanrwst

and Bettwys-Coed, I came across a boulder of red porphyry.
    8. Height above the sea 336 feet.

Siwth Report of the Committee on the Treatment and Utilization of Sew-
    age, consisting o/Richard B. Grantham^ C.E.,F.G.S. (Chairman),

   r. J. Bramwell, C.E., F.R.S., Professor W. H. Cokfield, M.A.,
   M.D. (Oxon.), J. H. Gilbert, Ph.D., F.R.S., F.C.S., W. Hope,
    V.C, and Professor A. W. Williamson, Ph.D., F.R.S., F.C.S.

 During the past year the Committee has been able to continue its observa-
 tions on the amounts of the various crops obtained at Breton's Farm, near
 Bomford, but has not been able, from want of funds, to continue the regular
 gaugings of the sewage and effluent water, nor to have any more analyses
 performed ; so that neither the quantities of sewage and effluent water nor

 their composition can be given for the past year.

     It has been thought desirable to keep the corresponding Tables numbered
 as they have been heretofore ; and as Tables I., II., and III. cannot be given
 this year, Table IV. is the first, and shows, as it did last year, the kind of crops
 grown on the diiFerent beds of the farm, the dates when sown or planted,
 and when cut or gathered, the total produce, and the produce per acre, with
 other particulars, but does not show this year the approximate amounts of
 sewage applied, nor the number of dressings which each crop received.

     Table Y. is a summary of Table IV., the acreage of eacb plot being given,
 the kinds of crops grown, and the total amount and amount per acre for

  each plot ; it onlj' corresponds to a small part of Table V. of last year.

 From it we see that 2353*43 tons of crops were taken ofi" the farm from
 March 25th, 1873, to March 24th, 1874, this being at the rate of 21-7 tons
  per acre. In 1872-73 only 1704 tons were taken off, as against 2714 tons

  during 1871-72; and this was, as explained in last year's Report, due

 partly to the fact that a much larger amount of crop was standing on
  March 24th, 1873, than on the same day in 1872, and partly to the fact
  that cereals were much more largely grown in 1872-73 than in 1871-72.

      In Table VII. these particulars are given for the past year ; and a com-
  parison is also made with the two previous ones ; from which it appears
  that the area actually fallow on March 24th, 1874, was nearly the same as
  that on March 24th, 1873, and very much less than that lying fallow on
  March 24th, 1872 ; from which it might at first seem that the amount of
  standing crop left on March 24th, 1874, Avas about the same as that found
  on the land on March 25th, 1873, when the year began as far as the records
  are concerned ; but it must be observed that the land sown with spring wheat
--

is counted as laud in crop, so that a fairer comparison of the crops actually-

standing is got by subtracting the acreage of the land so sown from the total
number of acres " in crop" each year; thus :

ON THE TREAT.MENT AND UTILIZ.4TI0N OF SEWAGE.  213

                   Section I. Fourth Note on the Diy Eurth System.

   Dr. Gilbert has supplemented the results given in former lleports by the
deterraiuation of the nitrogen (by the soda-lime process) in soil which has

now passed through a Moule's eartli-closet five times. The determinations
were made upon the air-dried manure ; but, for uniformity and for fairer
comparison, the psrcentage is, in each case, calculated upon the soil as dried
at ] 00░ C. The results of the series are as follows :
                                                       --

amount of soil, aud a smaller proportion of the total nitrogen daily voided,
would be collected in an earth-closet. The increased percentage of nitrogen
actually found is seen to be less than one third of the amount calculated on
the foregoing assumption. There can, indeed, be little doubt that there is a
considerable evolution of nitrogen in some form ; and the probability is that

it takes place to a great extent as free nitrogen.

   The Committee would refer to their former Reports (III. pp. 187 & 188,

IV. p. 143, V. pp. 413&439) for their opinion of the system in its other aspects

than that of the composition and manurial value of the product.

 Report on the Anthropological Notes and Queries for the use of

    Travellers jiublished by the Committee, consisting of Colonel Lane
    Fox, Dr. Beddoe, Mr. Franks, Mr. Francis Galton, Mr.

   E. W. Brabrook, Sir John Lubbock, Sir Walter Elliot, Mr.
    Clements Markham, aud Mr. E. B. Tylor. By Colonel A.

    Lane Fox, Secretary of the Committee.

 These Notes and Queries are the result of a resolution of the General Com-
 mittee passed at the Brighton Meeting in 1872, to the following effect:
 " That Colonel A. Lane Fox, Dr. Beddoe, Mr. Franks, Mr. Francis Galtoi],
 Mr. E. AY. Brabrook, Sir John Lubbock, Sir AValter Elliot, Mr. Clements
 Markham, and Mr. E. B. Tylor be a committee for the purpose of prepariug
 and publishing brief forms of instruction for travellers, ethnologists, and
 other anthropological observers ; that Colonel Lane Fox be the Secretary,
 and that the sum of .Б25 be placed at their disposal for the purpose."

     At the Bradford Meeting in 1873 the Committee was reaj^pointed, and
 the grant increased to .Б50, with the view of covering all possible expenses
 and producing a work calculated to suffice for the use of travellers for some

 time to come.

   A report on the progress of the work was made to the General Committee

 last year, to which it is unnecessary to refer here. The object of the book
 is to promote accurate anthropological observation on the part of travellers,
 and to enable those who are not anthropologists themselves to supply the
 information which is wanted for the scientific study of anthropology at home.

      Similar instructions on a smaller scale have been published by this Asso-
  ciation in former years, as also by the Smithsonian Institute, the Anthropo-
  logical Society of Paris, the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and

 Ireland, and other bodies ; but many of them have become obsolete, and are
 but little known to travellers at the present time.

     The chief defect of most of these works has been their insufficient detail.
  It is not enough to publish such general queries as might suggest themselves
  unaided to any well-informed traveller ; what is wanted is to draw attention
  to minutiae which might ordinarily be expected to pass unnoticed, but which

  are often of the first importance to the student of the different branches of
  anthropological research.

     To this end it has been thought advisable that the questions on the several

 sections should be drawn up by different anthropologists, each of whom has

  paid special attention to the subject treated.

  --The work has been divided into two main divisions the first relating to

 the constitution of man, physical and mental ; the second to the history and
 development of culture.

    Under the first division we have questions relating to ethnology proper.
ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTES AND QUERIES FOR TRAVELLERS. 215

and directed to the acquirement of knowledge resi)ccting the geographical
distribution, migration, and intermixture of the different races of mankind,

as well as the ph^^sical and mental capacity of these races for civilization.

   Under the second division we have questions bearing upon the rise and.

progress of the arts, religions, laws, customs, and institutions of mankind,
and the means by which they have been developed and spread by war, com-
merce, and other causes, and includiug all that comes under the head of the

new science of Sociology, to which comparatively little attention has been

paid hitherto.

   The whole of the first or ethnological division of the subject has been
intrusted to Dr. Beddoe, with the exception of the section on physiognomy,
which has been contributed by Mr. Darwin, and some remarks on heredity

by Mr. Galton. In Section I. is given a description of the various instru-

ments to be employed in measuring the different parts of the body and

Askulls.  description of the parts to be measured is given in Section

II., which includes two diagrams showing the positions in Avhich the

measurements are to be taken. Under anatomy and physiology are in-

cluded questions relating to the internal organism and the soft parts of the

--body muscles, circulation, respiration, temperature, nerves, tissues, &c. In

Section IV., under development and decay, are given inquiries into the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         _

periods of growth, length of life, puberty, dentition, death-rate, birth-rate,

&e. Section V. is devoted to the qualities, mode of growth, and tex-

ture of the hair. Under Section YI. are given instructions for esti-

mating accurately the colour of the eyes, skin, and hair of races. "Even
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               _

educated men," says Dr. Beddoe, " differ very widely as to the appreciation of
colours and their nomenclature. Such a term as olive, for example, is used

by different observers to denote hues totally different from each other.

Moreover, decided colours, such as bright red or yellow, or coal-black, are

apt to attract the eye, and their frequency is likely to be overestimated. It

is therefore most desirable that information as to the colour of the skin, hair,
and eyes should be collected in a systematic manner, by comparing those of
every individual observer with a table of numbered squares showing the
various shades of colour graduated from coal-black to the fairest European
flesh-colour, and including all the different hues that are to be found amongst
the races of mankind." In order that the data of European and foreign

observers might tally as closely as possible in their system of appreciating

these colours, we have adopted the chromatic tables of M. Broca, who has

kindly given his assistance in obtaining the identical shades which he has

employed. These tables occupy three pages of the book.

Passing over two sections relating to the odour and motions of the body,

--we come to Section IX. on physiognomy, by Darwin, which includes such

remarks as the following: "General remarks on expression," he says,

" are of comparatively little value ; and memory is so deceptive that it ought

Anot to be trusted.  definite description of the countenance under any

emotion or frame of mind, with a statement of the circumstances under which

it occurred, would possess much value. 1. Is astonishment expressed by the

eyes and mouth being opened wide, and by the eyebrows being raised ? Are

the open hands often raised high up, with the fingers widely separated, and the

palms directed towards the person causing astonishment ? Is the open mouth

in some cases covered by the hand? or is the hand carried to some part of the

head ? 2. Does shame excite a blush when the colour of the skin allows it

to be visible ? and especially how low down the body does the blush extend ?
3. "When a man is indignant or defiant, does he frown, hold his body and

head erect, square his shoulders, and clench his fists ? 4. When considering
--216
KEPOiiT 1874.

deeplj'' oil any subject, or trying to understand any puzzle, does he frown or

wrinkle the skin beneath the lower eyelids ? 5. When in low spirits, are the

corners of the mouth depressed, and the inner corner of the eyebrows raised
by that muscle which the French call the ' Grief muscle' ? " The questions
on this head are sixteen in number.

   After a section on " Pathology " we come to " Abnormalities," which are

natural deformities, and are distinct from Deformations or artificial deformities,
which have a distinct section allotted to them under the division of " Culture."

    Under the section devoted to the " Senses " are given various tests to serve
 as means of comparison, including two pages of the test-dots used for testing

the eyesight of recruits in the British army. By this means a comparison of
the eyesight of natives with that of Europeans can be made. The instructions
for judging distances in use by the army are also given for the same object.

    Under the head of " Crosses " are given tables for indicating the racial posi-
 tion of mongrels and mestizos, and for estimating the number of return
 crosses which restore apparent purity of blood.

     Under " Psychology " special attention is drawn by a series of questions to
 the desirability of distinguishing between the effect of European customs
 when introduced amongst savages and exposed to contact with native sur-
 roundings ; and, on the other hand, to the eifect of culture upon natives
 of the same race who have been removed at an early age from native
 surroundings and brought up in European schools.

     All the foregoing sections are included under the head of " Constitution
 of Man," and, as already said, are ethnological in their bearings; but with
 the adoption of the term anthropology our science has widened its sphere.
 It is true that in the old days ethnology did practically include a broader
 range of subjects than are comprehended under the strict derivation of the
 term " ethnos." It is equally true that anthropology has and does at the pre-

 sent time confine itself far too exclusively to questions of race. But as the

 widening of our science has been coincident with the change of name it may
 be well to consider for a moment the causes that may be expected to assign

 to race-questions a less important place in our deliberations than formerly.

    According to the old dogma, all human life was destroyed by the uni-

 versal deluge with the exception of one family ; and as the whole of the
 existing races of mankind must have descended from one or other of the
 three sons of Noah, the ethnological or racial question was of paramount
 and immediate importance, and was limited to the determination of the
 period, and the causes by which such races as the Fucgians, the Tasmanians,
 Australians, or Esquimaux were constrained to change their colour and other
 physical peculiarities, and descend to the comparatively low condition in

 which they are now found.

     Since, however, science has demonstrated the error of this theory, and
 has shown that long prior to the supposed era of the deluge the whole
 world was peopled by races of beings some of which were, in all probability,

 human only in form, and since the researches of Mr. Darwin and others
 have shown the great probability of the descent of the human species from

 the lower forms of life, the racial question, though still of primary importance,
 zoologically considered, has been transferred to the domain of palaeontologj',

 to be determined perhaps by geologists in the far distant future. And as a

-- --line must be drawn somewhere, man's origin, in the proper acceptation of

 the term man as a progressive being has become indissolubly connected

 with the origin and development of culture. It is to this science of culture
 or sociology that Sir John Lubbock, Mr. Tylor, Mr. Herbert Spencer, and
 others have of late years turned their attention.

   It has been shown that the rise of culture in man has been one of evolu-

tion, corresponding in all respects with the evolution of those species of

animals amongst which that of man is included, that every art, custom, and

institution has a history of development which is capable of being studied

apart from that of the devclopmcut of the particular races amongst whom

those customs thrive, and that the attention of anthropologists in the future
wiU in a great measure bo occupied in tracing the sequence of that develop-
ment and the laws by which it is governed.

    This is the science of " Sociology," the rise of which has been marked by the

conversion of ethnology into anthropology, or the study of man in all its

bearings, and for the prosecution of which far greater accuracy of detail is
required in the description of the social institution of savages and barbarous
races than has been devoted to the subject hitherto. Every work of man's

hand and brain has now to be studied in its bearings upon social evolution

just as in the study of natural history every part of an organism and every
variety of species has to be studied in its bearings upon the evolution of
species. The social anatomy of every tribe and race has to be considered
in all its parts, and the questions by which the attention of travellers have
been directed to the several subjects have therefore been classified, as far as
possible, by their affinities, and by their relation to the general results.

    Under the head of " History " it has been endeavoured to collect all the
information that can be obtained from the traditions of the people, and from
inquiries as to their mode of recording events. Archaeology is divided into
Palfeolithic period, Cave period, Neolithic or Surface period, Megalithic
monuments, Tumuli, (fee. ; engravings of the principal types of implements
to be looked for have been contributed by Mr. John Evans, and the attention
of travellers has been directed, by means of a diagram, to the position in

which such implements are likely to be found. When it is considered that

it is only within the last fifteen or twenty years that archaeologists have begun
to study in earnest the prehistoric monuments and implements of civilized
countries, and that the antiquities of savage and uncultivated countries are

entirely unknown, important results may be expected from this branch of

inquiry.

    The important subjects of food, narcotics, cannibalism, personal ornament,
tattooing, and clothing have been treated by Mr. Franks. War, hunting,
games, archasology, stone implements, circumcision, drawing, and ornamen-
tation, by myself. Deformations, by Professor Busk. Machinery, string,
weaving, dyeing, basketwork, and engineering, by Mr. John Evans.
Medicine, by Dr. Barnard Davis. Trade, money, weights, and measures,
domestication of animals, by Mr. Hyde Clarke. Communications, causes that
limit population, population, and statistics, by Mr. Galton. Contact of
savages with civilized races, by Sir T. Gore Browne. Marital relations,

is treated by Mr. Tylor in great detail, and is divided under numerous sub-

headings.

    The work concludes with a valuable section by 'Mr. Galton, on the mode

of obtaining statistics and striking averages. Many of the questions through-

out the book are of a nature which, from the apparent insignificance of the
subjects referred to, might appear to those ignorant of the requirements of
anthropology unimportant or even childish ; and yet from that very cause
--218 REPORT 1874.

these apparently trivial matters, owing to their having been less influenced

by progressive changes, are often of the utmost value in tracing the con-

nexions between the culture of different races and localities.

The necessity which exists for laying the groundwork of our science on

a sounder basis must have struck most of those who have attended the

Whymeetings of this department during past years.  is it that cur leading

biologists devote their attention so exclusively to the lower forms of life ?

It cannot be because men of science think the noblest study for mankind is
beast kind, but because beast kind is more scientifically treated than man-

kind, especially as regards the branch of descriptive anthropology, upon

which all sound deductions must be based.
   Travellers have usually recorded only those customs of modern savages

which they have chanced to observe; and, as a rule, they have observed chiefly

those which their experience of civilized institutions has led them to look

for. Nor are there wanting instances in which the information thus obtained
has been lamentably distorted in order to render it in harmony with precon-

ceived ideas.

    In attempting to trace the distribution of cognate arts and customs, the

anthropologist is perpetually thwarted by the difiiculty of distinguishing
between positive and negative evidence, i. e. between non-existence and non-
recorded existence ; so that, to use the words of Mr. E. B. T3'lor, it is " play-
ing against the bank for a student to set up a claim to isolation for any art

or custom, not knowing what evidence there may be against him buried in

the ground or hidden in remote tribes."
   The rapid extermination of savages at the present time, and the rapidity with

which they are being reduced to the standard of European manners, renders

it of urgent importance to correct these sources of error as soon as possible.

   It is hoped that the questions contained in this work may be a means of

enabling the traveller to collect information witliout prejudice from his indi-

vidual views.

To this end it is particularly to be hoped that they will endeavour to

answer the questions as fully as possible, not confining themselves to a

detailed account of those things which exist, but also, by special inquiries

directed to the subject, endeavouring to determine the non-existence of

others to which attention is drawn*.

On Cyclone and Rainfall Periodicities in connexion with the Sun-spot
                   Periodicity. By Charles MELDRUMf.

The catalogue of cyclones experienced in the Indian Ocean from 1847 to
1873, submitted last year, indicates that during that period the number of

cyclones in the space between the equator and 34░ S. lat., and the meridians

of 40░ E. and 110░ E., was much greater in the years of maximum than in

the years of minimum sun-spot frequency.
   It will now, and in subsequent Eeports, be shown that not only the num-

    * Tlie Notes and Queries bave been publislied by Stanford, of CI aring Cross, and a
 notice bas been inserted in tbe flj'leaf requesting that any communications from travellers
 relating to the queries contained in tbe volume may be sent to the Secretary of the An-
 thropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, 4 St. Martin's Place, Trafalgar

Square, London. The names of Mr. John Evans and Mr. F. W. Eudler have been added

to the Committee.

  t A grant of Б100 was made at Bradford to Prof. Balfour Stewart, Mr. J. Q-laisher

and Mr. J. N. Loekyer, to assist Mr. Meldrum in conducting meteorological researches

in Mauritius.

         CONNEXION OF CYCLONES AND RAINFALL WITH SUN-SPOTS. 219

ber of cyclones, but their duration, extent, and energy were also much greater

in the former than in the latter years, and that there is a strong probability
that this cyclonic fluctuation has been coincident with a similar fluctuation

of the rainfall over the globe generally.

   The present communication is confined to the twelve years 1856-67,

comprising a complete sun-spot cycle.

   With regard to the cyclones of the Indian Ocean, the investigation is based
upon the extensive collection of observations made by the Meteorological
Society of Mauritius, on the assumption that the observations are so numer-
ous that no cyclone of any considerable extent or violence can have escaped

detection.

  A chart has been prepared for noon on each day of the period during

which a cyclone lasted. The chart shows the positions of the vessels, the
direction and force of the wind, the state of the weather and sea, &e. In
this way the position of the centre of the cyclone is ascertained for each
day. Then, by examining the several charts, the duration, extent, &c. of

the cyclone are determined.

   The number of cyclones thus examined for the twelve years is one hundred
and thirteen, and their tracks have been laid down on six charts.

   The results of the investigation are given in Table I. Column 1 shows
the dates ; 2, the number of cyclone on chart ; 3, the distance traversed
4, the mean radius of cyclone ; 5, area of cyclone, or irv" ; 6, the duration in
days ; and 7, total cyclonic area, or Drrr".

   Prom Table I. we obtain the following general results :

                  --

220 REPORT 1874.

   From the chart for 1866 it will be seen that in April of that year there
was a number of small cyclones. The S.E. trade and N.W. monsoon were

in collision for a considerable time, and several cyclonic eddies of short
duration were formed.

   If we could obtain good values of the mass of air in motion and the velo-
city of the wind, it would probably be found that the ratios of cyclonic

energy were still greater than those of cyclonic area ; for the cyclones were

much more violent in the years of maximum than in those of minimum sun-

spot frequency.

    Assuming the mass to be nearly proportional to the area, and the velocity
of the wind in a strong gale to be fifty-five miles, in a whole gale seventy
miles, and in a hurricane eighty-five miles an hour, the amount of cyclonic
energy in 1860 was about eighteen times greater than in 1856, the squares

of the velocities being nearly three to five.
    Although the results are necessarily rough approximations, yet the fact

that the number and violence of the cyclones of years of maximum sun-spot
were far greater than in the years of minimum sun-spot is beyond all doubt.
There is independent evidence of this, which any one may examine for him-
self. When a great hurricane tabes place in the Indian Ocean the disabled

ships are obliged to put into the nearest port ; and the newspapers, in their
" Shipping Intelligence," announce the arrivals of the vessels, the dates and
localities of the bad weather, and the amount of damage sustained.

    For upwards of twenty years the ' Commercial Gazette ' of Port Louis has
published all arrivals of vessels and all maritime events which have been

reported bj' them. Considering, then, the geographical position of Mauritius,
a cyclone periodicity, if one exists, should be traceable in the " Shipping

Intelligence." Now, from Table II., which gives the published reports for
1856, 1860, and 1867, it will be seen that the number of storms and the
damage sustained in 1856 and 1867 were insignificant compared with the
long list of hurricanes and disasters in 1860.

    Table III. gives as complete a list of hurricanes and storms experienced
in Mauritius as I have hitherto been enabled to prepare. The list comprises
only such storms as, from the violence of the wind, committed considerable

damage. Taking each maximum and minimum sun-spot year, and two years
on each side of it, we get the following results :

   For the two islands the number of cyclones in the maxima years was
thirty-six, and for the minima years nineteen. This result is favourable.

   It would appear also from Mr. Pocy's researches, and from investigations
made at Mauritius in 1872, that the cyclones of the "West Indies are, upon
the whole, subject to the same periodicity.

   The rainfall for the twelve years under discussion is given in Tables Y.

to IX.

   Taking the mean annual rainfall at thirty stations in Scotland, thirty-one

stations on the continent of Europe, and the annual falls at Greenwich, Cal-

cutta, Bombay, Mauritius, and the Cape, we get :

       ON EARTHQUAKES IN SCOTLAND.     241

Fifth Report on Earthquakes in Scotland, drawn up by Dr. Bryce,

   F.G.S. The Committee consists of Dr. Bryce, F.G.S., Sir W.

   Thomson, F.R.S., J. Brough, G. Forbes, F.R.S.E., D. Milne-
   Holme, F.R.S.E., and J. Thomson.

The peiiod of extraordinary earthquake disturbance in various parts of
Scotland recorded in last year's Report has been succeeded by one of entire
quiescence. Neither in the Comrie district, where the disturbances have

been in time past both most frequent and severe, nor in other tracts of country

occasionally agitated, has any earthquake movement been known to occur

during the year, such as either to excite the attention of any one or to

affect the instruments.

   The seismometer belonging to the Association, placed in the tower of
Comrie parish church, is maintained in a state of efficient action, and carefully
observed from time to time; and a meteorological record is kept in the house
of a local member of the Committee, whose residence is in the immediate

neighbourhood.

   As an additional indicator and check upon the seismometer, a set of
upright cylinders are now to be placed in a separate building arranged as
suggested by Mr. Mallet, and of the size and form which he recommends.
A^site for this building has been most kindly granted by Peter Drumniond,
Esq., of Dunearn, near Comrie, on the private grounds which surround his
residence. The distance from the parish church is about half a mile, and
the site upon a rock tlirough which any vibrations that occur will be freely
communicated from the supposed centre of disturbance, situated among like
rocks about two miles towards the N.W. This building is to be immediately

proceeded with.
    In closing this brief Report the Committee have to refer with the deepest

regret to the lamented death of Mr. Peter Macfarlane, which occurred iu

June last. Mr. Macfarlane for many years had charge of the instruments at

Comrie ; and the Committee have had frequent occasion to refer to his untiring
zeal and watchfulness in conducting this inquiry, and to speak in terms of
high commendation of the ingenious mechanical contrivances which he was

enabled to bring to bear upon the methods of observing.

Report of the Committee appointed to prepare and print Tables of
    Wave-numbers, the Committee consisting of Dr. Huggins, F.R.S.,
   J. N. LocKYER, F.R.S., Dr. Keynolds, F.R.S., G. J. Stoney,

   F.R.S., W. Spottiswoode, F.R.S., Dr. De La Rue, F.R.S., and
   Dr. W. M. Watts.

The work of this Committee is in progress, and the Committee hope to be in
a position to make a full report at the next Meeting of the Association.
Under these circumstances they ask to be reappointed.

--242 REPORT 1874.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Prof. A.W.Williamson, F.R.S.,

   Prof. Sir W. Thomson, F.R.S., Prof. Clerk Maxwell, F.R.S., Prof.

    G. C. Foster, F.R.S., F. A. Abel, F.R.S., Prof. Fleeming Jenkin,

   F.R.S., C. W. Siemens, F.R.S., and Mr. R. Sabine, appointed for

    the purpose of testing the new Pyrometer of Mr. Siemeus.

Tour pyrometers, numbered bj the makers 404, 411, 414, and 445 respec-
tively, have been supplied for the purposes of the Committee by Dr. Siemens
during the course of the experiments. In aU the instruments the part by
"which indications of change of temperature are given is identical, and con-
sists of a length of fine platinum wire doubled back on itself, and coiled upon
a cylinder of refractory fire-clay. The ends of the coil are fastened to stout

platinum wires of such a length that their further extremities never reach a
very high temperature, and these in their turn are connected by copper wires

with binding-screws on the outside of the case of the pyrometer. The copper
wires are enclosed in a stout tube of wrought iron, about 3-5 centimetres in
diameter and about 120 centimetres long, which projects from the furnace
or other space whose temperature is required, and forms a handle and support
for the whole instrument. The part to be inserted in the furnace (namely,
the coil of platinum wire) is protected by a case or sheath, which is fastened
by screws to one end of the iron tube. In pyrometer No. 404 (which, it is
understood, was constructed according to the plan usually adopted by Messrs.
Siemens Brothers previously to the experiments of the Committee) this sheath
was made of a piece of wrought-iron tubing closed at one end, and the fire-
clay cylinder supporting the platinum coil was inserted in it without any
further protection, beyond a packing of asbestos, employed to prevent it
shifting or being injured by shaking. Pyrometers Nos. 411 and 414, besides
an outer sheath of wrought iron similar to that of 404, had a piece of stout
platinum foil wrapped tightly round the fire-clay cylinder, but of course not
touching the coil. In aU other essential respects they were exactly like
No. 404. In No. 445, instead of a wrought-iron sheath, a platinum tube
closed at one end was used to enclose the pyrometric coil, so that in this in-
strument, although it had the usual long stem of wrought iron, no part of
the iron was ever exposed to a red heat ; otherwise, it was just like the others.
In all cases the conducting-wires, where they pass up the stem of the instru-
ment, are kept from contact with it or with each other by being inserted in

clay tubes like tobacco-pipe stems.

   The indications depend on the changes which the electrical resistance of
the ])latinum coil undergoes when its temperature is altered. In ordor to
avoid the errors that might otherwise arise from the heating of the leading

wires connecting the pyrometer with the measuring-apparatus, the undivided

current of the testing-battery is conveyed by a wire, which passes down the
stem of the instrument, and is denoted in the diagram by C, to the beginning
of the pyrometer-coil, where it divides into two parts, one of which, after
traversing the coU, is conveyed up the stem and back to the battery by a wire
marked X^ in the diagram, while the other part is conveyed by a precisely
similar wire (X) to the standard against which the coil is to be measured.
Thus, in the comparison, the resistance of the wire X^ acts as an addition to

Xthat of the pyrometer-coil, and that of the wire as an equal addition to

the resistance of the standard. To insure that this compensation between

the resistances of the leading wii'es is as accurate as possible, the three wires,

temperature, &c.

    The most important points to ascertain, in relation to the applicability of

Siemens's pyrometer to the purposes for -which it is intended, were how nearly

the resistance of the coil is constant at a given temperature, and, in case of

its being found to be. permanently altered by exposure to high temperatures,

to determine the extent of such alterations. The investigations of the Com-
mittee have been confined to these two points. The whole of the measure-
ments have been made in the Physical Laboratory of University College,

London, by Professor G. C. Foster, or his assistant, Mr. W. Grant, or else by

students working in the laboratory under Professor Foster's supervision. The

thanks of the Committee are specially due to Mr. Charles Law and to Mr, 0.

J. Lodge for their valuable aid thus rendered. The method adopted was that

of the diiferential resistance-measurer. Two sets of resistance-coils, both of

them adjusted to the British-Association standard, were available for the
measurements. One of them, made of platinum-silver wire, by Messrs. EUiott
Ikothcrs, gave any whole number of ohms from 1 to 10,000 ; the other, of
very thick German-silver wire, by Mr. Grant, gave any whole number from
1 to 200. The resistance of all the pyrometers was marked upon them by
the makers as being equal to 10 Siemens's mercury units at 0░ C, and at the
highest temperature to which any of them was exposed during the experiments,
the resistance never rose beyond about 36 ohms ; hence the resistances to be
measured always lay within the range of the German-silver coils. In order
to be able to estimate fractions of a unit, the following method was adopted :
after the smallest whole number whose resistance exceeded that of the pyro-
meter had been foimd on the German-silver coils, the other set (Elliott's)
were connected in parallel circuit with these, so as to act as a " shunt," and

                                                                      k2

the resistance was altered until the balance was got as accurately as possible.

It was found that in this way changes of resistance amounting to 0-001 ohm,

or to about -nro'diT of the quantity to be measured, could generally be detected

without much difficulty. When measurements were made at atmospheric

temperatures, the pyrometers were always immersed in water nearly up to

the junction of the sheath surrounding the coil with the stem, and were placed

in the water at least an hour before the measurement was made. Owing,

however, to the conductivity of the mass of iron forming the stem, it was

impossible to insure that the pyrometer-wire was even nearly at the same
temperature as the water, if this differed much from the temperature of the

air in the laboratory; and consequently it was thought better not to attempt

to get measurements at a fixed temperature, but to make the determinations

as nearly as might be at the temperature of the laboratory, and to reduce the

results to a fixed temperature by calculation. As 10░ C. was approximately

the mean temperature at which the measures were actually taken, this was

adopted as the temperature of reference.

The formula employed for correcting the observations for temperature was
--Aobtained as foUows :
                         piece of the same German-silver wire as that of wliich

the 10-ohm coil was made in the set of coils used was immersed in water

and its resistance measured, in one experiment at 17^'6 and 100^ C, and in

another, with a slightly different ari'angement of the apparatus, at 18░ and

100░. These determinations gave for the value of a in the formula

                         r,=yio[i+Ф(0-iO)].

yja the resistance at 10░, the values 0-000306 and 0-000312 respectively. The
mean value 0-000309 was adopted in subsequent calculations. On the other

hand, the following determinations "were made with one of the pyrometers,

The course of testing to which each pyrometer was subjected consisted in
heating it repeatedly to redness and determining its resistance at the atmo-

spheric temperature after each heating. The source of heat most often used
was the laboratory fire in an open grate without blower ; but in some of the

later experiments a small Hofmann's gas combustion-furnace, with three rows

of clay burners, was employed. Hough measurements of the resistance of the
pyrometers were made while they were in the fire in order to find out approxi-
mately how long the temperature continued to rise, and whether it was about
the same in the different experiments.

It wiU be seen from the Tables of results which follow that, on the whole,

the later measurements agree better with each other than those made at the

beginning of the trials. This is no doubt to a great extent a natural result

of practice in the use of the methods*, -but it is also probably due in part to

the greater sensibility of the galvanometer emjiloycd in the more recent ex-
periments. The galvanometer used at first was a thin wire double-needle

8:alvanometer by Watkins and Hill, of about 136 ohms resistance ; this neces-

sitated the use of a comparatively powerful testing-battery (three cells of
Marie-Davy, zinc, carbon, sulphate of mercury), and it was consequently not
always easy to prevent the resistance of the pyrometer being changed by the

testing current. In all the recent experiments a reflecting galvanometer of

very low resistance, by W. Grant, has been used, and a single Smee's cell has

been used as the testing-battery.

248 REPORT 1874.

   From tlie results shown in the Tables it appears that the effect of repeated

exposure to a red heat for some hours -was to cause a considerable permanent
increase of resistance in pyrometers 404, 411, and 414 ; while the resistance
of 445 was almost unaffected by similar treatment, the experiments showing
in this case a slight fall of resistance. The following Table gives the resist-
ance of each pyrometer at 10░ before and after the series of heatings, the total
change of resistance undergone by each pyrometer, and the change of tem-
perature which would produce approximately the observed change of resis-
tance :

but that measurements made after an interval of a few months, even when
the pyrometer had not been heated in the mean time, sometimes differed deci-
dedly from the results previously found. Possibly such changes may bo due

to alterations of the unsoldered connexions of the conducting-wires ; but, what-
ever their cause, they would probably be met with in actual practice if the
pyrometers were used during long periods of time.

As in the Report on the subject handed in in August last, the results of the
investigation will be presented under three principal aspects :

   (1) The law of the variation of the resistance, in terms of the variation of

the speed.

   (2) The law of the variation of the resistance, in terms of the variation

in the length of the surface.

   (3) The nature of the variation of the resistance, in terms of the variation

in the quality of the surface.

   It will be seen, however, that, as exemplified by the results now presented,

no less than by those presented in the former Report, the three laws are more

or less interdependent.

In this concluding part of the series it was sought to give completeness

to the determination of the effect of quality, in what may be termed its

practical extremes of smoothness and of roughness. The experiments com-

prising the completion of the trials made with a tinfoiled surface on the one

hand, and one coated with rough sand on the other, represent these extremes.

   The list of materials used in forming the surface includes (1) tinfoil;
(2) hard paraffine, laid on thin and scraped perfectly smooth (this was also

used as a substratum on which to lay the foil, the medium of adhesion being

a thin  coat of tallow)                                                                          (.3)  blacklead, polished on the paraffine;            (4)       imbleachcd

ness of grain. The sands, of graduated fineness, were in turn sifted on to a

paraffined surface, having been previously sufficiently heated to melt their

way into it and become fixed there.

   There was, as might be expected, some difficulty in securing identity of
quality (1) throughout the length of each individual surface, and (2) (a for-
tiori) in the planes of different length. Of the smooth surfaces, the scraped
paraffine, naked, was perhaps the most uniform for all lengths ; of the rough

and no difference of perceptible amount was permitted.

  A tolerably correct perception of the different degrees of roughness ob-

tained with the roughened surfaces wUl be conveyed by the full-size photo-

graphic representations (Plate XII.).

    In formin'go all tlie surfaces care was taken to avoid abnormal roughness,
and to eliminate the effect of thickness of cutwater and of stern-end or run,
the ends of all planes being formed as shown in plate 3 of the previous
Eeport. In the case of the calico, a fine entrance was obtained by placing a
sharp tin cutwater, 1 inch long, over the scam at the front edge of the
plane ; the cahco was also carefully closed round the tail, and a fairly fine
run secured.

   The results obtained are shown in full detail in the accompanying dia-
grams, four in number, which, as in the former Ileport, represent them
seriatim, as finally reduced, in two separate forms. In one form (series 1,

sent speed ; in the other (series 2, Plates X. & XI.) they represent length of

surface. The corresponding ordiuates in each case represent resistance.
    In the first-named series, each of the successive lengths of surface has a

group of curves assigned to it, corresponding with the various qualities of
surfaces, and exhibiting the law of resistance in terms of sjjeecl of surface.

    In the second-named series, each of the successive speeds of surface has a
group of curves assigned to it, corresponding with the various qualities of
surface, and exhibiting the law of resistance in terms of length of surface. In
each of the diagrams, curves showiug the results given by a surface coated
with shellac varnish are given as a standard of comparison, the former ex-
periments having shown that this quality of surface might be regarded as in

--some sense a standard quality it being easily laid on with invariable

quality, and being practically identical in respect of resistance with Hay's or
Peacock's composition, smooth paint, or tallow. These standard curves are
 copied from the diagrams which accompanied the former Report.

    The ijlanes used in the experiments were, as before, about 19 inches wide ;
but the resistances shown for each length are those of the entire length of
 surface, assuming it to be of parallel width, and to expose to the frictional

 action one square foot of surface per foot of length.

    It wUl be seen that the diagrams of each form are deducible from those of

 the other.

     The results are shown in a more compendious but necessarily less complete
 form in the accompanying tabular statement (p. 2.51 ).

     This represents the resistances per square foot due to various lengths of

 surface, of various qualities, when moving with a standard speed of 600 feet
 per minute, accompanied by figures, in smaller type, denoting the power of
 the speed to which the resistances, if calculated for other speeds, must be

  taken as approximately proportional.
     Under the figure denoting the length of surface in each case, are three

  columns, A, B, C, which are referenced as foUows :

            A. Power of speed to which resistance is approximately proportional.

      --B. Resistance in pounds per square foot of a surface the length of
                   which is that specified in the heading taken as the mean resist-
                      ance for the whole length.

              C. Resistance per square foot on unit of surface, at the distance

owing to the combined effect of the greater power of the speed to which the
resistance is proportional, coupled with its less rapid declension in terms of
length of surface, with a length of 50 feet the mean resistance of the tin-
foiled surface is barely less than that of the varnished surface, and its

resistance per square foot at the 50th foot is the greater of the two.
   It is true that this apparent anomaly probably in part depends on the fact

that the coating of the longer surfaces with the foil was not so easily effected
as that of the shorter, and therefore perhaps their smoothness was less perfect
and their resistance somewhat increased ; yet, making every reasonable allow-
ance for this, the anomaly is still remarkable.

    Again, no rational explanation presents itself of the differences in the law
of variation of resistance in terms of length, exhibited by the rougher and
more highly resisting surfiices. The resistance, for instance, of the medium
sand alters disproportionately little towards the end of the plane, nor do any
of these resistances exhibit as marked an excess of decrease in that direction
as might have been expected. Partly, no doubt, this is owing to the diffi-
culty in securing uniformity of coating ; but also, it must be admitted, that
the law which really governs the decrease has yet to be discovered, though it
can hardly be doubted that it depends somehow on the current created by the

passage of the surfaces.

   I shall conclude the Report with some remarks on what appeal's to me to

be the rationale of the declension of resistance in terms of length of sur-

face.

    It is certain that any surface which, in passing through a fluid, experiences
resistance, must, in doing so, impress on the particles which resist it a force in

the line of motion equal to the resistance. Now, we cannot regard a fluid as
anchored to the shore or bottom by lines of tension or of thrust which are
snapped or crushed by the force which causes motion ; but, on the contrary,
we must assume the resistance offered by the particles of fluid to be purely
dynamic, and to be dependent on and correlative to their weights and the

velocities imparted to them.
    This being so, it is quite certain that the operating force, which (whatever

be its amount) must be precisely equal to the resistance when the speed is

steady, will in each unit of time, say in each second, generate a given definite

amount of new momentum, estimated in the line of motion, in the system of
particles on which it operates. The force must, in fact, generate some-
where and somehow in the surrounding fluid the momentum which exactly
corresponds dynamically to the universal law connecting force and mo-

mentum.

   That law may be expressed as follows :

If r be the force in pounds which operates in a given direction,

AY the weight operated on in pounds,

V the velocity in feet per second,

t the time of action,

                                     32-2 ft.

For the momentum, therefore, we have

                                 WV=F^<;

and this is equally true, whether it be the result of a small force acting
             EXPERIMENTS ON SURFACE-FRICTION.                               253

on a large mass, or vice versa, or of a single force acting on a succession of

masses.

The expression, therefore, quantifies the momentum which must be gene-

rated in each second in the surrounding fluid, by the transit of a surface the

resisting force of which is F. In some shape or other, there must be left behind

it, in each second, new momentum to that extent, existing either in the shape

of a narrow and rapid current, or a bi-oad and slow one, or one of graduated

speed and corresponding volume.

This last supposition is clearly the most reasonable one, and it is approxi-

mately in visible accordance with fact ; and, without speculating on the modus

operandi by which the motion is communicated, it becomes easy by help of

this supposition to put an approximate value on the breadth of the current

produced under any given circumstances.

    It will be seen presently that if the surface is long, tho current thus esti-
mated must be of considerable breadth ; and if this be so, instead of finding

it difficult to explain why the resistance per square foot grows less as the
length is increased, the perplexing question is, how the rate of declension is

so slow. For a little reflection obliges us to see that it is the motion of the

surface relative to contiguous particles, and not relative to distant ones, that

governs the resistance ; and if these contiguous particles are already possessed
of considerable velocity, concurrent with that of the surface, their resisting
power must plainly be impaired.

   When we proceed to trace the genesis of the momentum in detail, as it

must exist in the completely generated current left behind by the surface, if

we select at any point an element or strip of current parallel to the line of

motion, and possessing the velocity v in feet per second in that line, we see

that in that element the quantity of matter newly put in motion per second

--will, at that point, be a portion of the strip, (V w) feet in length (that being

the length left behind by the surface), while the velocity impressed on it is v и

and if all the dimensions be in feet, taking the depth of the current parallel

to the surface as unity, and the thickness or breadth of the element as d h

(h being the distaiace from the plane of the surface), we shall have for

=the weight of the element, diu (V--ui t') dh, w being the weight of a

cubic foot.

=VNow if we assume that tho current possesses a velocity                    at the plane

of the surface (that is to say, that the particles in contact with the surface

=have the same speed as the surface), and that whore A =11, then also 1^ 0,

the intermediate gradation of speed being uniform, we have

or, since salt water weighs 64 lbs. jDer cubic foot, so that w=64, and g=S2-2,
we may write the equation with sufficient exactness

                                         ^ Y=H

H =or, as the extreme breadth of the current,  -^^r.

If we apply this to the 50-ft. varnished surface, having a speed of GOO ft.

per minute, or 10 ft. per second, which had the definite resistance of

12-5 lbs., we have  H = "375

                              ft.,  or  about  4^  inches
                                                                             ;

and this was not far from the truth, though, as it is not easy to obtain an
exact measurement, the agreement must not be represented as more than

approximate.

    But if tlic surface had been 500 feet instead of only 50 feet in length, and if

we could assume the same resistance per square foot to be retained through-

out the length, the current would be 3"75 feet broad, and the velocity, to a
sensible distance from the surface, would be not far short of that of the

surface ; and we should have to encounter the paradox that under these
 circumstances the surface when enveloped in a favouring current more than
3 feet in breadth, and having, for a breadth of many inches, scarcely less

 speed than the surface itself, would be experiencing the same resistance as

when entering undisturbed water.
    If we suppose the law of distribution of velocity through the current to be

 different from that assumed in the above investigation, so as to allow particles

having much less velocity to be near the surface, the breadth to be assigned
to the current must be on the whole much greater, and the method by which
 the velocity could be thus distributed would be difficult to conceive.

    However, we do in fact see that tlie current is greatly disturbed by eddies
 and these, no doubt, furnish a machinery by which the distribution of velo-

--city is modified the modification being of such sort that relatively undis-

 turbed particles are being perpetually fed inwards towards the surface from
 tlie outer margin of the current ; and it is by this agency alone that the

 resistance througliout the length of surface is so little reduced as these ex--

'periments prove: though, on the other hand, it seems to me certain that

 unlimited elongation of surface must nevertheless be accompanied by an all
 hut unlimited reduction of resistance. At least it appears impossible to con-

 ceive a system of eddies such as to bring undisturbed particles across a current
 of unlimited width into close proximity with the surface, and in such quick suc-
 cession, as a sustained scale of resistance would imply.

     Practically, however, although these experiments do not directly deal with
 surfaces of greater length than 50 feet, i\iej aff'ord data sufficient to enable us

 to predict with tolerable certainty the resistance of surfaces of such lengths as

 are commouly met with in ships. For it is at once seen that, at a lengtli of
 50 feet, the decrease (with increasing length) of the friction per square foot
 of every additional length is so small that it wUl make no very great difference
in our estimate of the total resistance of a surface three hundred feet long,
whether we assume such decrease to continue at the same rate throughout
the last two hundred and fifty feet of the surface, or to cease entirely after
fifty feet ; while it is in eff'ect certain that the truth must lie somewhere
 between these two assumptions.

TiTE Committee on the Nomenclature of Dynamical and Electrical Units have

circulated numerous copies of their last year's Report among scientific men
both at home and abroad.

    They believe, however, that, in order to render their recommendations
fully available for science teaching and scientific work, a full and jiopular
exposition of the whole subject of physical imits is necessary, together with
a collection of examples (tabular and otherwise) illustrating the application

 of sj'stematic units to a variety of phj'sical measurements. Students usually
find peculiar difficulty in questions relating to units ; and even the experi-

enced scientific calculator is glad to have before him concrete examples with
which to compare his own results, as a security against misapprehension or

mistake.

    Some members of the Committee have been preparing a small volume of

illustrations of the C. G. S. system [Centimeti-e-Gramme-Second system]
intended to meet this want.

ing to about -04 of the pressure due to

the speed. If, however, the end of the

pipe be not very exactly flush with the

plane, this positive pressure is increased

when the rearward edge is the projecting

part (fig. 2), and is diminished, or even                   4lДMmWДl

becomes negative, when the position is

reversed (fig. 3). If the end of the pipe

is flush with the plane, but has its in-

ternal edge slightly rounded off (fig. 4),
the positive pressure caused by motion of

the plane very nearly disappears.

If the end of the pipe be closed by a

disk forming a smooth flush end with a

small aperture in it (fig. 5), there is no

appreciable positive pressure caused by

the motion of the plane ; nor is positive or

negative pressure caused when this disk

forms a slight angle with the line of

motion, whether facing forward or facing

sternward (figs. 6 & 7), unless the angle

is considerable (say some five degrees or

so), a very much larger angle than pro-

duced considerable effect of this kind with

the open-mouthed pipe.

The pipe with which these results were

obtained was about ^ inch diameter, and

the speeds used ranged from 280 to 600

feet per minute.

(2) In a cylindrical tube projecting into

the fluid at right angles to the line of

motion, with the end closed but with a

hole in the side, the angle of position of

the neutral point, referred (that is to say,

measured circumforentially from the fore-

most side of the cylinder) to the point

where the pressure is not affected by the

motion, depends considerably upon the

relative diameter of the tube and the hole

in it. The greater the relative diameter

of the hole, the greater is the angle of

position of the neutral point. Thus the

angle of position of the neutral point in a

tube I'l inch external diameter, having

a jL-inch diameter hole, seems about

40*^-5                   that of the same tube with a hole
                      ;

zpg inch diameter is about 43░ ; and that of a tube g inch diameter, with
a hole j^j- inch diameter, is about 45░-5.

   The position of the neutral point Avas also in these experiments sensiblj'
affected by some iinknowu condition, dependent apparently upon the degree
of projection of the tube into the fluid, and which I tliink may possibly have
been of the nature of a vibration of the tube. Of this I will here merely
say further that it prevented a precise detei-mination of the degree to which
the neutral angle is affected by close proximity of the hole to the end of the

tube.

   (3) The maximum positive pressure (which was obtained, of course, with

the hole pointing directly in the line of motion) falls slightly short of that
theoretically due to the speed, and is apparently unaffected either by the size
of the tube or of the hole in it. It appears also to be unaffected by the

above-mentioned unknown condition, being practically identical under all
conditions, except when the hole approaches close to the end of the tube
(within, say, a distance equal to the diameter of the tube), in which case the

pressure is found to diminish.

   (4) For some distance on either side of the neutral point the pressure
decreases nearly uniformly, with uniform increments in the angular departure
of the hole from the line of motion. The rate of decrease is about -04 of the

maximum positive pressure for every degree of angle. At angles of more

than 50░ the column was always unsteady, and it was impossible to obtain
accurate measui'es of it; but the observations show consistently a maxi-

mum of negative pressure at somewhere about 70░, and then a decrease

of between one third and one half of the maximum negative pressure
between 70░ and 90░. From 90░ to 180░ the negative pressure remains about

uniform*.

   The amounts of these negative pressures, besides being, as already men-

tioned, rather indefinite in consequence of the fluctuations of the columu,

are sensibly affected bj* the unknown condition already referred to, and

therefore it is impossible to speak positively as to their absolute amount.

   A(5) hole in the stopped end, instead of in the side, of the pressure-

tube (the tube being set as in the experiment for side pressiu-e) gives a con-
siderable negative pressure, varying in amount according to the position of
the hole in the disk which closes the eud of the tube. In the case tried,
the tube was l-l inch external diameter, the hole was J^ diameter, and

was eccentric in the disk by about half the radius of the tube. It was
tried at a speed of G feet per second, corresponding with a direct pressure of
и56 foot; and the negative pressure recorded when the hole was nearest the

forward edge was '64 foot. When it was 180░ from this position (i. e. nearest

to the rearward edge) the negative pressure was -29 foot ; and this appeared

to be the position of minimum negative pressure. The maximum negative

pressure observed was -67 foot, and was at 45░ from the foremost position.
At 90░ it was -64 foot, and at 135░ was -41 foot.

    I proceed to describe the principal features of the apparatus, and the mode

of trying the experiments.

    The fundamental parts are as follows :

   * The diagram, Plate XIV., shows the pressure for all angles between 0' and 180' undin'
three of the difterent conditious tried. The carves thus presented, between 0' and the
neutral angle, somewhat resemble curves of sines. The degree of resemblance is indicated
by the companion lines shown in fainter dots, and which are true curves of sines. It may
be observed that the wider the neutral angle the greater is the departure from the com-
panion curve.

    The above-named elements are also the fundamental parts of the apparatus

used in the experiments which I am carrying out for the Admiralty in the

investigation of the resistances of ship-models of various forms at various

speeds.

    Por the purpose of the present experiments, there was attached to the
truck an additional apparatus, represented in Plate XIII.

   It may be serviceable to observe at starting that, with a view to many

(pei'haps sufficiently obvious) points of convenience, the principle adopted
in the arrangement of the pressure-gauge is one in virtue of which it might

--be termed a " sympiezometer " the variations of pressure to be recorded

being, however, not those of the atmosphere, but those of the pressure of
the water on the open end of the instrument, that is to say, on the pressure-
hole. It is true that were the pressure of the atmosphere to vary during any
individual " run," that variation would enter into the result ; but this is

a condition which, because of its inevitably infinitesimal character, may be

 safely left out of the account.

    The following references will assist in explaining the arrangement.

justed vertically (so as to vary the depth of immersion of the pressure-
hole) and circumfereutiaUy (so as to allow the hole to be presented in
any required direction relative to the line of motion). The pipe leads

        out of tlie Icncr part of the hollow or chamber in the nozzle, so that

        any bubbles of air which may enter the pressure-pipe become im--

        pounded in the iippcr part of the hollow, instead of rising in the

        pressure-pipe.

//. The pressure-pipe. The pipe here shown is the largest of those used,

        and it is in the lowest possible position. The range of vertical adjust-

r/ <i.  ment is indicated by dotted lines.

        A disk 16 inches in diameter, divided to degrees, and, by a vernier, giving

        --tenths of degrees, fixed to the lower of the two collars in which the

        arbor slides the collar, namely, in which the arbor is clamped so as to

        define its level. The collar, with the divided disk attached to it, can

        be clamped in any required circumferential position, so as to secure the

        pressure-hole in the required position relatively to the line of motion.

h li. The glass index-tube, forming a connexion between the pressure-pipe

        and the vacuum-chamber, and provided with scale for reading the level

        at which the water stands.

j j. Tlie vacuum-chamber. The required degree of exhaustion is pro-
       duced in it by the descending leg of a siphon. It is connected at the

        top with the external air by a vertical india-rubber pipe, and with the

        siphon by a horizontal one, either of which can at pleasure be closed

        air-tight bj' a clamp.

The7.- /.-.  siphon,  consisting of  a  water-chamber and a descending pipe.

        The lower end of this pipe is turned upwards, and is closed by a cork

        while the siphon-chamber is being charged with water through an

        aperture with screwed stopper at the top. "When the chamber is fully

        charged, the cork is removed and the water descends, raising the column

        on the other side above the top of the glass tube. The india-rubber

        connexion with the vacuum-chamber is then closed, and air is admitted

        to the latter through the india-rubber pipe at the top, until the water

        assumes a convenient zero-level. The vacuum-chamber is effectually

        "jacketed" with paraffine, so that changes of atmospheric temperature

       do not rapidly aiFect its interior.

A1 1. plane surface or deck (of thin board, 14x 19 inches) for restraining

        the surface of the water, so as to prevent the formation of waves and

        the consequent dissipation of pressure, and give additional stiff"ness to

        the pipe and the arbor which carries it. The deck is securely bracketed

        to a pair of transverse bars, carried by vertical slides which are attached

        to the side-frame of the truck, and which are firmly clamped when the

        deck is brought to the required level. The brackets which carry the

        deck can be adjusted on transverse bars, and are finally clamped to them

        (like the saddle of the rest on the bed of the lathe) when the deck has

        been duly adjusted to the pipe. The drawing shows the deck as fixed

        at its working immersion.

        As the hole in the deck is necessarily large enough to admit the

        largest pipe, and as it is convenient that the fit should be easy while

        the adjustments are being made, each pipe is provided with a detached

        stout plate through which it slides with a close fit,, and which by a

        suitable arrangement is firmly clamped to the deck and blocked by

и wedges on all sides so as to support the pipe effectually, and, morc-

, over, prevent the admission of air behind the pipe, which at high speeds

        would affect the negative pressure in the rear. To exclude the air with

        still greater certainty, a " wall " of tin encloses the sides and rear of

        the tube above the plate (acting as a water-trap), so that the hole through

                                                                                   s2

       whicli the pipe passes shall be always gorged with water when the
       apparatus is in motion. Thus the leakage, if any, which the suction
       in the rear of the pipe creates is satisfied by water instead of air.

m m m. The brackets, transverse bars, and vertical slides, forming an adjust-

        able framework.

   The details of these arrangements will be readily understood by inspecting

the drawing, including figs. 2 & 3 (Plate XIII.),

    In the tabulated statement of experimental results (p. 261), the diameter
of the tube used, the diameter of the pressure-hole, its level above the end
of the tube, and the immersion of the end of the tube below the surface of
the water are fully stated.

    It is obvious that, under the arrangement described, the changes of pres-
sure indicated by the rise and fall of the water in the glass tube include not
only that due to the difference in the height of the column, but also that due
to the small variation in the tension of the air within what has been called the
" vacuum-chamber." This circumstance has to be taken account of in the
interpretation of the observed results, and involves a calculation, which,
however, is readily made, in terms of the ratio of the diameter of the glass
tube to the capacity of the vacuum-chamber. Taking account of the

dimensions of the parts, the correction is made by adding 15 per cent, to the
observed change of column. This correction has been made throughout in
framing the table, and the figures there given may be accepted as expres-
sing the true pressures in terms of head of water at about the temperature

of 60░ Fahr.

    The adaptation of what has been called the water-deck was found to be
absolutely necessary after a few preliminary trials had been made without it.
Indeed, as the depth to which the pressure-pipe could be immersed was of

course limited, it had from the first been a question how far the jjressures

--on the apertures would be affected by the proximity of the free surface of

the water since the natural stream-line forces, which would have existed
in their completeness had the immersion been of unlimited depth, would
inevitably tend to resolve themselves, to some extent, into some kind of wave-
motion or surface-disturbance ; and the first few preliminary trials led to the
suspicion that this cause was producing effects of tangible magnitude, and to
the belief that they might become very great at high speeds : a trial was
therefore made at a speed of 900 feet per minute.

    The effect of this speed was so remarkable as to deserve notice, if only as
affording a striking exhibition of some of the forces inherent in stream-line

action.

    The end of the pipe was immersed 21 inches, the pipe being 1| inch in

diameter.

    Immediately in front of the pipe, and embracing its anterior surface, the
water rose in a thin sheet, which was shattered on the underside of the
divided disk. In the immediate rear of the pipe the exact state of the water-
surface could not be very clearly discerned, because the conoidal sheet of water
which shot upwards from the sides of the inpe, and was broken up by the
framing of the truck, fell in such a " heavy rain" as to obscure the view;
probably, however, the water-surface was opened in a deep "gash" nearly
to the fuU depth of the tube's immersion.

    The most striking phenomenon was that which appeared at a small distance
sternward " in the wake."

    At about 3 feet astern of the tube the " gash " had become closed by

the gradual meeting'of the side streams which had bounded it : from tliis point

to about 7 or 8 feet further sternwards there rose vertically a central wall

of water, the crest of which, in its side elevation, had a parabolic form (as

far as could be estimated by the eye), the highest part of the ridge being

certainly over 2 feet above the natural water-level ; its sectional form was
tolerably discernible when it was looked at endways, and was not unhke that

of an ordinary fountain issuing from a circular orifice ; the thickness increased
as the upward velocity lessened, till at the crest the water spread laterally in a
kind of mushroom form, and fell in streams on either side. These streams

in side view formed ragged sheets, through which the central wall of water

could be seen at intervals.

   The disarrangement of forces which at high speeds took so intensified a
form would of course produce results of sensible magnitude at smaller speeds

but it seemed that a tolerably effective remedy would be supplied by the

application of the water-deck which has been already described.
   This was so arranged that the depth of its immersion could be varied

within moderate limits. If too little immersed it would not suificiently re-

strain the surface-disturbances, or might allow the intrusion of air. If too

deeply immersed it might produce stream-line forces of its own, though its
under surface was plane from end to end and truly horizontal. Eventually

it was found to produce least disturbance when its underside was immersed

about g of an inch, and at this level it was maintained during the subse-
quent experiments. The area of the deck was 19 inches in length and

14 inches in width.

   One valuable purpose which the deck served was to give additional steadi-
ness to the tube. Some collateral experiments showed distinctly that the

pressure in a long tube of small diameter underwent most abnormal dis-

turbances                                      and  though  it  can  hardly  be  said with  confidence  that  tremor
                                            ;

would account for these, it is the only condition which suggests itself as a

possibly relevant " vera causa ;" and even in the experiments which are

reported, there are certain discordances which may possibly be attributable

to the same cause, though the tubes used were stiff and were pretty rigidly

held at tlie deck level : the discordances or unintelligible differences were

felt, not in the maximum pressure delivered on an aperture exactly facing

the line of motion, but in the pressure exhibited in the experiments relative

to the position of the neutral point and to the negative pressures.

   In performing each experiment the aperture was set in the required direc-
tion and the apparatus clamped. The zero of the pressure-scale was brought

to a convenient level according as a negative or positive pressure was to be
expected. The zero was recorded ; and the mean height attained by the Avater
in the tube was also recorded when the steady speed was attained.

    Partly because time did not permit the extended variation of conditions
which was desired, partly because, at higher speeds, increase of tremor (or of

the unknown cause of irregiilarity whatever it may be) was to be aj^prc-

hended, the speed adopted throughout the tabulated experiments was 360 feet

per minute.

After these explanations, the details of the tabulated statement must be

allowed to speak for themselves. It does not, however, contain the record

of the experiments with the pipe-end flush with the underside of the deck,

or of those made with the hole in the stopped end of the ordinary pressure-

tube, because the particulars were not readily reducible to the form of the
table. The results were therefore fully stated in the prefatory matter.

   The series of experiments requires extension in many directions which

are at once obvious : one of the most important of these is tliat which
relates to the effect experienced by a pressure-tube Avhen arran?,-ecl as a log,
from the stream-line disturbances which the passage of a ship's hull intro-
duces into the relative speeds of the water surrounding the various parts of

the hidl.

    It is hoped that this latter investigation, and perhaps all the others that

are required, may be introduced as part of the series of experiments on
the forms of ships which I am conducting hero for the Admiralty, since the

two subjects are inherently and closely relate^ to each other. But the

introduction of the experiments now reported has under present circumstances

been, in effect, an interruption ; and though the interruption was permitted,
it has been carried to the full limits of the permission.

    Incomplete as the experiments are, they tend, I fear, to confirm rather
than to dissipate the difficulties which have to be overcome before the pressure-
log can be accepted as supplying the greatly desired object, an independent

and self-justifying measure of a ship's speed.
   The inventors whose plans have been before the Committee have, I believe,

felt the difficulties forcibly. Mr. Berthon* and Mr. Napier have indeed
expressed their belief that it was unsurmounted, perhaps unsurmountable.

   The foremost of the difficulties to be overcome is that of finding a self-

justifying zero of the pressure-scale.

' This, primd facie, might have been supplied by either of three condi-

tions :

    (1) The determination of the position of neutral pressure.

   (2) The determination of the position of maximum negative pressure, and
            the ratio of this to the maximum positive pressure.

   (3) The determination of the ratio of the negative pressure, in the region

                of tolerably uniform negative pressure in the rear of the tube, to

             the maximum positive pressure.

   With regard to the former of these conditions, the present experiments

show, I think, conclusively that the position of the neutral point is governed
by conditions which it is difficult to count on with certainty ; or if this diffi-

culty be surmounted at all, it only can be by much laborious investigation

there remains the circumstance that the neutral point is placed exactly where

the pressure is changing with maximum rapidity in terms of angle of posi-

tion ; so that any small error in taking account of the governing conditions
will produce the greatest relative amount of error in the working zero from

which the pressures are counted.
    Thus the very elegant and instructive proposition as to the existence of

this neutral point at a little over 40░ from the line of motion, which
Mr. Berthon discovered and determined with approximate exactness, and
announced long before the promulgation of the doctrine of stream-lines had
shown that such a point should exist nearly in that position, appears to

involve special difficulty in its utilization as the basis of a pressure zero.

   And difficulties hardly less serious in amount attach themselves to the

determination of the two other conditions which have been referred to, though

it is no doubt true that subsequent examination may determine with

sufficient exactness the conditions which govern the relation of the negative

pressure in the rear of the tube, to the positive pressure in front of it, in

such a manner that the causes of uncertain variation may be excluded, and

   * Mr, Berthon has since informed me that I have rather overstated his opinion on this

 point.
                              --

that the entire disturbance of pressure may be capable of definite inter-

pretation.

If this can be accomplished so that in effect a worliing zero can be esta-

blished, the only difficulty remaining to be encountered is the collateral one

which arises from the motions impressed by the passage of the ship on the

fluid which she displaces ; this too, however, may prove not altogether

intractable.

   Apart from the unexpected variations in results the general character of

which had been already known, the only new results which have been brought

out by these experiments have been those which relate to the state of

pressure at the end of the pressure-tube, whether (1) it project into the
water in the usual manner, or (2) be cut off absolutely flush with the sur-
face through which it issues.

The fact that in the former case the area of the pipe-end when stopped is

covered (so to speak) with negative jjressures which are of considerable

amount, and which vary largely within a limited area, only serves to show

that this part of the tube cannot be usefully applied to the purposes of the log.

myEut the fact that (contrary, I own, to  previous belief), in the latter

case, the pressure seems to be almost absolutely neutral, whether the end of

the tube be stopped with a perforated plane or be wholly open, suggests the

hope that here also might bo found a tolerably sound basis for a working zero

of pressure. Doubtless the use of it would be exposed to one important ob-

--jection namely, that if a barnacle were to attach itself to the surface any-

where near the aperture, especially in front of it, the truthfulness of the zero
would be destroyed ; it is possible, too, that some causes of error might be
found to exist in the "drag" of the eddies in the belt of water disturbed
by the friction of the ship's surface. Nevertheless the idea that a trust-

worthy zero may be obtained on this basis, suggests itself as one deserving

of consideration and inquiry.

liothing in these experiments, however, tends at all to disparage the value

of an instrument based on the principle which has been investigated, if
the instrument be regarded as one the scale of which has to be inter-
preted by special experiment after it has been fitted to the ship in which
its indications are to be made use of; and although in some respects its
value would have been considerably greater if its scale could have been

regarded as self-interpreting and self-justifying, yet, even under the prac-
tical limitation which has been referred to, the instrument, if well organized,
must be regarded as possessing the highest practical usefulness.

had not been published when your Committee agreed to their last Report,

appeared shortly afterwards, and contained recommendations almost entirely
identical with the anticipations of your Committee.

    2. These recommendations were so fully considered by your Committee in

their last Report, that they think it unnecessary to refer again to the subject
beyond expressing their regret at finding, from the printed and published
evidence taken by the Select Committee, that its recommendations were not

at all in accordance with such parts of that evidence as your Committee deem
the most trustworthy and valuable.

    3. The delay in the meeting of Parliament, occasioned by the General
Election and change of Ministry, made your Committee believe that it would
be inexpedient for them to attempt any amendment of the ' Wild-Birds Pro-
tection Act' during the late Session.

   4. In the House of Lords the Earl De la "Warr introduced a BiU intituled
"An Act for the more effectual protection of Wild Birds during the Breeding-
Season," the principal feature of which was to render penal the taking of

certain birds' eggs. This Bill was not based on any of the recommendations

of the Select Committee of the Hoi;se of Commons (] 873), and stiU less on

any suggestions which have ever proceeded from your Committee.

   5. Lord De la Warr's Bill was withdrawn ; and your Committee take this

opportunity of declaring their belief that the practice of birds'-nesting is and

has been so much followed in England that no Act of Parliament, except one

of the most severe character, could stop it ; while any enactment of that kind
would, by filling the gaols with boys (often of a tender age), excite a strong
and universal feeling of hostility against all measures for the protection of in-

digenous animals, even among many of those who are at present favourably

disposed to it.

   G. Your Committee believe that tlie effect of birds'-nesting on such kinds
of birds as are known to be diminishing in numbers is altogether inappreci-
able, while its effect on those whose numbers are not decreasing may be safely
disregarded, and consequently that there is no need of any legislation inter-
fering with the practice. They again repeat their conviction that the only
practicable mode of checking the diminution of such birds as have been
proved to be decreasing, is the effectual protection of the adults from destruc-

tion during the breeding-season.

   7. Your Committee find that while the Sea-Birds Preservation Act continues
to work successfully, being not only popular but also effective in its operation,
the Wild-Birds Protection Act has done little if any thing towards attaining
the objects for which it was passed, and in various quarters still gives consider-

able discontent.

   8. Your Committee have once more to point out, as they have done in
former Reports, that the birds commonly known as " WildEowl" are subject
to very great persecution through the inadequacy of the present law to pro-
tect them, that they are rapidly decreasing in number, and that they are not

only perfectly innocuous but of great value as food. Consequently your

Committee trust that the efforts they hope to make in behalf of "Wild Fowl

in the next Session of Parliament will obtain a very general support.
    9. Representations as to the inordinate slaughter of Seals which takes

place every spring in the North-Atlantic Ocean have been made to some
Members of your Committee. There can be no doubt that such slaughter
carried on at that season, and with increasing activity, will soon bring these

proper protection seems to be a subject not at all unworthy of the considera-
tion of Her Majesty's Government. Tour Committee, however, are of opiniou
 that the subject is one lying beyond tlie powers entrusted to them, since the
Seals of the North Atlantic can in no sense be termed " Indigenous Animals,"
and accordingly refrain from offering any other remark upon it.

    10, Your Committee respectfully request their reappointment.

Report of the Committee, consisting of Lord Houghton, Professor Tho-

   ROLD Rogers, W. Newmarch, Professor Fawcett, M.P., Jacob

    Behrens, p. p. Fellows, R. H. Inglis Palgrave, Archibald
    Hamilton, and Samuel Brown, Professor Leone Levi (Secretary),
    appointed to inquire into the Economic Effects of Combinations of
   Labourers and Capitalists, and into the Laws of Economic Science
    bearing on the principles on which they are founded.

YoTjR Committee, appointed to inquire into the economic effects of combina-
tions of labourers or capitalists, and into the laws of economic science bearing
on the principles on which such combinations are founded, beg to report as

--foUows :

    Public attention has for a considerable time past been directed to the ex-

tensive prevalence of combinations both among labourers and capitalists in nearly
all the principal trades and industries, to the frequent conflicts which have
occurred between employers and employed, and the strikes and lock-outs
which have followed. And alreadj^ several public inquiries have been insti-
tuted on the subject in its general bearings. In 1854 a Conference on strikes
and lock-outs was held at the Society of iVvts, when the first point of discus-

--sion was " Combinations are they objectionable, whether set on foot by em-

ployers or employed, as a means of influencing the Value of Labour?" In
1859, the Council of the Social Science Association appointed a Committee
for the purpose of reporting on the objects and constitution of trade- societies,
with their effects upon wages and upon the industry and commerce of the
country ; and their report is extremely valuable for the vast amount of infor-
mation it conveys, as well as for the lessons it contains. In 1866 Her Ma-
jesty's Government appointed a Eo^-al Commission to iuqiiire into and report
on the organization and rules of trade-unions and other associations, whether
of workmen or employers, and to inquire into and report on the effects pro-
duced by such trade-unions and associations on the workmen and employers
respectively, and on the relations between workmen and employers, and on the
trade and industry of the country. These reports, together with the extensive
literature which has accumulated on the subject, furnish sufficient materials
for arriving at a sound judgment on the questions submitted for consideration

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

nevertheless it is too e\ndent that the economic bearings of the question at
issue are as yet but insufficiently appreciated, especially by the parties most

interested in the question. It were, indeed, much to be desired that the rela-
tions of capital and labour were put on a more satisfactory footing than they
now appear to be placed ; and your Committee trust that they may render some

practical service to the contending parties, if they are able to test the claims
urged by either employers or employed by reference to the sound principles
of political economy. Generally speaking, the objects of trade-unions are

twofold. In their character as friendly societies they afford relief to the
members of the imions "when incapacitated from work by accidents or sickness,
and they provide superannuation allowances for members whenincapacitated by

old age, as well as a sum for the funeral expenses of the members or their wives.
As ivorkmen's protection societies, trade-unions endeavour to promote the in-
terest of workmen in matters of wages and hours of labour, to bring about a
more equal division of work among the members of the union, and, if needful,
to create a monopoly of labour with its attendant powers to command a
higher rate of wages. The means used for such purposes are ordinarily the
enforcement of rules limiting the number of apprentices to be allowed in a trade,
excluding from work, as far as possible, workmen not belonging to the union,
and prohibiting the employment of boys to do work which ought to be done by

men. Wliilst the employed have thus organized themselves into trade-unions,

the employers have likewise resorted to concerted action in many forms.

    Often do they combine in order to regulate the prices of sale of any com-
modity, as the ironmasters are wont to do. Often do they combine in getting
privileges for themselves ; but the most signal instance of recent combinations
among employers is the constitution of a specific society for the protection of

their interests.

   The National Pederation of Associated Employers of Labour, recently orga-
nized in Manchester, is a defensive organization by the employers of labour

to resist the designs of trade-unions, so far as they are hostile to the interests
of employers, the freedom of non-unionist operatives, and the well-being of
the community.

    Although, however, the general object of such combinations, whether of
capitalists or labourers, is well known, both from the written rules which bind
them together and from the action they have taken from time to time, your
Committee have deemed it desirable to ascertain, by personal contact with

some representative men from both classes, whether they do now stand by the
rules of their unions, and how far they are prepared to defend them. For

this purpose your Committee resolved to hold a consultative private conference
of employers and employed, not exceeding six or seven on each side, in the
presence of the members of the Committee, and under the presidency of Lord
Houghton, for the purpose of discussing the questions involved in the resolu-
tion of the British Association, and with a view of reporting thereon to the

same. The conference was accordingly held on the 19th of May last in the
rooms of the British Association, 22 Albemarle Street, when the questions

more especially discussed were :

   1st. What determines the minimum rate of wages ?
   2nd. Can that minimum rate be uniform in any trade ? and can that uni-

formity be enforced ?

    3rd. Is combination capable of affecting the rate of wages, M'hether in fa-
TOiir of employers or employed ?

   4th. Can an artificial restriction of labour or of capital bo economically
right or beneficial under any circumstances ?

   And for the discussion of these questions your Committee had the advan-

tage of bringing together a deputation from the National Federation of Asso-
ciated Employers of Labour, including Messrs. li. R. Jackson, M. A. Brown,
H. E. Greg, .Joseph Simpson, J. A. Marshall, E. Hannen, and Henry Whit-

--worth. As representing laboiir : Messrs. Henry Broadhurst, Daniel Guile,

donald, M.P., and Mr. Burt, M.P., having been prevented from attending,

And on the part of your Committee there were Lord Houghton, Professor

Rogers, Mr. Samuel Brown, Mr. A. Hamilton, Mr. Frank Fellows, and Pro-
fessor Leone Levi.

    The discussion at the conference was carried on in the most friendly spirit,
and, in the opinion of your Committee, with manifest utility towards tlie
elucidation of the questions at issue. From the employers your Committee
have, moreover, received valuable written answers to their inquiries ; whilst
the ' Beehive,' the principal organ of the employed, said of the Conference,
" The case was stated with great frankness, and the attack and defence was
carried on in perfect good humour for three hours ; and whether any
conviction on either side was altered or not, it was proved very distinctly
that such meetings, if held more frequently, could not fail to beget a clearer
view of the questions in dispute on both sides, and a stronger disposition

than now exists to arrange differences in a friendly and peaceable spirit.

We do not know whether it would be within the province of the Com-

mittee of the British Association to call a series of meetings composed of men

from each side competent to deal with the question in dispute, where they

Amight be taken seriatim and thoroughly inquired into and discussed.

series of such meetings would prepare the ground for some practical work,

such as would bring into reconcilement the reasonable and fair men and lovei's
of peace on both sides." Your Committee have not been able to exhaust the

inquiry on the poiots of dispute between employers and employed, nor to
enter into any suggestion of a remedial character on which the opinion both

of employers and employed would be extremely useful. And under such
circumstances your Committee have decided not to make a final report on the

present occasion, but to recommend the reappointment of the Committee of
the same members as it stands, with power to add to their number, with in-
structions to renew the conferences already inaugurated between employers
and employed, and to report on the general question ; and your Committee re-
commend that another grant of Б25 be made for the purpose of such inquiries.

   Dredging on the Coasts of Durham and North Yorkshire. Draion
   up by David Robertson and George Stewardson Brady.

The dredging off the coasts of Durham and North Yorkshire, provided for by

a grant from the British Association last year, was carried out during the

Aweek beginning on the 13th of July,  suitable steam-vessel was engaged,

and being on the whole favoured by the weather, we dredged every day imtil

the 18th inclusive.  During two days the Eev. A. M. Norman accompanied us
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;

we were indebted to him for valuable assistance in naming some of our speci-

mens, as well as for kindly undertaking to report on some sections of the work.

On two days out of the six the sea was too rough to allow of the dredges

being worked very successfully, and one dredge was unfortunately lost by

getting fast on hard ground while a verj'^ strong tide was running ; but with

these exceptions the work was carried out satisfactorily. The dredging

ranged from near Tynemouth on the north, to Scarborough on tlie south,

the water varying in depth from 20 to 45 fathoms, the greater portion of

the time being devoted to a belt (known to fishermen as the inner " fishing

bank ") lying from 4 to 8 miles from the shore. One day, however, was spent

afc the gi'cater distance of 30 to 40 miles from shore, and another day at a
distance of about 17 miles.

   Time has not allowed of any thing more than safely to preserve and arrange

our captures. On a future occasion we hope to give a full account of the

results obtained.

Report 0)1 Obsei-vations of Luminous Meteors during the year 1873-74,

Observatory, Greenwich, R. P. Greg, F.G.S., F.R.A.S., C. Brooke,

The appearances of meteors noticed in published journals, and otherwise

ascertained by the Committee during the past year, include some striking

cxiimples of such remarkable exhibitions discussed and investigated very

ably by astronomers, as well as of others passing almost unobserved excepting

Aby accidental gazers.                                      few such large meteors were doubly observed in

England                                         some  have  been  visible  in  the  daytime, while  many other  large

and small fireballs have been described to the Committee, of which it is to be

regretted that notices have hitherto only reached them from single observers.

The months in which these phenomena have been most abundant were Sep-

tember, December, and January last, April, June, and again quite recently the

last few days of July and beginning of August in this year. The Keport con-

tains descriptions of the brightest of these meteors, and an account of Prof,

Galle's calculations and inquiries regarding the real course of a large meteor

which passed over Austria on the 17th of June, 1873, with the probable

path that he assigns to it. With the exception of those of Khairpur, India, in

September, and Yidiu, Turkey, in May last, no occurrence of a fall of aero-

lites, as far as the Committee is aware, has taken place during the past year.

The annual star-showers have been watched for with the usual attention

of observers in correspondence with the Committee, and the results of their

combined observations are described, with accounts of some other occasional

star-showers, at some length in the descriptive part of the Report. Although

little important information was thus added this year to our present know-

ledge of the well-known star-showers of January, April, and October, and

the cometaiy meteor-streams of November 14 and 27, connected with

Temple's and with Biela's comet (aU of which, in spite of very favourable

weather for their observation, were this year of not very conspicuous appear-

ance), yet the fluctuating intensities of these showers at their successive

periodic dates is an important element to record ; and in the case of the star-
showers of August 10th and December 12th of the past year, the watch was

at least attended with more positive success. Duplicate observations of

meteors were obtained in them, and the general centre of divergence of each

of these two meteor-currents was pretty exactl}' ascertained. Bright meteors

were more frequent on each of these two nights than is at all usual in ordi-

nary exhibitions of those showers. It will be found among these observa-

tions that the return of Biela's meteor-shower on the 27th of November last

disappointed expectation ; and the small extent and rapid departure of that

meteor-cloud from the earth's neighbourhood is clearly shown by its visibility
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

as a star-shower only for a single year. The duplicate ohservations described
in former Reports have been reduced at the request of the Committee by Mr.
T. H. Waller, whose report of these calculations is added, and whose con-
clusions of their real heights and velocities are without doubt very accurate
and complete.

   The publication of Captain Tupman's observations of shooting-stars in the
Mediterranean during the years 1869-71, with the list of radiant-points
obtained from them, shown on a pair of convenient charts, or plates accom-
panying them, by Captain Tupman (recommended for immediate consider-
ation of the Committee during the last two years), is now brought to a close
and the catalogue and charts have been sent to astronomers and correspon-
dents of the Committee in England, abroad, and in America ; and discussions
of them in foreign scientific journals have appeared, showing the important
light in which the appearance of this valuable new meteor-catalogue has
been regarded. Its principal pai-t, the comparative catalogue of his meteor-
showers with those of other observers, and the charts on which they are
Ijrojected, are presented in this Eeport, with Dr. Schmidt's similar catalogue
(the remaining two principal meteor-shower lists, of which no account has

yet appeared at full length in these Reports), thus placing before readers of
recent volumes of these Reports all the material contributions to this branch

of meteoric astronomy that have yet been made. They are summed up in a
very concise catalogue contained in this Report by Mr. Greg, who has

selected (to corroborate such observations already published in his former
lists) the greater part of Dr. Schmidt's and Captain Tupman's observations,

and has included them with his own former coUectious, thus forming a very
extended catalogue founded on all the similar work of his contemporaries, and

omitting but few general meteor-showers from his copious list, observed chiefly
by Dr. Neumaj-er in the southern hemisphere.

    Following the method of Dr. Weiss, of calculating the radiant-points of
those comets of early and recent times whose orbits are believed to pass near
the earth, a list of such comets for both the northern and southern hemi-
spheres is annexed to Mr. Greg's catalogue, and the cases where they corro-

borate each other are pointed out. Many important and well-known comets

are found to have modern meteor-showers as their present representatives, as
would perhaps be still more apparent if more reliable data of their orbits
could be used ; but the numerous coincidences are yet striking enough and
sufficiently exact to make the further cultivation of cometary astronomy by
the help of star-shower observations perhaps within the easy reach of ordinary
watchers, who wUl continue for that end to delineate meteor-fliglits observed
on fine nights among the well-surveyed fields of the fixed stars and their

constellations.

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  271

on Large Meteors and Aerolites, yet the careful investigation of its real patli
and of its orbit round tlie sun made by Dr. Galle and by other German

astronomers, from the many exact observations that were obtained in their

neighbourhood of its appearance, render its description in the first place of

this Appendix especially appropriate. The meteor was seen in full twilight
at 8^ 46'" P.M., Ureslau mean time, about half an hour after sunset, skirting
the S.W. horizon at uo great altitude at Ereslau, and proceeding with very
little downward inclination westwards : by means of a meteoroscope Dr. Galle,
who saw the meteor at Breslau, obtained the exact places of two points on
the luminous streak which it left visible in the sky for more than a quarter
of an hour after the disappearance of the nucleus ; and an assistant at the
Observatory, who also saw it, accustomed to observe the time of flight of

ordinary shooting-stars, counted 9 seconds as the duration of the meteor's
flight from its fu-st appearance until the time of its explosion and extinction.
Dr. Weiss at Vienna, and Dr. Hornstein at Prague, communicated to Dr.
Galle equally valuable observations. In the pages of the ' Astronomische
Nachrichten ' (No. 1955) for September 1873, an exact calculation of the

meteor's real path by Prof. v. Messl, of Briinu, from ten or twelve excel-
lent descriptions of its course at places in Moravia and Bohemia (imme-
diately beneath or on the west side of the meteor's course), had appeared.
Dr. Galle observes that but for the unusual astronomical exactness of some
accounts, the particulars of which had reached him from Silesia and places
chiefly east of the meteor's course, it would have been superfluous to recalcu-
late the meteor's course by the new rigorous method which he proposed from
all the observed data, so perfectly did the observations collected, and the cal-
culations made from them by Prof. v. Niessl, establish the general character
of the meteor's course. Complete mathematical formulte are given by Dr.
GaUe, showing how, independent weights having first been assigned to the
positions given in the different observers' descriptions, the whole can be
combined together so as to furnish without very laborious calculation the
most probable path, and the amount of probable error of the determination
of the meteor's real course. Apart from these calculations, Dr. GaUe also
visited the locality in Oberlausitz, between Saxony and Bohemia, over which
the meteor appears to have exploded, and ascertained the correctness of this
supposition from the accounts of many observers who saw the meteor burst
there directly overhead. It has been conjectured by Dr. GaUe, in his in-
vestigation of the real path of the fireball and other interesting questions
relating to the shower of stones at Pultusk, near AVarsaw, on the 30th of
January, 1868 (see the volume of these Reports for 1868, p. 388), that the
so-called bursting into fragments, or " explosion," and the accompanying loud
reports seen and heard at the disappearance of large detonating or aerolitic
fireballs, arise from the expansion of compressed air before the meteorites at
the moment when their once planetary velocity is so arrested and diminished
by resistance as to allow sound-waves to start from them in all directions ; at
that time the intense illumination ceases and the largest fragments only pur-
sue their onward course, also shortly to become extinguished and to produce
louder and more violent reports than the smaller stones, from their greater
surface and exposure to compression of the air. Thus as each atom, grain,
or fragment of a stone-swarm, when it first enters the atmosphere, is
arrested in its flight, it yields up its light and planetary speed, and following
as a dull spark in the meteor's train, it marks the first moment of its fall
towards the earth under the mere influence of gravity alone by a more or less
audible explosion. To observers neax the point of disappearance of such
large meteors, the loudest explosions arising from the largest aerolites which
                                                                            ;

--273 REPORT 1874.

penetrate furthest are heard first like one or several cannon-shots, probably

indicating if there is only one or if there are more than one such large

aerolites included in the swarm. The smaller more distant detonations are

heard afterwards following the principal shots as a confused rattling sound,

generally compared to musketry or to the rattling and rolling sound of a near

peal of thunder. Such is shown both by telescopic examiuations and naked-

eye observations of the structure of many large fireballs, as well as by the

frequent occurrence of such showers of stones as those of Pultusk, Stannern,

or L'Aigle, where the largest stones are found leading the fall and the whole

area scattered over lies almost vertically below the point of explosion or dis-

appearance of the meteor.  Such was apparently the condition at Pultusk
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

and the height of 20| English statute miles above the earth's surface at

which the present meteor disappeared, resembling exactly that of the point

of disappearance of the Pultusk fireball, coupled with the fact that few or

no distinct explosions but, as generally described, a prolonged rattling sound

as of many small reports, lasting for nearly a minute, was produced by the

bursting of this meteor. Dr. Galle was prepared to hear in his inquiries on

the spot of some small aerolitic fragments having been discovered near the

place which he ascertained to be under the meteor's point of disappearance

but the ground was thickly clothed with grass and forests ; the hour of the

evening when the meteor appeared was already late, and the chance of their

observation or recovery, if any fell, was on these accounts extremely small*.

It is remarkable that perfectly authentic statements were received of the

deposition, soon after, or about the time of, the meteor's explosion over Zittau

and its neighbourhood, of a mass of melted and burning sulphur the size of a

man's fist, on the roadway of a village, Proschwitz, about 4 miles south of

Eeichenberg, where the meteor exploded nearly in the zenith. It was stamped

out by a crowd of the villagers, who could give no other explanation of its

appearance on the spot than that it had proceeded from the meteor ; on exa-

mination at Breslau some remnants of the substance proved to be pure

sulphur. With regard to the calculated course, the meteor must, however,

have passed quite 12 or 14 miles south-westwards from the place where this

event is said to have occurred ; and its questionable connexion with the

fireball is accordingly rendered very doubtfal from the great distance of the

locality from immediately below the meteor's course. In Ohladni's work on

Fiery Meteors and Stonefalls, only one similar instance is recorded, from

ancient chronicles, where burning sulphur fell at Magdeburg, of the size of a

man's fist, on the castle-roof at Loburg, IS miles from Magdeburg, in June of

the year 1642. The fact of this large fireball having deposited any stony or

other aerolitic matter cannot therefore yet be regarded as decidedly esta-

blished.

   The most remarkable circumstance connected with this meteor's real
course, both as calculated by Prof. v. Niessl and by Dr. GaUe, is that the
speed of its motion, combined with the calculated direction of its flight,
belong to an orbit round the sun which was decidedly hyperbolic. The
principal alteration of the real course found by Prof. v. Niessl, that was
introduced by the observations in Silesia, West Prussia, and Austria collected
by Dr. Galle, depended upon an excellent description of the meteor's first
appearance at Ilj'bnik and Eatibor, two towns in Upper Silesia, as well as on
equally certain positions obtained at the observatory and in the town of

   * Some accounts of a brownish dust Laving been seen falling, and of a deposit of line
yellow sand having been collected in its descent from the air, are contained in the original
descriptions ; but the evidence of these occurrences appears to have been too slight and

Breslau in the same province. At the former places the meteor first
appeared to emerge and separate itself from the disk of the planet Mars (then
southing, at no great altitude), and to pursue its way westwards, gradually
descending towards the horizon, where it disappeared behind a cloud. Dr.
Sage, who noted this appearance of the meteor at Eybnik, was looking
attentively at the planet Mars when he thus saw the meteor apparently issue
from it, and the planet appear as if it was breaking up and dividing into two
parts. After a first estimation, roughly stated at 20 seconds, Dr. Sage con-
sidered that the time occupied by the meteor's flight until it disappeared was
really not more than ten or twelve seconds. The observers at Ratibor, not
far from Eybnik, were equally positive of the meteor's first appearance " as if
issuing from the red star in the south;" and their average estimate of the
time of flight was reckoned to be 15| seconds ; one observer, however, espe-
cially able to judge correctly of the duration, would not admit that the
meteor occupied more than ten seconds in its flight. The time of flight
recorded by the assistant at the Breslau Observatory was, as above mentioned,
nine seconds for the whole period of the meteor's course. The point of dis-
appearance of this meteor being known with great exactness, and the obser-

vations of the earlier part of its flight being unusually accurate, the visible

track along which it shot over Hungary, Austria, Moravia, and Bohemia to
the mountain confines of the latter state with Saxony, is calculated with very
small probable errors by Dr. Galle.

Point of first appearance.

 meteor's visible flight of 15-5 seconds, from these accounts, gives the
 diminished meteor-speed marked (b) in the above Table ; no reason for further

 extending the possible time of the meteor's flight is in any way suggested by

 the scattered examples of less complete observations of its whole course and

 duration that appear among the accounts received by Dr. Galle from many

  other stations.

     Along this long track of nearly 300 miles the meteor increased gradually
 in size as it advanced, soon growing to the dimensions of a fireball of the
 largest class,' which it maintained until it disappeared. The nucleus was pear-

 shaped, tapering to a tail of red sparks, several degrees in length, following

 the head. Some described the nucleus as triple, consisting of three fireballs
 travelling together ; others saw jets of flame, accompanied by detached frag-

 ments, projected occasionaUy, giving the meteor the appearance of having a

 serpentine or wavy course. The prevailing colour of the meteor's light was

 white or yellowish ; but in front projecting tongues of red flame, and sparks
 like those emitted from burning iron, gave the light in the forward half of
 the nucleus a reddish cast, only the middle of the head or body of the meteor
 being white or yeUow. The following part of the head and some parts of
 the tail that shone brightest were distinctly green. The parts into which

--the meteor separated in bursting were numerous according to some of the

 descriptions " not descending vertically, but as if projected forwards." Two

Aor three of them appear to have been somewhat larger than the rest.

writer at Schreiberhau (SUesia ?) states that before reaching the horizon the
fireball divided itself into three smaller globes equally bright-coloured with
the first, which together travelled onwards in the same direction and then

disappeared. The rocket-like tail of red sparks exhibited by the meteor faded
away quickly, following the head ; but in about the last quarter of its visible
path a bright white very persistent light streak was left by the meteor on its
track. It was at first straight, brightest, according to some observers, at the
edges, as if hollow and cylindrical ; it siieedily, however, became curved and
zigzag, and separated itself into shining clouds, whose bright white was visible
in the sky for nearly half an hour. The time of the meteor's appearance
being at about a quarter before nine, and the time when the sun set below
the horizon of the meteor's point of explosion over Zittau, as found by Dr.
Galle, having been only at a quarter after nine o'clock, it follows that the
meteor-streak was exposed throughout the time of its visibility to the direct
rays of the setting sun, and the brightness of its white light as long as it
could be traced on the darkening background of the evening sky is thus

accounted for. AU the higher masses of the light streak had at the latter

time quite dissolved away, and the utmost period of visibility of its knots
and wisps as a distinguishable vapour does not appear to have exceeded half
an hour. Dr. Galle calculates that it extended from a height of about 37
miles at its commencement to a height of about 20 miles, the point of explo-

sion of the fireball ; with a real length, when first deposited, of about 69
miles, and a real diameter, taking that of the fireball (as seen by observers
40 or 50 miles from its path, about one third the apparent diameter of the
moon) as its least width, of not less than 230 yards. Its substance Dr.
Galle considers to have been either dust or volumes of still more finely

divided particles of smoke. Another question of great physical interest dis-
cussed in this paper is that of the time taken by the sounds of the reports to
reach observers, and the distances to which they were heard round the point

of explosion of the fireball. Erom the least of the time-intervals (about
1" 39' at Grossschonau) to the greatest calculated (at Neukirch, 4" 35')

OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  275

answering to distances of 20| and 57 miles respectively from the meteor's
bursting- place, the observations at about twenty stations arc on the whole
in perfect accordance with the supposition that the detonations and audible
reports of the meteor's explosion aU proceeded from the same point as that

of the termination of the meteor's course. If four exceptionally discordant
accounts are retained in the average, it appears as the result that the average

calculated interval of 2" 12" for the whole list of stations is exceeded by the
average of the observations themselves by 18 seconds, or by about 10 per
cent, of the real value ; this would easily be accounted for by the long duration
(in some cases about 1"") of the thunder-like echoes of the sound, to develop
and prolong which mountainous locahties would be particularly favourable
but if these four very discordant observations (all near the end point of the
meteor's course) are omitted, the remaining seventeen observations exhibit
no such retardation, and the average observed time-interval is identical with
that found by calculation of the observers' distances from the end point of

the meteor's course.

   The most important conclusion established by Dr. Galle's calculations is
one which Prof v. Niessl had already demonstrated independently, that the
orbit of the meteor-mass composing this fireball round the sun was neither
an ellipse nor a parabola, but an hyperbola. On entering into collision with
the earth's atmosphere and traversing its outer layers as shooting-stars and
fireballs, meteor grains and masses present different directions of motion

from those which they may be shown, by a proper treatment of the obser-

vations, to have had originally in their orbits. The causes of this difference
are of various kinds, some evident and considerable, and others for the most
part insensible in their effects ; but tables have been given by Professor
SchiapareUi for obtaining a meteor's real radiant-point in its orbit from that
presented by observers' descriptions of its apparent or atmospheric path,
whenever the latter is known exactly, and when the meteor's velocity is also
considered to be certainly determined. In such cases every influencing cir-
cumstance can be allowed for, whether it is the earth's own rapid motion in its
orbit, and its far less rapid rotation (especially in moderately high latitudes)
about its axis, making the meteor's motion as observed only relative to the
earth's centre (or surface when extreme accuracy is desired) instead of to
the sun and fixed stars, to whose sphere alone, before its collision with the
earth, the cosmical path of the meteorite properly belongs ; or whether it be
the earth's attraction causing the meteor to dip or descend more steeply as it
approaches, and at last plunges obliquely into the atmospheric ocean. As a
rifle-bullet fired horizontally over a level plain will strike it more and more
perpendicularly the less the force of the charge and the speed of the projectile
is made, so Prof. SchiapareUi shows that by the accumulated attraction of
the earth upon it (until it enters the atmosphere and is finally arrested) an
ordinary meteorite* overtaking the earth with the least possible relative
speed that it can have, and grazing the earth's atmosphere horizontally at
last, win have its apparent radiant-point raised 17░ by " zenithal attraction,"
which is the name by which he has distinguished this correction. If the
same meteorite moved from the opposite direction, meeting the earth instead
 of overtaking it, and at last grazing the atmosphere horizontally, the zeni-
thal attraction of its apparent radiant-point would be less than half a degree,
or about 0░ 20'. The actual speeds of these two meteors' flights through the

 cepted, and only those are considered, forming probably far the most numerous class,
 whose orbits are parabolas or very long ellipses.

atmosphere are about 10 miles and 44| miles per second ; and between these,
as well as also according to trustworthy observations below and above these
values, real velocities of aerolites, bolides, and shooting-stars have been re-

--corded. The amount of zenithal attraction depends also on the altitude of the

apparent radiant-point meteors that descend almost perpendicularly having

undergone much less deflection from their course than those which reach the

atmosphere from low radiant-points, and which appear to enter it at last very

obliquely. Considering these various conditions, Dr. Galle obtains two new

positions " corrected for zenithal atti'action " of the large meteor's observed
radiant-point, differing most from its original place in the case (b) in the

Table corresponding to the case where the least admissible value of the real
velocity is assumed ; and proceeding thence to construct separately from each
of these adopted data the meteor's orbit round the sun, he finds it to be in
each case an hyperbola of greater or less eccentricity, and that to make it a
parabola the meteor's time of flight would have to be reckoned as about 17
seconds. Several observations of the duration, besides those already men-
tioned, collected together, show that in only one instance out of twenty-two
(at Bernstadt) an observer recorded the duration of the meteor's flight as
 exceeding 10 seconds (12-15 seconds) ; and that by the great mass of the
 observers the time of the meteor's flight was estimated as between four or five
 and ten seconds, making the hyperbolic character of the meteor's orbit even
 more strongly probable than before. The following are the hyperbolic
 elements of the two orbits found by Dr. Galle, to which are added the hyper-
 bolic elements (as above referred to in these Reports), also calculated by Dr.

 Galle, of the aerolitic fireball of Pultusk.

The orbit is in each case nearly in the ecliptic plane, overtaking the earth at
long. 266░ 36', and crossing the earth's orbit towards the sun at an angle of
about 45░ in the first, and of about 36░ in the second case. The resemblance

of the first case to the hyperbolic orbit of the Pultusk meteorites is remarkable
by the large eccentricities and perihelion distances, the direct motion and
small inclination to the ecliptic allowing each meteor to overtake the earth
on paths that crossed its orbit towards their perihelion points at angles of
about 45░ and 11░. It should also be remembered that the meteor of Pul-
tusk burst and disappeared at a height of 25 miles, and the present large
fireball at a height of only 20 miles, as if its materials were tougher or more
compact than the perfect shower of small stones that fell at Sielk from the
point of the Pultusk meteor's explosion overhead. Both of these large fire-
balls were well seen and recorded at the Observatory of Breslau ; and the con-
current testimony of two such well investigated cases is, as observed by Dr.
Galle, strongly indicative of a tendency of aerolitic and detonating fireballs
to belong to a class of astronomical bodies different from comets or annual

pciiodic star-showers by moving in hyperbolas instead of in parabolas or
long ellipses, so as to have motions of their own beyond the sphere of the
sun's attraction, carrying them apparently from star-system to star-system,
instead of in constant revolutions round a single solar centre. Observations
of the duration, length of path, and points of first appearance of meteors of
the August and November star-showers Dr. Galle suggests will be most valu-
able to show if any shooting-stars of those well-known streams present
speeds that cannot belong to other than hyperbolic orbits, as in those cases it
must be assumed that the excessive velocities observed have their expla-
nation in some physical cause, to which it wiU. then be very desirable to
direct special and the most accurate possible investigations.

   The combination of at least two good observations needful for determining
a shooting-star's real speed of flight is the difficulty that wiU present itself to
carry out Dr. Galle's experiments on the Perseids and other annual meteoric

showers. This objection, however, does not apply to the apparent speed, if
even a single observer records that speed without very serious errors ; but
even such a record is not often reached. Observers' estimates vary chiefly

as to the apparent lengths of meteors' courses and their time of flight. An

incomplete view of the course at the beginning, and sometimes also (from
dimness of the meteor owing to distance) at the end, is often the cause of
this, unsuspected by the observer. The time of flight and length of path
recorded should, however, always correspond together, a short observed time
of flight for a partially observed path being never coupled in a record with an
ideal length of course supposed to make up the whole length of a meteor's

line of flight judged by such indications of it as the meteor may have left. It
may also be foi'gotten to record the times of flight of some shooting- stars at

--all a very unfortunate omission, because the value contributed by such an

observation to a simultaneous observation of the same meteor made at a
distant station is enhanced immensely by a statement of this astronomically
important datum. Much is due here to hurry in the rapid succession of

meteors in periodic star-showers, and comparatively little to inability to note
and appreciate small intervals of time. The best time for noting the duration
(as well as the magnitude and colour) is while fixing with the eyes the posi-
tion of the path just seen, often marked for some time after the meteor's dis-

appearance by the persistent streak among the stars ; and it can then easily
be borne in mind, and presently afterwards recorded. Stop-watches, how-
ever, or chronographs of the best description, must be resorted to if results of

the most rehable character only are desired to be obtained.

   It may be added that if the visual radiant-point and the real height in

miles at disappearance (h miles) are determined, and the following particulars
of a meteor's apparent course are taken from a single observer's description
of its apparent path, viz. the distance from the radiant-point in degrees (d)
of the point of commencement, the altitude in degrees from the horizon (a)
of the point of extinction, the length (I) in degrees of the apparent path, as
 well as the time of flight in seconds (s), then the real length of path (L) in

and an average real velocity of the meteors of the shower may then be

     Notes to a List of Meteor-heights, Sfc.

By Mr. "Wallek and Professor Herschei,.

(1) The brightest meteor noted on the 10th of August, 1871, descended

almost to the S.W. horizon, from close to Saturn, at Portsmouth (J. P. Mac-

lear), from the direction of a Capricorni at Cardiff (Gr. H. Thompson), in

the direction of 60░ W. of Magnetic South at Hawkhurst, and from 12░

below and right of " Antares," at the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich. The

star Antares had set at Greenwich some minutes at the time of the meteor's

Aappearance, and the planet Saturn was evidently mistaken for it.  distance

of 8░ below and right of Saturn at Greenwich, and of only 3░ from Saturn in

the same direction at Portsmouth, corresponds very exactly with the points of

appearance of the meteor, as described at Cardiff in South Wales and at Hawk-

hurst in Kent. The length of path of the meteor seen at Greenwich is said to

have been 5░, and the point of disappearance of the meteor, where it burst

into fragments like a shell, is more or less distinctly recorded at the other

stations. The height and position of this fine meteor's path are thus fixed

with considerable certainty, and its identification with some of the bright

bolides, reported by Mr. Le Verrier's staff' of observers to have been seen at

the same time at St. Lo in Calvados, and at Angers on the Loire, may be

the means of fixing its true course and perhaps its real velocity, for which

the very distant observations in England were ill adapted, with greater

accuracy. Tlie real course was over the northern part of the mouth of the

Bay of Biscay, beginning about 70 miles south, and ending about 120 miles

S. by W. from Brest, in longitudes and north latitudes respectively of about

5░ W. from Greenwich, 47░ 20' N., and 5░ 35' AV. from Greenwich, 46░

30' N. No sensible appearance of a persistent streak was recorded, probably

from the appearance of the meteor to all the observers among the cloudy

vapours of the horizon ; and from this circumstance of its low apparent ele-

vation and very distant southern apparition, a bright meteor seen almost

simultaneously with it at some considerable altitude in the south-western

sky, at the Luxembourg Observatory in Paris, by Mr. Chapelas Coulier-Gra-

vier, though otherwise resembling it in description (as noted in the list of

meteor accordances of last year's Keport), was certainly distinct, and not
identifiable with this bright fireball of the " Perseid " shower. In deducing its

real height an addition of between 20 and 30 miles is made as an allowance

for the curvature of the earth's surface at the great distance of between 400

and 450 miles from Greenwich, at which the meteor entered the atmosphere

and pursued its course through the air.

(2) The rough note (in a Birmingham newspaper) of the apparent place

 of this meteor's streak at Leamington, or of the last fading part of it, before
 it disappeared " extending N. to S. across the chief stars of Cassiopeia, 3░ or

,4░ long, and fading away in 15 seconds," may have related to its position

after it became serpentine and was displaced by air-currents : compared with

Mr. Greg's observations of the meteor at Manchester in the older list it led to

an excessive height of the streak-bearing portion of the meteor's flight, which

was certainly from the "Perseid" radiant-area, and to no satisfactory indi-

cation of its radiant-point. The present observation of the same meteor by

Mr. Lucas at the Eadcliffe Observatory, Oxford, combined with Mr. Greg's

excellent description of it at Manchester, supplies an estimation of its real path,

length of course, and velocity, which is probably a much nearer approximation
       OBSERVATIONS OF LUMINOUS METEORS.  285

to the truth. The point of appearance was nearly over Newark, and that of
disappearance nearly over Derby in the Midland Counties, at heights of about
90 and 40 miles respectively, the brightest and most enduring portion of the
bright streak being left, apparently, at a height of about 54 miles on this
course. The radiant-point given by the Oxford and Manchester observations
is a few degrees distant, in the direction of Andromeda, from the cluster (x)
in the sword-hand of Perseus.

   (3) The extent of the meteor's flight at the beginning and end of its appa-
rent course at Greenwich is not stated, leaving the corresponding heights,
and the resulting length of path and velocity of the meteor from these obser-
vations, iinverified and doubtful. The meteor's radiant-point between ^ Persei
and e Cassiopeise is probably very well established, and it accordingly formed
one of the meteors of the " Perseus" shower.

   (4) The recorded paths are in very good accordance with a radiant-point
near yjr or t Cephei ; the meteor belongs to a contemporary shower from
Cepheus or the North Pole, adjoining one between Draco and Cepheus
frequently observed (with but slight intensity) on or about the same date

as the Perseids of the 10th of August. The declination of its radiant-

point appears too northerly to allow it to be regarded as a very erratic

Perseid.

   (4Ф) The recorded appearance at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, of a

bright meteor at 10'' IS" 9' {> %, &c.) on the 11th of August, 1871, nearly

simultaneous and agreeing in all other particulars of its appearance with a
meteor observed nearly at the same minute at York, Hawkhurst, and in London
(whose height was thence calculated in the older list), is unfortunately of no
useful service to afford a redetermination of the height, the region bare of
stars in which it appeared having evidently afforded no visible sky-marks
for its accurate registration. The direction of its flight, however, confirms

the position of the radiant-point (near B Camelopardi) adopted rather than

obtained directly from the three independent observations of its course already
used, and renders the height and velocity of this true Perseid thus arrived at
in the former list very probably correct.

286 REPORT--1874.

Grreenwicli in this case with all its features, except those of verified positions,
sufficiently resembling the descriptions of a meteor elsewhere doubly mapped
and calculated to have led it without this certain difference to have been
treated as identical with it, and hence (if the distinction were not observed)
to have been coupled with it in an average result.

   (6) The path of this meteor was well mapped at Greenwich, and it is in
excellent agreement with the apparent course as seen at Birmingham. The
original observation of its track by Mr. Crumplen in London is marked " im-
perfect view ;" and lying as it does transversely as well as at a considerable

distance from the course shown at Greenwich (very near to London), it may

be assumed that the apparent path mapped at Greenwich is more reliable,
and that the above calculations of the real heights, length of path, and
velocity from the Greenwich and Birmingham observations, are more nearly
accurate than those obtained by comparison of London and Birmingham in
the older list. Mr. Waller's and Prof. Herschel's calculated paths differ
greatly in the Table, the cause of which is not improbably an uncorrected
printer's error, 8░+ 56░ instead of 8░+ 86░, accidentally inserted in the
catalogue of the last Eeport as the meteor's point of first observation by Mr.

Wood at Birmingham, the existence of which was only noticed when Mr.

Waller's calculations had already been completed.
    (7) Doubtful conditions of the recorded paths appear in this instance to

lead to very uncertain determinations of the real course.
    (8) Probably a " Cygnid," from its apparently foreshortened paths near

that constellation ; but found by Mr. Waller's determination of the real
from the described apparent positions of its course to have had a nearly
horizontal motion. The original observations are evidently unable to afford,
without notable concessions, a radiant-point near enough to the observed paths

to be regarded as a proper explanation of their curtailed and apparently

foreshortened lengths. This Greenwich meteor at ll*" 35" 45' p.m.. Hawk-

hurst 11'' 34" P.M., is quite distinct from the true Perseid simultaneously
observed at ll** 36TM p.m. at Hawkhurst and London (recorded in the earlier
list), the times at Hawkhurst and London having all been between 1" and 2"'
slow on Greenwich time throughout the watch.

    (8 a) The Greenwich observation of this meteor (if they are really identifi-
able) is so much at variance with the Hawkhurst observation as scarcely to
permit of the height determination that Mr. Waller has endeavoured to obtain
from them. The Loudon and Hawkhurst observations (of the old Hst) agree
well together, and Mr. Waller's recalculation of them (as will be seen in the
Table) leads very nearly to the heights &c. already found. The view of
the meteor at Greenwich was probabl}' imperfect ; but errors may also have
been made at Hawkhurst and in London ; and in such cases it would be very
desirable to share the errors as far as possible equally among the different

observers.

   A(9) meteor simultaneously observed at about this time (ll** 53-54") at

Hawkhurst and London (in the old list) was a " Polarid : " and although
appearing in nearly the same quarter of the sky with the "PerseVd " mapped
 at Birmingham and at the Poyal Observatory, Greenwich, it is found by pro-
jection of the apparent paths to be irreconcilable with and quite distinct from
 it, these two duplicate observations having thus been obtained (like the two

 last described) independently of each other in a brief interval of scarcely

more than a minute's watch.
    (10) The hour at Hawkhurst (O*" 29" a.m.) is scarcely half a minute

instead of, as usual during this night, a full minute, or considerably more than
a minute slow on the Greenwich time of observation (0'' 29" 25') ; and

although in all respects of appearance and relative ijosition, excepting an

extremely small parallax of about 10░ or 12░ near the zenith, the meteor

descriptions at Hawkhurst and the Eoyal Observatory, Greenwich, are in very

good agreement, the sensible difi'erence of the times and the excessive length

of path and velocity as well as the extravagant real heights of the meteor's

course to which the observations lead, make it manifest that the supposed

identity of these meteors is mistaken, or that if the resemblance was real, and

not merely accidental, the errors singularly made in recording the apparent

paths are such as to prevent entirely any satisfactory calculations from being

founded on them.

A(11)     large and bright Persei'd leaving a long enduring streak that

remained visible at Greenwich about 15 seconds. The meteor's course well

observed at both places.

   (12) The evidence of identity in this duplicate observation is by no means

certain. On the other hand, from the brightness and unusual direction of

the meteors, and from the near coincidence of the times, it is extremely

probable. Even if it can be assumed that no errors have crept into the

descriptions of the two apparent paths, that noted by Mr. E. Neissou in

London, " from Cepheus to Perseus," admits of very wide interpretations.

Both observations are probably open to very considerable emendation ; but

it cannot be denied that, as they stand, if they refer to one and the same

shooting-star, its real elevation above the earth's surface was far inferior to

what is usual in ordinary meteors, and ranged no higher than the lowest points

(between 25 and 15 miles above the sea-level) to which detonating and

aerolitic fireballs sometimes penetrate the earth's atmosphere. The absence

of good evidence both of identity and accuracy in the observations must, how-

ever, leave this general conclusion from them very doubtful.

   (13) The three meteors of the January star-shower in 1872, doubly ob-
served at Hawkhurst and in London on the 2nd of January, 1872, were

bright ones of a very fuie return of that periodic shower, and they were care-

fully recorded. Their general elevation appears to have been lower than that

of ordinary shower-meteors, and a good average velocity of about 21 or 22

miles per second (which is a very moderate meteor-speed) appears to have

been obtained. Comparisons of this meteor-speed with the known elements

and theoretical meteor-speed of the January meteor-stream will afford an

interesting subject of investigation.

many general descriptions of the course of this large meteor seen at many

places in the south of England in strong evening twilight on July 22nd,

1872.

watch of the August shooting-stars kept by Prof. G. Forbes at the Eoyal

Observatory, Greenwich, and Captain G. L. Tupman at Bangor in North

Wales.

a very good determination of the height, speed, and direction of the real path

of a meteor from a well-known coradiant of the August shower close to

Polaris.

by Prof. G. Forbes at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, as well as by Mr.
Glaisher's staff of observers there, and by Mr. Crumplen in London.

   A(17) rather bright meteor unconformable to Perseus at 9^ 11-12" p.m.,

August 11th, 1872; simultaneously observed at three stations, appearing
with yellowish light, slow speed, and somewhat crooked course. Carefully

observed at all the stations, and the resulting heights, &c. probably pretty

accurate.

   A(18) bright " Orionid " of the annual October shower, with long course

of 40░ along the southern horizon at Scots' Gap, Northumberland, and falling
nearly vertically in the west ; length of path about 20░ at Birmingham. The
view at Scots' Gap near the horizon was unfavourable for exact description by
the stars, and the recorded time of appearance at Scots' Gap was five minutes
earlier than at Birmingham, where the meteor noted was the first recorded
on that night. It is very doubtful if the same meteor was simultaneously

observed, each of two bright meteors of the shower having apparently been
seen at one, which was at the same time unnoticed at the other station.

   A(19) small bolide of the December shower, which was observed simul-

taneously at Glasgow and at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, on December 11th, 1873.
The meteor appeared close and bright at both the stations, and of distinct

greenish light at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where it really descended at a
distance of 150 miles towards the east, or two fifths of the way across from
the English to the Danish shore of the German Ocean ; and the length, height,
and position of its luminous track were fixed with great accuracy by the

duplicate descriptions of its course.

    (20) These two meteors simultaneously observed at Birmingham and

Weston-super-Mare by Mr. Wood and Mr. T. H. Waller, with foreshortened

courses near their respective radiant-jjoints, during the April meteor-shower
in 1874. The first, directed from Comae Berenices, presents a very satisfactory
accordance. The agreement of the recorded paths of the second, from Lyra,
is less exact ; but the extreme shortness of its visible path at Weston-super-

Mare may have made it rather more difficult to describe its course and its

apparent position there correctly.

  A(21) fine bolide, unconformable to the shower from Perseus, seen during

the meteor-shower on August 10th, 1874, at Birmingham and at Newcastle-
on-Tyne. The real height, speed, length of path, and direction are well
defined by the observations as far as the last point of principal explosion.
The meteor then continued its path for some distance as a ruddy fragment,
which, from the low view of the meteor near the horizon, was not visible
at Newcastle-upon-Tyne ; it inclined downwards, at the same time, in its

direction until it disappeared. Mr. Wood has calculated the following

real heights and positions of the meteor at the three principal points upon

its course.

   He adds that the observations indicate a radiant-point of the meteor's

--course at about a =32.5░, S= 17░, which is close to positions well defined

by Captain Tupman (No. 44), at 326░, - 13░ on July 28th ; by Dr. Schmidt, at
332░, --14░ from July 20th to 31st, and August 3rd to 31st; and by Heis

--and Neumayer (S,, for August) at 337░, --10░, forming a distinct radiant-

region in Aquarius along a part of the southern arc of the ecliptic at that
season of the year.

                        II. Aerolites..

It is noticed in the 'American Journal of Science' of September 1873,

that a mass of meteoric iron found at Neuntmannsdorf, in Saxony, in

December 1872, weighing 25 lbs., has been deposited in the Museum at

Dresden.

In the ' Comptes Rendus' (vol. Ixxix. p. 276, August 3rd, 1874) are

communications by M. Daubree on the recent aerolitic falls of Yidin (Turkey)

and St. Amand (France), of which the following are abstracts.

 --Virba, near Yidin, Turkey, May 20, 1874. An aerolite weighing 8 lbs. fell

with the usual loud explosions, and penetrated the earth to a depth of about

1 metre (3| feet). It was entirely coated over with a dull black crust, and,
as preserved in photographs, its form appears to have been fragmentary.

The substance of the stone is light grey, fine-grained, with a rough fracture

and occasional globular structure. Fine grains of metallic nickeliferous iron

and impalpable particles of chrome iron and sulphuret of iron are scattered

through it. The mineral portion is partly attackable (peridot) and partly

unattackable (enstatite) by hydrochloric acid. The attackable part forms
fully one half of the meteoric mass. It is thus a meteorite of the most common

species, like that of luce or luceite. The following aerolites are cited by M.

--Daubree as resembling it: Bachmut, 1814, February 15; Politz, 1819,

October 13 ;  Angers, 1822, June 3 ;  Maseombes (Correze),              1835, June  30
                                                                                                   ;

choff (Kurland), 1863, June 2 ; Dolgowola (Yolhynia), 1864, June 26.

 --Saint-Amand, Loir-et-Cher, France, July 23, 1872. In addition to the

fragments of this fall found at Lance (104 lbs.) and at Pont Loiselle (| lb.
in weight), the latter fragment ten kilometres (6| miles) from the former

(see these lieports for 1873, p. 384), M. Daubree relates that four other frag-

ments, weighing between 7 lbs. and | lb., have since been discovered. Two

of them, weighing about 1| lb. each, were found 100 metres apart, while the

other two struck the ground some miles from them and from each other.

courses prove them to have belonged to different meteor-systems, or at least
not simultaneously to any one of the hitherto established systems of occa-

sion al shooting- stars. Among the sixty-four bolides of the list, known

radiant-points are assigned to forty-eight (or 75 per cent.), without any signs
of recurrence on particular days, or of any such shower exhibiting an unusual
number of large meteors on a certain date. The possible existence of meteor-
showers consisting principally of large meteors is therefore not discernible
from this fireball-list ; but as it only extends to three years' observations, a
wider discussion of the question, if it were possible from the comparatively
small number of bolides of which the apparent paths have been accurately
observed, will be necessary to determine if no such meteor-showers exist.

   The list of radiant-points obtained from his observations by Captain Tup-
jnan is here extracted from his catalogue, accompanied by an illustrative

map and planisphere of all the regions of the sky visible in the latitude of

AGreenwich.  description of these two plates and directions for their use

is added from the pamphlet of Captain Tupmah's observations, 500 copies of
which were this year printed by the Meteor Committee of the British Associa-

tion, and distributed under their directions to the principal Scientific Societies,

directors of Astronomical Observatories, and leading observers of shootiug-stars

in this and other countries, from some of whom acknowledgments of its

communication were received. Preliminary discussions of its list of meteor-

tracks have already appeared in foreign journals (' Memorie della Societa degli

Spettrosccf[)isti Italiani,' May 1874), of which an abstract, when the memoir

is received by the Committee, will be given in a future Report. The latest

general list of radiant-points observed by Dr. J. F. Schmidt, of Athens, to

which frequent allusion is made in Captain Tupman's list, and of which no

copy has hitherto appeared in these Reports, is also appended here, to assist

observers in reducing observations of occasional shooting-stars to the radiant-

Apoints of known meteor-showers.  general list includiug the two last-

named, and accordingly, as far as such a compilation can be accomplished

successfully, believed to be complete, is offered by Mr. Greg for the same

purpose. From its comprehensiveness, embracing almost exhaustively all

other radiant lists which have hitherto appeared, and adding to them many

special references, it is believed that no fuller Table of the probably existing

centres of meteoric radiation throughout the year can be used and consulted

by observers, in the present largely developed state of this inquiry, as a

standard catalogue for reducing, verifying, and recording their occasional

notes of shooting-stars, and for identifying meteor-streams on occasions when

their radiant-points can be independently observed and exactly or approxi-

mately ascertained. As intended, however, chiefly for observers in the nor-

thern hemisphere, several of the extremely southern radiant-points of Heis

and Neumayer's list are for brevity not included in it.

                           DESCEIPTION OP THE PLATES.

                                                      Plate XV.

is a chart of the observed radiant-points, on an equidistant projection, with the North
                Pole in the centre.

The meridians and parallels are dotted at intervals of 2░.
 The positions of the radiant-points are represented by the numbers in the first column of

               the Catalogue, enclosed in a circle, or in an irregular figure resulting from dis-
*

                 cordances in the determinations.

 The graduations enable the observed tracks of meteors to be suitably projected upon
               tracings containing only those radiant-points proper to the season and above the
                horizon at the time of observation.

                                                        Plate XVI.

 contains the projections of graduated great circles of the sphere crossing Plate XV- at
               intervals of 10░ from the Pole, which occupies the centre.

 The transparent tracing, prepared as described above, is superposed on Plate XVI., centre
               over centre, and turned round until the meteor-track is symmetrically situated
               between two of tlie curves seen through the tracing. All the i-adiant-points from
               which the meteor could possibly proceed can then be foiuid immediately by

                prolonging the track backwards along the curves.
 The proper curve on Plate XVI. can be selected and transferred to the tracing to represent

        --the observer's horizon. [Q-. L. T.]

310 REPORT--1874.

            IV. Periodical Meteor-Showees.

A collection of copious notes of the annual meteor-showers of August and

December last, and of April and August in the present year, has been

received, with more than ordinarily full details, from observers of these

showers. An examination of them is iinavoidably postponed, from their

length, in this Report, and results of the comparison and reduction of the

observations which are now in progress are reserved for a future communi-

cation. The annual August shower in 1873, although greatly concealed from

view by clouds, was not much inferior in brightness when it was observed on

the nights of August 10th and 11th to the considerable return of this shower

in the year 1871. In the present j^ear the August star-shower somewhat

surpassed, especially in the brightness of its meteors, the intensity of its

appearance on the two previous occasions.

Few meteors were recorded on the nights of the 18th to 21st of October,

1873, partly on account of cloudy skies ; but the majority of those observed
indicated, by their appearance and direction, traces of a slight return of this

annual meteor-shower.

No success attended the watch kept by Captain Tupman at Greenwich

from 11'' to 13", and by the observers at Stonyhurst College throughout the

night of the 13th and 14th of November, for the return of the November

shower of Leonids in 1873 ; a watch was also kept until 13** 15"* on the

same night, with similar results, by Mr. H. W. Jackson and F. II. "Ward at

ATooting.  completely overcast state of the sky prevented observations on

the following night. An organized watch was also arranged to observe any

recurrence that might be visible of the Andromedcs of November 27th, that

formed a conspicuous star-shower in the previous year. No meteors of this

shower, however, were visible, although clear skies prevailed at the observing

stations on the 27th and on most of the other nights in the last week of

ANovember.  brief notice of an unusual number of meteors seen on the

evening of the 23rd, at Mr. Prince's Meteorological Observatory in Sussex,

will be found in the notes of occasional star-showers at the end of this

appendix; a solitary meteor (not an Andromede)was seen, in an attentive watch
in clear moonless sky, between 7'' 30TM and 8'' p.m. on that evening, by Mr.

M'Clure at Glasgow. If the recorded prevalence was yet observable, perhaps

at some later hour on that evening, as described, it appears highly probable

that it was connected with the branch stream of the main shower of

Andromedes observed and recorded very generally on the night of the 24th

of November, 1872. As far as the Committee have been able to ascertain,

no traces of a return of the meteors representing Biela's comet have else-

where been recorded as ha^dng been visible in November 1873.

With the exception of the August displays, the brightest annual meteor-

shower of the past year was that of a well-marked exhibition of the Geminids

on the nights of the 10th, 11th, and 12th of December, 1873. The state of

the sky was favourable for observations on these nights at certain stations,

and unfavourable at all of them on the 13th, so that the termination of the

shower was not observed. Nearly 200 meteor-paths were mapped ; and the
appearances of the meteors were described by observers at Heidelberg (where

Mr. J. E. Clark obtained a clear view of the shower) in Germany, and at

Birmingham, Newcastle-on-Tyne, and Glasgow in England and Scotland, and

tlie time of greatest frequency of the shower was approximately ascertained.

Meteors were less frequent ou the 10th than on the two following nights
and they were visible in greatest numbers towards midnight on the night of
the 11th, Avhen the number mapped by Mr. Clark was nearly thirty in an

hour. A greater number of meteor-tracks was recorded at Birmingham by

Mr. Wood on the night of the 12th than on the 11th; and the number of

bright meteors on the latter was also greater than on the former night ; but
a part only of the shooting-stars observed diverged from Gemini, the rest
proceeding from six or seven other radiant-i^ints more or less certainly
included in Mr. Greg's general list. The percentage number of Geminids
mapped is between forty and seventy in the different accounts, Mr. Clark's
observations giving fifty-nine. Of the remaining shooting-stars mapped by
Mr. Clark on the nights of the 10th and 11th, thirteen, or 20 per cent., pro-

ceeded with so much precision from an apparently new radiant-point at
E.A. 57░, N. Decl. 6░, that the apparent courses of five of them prolonged
backwards passed within one degree, and those of six others within two
degrees of this point. The radiant-area in Gemini extended, according to

Mr. Clark's description, from Greg's'radiant G, near 6 Geminorum, to Heis's

radiant M^, a little north of a Geminorum. Mr. Wood assigns to it a

position extending from 6 to a Geminorum, and Mr. Greg a region of some

width in Telescopium.
   The following numbers of meteors and hourly averages were recorded by

the principal observers of the shower during the half hours ending at :

of the April shower as it was visible at its return in 1874. In a watch of

40 minutes, kept at about 2'' a.m. on the morning of AprU 20th by Mr. Back-

house in an interval of almost cloudless sky, only four meteors, three of

which were Lyraids, were observed. During watches of nearly the same

length, between lO*" and ll** and between ll*" and 12'', on the evening of

April 20th, eight meteors and four meteors were mapped, four meteors in

Aeach watch being Lyraids.        double watch of the same duration (l*" 20")

on the night of the 21st only presented four meteor-tracks, of which two, as

bright as Sirius, are erratic or very doubtful Lyraids, Mr. Wood's description

of the shower, as summed up from his observations in the following remarks,

is very similar as to its duration and intensitv.

   " Night of the 19th overcast j 20th very fine. From 10'^ to 10" 30"", no

meteors ;  10" 30░^ tiU           11" 30'", 10 meteors ;       11" 30"'  till                                               12", no meteors
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

12" till 12" S"", 2 meteors. 21st, fine night ; from 10" till 11" 15'", no meteors.

A very bright but short return of this shower within well-defined limits.

One half exceeded stars of the first magnitude, and were contributed by the

different radiants in the proportion of one fourth from QH^ (in Lyra), one
sixth from Q,^, and similarly from B. ,, and DG,, and the remaining fourth
from SG, and WG.

" The shower was of an intermittent character, with half-hour intervals of

quiescence. The maximum was probably reached during the outburst from

10" SO'" to llh 30"" P.M. on the 20 th. The night following was marked by a

total absence of meteors ; the same feature presented itself at the brilliant
return of 1863."

Mr. Clark's general remarks on the appearance of the shower at Heidelberg,

and Mr. Greg's view of it in England, corroborate the above descriptions very

closely. Mr. Clark writes : " The weather during the week ending with the

19th was specially unfavourable, but since then perfectly clear. The hills

behind hid the moon after 10 o'clock on the 20th, and [from 10" 15"" until

12" 30TM] in all I saw twenty-five meteors, and mapped twenty-three. From

10" 50"' to 12" [Karlsruhe time, corresponding to about 10" 20"'-ll" 30""

G.M.T.] there was a great run of Lyraids ; other^vise they were much out-
numbered by those from other radiants. On the night of the 21st I only

--saw three meteors during a 40 minutes' watch. . . . From six apparent

radiants meteors came as follows : 1 from 33 (of Greg's general list, 1872,
=MZ MJHeis's
                               ;  ; 2 from 43 (M,_ ^) ; 2 from 35 (DG^) ; 13 from 38 and 39

(Cerberus and Lyra) ; 5 from near 40 (SG^) ; and 2 from 54 (S, ^ J : total

25 meteor-tracks. Yery few from Lyrai'd region, save between 10" 50"" and

12". On the 21st, 54 and 38, 39 seemed the chief radiants."

A rather larger proportion of Lyraids appears to have been observed by

Mr. Greg, who also communicates from his mapped observations a very exact

position of the radiant-point and the following general description of the

shower :

   " The night of the 20th was very favourable. I looked out from ll*" 15""
-12" 45"' and saw over twenty meteors, of which about fifteen were from Lyra,

mostly very  fine  and            remarkable  ones,  flashing  and trained                                                  very rapid  when
                                                                                                                         ;

overhead, moderate in speed when near the radiant. About four or five others

from Cerberus were diff'erent, also trained, but slower and duUer in colour

only one other meteor not from these two radiants ! The radiant seems very
close to a Lyrfe, perhaps 2░ or 3░ below it. On the evening of the 21st I
looked out from 11" to 12", and saw no Lyraids, except one doubtful one not
by any means from Ф Lyrse." The plotted apparent paths of eleven of the

    Occasional notices of the unusual frequency of meteors on certain nights of

the past year have been received, of which particular accounts were furnished

in the following communications :
   September 1st, 1873 (Ackworth, Yorkshire).--" There was quite an abun-

dance of meteors on the night of September 1st. Between 11" and 12" p.m.

I heard from my brother (F. J. Clark) that nine meteors were seen, some

--very fine ones, mostly in the south." J. E. Clark.
 --October 17th and November 23rd, 1873 (Crowborough, Sussex). " Octo-

ber : during the evening of the 17th a number of small meteors were observed.

--November: one large meteor and many smaU ones were observed on the

evening of the 23rd." Summary of a meteorological journal for 1873 kept

at Crowborough Beacon Observatory, by C. L. Prince, F.E.A.S. &c.

   1874, March 18th and 19th (Sunderland).--" There were a good many

shooting-stars on the nights of the 18th and the 19th (particulars enclosed).
The paths traced backwards of six or seven of these agree with a very exact
radiant-point at R.A. 157^░, N. Decl. 13░ ; those of four or five others, as

--far as observed, with the radiant-point M^." T. W. Backhouse.^

   Prom the abstracts of logs kept on board of vessels supplied with meteoro-

logical instruments from the Meteorological Oifice of the Board of Trade

during recent years, Captain H. Toynbee has obligingly furnished the Com-

mittee with the following entries of observations of shooting-stars near the

Cape-Yerd Islands in the month of February, remarking that in the 10-degree
square of the Atlantic that includes those islands upwards of six such entries
are found in the year 1860, and none in any other year. As far as these
Reports extend, no unusual prevalence of shooting-stars or bright meteors in
February was recorded in them in the year 1860 ; but the occurrence of
meteor-showers on the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 14th, and 18th-21st of Februaiy,
and of unusually bright meteors on the first two of these dates as well as on
the 9th-llth and during the last six or seven days of February, is more or
less well determined from existing records, to which the present important
communication from Captain Toynbee affords a very valuable extension and

corroboration.

the Astronomical Society is pointed out in Herr von^Konkoly's detenninatiou
of the radiant-point. As extracted from Dr. Heis's collection (and not from
Signer Deuza's (D) as stated in the list) the N. declination of the radiant-
point observed by Herr von Konkoly was 45░. Signor Denza's description,
translated from that of Prof, von Littrow in the 'Wiener Zeitung,' gives.
55░ as the N. declination. In a letter since received from Herr von Konkoly
he observes that his first accounts of the shower contained an eye-estimation
of the position of the radiant-point, and that on afterwards pointing an
equatorial telescope towards the exactly selected spot, an accurate position of

+the radiant-point was obtained. This was at a place in R. A. l** 45'" ( 5"'),

Decl. +45^ (▒1░), or about in R.A. 26░-2, N. Decl. 45░, a position agreeing

very closely with the probable true centre of the meteoric shower.

   The following few observations of the radiant-point appear to have been
omitted from the above-mentioned list :

scope towards it, the bright lines of sodium and magnesium, and two lines
in the red and two in the green, were found by Herr von Konkoly to be

visible in its fading light. The last four lines, when compared with several

Geissler tubes, were found to be absolutely coincident with those contained

--in the vacuum spectruju of coal-gas ("womit die Strassen beleuchtet wer-

den," or " lighting "-gas, evidently misprinted " lightning "-gas in the

description in the ' Monthly Notices '). The comparison occupied eleven
minutes, at the end of which time the carbon lines could no longer be distin-
guished; but the bands of magnesium were still very finely visible with the
meteor-spectroscope. Herr von Konkoly adds that accounts of the meteor's
path were being collected by Prof. Galle, of Breslau ; but that hitherto sufii-
ciently accurate descriptions had not been obtained to enable its real path to

be determined.

   The following are descriptions of some memoirs and discussions that have
recently been pubhshed on the appearances of the August and other meteoric
star -showers of the last few years.

The August Perse'ids, 1873. (Italian Observations.)

   I. Prof. Serpieri, of Urbino, at the meeting of the Royal Lombard Insti-

tution of Science, held 8th January, 1874, read a paper on the Perseids of

August 1873, from which we condense the following brief analysis concerning

the radiant-points of that shower. Prof. Serpieri and three assistants, in
spite of nearly fuU moonlight, observed 267 meteors from the 8th to
the 15th August, of which 139 were true PerscVds whose positions were

duly mapped on a chart by Prof. Lorenzoni. The time of maximum for

the shower was not determined, owing to clouds on the 10th August.
Serpieri considers that there are two principal radiants for the Perseids,
or rather two principal axes of radiation crossing each other obliquely and
having at the same time a nearly common centre. The one which he calls the
"old" radiant, as determined (1847-1867) by Greg and Herschel in their
meteor atlas, and especially by Prof. A. S. Herschel in 1863, has its position

from

    Ф ^^'и^"иии:      t%26░  2E7',t+'6l3Z░  ^^') 44░,  +56░       mean      centre,                         1863,

and the " new " radiant (first determined by Prof. Newton, of America, and

also confirmed by Serpieri himself) from

Out of the 139 Perseids mapped for August, 1873, exactly half, or 87, are
considered by Prof. Serpieri to answer the conditions as belonging to each of
these two radiants. The idea entertained by Serpieri appears to be that
there has in recent years (from about the year 1867) been an evident in-
crease in the proportion of meteors affecting the " new " radiant, or radiant-
axis, as compared with former years (from about 1847 to 1867, according
to the English observations). The mean central points for both are apparently
very nearly the same ; but the meteors affect for the two radiants apparently
a somewhat different range of flights, according to the mode in which Prof.

Serpieri has analyzed their distribution in connexion with his definition of

the radiant-regions. He considers that the meteor-flights appertaining to
the " older " English radiant have a tendency to a maximum fan-like stream

from Tc Persei towards that part of the heavens situate between Corona and

Delphinus ; whilst the tendency of the maximum streams from nearly the
                                                --

same point in Perseus, for the " newer " radiaut, is in a direction more
oblique to the meridian, extending over the region between Corona and
Pegasus as far as Algeinb. Prof. Serpieri gives two drawings to show the
relative position of these two radiaut-axes, crossing each other near k Persei

at about the angle given in the accompanying

figure, with the valuable addition of the meteor-

flights, indicated by arrows, as most reliably con-

Anected with either line of radiant. For B, the

" new " radiaut, there are 52 meteor-tracks

(1873), and for a e 50 tracks. It would appear

Athat the apparent velocities of the B meteors
Awere greater than for a, and for B also a greater

number of the meteors having a less precise point

of radiation. Per the "new" radiant about

22 meteors showed a very good centre at

+E.A. 44░, Decl. 55░ (Prof. Newton's centre

being 43░, -f-57░); about 17 meteors belonging to the same current and

radiant- axis, from a point at 45░, +59░ ; and about 8 others from one of Dr.

Schmidt's radiants at 50░, +62░.

    II. Prof. Serpieri, in another paper, records a strong display of the zodiacal

light on the evening of the 12th December, 1873 ; also that Professor
Denza had noticed the same evening at Montcalieri, in Piedmont, a remark-

able " lucidity" over the entii'e sky. An unusual display of meteors (Gemi-
7iids) were also seen at both places the same evening. As many as 80 were

seen, of various sizes, by three observers (at Urbino) between 6'' 20TM and

7'' 15"░. Meteors were also seen on the evenings of the 10th and 13th.

The general centre of radiation was ascertained by Prof. Lorenzoni to be

an area included between the points

This latter place differs somewhat from the centre of radiation for the
" Geminids " of this epoch as given in the British Association Meteor-Atlas,
viz. E.A. 100░, Decl. +33░; most of the meteor-paths recorded were noted

in the constellation of Gemini.

   III. Captain Tupman, E.M.A., in his valuable catalogue of shooting-
stars and their radiant-points, lately distributed by this Committee, gives
no less than 28 distinct subradiant positions connected with the Perseids
giving an average position of 45░-5, +56░-l, as nearly as possible the definite
one observed by Professors Schiaparelli, A. S. Herschel, Serpieri, and
Newton ; and it is also clear from Captain Tupman's observations that the
duration of the Persei'd epoch is nearly a month, or from about July 27th to
August 25th. That it endured from about the 27th July to the 18th or 20th
August, Mr. Greg had previously entertained a strong conviction. The
interesting and important question as to the radiant-area of the Perseid
shower being only a very diffuse one, or in which direction it is elongated, or
whether it contains several distinct minor or S(f6streams of meteors and sub-
radiants, has not yet been determined with certainty. During the past year

Mr. J. E. Clark undertook the projection on separate maps, for intervals of
successive five minutes (where the observations were sufficiently numerous),
of the tracks of upwards of 2000 Perseids described in the volumes of these
Eeports for former years, with a view to discover motions of the radiant-

jDoint on successive days or hours of the night ; but, as far as could bo judged,
witbout success, although a progressive motion on successive nights, like that
observed by Prof. Twining in 1859, was thought to be traceable. Oscilla-
tions of the radiant-point accompanying the successive outbursts (with inter-
vening lulls between them) very commonl}"^ occurring in the apparent inten-
sity of the shower, were also unsupported by any signs of concentration, in
these meteor-groups, of their apparent directions about definite radiant-
points either movable or referable to a single place. The results in all these
cases, Mr. Clark observes, although not very precise (perhaps on account of
the mixed character of the observations that he employed), point to the con-
clusion naturally to be expected from an assemblage of such miscellaneous
records, that the variations exhibited are utterly irregular from what-
ever point of view it was attempted to examine them.

  A valuable list of upwards of 250 meteor-observations made at the Ead-

cliffe Observatory, Oxford, during the year 1873, under the superintendence
of its director, Mr. Main, has lately been published, of which copies have
been presented to the Committee, and they purpose in a future Iveport to

return to their discussion.

  A fourth number of the annual directions to observers of shooting-stars iu

Italy was issued last year, for the period 1873-74, by Signer Denza, to astro-
nomers and other observers engaged in contributing materials for the work
of reduction continued by Professor Schiaparelli. It may be expected that
the list of radiant-points obtained from these sources will contribute very
largely to the correction and confirmation of the abundant collections of
radiants now obtained, and to settle the doubtful questions of the distinctness
or connexion together in groups or families of certain meteor-showers as

exhibited in the existing lists.

   Important researches have recently been made by Professor Kirkwood, of
Bloomington, U.S.*, on the early recorded appearances of some of the best-
known annual meteor-showers of modern dates. Those of April, October,
and December are found to have been visible in past times in years which
indicate a cycle for these showers of about 285, 27^, and 29 years respec-

tively in their returns. Pursuing the investigation, Professor Kii-kwood

recognizes similar evidence of a recurring period in the recorded dates of

appearance of the star-shower of the 2nd of January, derived, however, prin-
cipally from observations in the present centuryf. The principal appearances
took place about the years 1825, 1838, and 1864, indicating as very probable
a periodic time of revolution of this meteor-ring of about 13 years. [The

next return of the centre of the cluster may thus be expected in 1877; and

allowing two years before and after as occupied by its nodal passage, con-

siderable returns of this meteor-shower may be anticipated during the comiug

years from 1875 to 1879. Note hy the Committee, 1874.]
   Another meteor-system is indicated by Professor Kirkwood as presenting

signs of recurring in old times with some regularity and frequency on a cer-
tain date, of which, imlike that last described, the modern appearances are
cither conjectural and uncertain or entirely wanting J. The annual date of

this shower is from the last two days in April to the first of May ; its period

of revolution appears to be about seven years. Por the possible representa-

tive of the shower in modern meteor-lists, Professor Kirkwood selects the
general shower Qj, ^ in Greg's list of 1867, diverging at the end of April and

in May from the direction of Hercules (/3 Herculis) or Corona, some indica-

tions of that shower having a 12- or 13-year period being also noted in the
meteor-list. In connexion with the very exact day of its periodical returns
or of its present date on the 29th of AprU, Professor Kirkwood points out a
resemblance between the supposed meteor-ring and the computed orbit of
the comet u.c. 136, passing very near the earth's orbit and having its nodal
point coincident with that date*. The radiant-point of meteor-particles from,
the comet at the earth's encounter with it at this node would, however, be
in R.A. 320░, S. Decl. 28░*; and the star- shower that they would prodiice
would only rise above the horizon at daybreak, having been invisible through-
out the night, if the elements of the comet's orbit are correct. Another

comet, that of 1006, similar, apparently, in many respects to that of b.c. 136,

whose orbit is roughly assigned by Pingre as having resembled, from the
comet's course, the orbit of Halley's comet, but with a different line of nodes,
agrees in that respect, and in passing near the earth's orbit, with the April and

May meteor-stream. As far as such imperfect descriptions of these comets

as have been preserved can offer any basement for comparison, the comets of
B.C. 136 and a.d. 1006 might be regarded as (except in the node and peri-
helion distance) resembling very nearly that of Halley's comet. Comets with
such a path as Halley's comet have (for the present epoch) a date of closest

approach to the earth's orbit on May 4th, with a radiant-point at about R.A.

337░, Decl. 0░. In the catalogue of meteors and meteor-showers observed
by Captain Tupman, the appearance of bright star-showers on each of the

nights from April 29th to May 3rd, in the years 1870-71, is recorded as the

principal display of shooting-stars (omitting those of August and November)
included in his three-years' watch, and the position of their radiant-point

(first visible above the horizon at about 1'^ a.m.) is very exactly fixed at

E..A. 326░, S. Decl. 2░-5. The apparent radiant-centi-e of this special shower
differs only ten or twelve degrees from that of Halley's comet ; and the near
coincidence of the time of its appearance with the date of the earth's closest
proximity to the orbit of Halley's comet renders the possible identity of this
meteor-stream with some dismembered fragments of the latter comet a very
suggestive hypothesis, apparently deserving of more complete investigation.

   As a first trial or criterion of the degree of frequency of such accordances
between the apparent paths of meteor-streams and the computed elements
of comet-orbits, as enumerated in a list (compiled chiefly, with later additions,
from that in Hind's work on ' Comets ') in the latest editions of Chambers's
' Handbook of Astronomy,' approximate calculations of the cometary radiant-
points were made in those cases where the comets' paths approach (especially

on the inside) to no great distance from the orbit of the earth. An attempt was

also made to identify some of the radiant- points thus obtained with those
of meteor-showers contained in general and in special mctcor-lists. The
number of approximate, though seldom very close, agreements exceeded the
Committee's expectations ; and however incomplete, and from since ascertained
sources of error in some cases inaccurate t, the list is acknowledged in its

   * [These calculations relate to the year of the comet's appearance. But for the present
time, allowing for the motion of the equinox between the years n.c. 136 and a.d. 1875,
the nodal date and the cometary radiant-poiiit (uninfluenced by pertiu-bations) would be

about on May 28th, and at R.A. 350░, S. Decl. 18░.--A. S. H.]"
   t .ill great errors of this kind, it is believed, liave now been i-emoved. {Note, 1875.)

MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS TO THE SECTIONS.

Address hy The Rev. Pjofessor J. H. Jellett, M.A., M.R.I.A., President of

                                                                 the Section.

myIn opening the business of the Section,                               first duty is, as you will naturally

anticipate, to return my warmest thanks to the British Association for the honour

which they have conferred upon me by inviting me to occupy this Chair. I do it,

I assure you, with all sincerity, fully sensible how high the compliment is ; and if

I do not dwell further upon the subject, it is, as I hope j^ou will believe, because

the President of a Section ought to occupy your time, not by speaking of himself

or his own feelings, but by a re\'iew, more or less extensive, of those branches of

science which form the proper business of the Section.

I say 'и' more or less extensive ; " for in determining what kind of review he will

present to you, the President of this Section has a very wide range of choice.

He may give you a rapid but (in its outline) complete sketch of the progress of
mathematical science during the past year. He may select some one special sub-

ject, probably (and rightly) the subject with which he is himself especially con-

versant, giving of that a more detailed account ; or he may take a middle course,

neither so extensive as the first nor quite so limited as the second. It is this latter

course which I wish now to take, proposing to direct your attention, during the short

time which I can allow myself, to the relations, becoming every day more fully de-

veloped, not only among the branches of science which properly belong to us, but

between our Section and the other Sections of the Association, or, in other words,

between the sciences which we ordinarily call mathematical or physical and some

of the other sciences to which the British Association is devoted.      "    am  the  more

                                                                          I

anxious to direct your attention to this class of subjects, because recent investigation

has shown how fertile for discovery the " border land," if I may so call it, between

sciences hitherto considered distinct has been found to be. Instances in proof of

this will present themselves as we go on ; some have no doubt suggested themselves

to you already.

  We are called, in ordinary language, the Mathematical Section. The adjective

--must indeed be understood in a very wide sense too wide perhaps for strict pro-

Eriety of language, if it be meant to include every thing to which our labours
  ere are devoted ; still the use of the term " mathematical " indicates, and truly

indicates, the preponderance which in this Section we give to mathematics and

to those sciences which are at present capable of mathematical treatment ; and
therefore the first question which in the consideration of our present subject

naturally presents itself is, Does this list of sciences show any prospect of increase ?
Are we making, are we likely to make, an increased use "of mathematics as an

instrument of phvsical investigation ?                                  Are we trving to improve its use in those
                                                                     "

sciences which are ah-eady recognized as belonging to its legitimate province ?

Are we trying to perfect the mathematical treatment of such sciences as optics or

electricity, which have been already brought under the sway of mathematics ?
Are we trying to extend its sway by bringing under it sciences (chemistry, for

example, or biology) in which as yet its power has been but little felt ? Or

have we come to the conclusion, to which some wiiters would lead us, that we

have already pushed the use of mathematics too far ? Is it true, for example, and

do we feel it to be true, that in our anxiety to bring physical optics completely
under the power of mathematical science, we have abandoned the principles of the
inductive philosophy, and substituted mere hypotheses for true knowledge ? And
are we convinced, at least, that every chemist is boimd, as he values the truth and

reality of his science, to resist the introduction into chemistry of the methods of

mathematical analj'sis, if any such attemf)t should be made ?

This latter is the opinion of Comte, whose severe strictures on the appUcation

of mathematical analysis to physical optics I shall have to consider further on

for the present I would confine your attention to the inquiry, What indications on

this subject are presented by the actual progress of physical science? Does its

history exhibit a tendency to widen or to contract the field of mathematical

analysis ?

   In reviewing, -with this purpose, the history of physical science, we may leave

out of sight those sciences, or parts of a science, to which the methods and language

of mathematics are applicable without the aid of hypotheses. No scientific man

doubts the advantage of applying, as far as our analytic powers enable us so to

do, the methods of mathematical analysis to such sciences as plain optics or plain

astronomy. Even pliysical astronomy, although in strict logical precision not

wholly independent of hypothesis, has been long recognized as, in the most proper

sense of the word, a mathematical science. Wherever, in fact, the fundamental

equations rest either on direct observation (as in plain optics) or (as in physical

astronomy) upon an hj'pothesis, if we may venture to call it an hypothesis, so

entirely accepted as universal gravitation, the extension of the methods of mathe-

matics is only limited by the weakness of mathematical analysis itself. But there

are other sciences, as, for example, physical optics, to which mathematical analysis

cannot be applied without tlie intervention of hypotheses more or less uncertain.

And if we would appreciate the true character of scientific progress, the question

which we must put to scientific history is this, Is science becoming more or l&ss

Atolerant of such hypotheses ?  principle is assumed, possessing in itself a certain

amount of plausibility, and capable of mathematical expression, from which we are

able to deduce, as consequences and by mathematical reasoning, phenomena whose

reality may afterwards be proved by direct experiment. And from this experi-
mental verification we infer, with more or less probability, the truth of the original
assumption. The question, then, which we have to put to scientific history is
this. Do the records of science indicate a greater or a less tolerance of this kind

of logic ? Is the mode of phj'sical investigation which I have shortly sketched
gaining or losing the favour of scientific men ?

Passing over sciences like astronomy, which, though not wholly free from

hypothesis, do not give us very extended information on this point, I come to a
part of scientific history to which we may put the question with every probability

--of obtaining (so far, at least, as one science is concerned) a decisive answer I mean,

the history of phj'sical optics.

  We have here a science whose basis is purely hypothetical. The definition of

light is an hypothesis, the nature of the fethereal motion is an hypothesis, even

--the very existence of the tether is an hypothesis hypotheses, indeed, which have

led to conclusions amply verified hj experiment, but hypotheses still. Does the

history of optical science indicate a desire to discard this hypothetical base ?

Does the historj' of this science betray a tendency on tlie part of scientific men to
abandon or neglect mechanical theories of light ? Have physicists given up as

hopeless, or perhaps unphilosophical, the attempt to reduce, by the intervention of

a supposed ajther, the phenomena of light under the mathematical laws which

go\-ern motion ? Are they even abandoning the reasoning or the phraseology of
the undulatory system ? The answer to these questions is not doubtfid. Com-

menciug with Fresnel, more than half a century aj^o, the history of physical optica
is a history of efforts, constantly repeated, to frame what M. de St. Venant has
called " a really rational theory of light."

    Take, for example, the repeated attempts to reconcile the mechanical principle of

continuity with the optical phenomenon of double refraction. When the movement

which we call light passes from one medium to another, if the molecular movement
be continuous, it is hard to see how the elastic force of the tether can be different
at different sides of the plane of separation. It would seem, then, that the principle
requires that the elastic force of the aether should be the same in all media. But if
it be the same in a crystalline as in an uuciystalline medium, it ought to be the
same in every direction ; and if it be the same in every direction, how are we to
account for the phenomenon of double refraction ? The effort to overcome this
difficulty may be said to have engaged the attention of Cauchy during all the latter
part of ills life. The same question was taken up after his death by other writers,

among whom I may mention M. Boussinesq as the most recent, and is to this day
a question of gi-eat' interest to mathematical physicists. I am not now inquiring

whether the reasoning which I have just stated be valid, or whether the dilficuJty,

which some writers do not appear to have felt, be real. I allude to it only as a

proof of the anxiety felt by men who have borne the gi-eatest names in optical

science to have a complete mechanical theory of light. It would be easy to mul-
tiply instances, affecting all the great phenomena of optics, which evince the same

anxiety.

   Another and even stronger proof of the firm footing which the undulatovy theoiy
has obtained in the world of science is the familiarity with which we use the terms

of that theory, as if they denoted actual physical realities. "\A"hen, not long since,

much labour was expended in calculating the wave-lengths for the several rays of
the spectrum, there does not appear to have been among physicists any conscious-

ness that they were discussing, and even professing to measure, things which had

no existence but in the fancy of mathematicians. On the contrary, we have come
to speak of wave-lengths quite as freely and as familiarly as we speak of indices of
refraction. Nor is this true only of detached memoirs, which mi^ht be supposed to

represent only individual opinion. The language and the principles of the undu-

--latory theory have found their way into our ordinary text-books a sure proof that

these principles have been generally accepted by the scientific world. I am not now

discussing the question whether, regarded as an indication of scientific progress, this

fact is favourable or unfavourable. I only say that it is a fact. M. Comte has done
all that the hard words of a man of great genius could do to banish theories of

light from the domain of science, but his greatest admirer will hardly say that he

has been successful.

    I pass to the consideration of another branch of science, closely comiected with,
and indeed including, physical optics, and exemplii^ying, even more strongly, the

desire of scientific men to extend the sway of mathematics over physical science

I mean. Molecular Mechanics. This branch of mechanical science (if, indeed, it be

not more correct to say, this science) is altogether modern. Fifty j^ears ago it had

hardly begun to exist,' and even now it is in a very imperfect condition. Imperfect
as it is, however, it has advanced far enough to mark the progress of science in the
direction which I have indicated. And as it is a science more general than physical
optics, the indications which we can gather from it are more important. Physical
optics does not take us outside our own Section ; molecular mechanics shows a

Kmarked tendency to carry mathematical analysis into the domain of chemistry.

it shall ever be possible to establish an intimate connexion between this latter

science and theoretical mechanics, it is probably here that we shall find the con-

necting link. In truth it is impossible to contemplate the ever-growing tendency

of science to see in so many natural phenomena varieties of motion, without anti-
cipating a time when mathematical dynamics (the science which has already
reduced so many of the phenomena of motion beneath the power of mathematical

analysis) shall be admitted to be the universal interpreter ot nature, as completely

as it is now admitted to be the interpreter of the motions of the planets. I do not

of scientific thought is setting strongly in that direction. The constant tendency of

scientific thought is, as I have said, to increase the number of those phenomena

--which are regarded as mere varieties of motion. Sound that we ha-\e placed on the

list long since. Light, though here our conclusions are more hypothetical, we have

also long regarded as belonging to the same category ; and Heat mav now be fairly

added                            and we have almost learned,                                                                                                                                 under the  guidance of  Professor "Williamson,
                              ;

to regard chemical combination as a phenomenon of the same kind. All the.se phe-

nomena (of sound, of light, of heat, and perhaps even of chemical combination)

--we now regard as produced by the movements of sj'stems of exceedingly small par-

ticles whether of known particles, as in the case of sound, or of the hypothetical

sether, as in the case of light ; and a science which proposes to itself the mathe-

matical discussion of the laws which govern the movements of such systems can

hardly fail to play an important part in the future history of physicarscience. I

shall not then, I hope, be thought to misemploy the time of the Section by ofiering

some observations on the science of molecular dj-namics.

 --When we have to deal with a science which professes to be more than a mathe-

matical abstraction a science which assumes to itself the function of representing,

--with at least approximate truth, the realities of nature our first question will

naturally be. What is the basis on which it rests ? Is it built upon a pure hypo-

thesis, not derived from experiment, but seeking to justify its claim to reality by

the truth of the results which may be deduced from it ?

The word "molecule," as Prof Clerk Maxwell has told us, is modern, embody-

ing an idea derived from modern chemistry. It denotes a material particle so small

as to be incapable of subdivision into parts similar in their nature to itself Thus

a drop of water may be divided into smaller drops, each of which is also water ; but

a molecule of water is regarded as incapable of such division. Not that we regard

it as absolutely indivisible ; but we assume that a further division, could it be

effected, would produce molecules, not of water, but of its component gases, hydro-

gen and oxygen.

  Now this conception of a molecule undoubtedly involves an hypothesis. Are

there such ultimate particles of matter, not only resisting all the dividing forces

which we can command, but absolutely indivisible, by any force, into particles

similar to each other, or perhaps into particles of any kind ? Or are we to suppose

that^ if we had instruments of sufiicient delicacy, the process of divi.Цion might be

carried on without limit ? Experiment gives lis no means of deciding between

these alternatives ; and if the exigencies of our method of investigation force us to

make a decision, we can make it only by an hypothesis. But we may fairly ask,

Does the logic of molecular dynamics absolutely require this decision ? And on this
point I wish to ofier one or two remarks. When we propose to determine the

motion of a body, solid or fluid, we ought, as indeed in all scientific problems, to

form in the first place a clear conception of the meaning of the qiiestion which we
We --propose to ourselves.
                                 wish to discover the laws which govern the motion of

what ? Not certainly of the body taken as a whole. That is, no doubt, part of

the information which we seek, but a veiy small part of it. When we have learned

to determine by a fixed mathematical rule, or formula as we generally call it, the

position occupied at any instant by the centre of gi-avity of the body and by its

principal axes, we have learned something, but the investigation is far froni' being

complete. There are, as you know, large classes of movements of which such

knowledge would tell us nothing. Thus, to take a familiar instance, you see a man

Cto use our ordinary language) "sitting quiet." He is at rest, so far as the move-

ment of the body, taken as a whole, is concerned. He is neither turning on his

chair nor walking about the room                                                                                                                                                             and yet there  is  probably  not a single particle
                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

of his body which is absolutely quiescent. You see, then, how ignorant we are of

the vital movements of the human body, if we know only that the individual is

" sitting quiet."

But suppose that we push the inquiry a little further and propose to investigate
Wethe motion of the blood.
                                 obtain an answer to this question in one sense by
--detenuining the rate at which the blood, taken as a whole, is moving that is to

say, suppose the number of ounces of blood which pass through the mitral valve

in the space of one minute ; but having learned this, we are still very far from

                             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                                                           O

knowing completely the motion of the blood. But suppose that we were able to

--assign at any instant the position of each one of the blood-globules considered as a

unit that is to say, suppose we coidd assign for each of these globules the position

of its centre of gravity and the positions of its principal axes, we should then
know the motion of the blood, not, indeed, perfectly (for we should still be ignorant
of the motion of the serum as well as of the internal movements which take place
in each globule), but very much more completely than before.

   Further (and this is the point to which I wish especially to direct your attention),
these results would be equally true, whether the globules were really units, inca-

pable of further subdivisiou, or really aggregates of still smaller particles. In the

former case we should know perfectly the motion of that part of the blood which

consists of the red globules ; in the latter, we should know the same motion, but

not perfectly ; that is to say, our results, though true as far as they go, would leave

us still in ignorance of one or more classes of motions which are really exhibited
Weby the globules of the blood.
                                                                                                                            should then be obliged to imagine a still further

subdivision. If, for example, we divided, in imagination, each globule into a

thousand parts, and could determine the motion of each part considered as a unit,

our results would still further approximate to completeness ; and so on for further

subdivisions. The logic of molecular dynamics may then be shortly stated as

follows :

   In seeking to form the equations of motion of a body, solid or fluid, we com-
mence by an imaginary division of the body into elements of any arbitrary mag-
nitude, and we form the equations of motion for each of these elements considered
as a unit. The results so obtained are true, but, as long as the elements retain a
finite magnitude, incomplete. They do not give us full information as to the
movement of the system. But suppose now, adopting the spirit of the differential

calculus, that the magnitude of tliese elements is constantly diminished ; then it

will be found that, as in the differential calculus, these equations tend towards a

certain limiting form, constantly approaching it as the magnitude of the elements

is  continually diminished                                                                                         and  in  this limiting form these equations are not only
                                                                                                                ;

true but complete.

    Stated in this general form, the principles of molecular dynamics are not only

perfectly logical, but wholly free from hypothesis. IlypotJieses have, no doubt,

been freely introduced for the purpose of forming the actual equations in any given

case                     but molecular dynamics,                                                                        as  such,  is not an hypothetical  science.  The word
                      ;

molecular is in some respects unfortunate, as tending to identify the science with a

particular hypothesis as to the constitution of matter. But molecular dynamics as

a science has no necessary connexion with the molecidar hypothesis. In truth

the methods of this science harmonize quite as readily vdth the supposition of the

infinite divisibility of matter as with the supposition of ultimate molecules.

    Molecular djTiamics may fairly be called the differential calculus of physical

science. It is, in its relation to physical science, what the differential calculus is
in its relation to geometry. As in geometry, when we would pass from the small
and excejjtional class of rectilinear figures to the infinite varieties of curve-lines,
we must invoke the aid of the differential calculus, so when we would pass from

the abstractions of rigid solids and unbending surfiices to the contemplation of

bodies as they really exist in nature, must we, if we would fully investigate their

phenomena, invoke the aid of molecular dynamics. It is the science of that phe-
nomenon which is gradually drawing all others within its sway ; it is the science

of that phenomenon which, " changed in all and yet in all the same," we have

learned to see in every part of nature. Molecular dynamics is the science of

--Motion in its widest and truest sense of the motion which passes along in the
--sweep of the tempest or the fierce throb of the earthquake of the motion (no

less real) which breathes in the gentlest whisper or thrills along the minutest

nerve.

   I have dwelt thus long upon the subject of molecular dynamics because the
amount of attention which in the present century it has commanded, and the gi-eat
advance which it has made, mark most distinctly the tendency of scientific thought

to the introduction of mathematical analysis into all parts of physical science ; for
molecular dynamics is the key to this introduction. It is to the perfection of this

science that we must look for an increased use of the mathematical instrument
and when we combine the indications afforded by the history of this science with
those which we may derive from the historj' of its principal application (Physical

--Optics) we have at least this partial answer to our question Matheniiitical

analysis shows no sign of relaxing its grasp upon any of the sciences which have

been hitherto considered to belong to its domain ; nay, more, the desire to extend

that domain is indicated by the efforts to perfect the instrument by which that

extension must be made. "\Ve may now ask, Is this indication confirmed by the

history of any of those sciences which have been hitherto regarded as hing wholly

without our Section ?

  And first, what shall we say of Section B ? Does chemical science show any

indications pointing to a future union with the group already collected under the

genus (if I may so call it) Theoretical Mechanics ? Take, for example, the gi-eat
problem of chemical combination. Does the treatment of this problem now show

any signs pointing in the direction of dynamical science ? I desire here to speak

with all reserve and even hesitation, being conscious that I am no long-er on familiar

gi'ound. Still there are signs whicli even an outside spectator may read. And we

may, I think, speak confidently of their direction, although the goal to which they

point is far distant and may perhaps be imattainable.

   One of these signs is the appearance of time as one of the elements of a che-
mical problem. And in recognizing the necessity of a certain time for the produc-
tion of a chemical effect, chemists are now pointing not obscurely to the analogy

of mechanical science. "Time," says Berthelot, "is necessary for the accomplish-
ment of cliemical reactions, as it is for all the other mechanical phenomena." This

might not in itself be very significant ; but chemists have not merely recognized the

necessity of time as a condition for the production of chemical phenomena, they

have also undertaken to measure it ; or rather, taking the converse problem, they

have undertaken to measure the amount of chemical effect produced in the unit of

time                      and the law of this phenomenon announced by Berthelot takes  (necessarily,
                       ;

indeed) a mathematical form quite analogous to equations which present them-

selves in dynamical science. The next step has followed as a matter of course,
and chemists now speak as familiarly of the velocity of chemical reactions as engi-

neers do of the velocity of a cannon-ball.

Still more important in its bearing on the future of chemistiy, and tending

distinctly in the same direction, is the theory of Chemical Combination, which

science ovies to Prof. "Williamson, and according to which this phenomenon, like so

Wemany others, ought to be regarded as in gi-eat measure a mode of motion.

suppose the normal condition of the atomic constituents of a body to be motion, not

rest ; and when we say that a molecule of one substance enters into combination
with a molecule of another substance, we do not mean that the same molecules

constantly adhere together, but that the union between the molecules, whatever

be its nature, is continually dissolved and as continually re-formed. According to

this theory, chemical equilibrium does not denote molecidar rest, but a system of

molecular motion, in which these decompositions and recompositions balance each

other.

If I may ventm-e to add any thing to that which comes from such an authority,

I would say that this theory leads us naturally to regard the chemical properties

of bodies as, if not wholly modes of motion, yet largely dependent upon the nature

of the movements which take place among their constituent atoms. Hence, if two

bodies incapable of chemical action are brought into chemical presence of each

other, we may suppose that their atomic movements, and therefore theii' properties,

remain unaltered. If, on the other hand, these bodies be capable of acting che-

micaU}' on each other, their atomic movements are modified by their mutual

chemical presence ; and therefore the chemical properties of the compound, as we
call it, may be wholly different from those of either of the bodies which have

entered into combination.

  Now we are not yet prepared to consider chemical combination as a problem of

molecular dvTiamics. \\'e have not sufficiently clear ideas (even hypothetical

ideas) of these atomic movements, and of the modifications which are caused by

the chemical presence of another body, to place the investigation of these phe-
                                                              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                        7

nomena in the same category with the investigation of the phenomena of physical

optics ; and I am sure that any attempt to hasten unduly the affiliation of
chemistry to theoretical dynamics would be productive of serious mischief. The

drift of the remarks which I have made has been only to show that the current of
scientific thought is setting in that direction ; and while we may not predict such

an affiliation, still less should we be justified in pronouncing it to be beyond the

possibilities or even the probabilities of science.

Time will only allow me to notice very briefly another important application of

--mathematics to a branch of science considered hitherto to be altogether beyond the

limits of our Section, I refer to the application of the methods of geometry and

theoretical mechanics to Biological science recently made by Professor Ilaughtou.

The first example which I shall notice is the establishment of a principle govern-

ing the animal frame, and quite analogous to the principle of " least action " in

dynamics. This principle asserts that every muscle is so framed as to perform the

greatest amount of work under the given external circumstances. If this principle
be admitted as an a priori truth, the an-angement of any given muscle may be

mathematically deduced from it ; but many, no doubt, will prefer to regard it as an
inductive truth established by the number of instances which Professor Haughton

has adduced and discussed. Among these the work done by the human heart is

considered                                                    and in order more  fully to exemplify the principle  of the economy  of
                                                           ;

work, Professor Haughton has imagined a very obvious construction of the heart

in which the principle would be violated, contrasting this with the actual con-

struction in which, as he has shown, the principle is preserved.

Professor Haughton has also made much use of the geometry of curved surfaces

in estimating the action of the non-plane muscles.

On the whole tlie work of Professor Haughton is a remarkable example of

the increasing use of mathematical methods in the investigation of pliysical

problems.

 We --have put to scientific history the important question Is it probable that the

dominion of mathematics over physical science will be more widely extended than

it is at present ? Is it probable, not only that we shall improve the mathematical

instrument as applied to those sciences which are already recognized as belonging

to the legitimate province of mathematical analysis, but also that we shall learn to
apply the same instrument to sciences which are now v/hoUy or partially inde-
pendent of its authority ? And to this question I think that scientific history must

answer. Yes, it is probable. It is probable, because physical science is learning

more and more every day to see in the phenomena of nature modifications of that

one phenomenon which is peculiarly under the power of mathematics. It is probable,

because science already indicates the path by which that advance will be made,

because we already possess in molecular dynamics a method (the creation, I may

almost say, of om* own age, and still very imperfect) whose proper subject is

motion not in any limited or abstract sense, but as widely as it really exists in

nature. And it is probable, because we cannot look back on the history of
science for the last fifty years without becoming conscious how large is the advance

which has been already made.

I have thus far endeavoured to show to you the light which is thrown on the

connexion between physical science and mathematical analysis by actual scientific

history ; and I have given you some reasons for believing, so far as it is permitted
to us to read the future, that this connexion is likely to extend still more widely.

   But before we pass from this part of the subject, we are bound to ask the

question. Are we to regard this indication as being favourable to the cause of
scientific progress ? Shall we regard the tendency to use, as far as possible, the

mathematical instrument in physical investigation as being likely to extend our

real knowledge of nature ? Or will its result be merely to encourage the formation

of vain hypotheses, recommended only by their capability of mathematical expres-
sion, and deeply injuring the cause of science by means of the facility with which

men accept such speculations as real knowledge ? This latter opinion seems to be,

on the whole, that of Ccmte, whose severe strictures upon physical theories of light

I have noticed before.

  Now I believe that the advocate of the matliematical method of investigation

might be, and would be, perfectly content to fight the battle of mathematical physics

Weon the ground which Comte himself has chosen.          have put one important

question to the history of science, let us put another.

Has the effect of theories of light upon the progi-ess of real optical knowledge

(knowledge which Comte himself would admit to be real) been beneficial or

injurious ?

This question belongs to a class to which the answer is never easy. It is never

an easj' task to abstract one from a group of causes which concur in the production

of an effect, and then determine how the eflfect would have been changed by such
removal. Still we may succeed in obtaining at least a partial answer to the

question.

It has been frequently remarked as one of the benefits conferred upon physical

science by theory, tliat it suggests experiment. Nowhere is this principle more

strongly exemplified than in the history of perhaps the greatest name in optical

--science I mean, Fresnel. He is an experimentalist certainly ; but he is an experi-

mentalist because he is a theorist. His most valuable experiments had their origin

in the desire to test the truth of a theory. The experiment with the two mirrors

were devised to test Young's principle of interference. His diffraction experiments
were devised at first to test the truth of Young's theory ; and when that had been
found to be inconsistent with fact, then to test the truth of his own. And, not to

multiply instances, the experiments by which he established the existence of cir-

cular polarization, and ascertained the true nature of the light which passes along

the axis of a quartz crj'stal, were suggested by theory.

   Among tlie motives which induced Jamin to undertake the experimental

researches which have given to science such valuable results, not the least was the

desire to test the truth of an hj-pothetical principle of Fresnel and of a theoretic

formula of Cauchy. And quite recently M. Abria has made an elaborate examina-

tion of uniaxal refraction for the purpose of testing the truth of the construction

of Iluyghens. I may here remark that it is mucli to be desired that some com-

petent observer would undertake the yet more diflicult task of verifying experi-

mentally the wave-surface of Fresnel.

   But to revert to the general subject. If any physicist is inclined to agree with

the views of Comte upon this subject, let me propose to him the following test :

Let him strike out of physical optics every thing which that science owes to theories

of light, and then let him try to vtrite a treatise on the subject, excluding the lan-

guage and the ideas of theory. Finally, let him compare his work with some trea-

tise in which these aids have not been neglected, and judge himself of their relative

value. Theoretic science need not be afraid of the result.

  Natiu'ally suggested by the subject which we have been considering, namely,

the tendency of scientific progress to a reduction of aU physical science under the

power of mathematical analysis, is the gradual development of connexions between
the different members of that great group to which we give the name of physical

science. And among the instances of such growing relationship I take, also sug-

gested by the topics which have engaged us, the connexion between optics and
chemistry. I only say "suggested " by our former subject, for I do not desire to

attach any undue significance to the fact that of these connected sciences one may

already be called a mathematical science. As yet the connexion between these

sciences has consisted principally in the introduction into chemistrj'^ of an analysis

in some respects more refined than any which has been hitherto known. And this

fact does not in itself indicate the extension to chemistry of the mathematical

character which belongs to physical optics. Still, if we hold the assumption
of this character by any science to be the mark of perfection, we shall be in-

clined to regard every improvement in its instruments of research as tending in

that direction.

In speaking of the connexion between Optics and Chemistry, the topic which

will occur first to every one is the Spectroscope ; but on this part of the subject it

is not necessary that I should dwell. It has so largely occupied the attention of

physicists, and has been so fully treated by those who have made it their special

study, that I could not hope to add any thing to what they have said. I would

only observe that the spectroscope has enabled chemistry to overleap a barrier
                                             --

                   TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                          9"

which Comte prououiiced to be insurniouutable, and which would have excludod

from the objects of chemical research any thing lying without the limits of our

earth. Comte warned us that our knowledge of the planetaiy worlds was neces-

--sarily limited to their geometrical and mechanical properties to the nature of their
--movements, and the forces by which they are produced, and that all inquiry into

the constituent elements of the planets or their atmospheres was for ever, and by the

necessities of the case, interdicted to us. But the spectroscope has told quite

another storj'.

 --But there is another point of contact between optics and chemistry, another

spot on the border-land between these two sciences which, I think, promises also

--to be fertile in discovery, I mean the use of polarized light as an instrument of

chemical analysis. It is true that the application of this instrument is limited in

its extent. The physical property on which this application depends (namely, the

power possessed by certain liquids to change the plane of polarization of a trans-

mitted ray, or, as it is commonly called, the rotatory power) is almost wholly con-

fined to' the organic world, and is not universal even there. Still, within this

limited range, the application of polarized light is capable of solving, or aiding to

solve, chemical problems which chemistry proper would probably find very difficult.

Let me give you two examples.

1. Is it true that an acid salt is decomposed by solution ? Or, taking the ques-

tion in another form : If to a solution of a neutral salt there be added, atom for
atom, a quantity of its own acid, does that additional atom of acid enter into com-

bination, or does it remain free ? It has been usually inferred from the thermic

researches of Dr. Andrews, followed up by Favi-e, Silbermann, Berthelot, and others,

that the second alternative is the true one, the solvent being water. Now, if the

problem be varied a little by making the solvent spirit, the application of polarized

light gives us this important information :

If to an alcoholic solution of the ordinary nitrate of qulnia there be added an

additional equivalent of acid, this additional equivalent does enter into combination

with the nitrate.

This information leaves to us the alternative of supposing that the ordinary

nitrate, sulphate, &c. of quinia are not neutral but basic salts, or of admitting that

an acid salt is not always decomposed by solution, at least in spirit.

  2. When an acid is added to a solution containing two bases, the salts formed

being also soluble, does the acid divide itself between the bases ? and if so, what is

the law which governs the division ?

The application of polarized light enables us to solve this question for some of

the organic bases, proving that there is a continuous partition of the acid, and

enabling us in one case, and probably in many others, to assign the law according

to which the partition is made.

One more instance may suffice to exemplify the advantage which chemistry proper

has already derived from its union with optics. I take this instance from the general

problem of saccharometry.

  We have long known how to analyze, both optically and chemically, a solution

containing two kinds of sugar, one of which is sucrose. But as each of these methods

gives but two equations, it is plain that neither is sufficient where the unknown

quantities are more than two. If, then, as is very commonly the case, there are

present in the solution three kinds of sugar, we cannot obtain a complete analysis,

either from optica or from chemistry. But, as Dr. Apjohn has recently shown, this

problem, insoluble by either method taken alone, is readily solved by a combination

of both methods. An important step is thus made in the application of optics to

chemistry. Instead of merely giving to chemistry a new solution of a problem

which chemistry could solve without any assistance, optics has aided chemistry to.

solve a problem which chemistry unaided might have found very difficult.

   But it is time that I should bring these remarks to a close ; and I recur, in con-

 --Let none presume to fix the bounds of Science. " Hitherto shalt thou come, but

to see but a few steps in advance. And when at times a tliiclcer darkness has

seemed to gather before them, men have recoiled as fi-om an impassable barrier,

and for a while that path has been closed. But only for a while. Some happy
accident, some more daring adventurer, it may be time itself, has shown that the'

darkness was but a cloud. The light of Science has pierced it ; the march of

Science has left it behind ; and the impossibility of one generation is for the next

but the record of a new triumph.

If seeming plausibility could give to man the right to draw across any path of

scientific discovery an impassable line, sm-ely Oomte might be justified in the line

which he drew across the path of chemistry. Fifty years ago it might seem no'

unjust restriction to say to the chemist, Your field of discovery lies within the

bounds of our own earth. You must not hope to place in your laboratory the

distant planet ,or the scarce-visible nebula. You must not hope to determine the

constituents of their atmospheres as you would analj'ze the air which is aroimd your

own door ; and you never will do it. Fifty years ago no chemist woidd have

complained that chemical discovery was imjustly limited by such a sentence; per-

haps no chemist would have refused to join in the prediction. Yet even those who

heard it uttered have lived to see the prediction falsified. Tliej^ have seen the

barrier of distance vanish before the chemist, as it has long since vanished before

the astronomer. They have seen the chemist, like the astronomer, penetrate the

vast abyss of space and bring back tidings from the worlds beyond, Comte might

Wewell think it impossible.  know it to be true.

We have learned from this episode of scientific history that the attempt to draw

an impassable line between the domain of the chemist and the domain of the astro-

nomer was not justified by the result. Another generation may learn to obliterate

as completely the line between the domain of the chemist and the domain of the

mathematician. AVhen that shall be, when Science shall have subjected all natural

phenomena to the laws of Theoretical Mechanics, when she shall be able to predict

the residt of every combination as unerringly as Hamilton predicted conical refrac-

--tion or Adams revealed to us the existence of Neptune that we cannot say. That
Weday may never come, and it is certainly far in the dim future.

   The author remarked that the similarity between the expressions for the com-
ponents, round the principal axes through the centre of giavity of a rigid mass A,

Bof the moment due to the attraction of a distant body and those forthe compo-

Anents of the moment due to the centrifugal force arising from a rotation of round

an axis would naturally suggest a physical resemblance between the two ; and he

Ashowed, from Newton's construction, that the couple exerted on by the attraction

of a distant body B, of mass L and at a distance a, is the same in magnitude as,

and opposite in sign to, that which would result from the rotation of A, with an
angular velocity o\ round a line in the direction of the distant body, and passing

On Statical and Kinematical Analof/iies. By Professor J. D, Everett.

A B AIf we take a line
to represent a force along B, the moment of this fin'ce

A Bround any point P will be represented by double the area of the triangle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           P.

A B AIf we take the same line
                                to represent a velocity of rotation round B, the

Psame double area will represent the velocity of due to this rotation.

AN^c have thus a dii-ect proof that a force acting along a line is the analogue of a

velocity of rotation round it.

]3y supposing the line to be indefinitely distant, we obtain a couple as the analogue

of a velocity of translation.

The moment of a force round a line is the analogue of the component velocity,

along this line, of any point upon it ; and the resultant moment round a point due

to any comliination of forces and couples is the analogue of the resultant velocity of

a point due to any combination of velocities of rotation and translation.

In these statements, the moment of a force round a point is not regarded as a mere

magnitude, but as a quantity having direction ; in other words, as the moment of

a couple whose plane passes through the point and the line of action of the force.

The velocity which is the analogue of the moment will coincide in dii'ection with

the axis of this couple.

   The only kinematical principles required for the demonstration of the above ana-
logies are (1) tlie parallelogram of velocities for a particle, and (2) the proposition
that the velocity of a point due to rotation round an axis is perpendicular to the
plane of the point and axis, and proportional jointly to the angular velocity and

the distance of tlie point from the axis.

     On a New Application of Quaternions. By Professor J. D. Everett.

   If TT denote a velocity of translation, regarded as a vector, and o- a velocity of rota-

tion round the origin, represented by a vector drawn along its axis, we may write,

                                p = w+Va-p,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (1)

where p denotes the velocity of the particle whose vector is p.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Hence the symbol

                                        ^+Va( )                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   (2)

is a complete representation of the velocity of a rigid body.
   Again, if -or denote a couple (represented by its axis), and <r a force at the origin,

the value of p in equation (1) is the resultant moment roimd the point whose vector
is p. Hence the above expression (2) represents a system of forces acting on a rigid

body.
                                                                                                                      . 1. .
   The expression (2) affords remarkable facility for the discussion of such subjects

as the composition of velocities of a rigid body, the general properties of systems of
forces, the conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body under constraint, and the rate

at which a system of forces does worlc upon a moving body.

Mathematics,' commencing with the Number for July 1874.

of paititions raiy be reduced to that of the expansion of algebraical fractions. In this

way Cayley has regarded the question in his memoir in the Philosophical Transactions,

185G, p. 127, where, besides considering the general decomposition into partial frac-
tions of the expression to be expanded, he has given the values of P(l, 2).r, P(l, 2, 3)
.r,. , . ., P(l, 2, 3, 4, 5).r, and in the Philosophical Transactions, 1858, p. 52, also of

P(l, 2, 3, 4, 5, G).v, P(l, 2, 3, . . . .r)x denoting the number of ways of partitioning
X into the elements 1, 2, 3, 4. . . .?и. The subject is also considered by Sylvester

(Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, vol. i. pp. 81 and 141, 185"), who likewise has

treated it (though very differently) as an expansion problem. It may, however, be
regarded in another light as follows :

    It is known that if we form the literal derivations of a power of a letter, say a*,

 according to Arbogast's rule, viz.

                                             Фs

                            a'd, a^hc, alP
                            a^e, ci^bd, d'c'-, ab'c, fr',

=then each term con-espouds to a partition ; thus if a= 1, 6 2,. . . .a* corresponds to

1, 1, 1, 1, a^b to 1, 1, 1, 2, the third line to 1, 1, 1, 3, and 1, 1, 2, 2, and so on, viz.

we have the partitions into four parts of the numbers 4, 5, G,. . . . , the w+lth line

Ф+4(the ╗ith derivation) giving the partitions of                                           into four parts. But by a Iniown

theorem the number of partitions of w+r into r parts is equal to the number of

partitions of ╗i into the elements 1, 2, 3,. . . ,r. Thus the number of terms in the

.rth derivation of Ф' is equal to P(l, 2, 3, 4).t, and generally the ,rth derivation of

Ф" contains P(l, 2, 3,. . . .n)x terms. From these considerations the value of
P(l, 2, 3, . . . .n)x can be found in the way which will now be briefly explained.

result.

  From the derivations of Ф' we find 4^ = 13-f.2-+3'+4''; so that the differential

         The complementary function is (A, B, 0, D) circlor 4^, which a little consideration

    shows may be written in the form P+(Q, -- Q) per 2^+(R, S, -- R, -- S) per 4^; so

     that in finding the particular integi'al we are not to calculate the terms of the form

   The general method of treatment is now clear, and it is unnecessaiy in this abstract

=to proceed further. Thus for 5* we should have the relation 5^ 1^ +2^ +3- +4^ -fo",

the law being evident ; and it will have been seen that by the use of prime circu-
lators (in which the sum of the coefficients is zero) the result is exhibited in the

most convenient form, as when so expressed it may be written (A+B(o~^+C<u~*'

+ --. . . .)(B''-f-&c., Q) being an nth root of imity; and the operation (E""*"^ 1)~^ is

performed at once on the circulator as it stands, since o -- 1 is a factor of the coef-

ficient of CO*. It will also be remarked that we can always express (A,,, Aj, ....

Ф--A(,_i) cu'clor a^ as a series of prime cii'culators, one for each factor of                having

the same number of constants ; and that v/henever the complementary function so

expressed contains a term identical in form with one which already appears in the

equation of differences, we shall (as is known from the theory of such equations)
have to expand or differentiate, and so obtain a term with a new form of coefficient

to the same prime circulator. Since w"=l"~^+2"~^. . . . -\-n░, we see that, to de-

termine the partitions of x into the n elements 1, 2, . . . .Ф, we should require to sub-

stitute the values of (n-iy^^, (Ф-2)'+2  2'+"-2                            so that if n were  large  the

                                                                        ;

work would be laborious.

   There is an interesting class of questions which arise in connexion with Arbogast's

derivations, and which admit of solution by the principles explained above. If we
consider, for example, the second derivation of a', viz. (v'c and a"6^, we notice that

a^c in any succeeding derivation can never give rise to more than one term, while

arb- gives rise to a'-hc aud ab^. The terms in any derivation therefore are of two

kinds, viz. are (1) extinct or steiile terms which merely continue to give lise in each
derivation to one term of the same type as themselves, or (2) active or prolific terms
which will give rise to two terms in some subsequent derivation. Thus in the

fourth derivation of a^ the active terms are crc'^, ab^c, and 6', wliile ere and d^bd are

extinct. In fact all terms are extinct except those in which the last letter is raised

to a power, or in which the last two letters are consecutive.

Suppose it now requked to find the number of extinct terms in the xih. derivation

=of u" ; let 2' denote this number, then, as before, 2- 11+2░ and 2'+2-2'=l, but
=here 2^ and 2^ =0. Solving aud determining the constants, we have

                          2-=i{2^-l+(l,-l)pcr2_,}.

   Let o' denote the number of extinct terms in the .rth derivation of Ф', then 3*

= +1^+2' 3░, aud the equation of differences is

                             3-+3_3*=|^2^+5+(l,_l)pcr2^^i} .

                               On some Conversions of Motion*.
          By H. Hakt, M.A., late Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

   1. The positive and negative Peaucellier cells may be combined together by the

   addition of two extra bars to either, thus making a complete double cell composed

   of two rhombs jointed together, giving four points. A, a, 3, B, lying always in a

   A B Bstraight line a, ^ being the poles, or the fulcrum of a positive, and A, being

   the poles, a or ^ the fulcrum of a negative Peaucellier cell. Thus each cell has

   two fulcra as well as two poles, the convenience of the second fulcrum being mani-

   Bfest in the tracing of certain discontinuous curves. As an example, let A, be

   the poles, a, /3 the fulcra of a negative cell. A', B', a', 3' the poles and fulcra of an

   exactly similar cell, c- being the modulus of either.

   BLet A, B' be fixed .and A', be connected by a bar whose length 2& = AB'. Let
   >the fulcra /3, ^' be fixed together. Then if c be 6, /3 will trace out the continuous
   < Boval of Cassini, but if c be J, /3 will ti-ace out an oval surrounding ; if ^, /3' be
   Aset free, and a, a' fixed, this point Ф will trace out the conjugate round A.
                                                                                   similar

   statement may be made with regard to the positive cell.

   N.B. While /3 traces the Cassinian, a and a trace out a certain Cartesian t.
   2. If four bars, AD, BC, AB, CD, equal two and two, be jointed so as to form the

   eqnal diagonals and equal but not parallel sides of a trapezium ABDO, and if

   ACQPP'Q' be a straight line parallel to  or BD, cutting the four bars above in the

   points P, P', Q, Q' respectively, then these points are such that

                   QP, QP' = Q'P, Q'P' = PQ, PQ'=FQ, P'Q'=constant

   Bhence Q, P, P', Q' are equivalent to the four points A, a, ^, of the completed

   Peaucellier cell described above. By means of the abo'Ne system of four bars it is

   evident that, by the addition of a bar which causes I' or P' to move in a circle

   Qpassing through or Q', we make P' or P move in a straight line. This contradicts

   the statement made (I believe) by Professor Tchebicheft", that seven bars at least are

   requisite for the conversion of circular into rectilinear motion.

      u. If, further, one of the four bars, say AD, be fixed, then the point on the bar

   AD=BC =which is equal to the one fixed describes the immerse of a conic; for if
   AB=OD = P2a, 26, and c=the distance of the fixed point from the centre of the

   bar AD, it is easily seen that the equation to the locus of P' is

                              ih--ia^a\ri'6={p-2ccos6Y-,

   which, when inverted and transformed to Cartesian coordinates, becomes

                =(i^ -c^)a;H(&' a')y''+2cK-x ii' (2k- being the modulus).

       4. Professor Sylvester (to whom I am indebted for various suggestions and

   remarks connected with this paper) has shown that three points otherwise fi-ee may

   be made collinear by the use of fifteen bars ; by help of the above trapezium motion
   n points may be made collinear by the use of oh -- 4 bars.

     If AOA' be three points always collinear, and AA' be moreover the angular points

   of a rhomb APAP', whose sides are of any constant length, then OP' must always

   = OP. Hence any number of points otherwise free may be caused always to lie on

   a sphere of variable radius.

       5. Let A, B, C be three points consti-aiued to move along three axes. Ox, Oy, Os

squares of all these joining lines shall be a minimum, the first and last points of
the first and the last row being any four points given in space. The network may

be regai'ded as a kind of extensible surface, each thread of which has a tension

proportional in each segment to the length of the segment.

   Iho problem is thus expressed as a statical problem, but the direct solution
would involve the consideration of a large number of unknown quantities.

This number may be greatly reduced by means of the analogy between this

problem and the electrical problem of determining the currents and potentials in

the case of a network of wire having square meshes, one corner of the network

being kept at imit potential while that of the other three corners is zero.

   This problem having been solved by Kirchhotf's method, the position of any point

                      By Capt. Abkey, li.E., F.Il.A.S., F.C.S.

   In this paper an account was given by the author of the means adopted for
insuring, at the different stations which would be occupied by the parties sent out
to observe the transit of Venus, photographic observations of the phenomenon in
question. It had been determined that at every station a photograph should be
taken every two minutes during the transit, and it has been a matter of consider-
able labour to work out a process that would admit of such a largo number of
negatives being taken in a hot climate. In Kerguelen's Land it would be perfectly
feasible to adopt the ordinary wet process, the low temperature admitting of it
but in a temperature of 90^ F.' the evaporation of the volatile constituents of the
collodion would render such a process inapplicable, as all photographers will
admit. In India, where the author had worked, a large-sized tent had often
proved injurious, and it would have been madness to have trusted to the wet
method. It was therefore determined to use a dry process if practicable ; and
after much deliberation it was decided to employ an albumen dry process, usino- a

account of the advantages thus secured, and discussed how each could be best
obtained, especially alluding to the phenomenon of irradiation. lie mentioned
that at each station the photographic party would consist of one officer and three

sappers all well trained to the process, so that all excitement at the critical

moment might be avoided. Practice on the mock transit at Greenwich has given
them a thorough knowledge of each phase of the phenomenon.

 On Photography in Connexion tvith Astronomy. By Col. Sttiarx Wortley.

   Ha"\Tng been asked by the Astronomer Royal for some information in connexion
with photographic processes with a view to their being used for the transit of Venus,

and having had the advantage of discussion of the various processes with my friend

Captain Abney, who has been in charge of the transit photographic work, I made
at various times during the past summer a number of experiments in solar photo-
graphy, the residt of which may possibly be of use to future workers in this branch

of science.

   Taking the ordinary commercial collodions manufactured for photographic pro-

cesses, we are at once struck with the difficulty of getting accm-ate micrometrical

measurements, in consequence of the ^иarying amoimt of contraction and expansion
possessed by the collodion-film in its wet and dry states. To counteract this diffi-

culty it is necessary to make the pyroxyline witli the maximum of water added to
the acids which they will bear without dissolving the cotton when immersed

therein ; and it is also desirable to reduce considerably the proportion of nitric acid
to sidphuric, with the object of obtaining a film which shall neither contract nor

expand when either wet or dry. By using such a pyroxyline I have been enabled
to make a film on which the most delicate micrometrical measurements can be

registered with absolute perfection.
   The next point to be considered in connexion with astronomical photogi-aphy is

the radiation and halation produced where the bright and dark parts of the pictm'e

--meet. This appears to proceed fi-om two different causes one, which we may

call "halation, being the reflection of light back from the glass which supports
the film into the film itself; and the other, which I will call " radiation," appears
to be an action in the sensitive molecules of the film itself, and occurs no matter

on what support the film may be laid. Halation from the first of these two causes
can be prevented in two ways--one method being to place a dark pigment on the

back of the glass plate and in optical contact therewith ; and the other, and far
preferable one, to stain or dye the film itself with such an amount of orange or red
colour as shall stop the rays of light from getting down to the glass and being thence

reflected.

   But the radiation which takes place in the film itself is much more difficidt to
subdue, cannot be subdued by mechanical means, and can only be subdued by the
use of certain chemicals in the film, differing somewhat from those in use in the

ordinary photographic processes.

    Before pointing out what I consider the best means of avoiding this injurious

halation I will point out what I consider it to be, and why I consider it to be so.
I think the radiation in photogi-aphic films, which is so unpleasantly apparent when
a bright object is photographed in close proximity to a dark one, is due to what I may

call a " creeping ' of the superabundant light, which has done its work on the bright
                                                                                                                                                                            "

                                                                         TRAXSACTIONS OF THE SECTI02^S.                                                                     21

object, over aud into the darker portious of the" pictiu-e. To illustrate this argumeut

the following fact iu connexiou with dry-plate photography should be borne in

mind:--If a landscape photograph consisting of trees and slty be taken in a bright

and actinic light, and when a short exposure is therefore only necessary, there will

be on a rapid dry plate but little radiation ; but if the same view be taken iu a dull

light, and when the actinism is infinitely less, the longer exposure required will

certainly produce a great amount of radiation from the sky over the trees : now the

sky, even in a dull light, would be impressed on the film tolerably rapidly, and the

necessity for the long exposure is in order to get the detail in the darker parts of the

picture ; and the radiation is thus produced by the creeping of the superabundance

of light that has already finished its work on the sljy over the dark parts of the

picture, which require the prolonged exposure. That this " creeping of the light

does talfe place, the following experiment will, I think, show with certainty.

In order to find out which of the salts of silver were least liable to give this

radiation I have experimented with a very large number of them, to which I will

presently allude ; and the following singular fact was discovered by me in connexiou
with the chloride of siher, which salt has much more tendency to give radiation

than any other that I have experimented with. I had found that a sensitive film

which contained a chloride was always possessed of less satisfactory keeping qualities

than one from which chloride was absent ; and in course of some experiments on

--Athe various keeping qualities of plates between exposure and development the
following observations were made :                                                               dry film containing a considerable quantity

of chloride was after exposure cut in half; one half developed immediately, and the

other half put away in the dark for forty-eight hours. It was found that on the

half of the plate that had been kept in the dark for forty-eight hours the " blurring,"

as it is called by photographers, was considerably greater than on the half plate

that was developed at once and on repeating the experiment several times I was
                                                                                                                                ;

enabled to convince myself that the action of radiation, or what I have called the

" creeping of light " on to the dark parts of the picture, continues after the film has

been removed from the action of the light, and after it has been put away in the

dark. I have noticed this with chloride of silver only, but I was thus led to inves-

tigate the beha\-iour of other salts of silver in connexion with this radiation of

No       photographic                                                    process  gives    such  good and  rapid               dry  plates as  the  one in

an emulsion is made of bromide of silver formed in the presence of a large excess of

the nitrate of the metal ; but when we use the bromide alone it is unfortunately

Westrongly addicted to the blurring before spoken of.                                                                               can, however, entirely

counteract this tendency by the use of other salts of silver. I will not take up your

time by going into very minute details on this point, but will merely say that I

have found that the addition either of the malate, succinate, fluoride, or iodide of

silver to the bromide wUl, if used in the proper proportion, give a sensitive film from

which radiation shall be entirely absent, and that their suitability to the piu-pose is

found in the order in which I have written their names ; and with a film containing
a large proportion of malate of silver I have been enabled to take subjects which it

would be impossible to take by any other method, owing to their strong contrasts

--of black and white. It should also be noticed that these salts have a peculiar effect

on the colour of the finished negative the malate giving a golden brown, the suc-

cinate a red-brown, the fluoride a pink, and tlie iodide a delicate green. It is also

a great preventive of radiation to add nitrate of uranium to the emulsion, and what-

ever other salts are used this should never be omitted. I may also mention here

that I have foimd these various salts to act iu a remarkable manner in connexion

with the colours of the spectrum, and to give peculiar results iu connexion with

some of the more difficidt lines thereof.

   There is one final point as to the obtaining of good astronomical photographs. It

appears to me to be essential that they should be developed by the strong alkaline

method of development which was introduced by niyseli in the course of last year.

It is impossible with the old method of development to obtain results iu any wav

as satisfactory as those obtained by my new method. Xot only is there a very great

increase of sensitiveness obtained, but the development is unusually certain and

rapid, and where the sun has to be photographed it has a peculiar effect in giving

   Attention has of late years heen directed, by Mayer, James Thomson, and others,
to the fact that the friction of the tidal currents on the bed of the ocean exercises
an effect in retarding the earth's rotation on its axis. The late astronomer
Delaunay showed that such effect was appreciable, and that it furnished a not
improbable cause of the unexplained part of the secular inequality in the moon's
mean motion.

   He pointed out that inasmuch as the axis of the tidal spheroid is always behind

the moon's place, a couple is exerted by the forces of the moon's attraction, which,
on the one hand, retards the rotation of the earth, and on the other, by its reciprocal
action, increases the dimensions of the lunar orbit.

   This alteration of the lunar orbit prevents us concluding, as we should other-
wise do, thatthe Idnetic energy which pa?ses into heat in the movement of the

tides has for its exact equivalent a corresponding quantity drav, n from the store
laid up in the earth's rotation on its axis.

Tlin objopt of tlic present paper is to examine whethei- we can assert suck au

eq[iiiv<alence to hold approximately, and if so, to what degree of approximation.

The question was started some years ago by the Astronomer Koyal in the ' Astro-

nomical Notices.'

In the course of a discussion of M, Delaunay's views, he proceeds to remark :

" It will probably be difficult to say what is the effect of friction in more compli-

cated cases. Conceive, for instance (as a specimen of a large class), a tide-mill

for grinding- com. The water which has been allowed to rise with the rising tide

is not allowed  to  fall with  the  falling  tide                    but  after  a time is  allowed                                 to  fall,
                                                                  ;

thereby doing work and producing heat in the meal formed by grinding the corn.

I do not doubt that this heat is the I'epresentative of vis viva lost somev/here
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but whether it is lost in the rotation of the earth or in the revolution of the moon,

I am quite unable to say."

It occurred to me that considerable light might be thrown upon the whole

.subject by combining the equation of energy v.'ith that of the conservation of

angular momentum.

   We may therefore atill infer that when, as iu the actual case, fl is small compared

to o), the energy lost iu the earth's rotation is almost the exact equivalent of that
consumed iu tidal friction, or in any work done by tidal action. It would also

appear that as tan (0+^) is less than ^, and the mean value of X must be

small, the coefficient -of is positive ; and that consequently, as in the case where

the equator and the plane of the moon's orbit coincided, so in the actual case
there is a small accompanying transfer of energy from the earth's rotation to the
orbital motion.

   All these conclusions apply mutatis mutandis to the solar tides, if we regard as

our binary system the earth and sun.

   In the case of nature, when we have to consider the three bodies acting together,
the main conclusion that nearly all the energy is drawn from the earth's rotation

will not be invalidated.

   It would also appear that if, as is usually done, we assume the friction to vary as

the velocity, the smaller effects (which consist in the transference of energy from

the earth's rotation to the energy of the orbit of the moon about the earth and

that of the earth about the sun) will correspond to the values separately calculated
for the binary systems.

       On Extraordinary Reflection. By Professor Cuetis.

The author drew attention to the fact that iu elementary ti-eatises on Experimental

Physics no mention is made of extraordinary reflection, whereby students are

frequently, although illogically, led to the conclusion that in the case of media

which violate the ordinary law of refraction, the ordinary law of reflection is

fulfilled ; while mathematical considerations show that Huyghens's consti-uction is as

applicable to reflection as to refraction, and that a ray of light proceeding through

a crystal, and impinging on the siu-face of contact of the crystal with a smi'oimding

medium, will give rise to two reflected rays, accompanied by one or two refracted

rays, according as the surrounding medium is ordinary or extraordinary. When

the crystal is uniaxial, one of these reflected rays conforms to the ordinary law of

reflection, while in general the other does not ; if the crystal is biaxial, neither of

the reflected rays in general conforms to that law. If, then, a ray of light falls

upon a crystal sm-rounded by air, part of this light is reflected and part is refracted,

the latter being in general split into two rays : each of these rays will suffer double

reflection at the point where it again meets the bounding sm-face of the crystal

and in the case where the two portions of the bounding surface are parallel, it is an

immediate consequence of theory that the planes of polarization of one pair are

parallel to those of the other, while the intensities of the light in one pau' is not in

general the same as in the other, and in fact one or more may vanish without the

others vanishing.

These facts were illusti-ated by an apparatus consisting of a horizontal stage free

to move round and along a vertical axis ; on this stage a uniaxial or biaxial crystal
is placed, and a ray of light is allowed to fall on it through a tube properly adjusted
and fitted by a cap, in which is a small orifice : at the opposite side of the stage is

placed another tube properly adjusted ; on looking thi-ough it. Jive images of the

--small orifice in the cap of the first-mentioned tube are seen one formed by re-

flection at the upper surface of the crystal, and the other /our by the rfowft^a-eflectiou

of the two rays refracted at the upper surface. As the stage is rotated the images

may be four, three, or two ; if the cap in the first tube be replaced by a Nicol's

prism, the images as the stage is rotated mav be four, three, two, or one. Tlie

On ilie Construction of large McoVs Prisms*. By W. Ladd, F.E.A.S.

             On the Construction of a lyerfectly Achromatic Telescope f.
                    By Professor G. G. Stokes, M.A., Sec.E.S.

   At the Meeting of the Association at Edinburgh in 1871, it was stated that it
was in contemplation actually to consti-uct a telescope, by means of disks of glass
prepared by the late Mr. Vernon Hai-com-t, which should be achromatic as to
secondary as well as primai-y dispersion. This intention was subsequently earned
out, and the telescope, which was constructed by Mr. Howard Grubb, was now
exhibited to the Section. The original intention was to construct the objective

of a phosphatic glass containing a suitable percentage of titanic acid, achromatized

by a glass of terborate of leadf. As the curvature of the convex lens woiild be
rather severe if the whole convex power were thrown into a single lens, it was
intended to use two lenses of this glass, one in front and one behind, with the
concave terborate of lead placed between them. It was found that, provided not

more than about ^ of the convex power were thrown, behind, the adjacent surfaces
might be made to fit, consistently with the condition of destroying the spherical as
well as the chromatic aberration. This would render it possible to cement the
glasses, and thereby protect the terborate, which was rather liable to tarnish.

   At the time of Mr. Hai-court's death, two disks of the titanic glass had been
prepared, which it was hoped would be good enough for employment, as also two
disks of terborate. These were placed in Mr. Grubb's hands. On polishing, one of
the titanic disks was found to be too badly striated to be employed ; the other was
pretty fair. As it would have required a rather severe curvature of the first

surface, and an unusual convexity of the la.9t, to throw the whole convex power
into the first lens, using a mere shell of crown glass behind to protect the
terborate. Prof Stokes thought it more prudent to throw about j- ot the whole
convex power into the third or crown-glass lens, though at the sacrifice of an
absohite destruction of secondary dispersion, which by this change from the original
design might be expected to be just barely perceptible. Of the terborate disks, the
less striated happened to be slightly muddy, from some accident in the preparation
but as this signified less than the sti-iae, Mr. Grubb deemed it better to employ this

 disk.

    The telescope exhibited to the Meeting was of about 2| inches aperture and
 28 inches focal length, and was provided with an objective of the ordinary kind,
 by which the other could be replaced, for contrasting the performance. Wlien
 the telescope was tiu-ned on to a chimney seen against the sky or other suitable
 object, and half the object-glass covered by a screen with its edge parallel to the
 edges of the object, in the case of the ordinary objective vivid green and purple
 were seen about the two edges, whereas with the Harcourt objective there was
 barely any perceptible colom-. It was not, of course, to be expected that the

 performance of the telescope should be good, on accoimt of the difficulty of

 preparing glass free from strife, but it was quite sufficient to show the possibility of
 destroying the secondaiy colour, which was the object of the constiiiction.

On a New and Simple Form of adjustable Slit for the Spectroscope.

   The end of the spectroscope-tube is screwed on the outside so that the cap ou
being tiuned round is gradually drawn down ; this being bevelled on the inside, the
bevel acts upon the ends of the jaws of the slit, which ai-e correspondingly bevelled,
and so closes the slit, a spring wire being used to open the slit when the cap is

iinscrewed.

Advantage is taken of the cap, and a glass cover is inserted so as to keep the slit

free from dust, the usual puU-otf cap                                                                                      or  case  being entirely dispensed with                                                                                               every

By this means a really practical pocket-spectroscope can be constructed, and no

loose cap or coyer is required to protect it when out of use ; it is always ready at

a moment's notice, and the utmost precision is obtained in the adjustment of the

slit without any very delicate screws being employed.

On some Pecvliarities in the Electric Discharge from a Leyden Jar,

                    By Dr. W. Feddeesen, Leipzitj.

The author showed a number of photographs obtained by projecting an image of

the discharge-spark of a Leyden battery on to a sensitive plate by means of a

rotating concave mirror, and illustrated by reference to them the natiu-e of the

movement of electricity which must be conceived of as occurring when such

discharges take place imder vaiying circumstances.

  When the Leyden jar is discharged through a circuit of small resistance, the

way in which the discharge takes place is that the opposite electricities of the two

coatings do not neutralize each other at once, but as it were pass through each other

several times in succession in a continually smaller and smaller quantity, so that at

definite successive instants the jar appears to be charged alternately positively and

negatively, but each time less and less strongly. This is the oscillatory discharge,

which reveals itself in the photographs by maxima of illumination following each

other at equal distances. The known rate of rotation of the mu-ror gives the

duration of the oscillation. Experiments show that this duration is proportional to

the square root of the number of jars* (capacity of the battery) employed, that it

depends on the form of the discharging circiut, and increases with the length of the

circuit and decreases with its thiclmess in a complex ratiot, but is nevertheless

independent of the resistance of the conductor. On the other hand, however, the

number of oscillations seems to be essentially aftected                                                                              by this resistance                                                                  when the

have at first a simple flowing off of the electricity, occupying about the period of

one oscillation ; but, when the resistance becomes greater still, the discharge
occupies a longer time. This is the continuous discharge. The limiting resistance
in its turn follows special laws*; it is inversely proportional to the number
of jars (capacity), and increases slowly with the length of the discharging circuit

(potential of the current).

   The correctness of the author's interpretation of the electrical photographs, and

--of similar experiments since made by others, as well as of the conclusions deduced

from it that in almost all cases when a Leyden jar is discharged through a metallic
conductor an oscillatory discharge takes place, and that the usual mode of representing
the motion of electricity during the discharge (which we meet with, for instance, in

--Riess's 'Die Lehre von der Reibungselectricitat') is incorrect follows,

   1st. From the agi-eement with theory. Sir William Thomsonf and Professor
Kirchhoff I had previously shown, by theoretical considerations, that under some
circumstances an electric discharge must exhibit such oscillations. Subsequently

Kirchhoff submitted the author's observations to a numerical calculation Д, and,

disregarding a constant factor, found them to agree completely. Moreover the
author has himself examined theoretically the laws of the strength of the currents

                                                                                                                                                                             ||

in divided circuits in the case of an oscillating discharge, and has discovered their
agreement with certain remarkable observations by Knochenhauer^ on the electrical
air-thermometerj as well as their relation to his observations of oscillation.

   2nd. From an experimental point of view, the interpretation that has been given

is supported by a variety of other investigations. Without reckoning the experi-
ments of Priestley, Savary, Riess, and others, which were made some of them a
long time ago and only doubtfully indicate this explanation, the following expe-

--rimental results may be mentioned : the proof given by Paalzow** that in some

discharges there is a current in two opposite directions; the negative residual
charge obtained by VonOettingerft (though not under ordinary conditions) with a
positively charged Leyden jar; and, lastly, the sixteenfold increase of the deflection
of a galvanometer observed by the author J J when the oscillatory discharge was sent
through its coils interposed between a Gaugain's double electrical valve. Time did
not allow of mentioning other experiments and observations of the author which
bear on the same point, and are to be found in various places in Poggendorff's

' Annalen.'

   The question has been raised whether the photographically represented oscillations
might not coincide with the discontinuous discharge observed by Wiedemann and
RuhlmannДД. The author contradicts tliis suggestion, and adds that he had ob-

served similar partial discharges before he discovered the oscillations of the
                                      II II

discharge of a Leyden jar. The discontinuous discharge, however, only occurs,
with the highest resistances, such as those offered by capillary columns of distilled
water, and wlien the discharging circuit is well insulated ; and successive partial
discharges differ from the oscillations in foUovping each other at continually gi-eater

Siu/fjestions for a SecUtermination of the Absolute Eleetromagnetic Units of

    Resistance and of Electromotive Force, By Prof, G. C. Fosxer, F.Jt.S.

               On Ohni's Law. By Arthur Schttster, Ph.D.

Ohm's law has often been subjected to an experimental verification. None of the

methods employed, however, were sufficiently delicate to prove the law between very

wide limits. The author thinks that the following method will allow us to judge

with far greater certainty whether Ohm's law is rigidly true. If we send rapidly

alternating currents through a galvanometer they will not affect the position of the

needle, as the two currents going in opposite directions will balance each other, if

the circuit is in its normal state (see paper on unilateral couducti\'ity, p. 31). If we

send in rapid succession two currents through the galvanometer which have different

intensities, they will have the same effect as one cm-rent, the intensity of which is the

arithmetic mean between the two currents. Let the electromotive force of one of

E E --the cui'rents be -|-.^', of the other  .r ; then, if the resistance is the same in both

cases, the two currents will have the same effect as a single cmTent produced by an

electromotive force E. On the other hand, if this is not the case, the resistance for

the electromotive force E-f-a; must be different from the resistance for the electro-

E --motive force  .r.

A weak constant cin-rent is sent thi*ough a galvanometer and a coil in which a

magnet was rotated. The cmTents induced by the rotating magnet had no effect on

the galvanometer-needle when the constant cm-rent did not pass. When the current

passed, however, the rotating magnet always increased the deflection. In order to

explain this residt we are obliged to make one of the two following suppositions :

1. The resistance of the wire decreases as the cm-rent increases.

2. The self-induction of a wire involves a term depending upon the strength of a

current and approaching a limiting value as the current increases.

           On Unihteml Conductivity. By Arthttk Schuster, Ph.D.

While engaged in otlier work the author discovered a new phenomenon in elec-

tricity which may conveniently he called unilateral conductivity. His expeiimentd

show that in a circuit composed entirely of copper wires, joined together by means of
binding-screws, the electi-ic conductivity in one direction may be diflerent from what

it is in the opposite du-ection. If a coil of wires be connected with the galvanometer,

and a magnet rotates rapidly within, the coil-cmi-ents in alternate direction will pass

through the galvanometer. Their effect, however, on the needle will coimteract each

other," and the needle will sliow no permanent detiection if the cm-rents are equally

strong. On the other hand, if the needle shows a permanent deflection, one current

must be stronger than the other ; and this again can only be caused by a difference

in the conductivity, as the electromotive force acting in opposite directions must be

equal. It is found that sometimes the cm-rents induced by the rotating magnet have

a very strong effect on the needle, and the effect shows best in wires which have not

been used for a certain time. The most remarkable fact connected with imilateral

conductivity is, that a cu-cuit of wires not showing unilateral conductivity maybe

made to conduct unilaterally by merely introducing for a short time a wire which

shows the effect. \N1ien the wii-e is taken out, the original circuit will again show
unilateral conductivity. The air condensed on the sm-face of the wire may possibly

cause the phenomenon. Two wires screwed together may not touch each other,
Abut a small layer of air may separate them.
                                                                                                    voltaic arc, the two electrodes of

which are of different form, will, as is known, show what is called unilateral conduc-

tivity, and a copper wire separated from the binding-screw by a thin layer of air

will act somewhat like a voltaic ai-c. In order to test the theory according to which

the facts mentioned above are easily explained, air was artificially condensed on the
Awire by having its ends put for a certain time into powdered charcoal.
                                                                                                    wire

which showed no unilateral conductivity was thus made to show it ; and after it had

been destroyed again, which generally can be done by rubbing the wire or screwing

it to another binding-screw, imilateral conductivity was produced a second time by

Athe same means.  thii-d attempt, however, failed, and from that time all the

means by which usually unilateral conductivity had been produced were not suc-

cessfid. ' If, therefore, the above theory is the correct explanation of imilateral con-

ductivity, some unknown secondary cause (perhaps the diflusion of the gas into thq

wire) must be active, which at certain times prevents it being produced.

A New Method of constructing Carbon-cells and Plates for Galvanic Batteries.

                                  By W. Symons, F.C.S.

The author mixes finely powdered wood-charcoal with a syrup of white sugar to

a proper consistence. In this thick syrup he dips paper moulds, only covering the

Whenoutside. After drying he redips, and repeats until sufficiently thick.                          well

dried, the cells are packed in sand and balied in an oven sufficiently hot to burn out

the paper moulds. Then soaked in weak hydrochloric acid, dried, soaked in sugar-

sp-up, then biu-ied in sand and gradually brought up to a white heat. The carbon

has a good metallic ring and a brilliant fracture. The outside of the cells can be

covered with paper and dipped in melted paraffin. Rods and plates of carbon cau

be easily rolled out or pressed if made of a similar mixture, but thicker.

other non-conducting liquids to the action of a weak but continuous galvanic current,

by dissolving them either in a solution of zinc chloride in alcohol or of ferric chloride

in ether.  The latter he finds the  best medium                                                     and oils &c. dissolved in it may be

beiug tlie result. Carbon disulphide may also be added to the oils, or acted on
alone. Other conducting liquids, not miscible with ether, may also be used as

anodes or cathodes.
    Oils, however, which are not soluble in alcohol are only partially soluble in the

ferric ether, which fact also suggests matter for future experiments. The author
considers it a significant fact that in some of these experiments carbon disulphide
was evidently decomposed, either directly or indirectly, by the current, although he

has not yet succeeded in getting a deposit of carbon.

On the Effect on the Compass of the Rolling of Ships*.

               By Sir W. Thomson, F.B.S.

On the Proportions in which Bases and Acids present in a Solution combine with
      each other. By Professor Gustav Wiedemann, Leipzig University.

  When a base is introduced into a solution containing two different acids, it is

divided between them ; likewise, when salts are dissolved in water, they veiy often

undergo a partial decomposition. Thus, for example, the salts of iron peroxide
dissolved in water are partially decomposed into acid, and colloid peroxide of iron

remaining in solution.

   The author has applied to the investigation of this phenomenon a method pre-
viously employed by him for the determination of the magnetism of chemical com-
pounds. In this process tlie effect which is to be determined is not measured

during the continuance of the chemical action, as is customary in measm-ing calo-
rific effects, but after the complete termination of the action, and without the inter-
vention of any external agent, physical or chemical.

   This method has as its basis the difference which exists between the magnetism
of the colloidal peroxide of iron and that of the peroxide contained in the salts.

When in a solution of a neutral or feebly acid salt of peroxide of iron a portion of

the salt is decomposed into free acid and colloid peroxide in solution, the modifi-
cation which the magnetism imdergoes should enable us to calculate the quantity of

salt decomposed.

   If we designate by wi,, the magnetism in a imit of weight of iron in its ferric salts

in a solid state or dissolved in an excess of acid, by wj, the magnetism of a unit of

mweight of iron contained in the colloid peroxide in solution, by the magnetism

of the unit of weight of iron in any solution whatever of a salt of iron peroxide
which has imdergone a partial decomposition, and, finally, by 1 x : x the ratio of
the quantity of the peroxide remaining combined in the form of salt to the quantity

of the peroxide that has assumed the colloid state, we have

and consequently  --m=╗ip(l .i')-f-╗H,aT,
                          --w╗,, ╗╗

                        a-=-

   The ratio 1 : a; is thus immediately deduced from the measure of the magnetism
of the solution. In this way the following results have been obtained :

   1. The magnetism of a solution of ferric siilphate does not imdergo any sensible
change, even when so diluted as to reduce the quantity of iron contained in 10
cubic centims. of the solution from 0-57 gramme to 007 gramme.

   2. If to a solution of colloid peroxide of iron containing a small quantity of

sulphuric acid we add constantly increasing quantities of (diluted) sulphuric acid,

the quantity of ferric sulphate contained in the solution also gi'adually increases,
while a portion of the colloid peroxide and a portion of the acid remain side by side
uncombined.

3. If the quantity of sulphuric acid is less than that which corresponds to an

equivalent of the peroxide, the formation of the ferric sulphate takes place at first

more rapidly than normally should be the case, considering the increase of the acid
consequently it tends gradually to a maximum.

   Even when in this case the quantities of sulphuric acid and peroxide of iron are in

the ratio of their equivalents, not more than 75 per cent, of those two substances

enter into combination, 25 per cent, of the oxide and the acid remaining free in the

solution.

  By taking larger and larger quantities of the acid (2 or 2*5 equivalents) for one

equivalent of the peroxide, the quantity of free peroxide is gradually diminished
(to 10 or 4 per cent.).

   4. It follows from these results that, on taking increasing quantities of sulphuric

acid for an equivalent of the peroxide, we observe at first that the quantity of free

acid in the solution diminishes ; and this phenomenon continues until the total

quantity of acid, free as well as combined, is a little more than one equivalent.

As we continue to add acid to the solution, the proportion of free acid increases

still further.

  We5. obtain, moreover, the remarkable residt that the quantity of peroxide of

iron, combined with a constant quantity (one equivalent) of acid in these solutions,

attains its maximum when the proportion of acid exceeds by a small quantity the

oxide of iron, equivalent for equivalent.

   6. The solutions of iron-ammonia alum give numerical results, which are almost

identical with those obtained with a solution of one equivalent of peroxide of iron
and one equivalent of sidphuric acid. The ammonia-salt contained in the alum

exercises in this case no sensible influence upon the decomposition which results
in the aqueous solution ; so that we are justified in concluding that the iron alum in
solution is entirely decomposed into sulphate of ammonia and ferric sulphate, the

latter of which imdergoes partial decomposition.

   7. By measuring the magnetism of a solution of peroxide of iron containing two

different acids or of a solution of an acid containing peroxide of iron and another

base (alumina), we may determine in the same way the division of the peroxide of

iron between the two acids, or of the acids between the two bases.

8. It would be diflicult to give a mathematically exact theory of the facts just

Wepresented, for a gi'eat number of different factors come into play.  can, how-

ever, henceforward regard as inaccurate all those formulae which give the quantities

of base remaining free in a solution containing an acid as a function of the second

degree of the quantity of the acid.

     Notes of Experiments on tlie Electric Currents jivoduced by the Gramme
        Magneto-electric Machine. By Alp. Niaudet BKEcrET, of Paris.

  ATwo Gramme machines (called, for distinction, and B) are placed in the same

circuit. On turning the first, A, an electric cuiTent is produced which traverses the

second, B, and the latter begins to tm-n.

   It therefore appears that the Gramme machine is equally fitted to couA'ert force

into electricity and electricity into force. In fact all electric and electromagnetic

machines have that property, but none have hitherto possessed this reversibility in
the same degree.

   This experiment proves that a sy.stem of two Gramme machines might be applied

to the transmission of force to a considerable distance, the immovable conductors

replacing the means of transmission or teledynamic cables of Mons. Him. An

analogous combination would permit the distribution of the force applied to a large

Gramme maclaine tlirougli a certain number of smaller macliines, placed at points

more or less distant.

Experiments now in progi-ess will, it is hoped, prove to tlie British Association at

its next Meeting liow far these ideas are practicaole and may he useful ; these expe-

riments will, to use the language of the mechanical theory of heat, show the eco-

nomic coefficient of the system in question.

   The first experiment may be slightly modified as follows :

   In the circuit of the two Gramme machines insert a platinum wire ; stop machine

AB and turn machine : the platinum wu'e heats, and indeed becomes red-hot by
Athe passage of the ciuTent from ; machine B remains quiescent, having been

stopped but if the stoppage be removed it will be seen to move immediately, and,
                                           ;

immediately also, the platinum wire ceases to be red.

The second experiment presents, I think, a suflieientl}' striking example of the

equality of mechanical action and heat ; besides which it realizes in a new manner

an experiment described by Helmholtz in his paper on the " Conservation of Force."

Helmholtz operated with a pile which  tm-ned  an  electromagnetic  machine                                     a gal-
                                                                                                            ;

vanometer was jilaced in the circuit, and its deviation was seen to diminish in pro-

portion as the rapidity of the machine increased ; he showed that the deviation of

Wethe galvanometer woidd be nil at a certain rapidity of the machine.  shall show

that in our experiment, the two machines being supposed to be alike, the deviation

of the galvanometer and the intensity of the current would become nil when the

rapidity of the two machines is the same.

   Finally, our second experiment may also be looked at from another point of view

--it affords an illustration of Neumann's principle, which may be described in the

following words : " Every effect produced by an electric cm'rent involves a dimi-

nution of the intensity of such cm-rent."

(hi the Cause of the Progressive Motion of Gydones, and of the Seasonal Varia-

           tions in their Patlis. By Isaac Ashe, A.B., M.B., T.C.D.

Dr. Ashe pointed out the importance of arriving at a correct theory regai-ding the

causes of the onward progi-ess of cyclones over the face of the globe, on account of
the light which would thereby be thrown on the question of seasonal variations in

their paths, such as had been observed by Captain Fyers, K.E., in the South-
AIndian Ocean.
                 correct theory would serve to indicate the line of research in

fiitm-e observations directed towards this point. Seasonal variations of path woidd

be due to special modifications of the more constant forces governing the paths and

progress of cyclones, such special modifications being dependent on the chano-es

induced in the action of the forces causing such progi-ess in consequence of changes

of season. The general law would depend on the more constant, and the seasonal

variation on the less constant elements of these forces. The more constant elements

would be those inherent in the cyclone itself ; the less constant elements would be

those depending on the prevailing winds of the zone and their seasonal variations.

The varying elements were better known than the fixed, though perhaps their

causal relation was not recognized from want of acquaintance with the fixed ele-

ments and more constant forces inherent in the cyclone itself, on which the onward

progress of the cyclone depended.

Dr. Aslie reviewed the kuown laws of cj^clonal progress, tlieii" luotion towards the

S.W. in the southerD, and the N.W. in the northern hemisphere while within the

tropics, and remarked that in both cases this direction was nearly at right angles to

the trade-wind of the hemisphere, and could not therefore be a motion due to the

trade-wind. He noticed their recurving at the tropics, and subsequent course to

S.E. in the southern and to N.E. in the northern hemisphere, and pointed out that

since this occiu-red in the open sea as well as near land, it must depend on the

latitude and some causal change connected therewith, and not on the proximity of

land as some had supposed. He adduced Captain Fyers's observations (Trans. Met.

Soc. Maiu-itius, vol. iii. p. 29) as to the onward progress of cyclones being very slow

at first on their formation near the equator, and increasing in rapidity afterwards,

apparently ^Jwrj^flssw with their poleward motion. The author then pointed out

that, in consequence of the difference in the rate of the earth's dim-nal rotation at

diflerent latitudes, air drawn into a cyclone from equatorwards would be moving

more rapidly than the centre of the cyclone, and hence as it revolved roimd the

centre in the eastern half woiild be discharging force into the mass of moving air,

and thus accelerating its speed of revolution ; while ah- drawn in fi-om polewards,
since it would be moving more slowly than the centre, would similarly use up the

force of the western half, and so retard its speed of revolution. The same caxises

would also make the cyclone assume an elliptical, rather than a strictly cii-cular

figure, as usually supposed ; and the western half would present a greater excenti-i-

city, on account of the greater differences of length in the degi-ees of longitude for

equal intervals of latitude as we approach the pole                                                                                                                                                                                            air from polewards would pass
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

more to westward than air from equatorwards would to eastwai-d hence the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

western half would have the larger sm-face, and would therefore experience more

friction against the sm-face of the ocean than would the eastern. Both these effects

would tend to produce the same result, namely, the comparatively slower revolution

of the western half, a slower motion of the air composing it ; this would cause the

eastern half to roll over or past the western, and so produce a general onward

progi-ess of the cyclone in a direction parallel to a tangent to the exti-eme western

point of the storm                                                                                      that would, in fact, be along the minor axis of the ellipse, since
                                                                                                     ;

such the author regarded it, formed by the storm, or, in short, in a poleward direction

in both hemispheres. Some persons had supposed that the air in the western half

of a cyclone would move the fastest because it moved along with the trade-wind,

while that in the eastern half moved against it ; but the aiithor pointed out that

this could only affect the rate of motion relatively to a ship at sea, and not as

Weregarded the internal constitution of the cyclone.                                                                                                                                                                                           shoidd investigate the proper

motion of the cyclone independently, and afterwards consider the entire cyclone as

being carried on along with the trade-wind within which it was generated. The

proper motion, then, the author considered to be to polewards in both hemispheres,

or due south in the southern, and due north in the northern, though some easting

might occasionally be due to a rapid poleward progress of the whole storm. To

this proper motion the trade-wind component should now be added, or a N.W.

progTess in the southern hemisphere and a S.W. in the northern. The resultant of
these two, supposing them about equal in force, would give the actual intratropical

path of the storm in each hemisphere, or W.N.W. in the northern and W.S.W. in
the southern. This was in exact agreement with the observed paths. At the

ti'opics, the ti-ade-wind failing, the proper poleward motion woidd alone remain
this also was in agi-eement with observation. Beyond the tropics the storm would

come wilder the influence of the S.W. and N.W. counter-trades, and the residtant

would be a N.N.E. path in the northern hemisphere and a S.S.E. in the southern

this also corresponded exactly with the results of observation. As the trade-winds
increased in strength in the summer of each hemisphere the component of force
due to their action would be greater, and a storm in the northern hemisphere woidd

take a more southerly coiu-se, and in the southern hemisphere a more northerly

course than at other seasons. This also was in acciu-ate agreement with Captain

Fyers's observations of the storms of the South-Indian Ocean, since he finds (Trans.

Met. Soc. Maur. vol. iii. p. 1.3) that " the November and December storms take a
more southerly coiu'se than those of the succeeding months, Januarv, Februai-y, and
March." After April the hwricane season as a ride is oyer in the South-Indian

Ocean, wliich the author accounted for by supposing that the trade-wind component

of the cyclone's motion is then sufficiently strong to draw any cyclone that may be

formed into the equatorial calm-belt during its period of slow proper motion on
its fii'st formation near the equator, where the degrees of longitude differ but little
in length at different latitudes. Captain Fyers had observed this slow progress on
the fii'st formation of a storm, and the cyclone would in consequence be soon lost in
the ascensive motion of the air within the equatorial calm-belt.

0)1 Disturbance of tlie Weather hy Artificial Influences, especially Battles,

   Military Manoeuvres, great Explosions, and Conflagrations. By R. B.

    Belchek.

   Many instances were quoted, from the siege of Valenciennes in 1793 to the
Ashantee and Carlist wars this year, to show that storms follow immediately upon
battles. The loss of the gi-eat battle of Solferino, which closed the Italian campaign
of 1859, was attributed by the Austrian commander to a terrific thunder-storm
which burst over the field and obscured movements of powerful masses of the
enemy. The decisive battle of Sadowa, which closed the Austro-Prussian war in
1866, was in like manner accompanied by a terrible storm, to which again the
Austrian commander attributed his defeat.

   The sham-fights at and near Aldershot this year, viz. May 19, June 19, 20,

July 8, 20, 21, 27, 29, were in each instance followed by thimder-storms, lasting
several days, with fine weather in the intervals.

   The manceu%'res at Dartmoor and Caimock, August 1873, brought such stormy
weather, that the former was broken up prematurely, and the latter carried on with
difficulty. Correspondents at Cannock Chase describe the artiller}^ below as setting
in motion the artillery above and bringing down the rain in torrents.

   Instances of great explosions being immediately followed by thunder-storms were
fiven, notably one in the harbom- of Bordeaux, September 1869, which was followed

 y a cyclone accompanied by an enormous wave which swept the shores of France
and England ; it was succeeded by a remarkable lightning- storm.

   Instances of lai-ge conflagrations which appeared to cause storms were given.

On certain protracted Irregularities of Atmosplieric Pressure in the Indian
   Monsoon Eegion, and their relation to Variations of the Load Rainfall.

   By Henry F. Blanfokd, F.G.S.

   After briefly noticing the distribution of atmospheric pressure which in Northern
India normally accompanies the two monsoons, and which has been described at
length elsewhere, the author draws attention to a fact disclosed by a discussion of
the barometric registers for the last seven years, viz. that the abnormal peculiarities

of relative pressure distribution which may appear in any season, tend to last for many
months, and in some cases apparently throughout several alternations of the mon-

soons. In the 3'ear 1868 a remarkable and unusually intense barometric depression in

the N.W. corner of the bay of Bengal characterized the whole of the S. W. monsoon,

while in Lower Bengal the pressure was for the most part above the average. In

1871 a similar but less intense barometric depression existed in the east of the bay,
and another in Orissa; also in Central India, north of the Satpoora range, the
pressure was unusually below that of the Gangetic plain on the north and that of
Nagpore on the south of the range. In 1872 the last depression had disappeared,
and that of Orissa and that in the east of the bay were united into one, the depres-
sion being greatest in that part of the bay oft' the coast of Orissa. In 1873 this
last depression continued, while another existed in the neighbourhood of the Nicobar
Islands, and a third in the province of Oudh, which was very inten.Фe during the
S.W. monsoon. The author concluded, from the facts adduced, " that amid tlie
never-ceasing changes of condition and place to which ever}' part of the atmosphere
is subject, certain states tend to perpetuate or reproduce themselves in the same

region, in such manner as to maintain a constant diflerence in the mean or average
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  37

pressures of two nelglibouring regions ; and that this tendency to a constant local
difference is, in certain cases, maintained throughout those great revolutions of
atmospheric density, composition, and movement which accompany the alternations
of the monsoons. Nevertheless these states, though protracted, are not perma-
nent, and disappear after a longer or shorter time, sometimes suddenly, but more
frequently by a graduated decrease."

   The author then proceeded to notice certain relations between these barometric
irregularities and the distribution of the rainfall in these years. In 1868, more
especially in the months of June and August, when the pressure was at its lowest

in the N. W. corner of the bay of Bengal, there was an excessive fall of rain in the

--S.W. corner of the Gangetic delta the greatest fall in each of these months being

about 100 miles to the north of the place of greatest depression, thus showing a
certain analogy to the case of cyclones, in which the heaviest rainfall is in advance
of the centre of the storm. The year 1871 was one of imusually heavy rainfall in

Bengal, the N.W. Pro\'inces, and Central India, indicating a somewhat similar

relation to the areas of abnormal barometric depression of that year. In 1873,
again, which was one of very deficient rainfall in most parts of Northern India,

the Punjab (which lay beyond the Oudh depression) and Burmah (which lay beyond
that of the Nicobars in the direction of the monsoon currents) enjoyed a plentiful
rain supply. But the deficient rainfall of that and the preceding year in Bengal

cannot be thus explained ; and although it can hardly be doubted that the abnormal
peculiarities in the distribution of pressiu-e must be very influential in determining
those of the rainfall, the author thinks that no satisfactoiy discussion of their rela-
tions is possible without a knowledge of the state of atmospheric pressm'e over the
whole region concerned with the Indian branches of the monsoons.

     On the apparent Connexion behveen Sun-spots and Atmospheric Ozone.
                                      By T. Moffat.

   The author stated that he had compared the mean daily quantity of ozone for
each year for nineteen years with the number of new groups of sun-spots which
appeared in each year, and the results showed that the maximum ot sun-spots
occurred in the same year as the maximum of ozone, and the period of minimimi
of sun-spots coincided with that of the minimum of ozone.

              On a Gymhal-swung Rain-gauge. By P. Pasto&elli.

   The author submitted for criticism a gymbal-swung rain-gauge provided below
the gymbals with a spherical receptacle of so much larger area than the funnel,
that the pressure of the wind upon it should tilt the funnel towards the point

whence the rain is falling. He also suggested that by duly weighting it might

answer on board ship.

   EOBEKT H. SCOTT, M.A., F.R.S.

   It is hardly necessary to draw the attention of men of science to the fact, that the
configuration of the earth's surface exercises an overwhelming influence on the wind
both as to its direction and force. Some statements and tables contained in a
paper by the author in the last Number of the * Quarterly Jom-nal of the Meteoro-
logical Society ' * abundantly prove this assertion, and it is therefore easy to see what
an imperfect representation of the actual force of the wind .at sea can be furnished by

reports from a broken and mountainous coast, such as the Atlantic coasts of Ireland

and Scotland, where the telcgi-aphic stations are, perforce, situated in sheltered
places, inasmuch as harbour's are natmdly found where there is as little exposure
to wind as is possible.

   In the practice of weather-telegi'aphy and storm-warnings, as the number of re-
ports received per day from each station is stiictly limited, on linancial considera-

tions, it is quite obvious that if the actual epoch of the commencement of a gale

does not fall within the hours of attendance at the Telegraphic Office and at the

Meteorological Office, which practically only extend from 8 a.m. till 3 p.m., much
time will be lost in sending news of the fact to London. If it commences at
6 P.M. at Valencia, we cannot hear of it in London till 9 a.m. next morning.
 ^ On the other hand, if the observer be living in a sheltered spot such as Plymouth,
Nairn, or Greencastle, we shall not get a true report of the gale at all, inasmuch as

the observer will not have felt it himself.

   The iirst-named defect in oui- system can only be met by a considerably increased
expenditure on the service, and that is not a scientific, but an administi-ative ques-
tion, with which the Government can alone deal.

   In order to meet the second diffieultv", Mr. De La Rue has Mndly devised an
instrumental arrangement by which the fact of any given force of wind having
been reached at an exposed point (such as Rame Head for Plymouth, or Malin
Head for Greencastle ) can be at once conveyed to the reporter in his own office,
or even to the central office in London. The instrument has been made by Messrs.

Negretti and Zambra.

The following is the construction of the new signalling-anemometer :

To the ordinary Robinson's anemometer-spindlo is affixed a toothed wheel, which

is geared with another and larger toothed wheel, fixed on a second vertical spindle,

carrying a centrifugal governor. The governor-spindle is made to rotate at one

half or one third of the velocity of the anemometer-spindle, in order that the

rods carrying the governor-balls' may not have to be made inconveniently short,

A provision is made for adjusting the" length of the arms of the governor, so that

dirt'erent wind-velocities may be indicated -\vithin certain limits.

 The governor-balls act in the well-known  way, and      expand  when  driven  at  a

_

given rate ; and the upward motion of these governor-balls is used to raise a secon-

dary wheel to bring into gear a third spindle, on which is fixed the armature of a

magneto-electric apparatus, which, like Sir Charles "SMieatstone's instruments, con-

sists of a compound permanent magnet with four soft iron cores, two of which are

mounted on the N. pole of the m.agnet and two on the S. pole these iron cores are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

--surmounted with fine insulated copper wire, and on rotation of the armature give

alternately -|- and currents in rapid succession, according to the rate at which

the armatiu'e is driven. These cmreuts are converged inland to the observing-

station by insulated wires and give warning by ringing an alarum as long as the

anemometer-cups are revolving at a velocity sufficient to raise the governor-balla

so as to bring the magneto-electrical apparatus into gear.

AVe see, therefore, that by adjusting the governor of the apparatus to indicate

any required speed, a warning will at once be given when the wind reaches that

speed, be it that of 60, 40, or 20 miles an hour, as may be required.

All the attention which the instrument requires, after the appai-atus is fixed, is

to lead two insulated wires from the anemometer into the observing-station, and to

connect these wires to the two terminals on the alarum.

   In order to enable the observer to communicate at once, and at as little expense
as possible, to London the fact of the velocitv' in question having been reached,
the individual stations might be k-uowu by letters or symbols, which might simply
be telegi-aphed to Loudon as an announcement that the alarum was acting at the

station in question.

   It is obvious that this plan is exceedingly simple ; and there seems little

reason why it should not be thoroughly efficacious, if only the registering portion

of the apparatus can be properly protected from wilful damage by mischievous

persons.

  As usual, we are met by tbe question of cost, not only of the apparatus, but of

the connecting wires, and la.st, though not least, of the transmission of the mes-

sages. To enable us to render our "service more effective than it is, we must be

     On the Meteorology at Banhnchje for ten Years, and Rainfall of Ulster.
                               By John Smyth, Jun., A.M.

   Banbridge lies in the valley of the Bann, 20 miles from its soiu-ce, lat. 54░ 23 'N.,
long. G░ 18' W., height above sea-level 200 feet. Meteorological observations have
been caiTied on since 1801 ; tables of the results of these and diagrams of the ther-
mometer-stand and rain-gauge were exhibited. The mean pressure of the atmo-
sphere for ten years-is 0-1.33 less than that of Greenwich for 32 years. June has the

highest mean monthly pressure and January the least. The year 1870 shows the
highest mean annual pressure, and 1872 the least. The mean temperature of the
air is 48░ F., or l░-2 below that of Greenwich for 15 years. July has the highest
mean monthly temperature, viz. 59░-2, or 2░-5 below that of Greenwich. January
has the lowest, 38░-4, or 0-3 higher than Greenwich ; February is 2░ higher. The
winters are therefore warmer, and the summers cooler than at Greenwich. The
highest reading of the thermometer was 83░ F. on August 4th, 1868, the lowest 11░
on January 3rd, 1867. The mean humidity is 82 per cent, of complete saturation,
being 0-4 drier than Greenwich. June is the driest, and January the dampest month
February and March are respectively 2 and 3 per cent, drier at Greenwich, and all the
other months, except July, NovemlDer, and December, damper than at Banbridge,
June and October being 3 per cent. The prevailing winds have been from the south,
and the least frequent from the east. The mean rainfall for the ten years, from
1862 till the end of 1871, has been 29'2 inches ; October shows the greatest rainfall
and June the least. The rainfall for the year 1872 is the greatest recorded (46-6),
and for 1864 the least (25-1) ; the greatest fall in 24 hours was 2-3 inches, in Oc-
tober 1865. The mean evaporation is 15-6 inches.

amount of ozone in 1873, as he found always when the same volume of air was exa-
mined by means of an aspirator, the same amount of ozone was registered, except
when the test-paper was damped by fog ; he was led to expect this from finding the
intensity of the wind correspond with the intensity of the ozone, as observed in

 On the Absorption of the Sun's Heat-rays hy the Vapour of tlie Atmospliere*.
                    By the Eev. Fenwick W. Stow, M.A., F.M.S.

    The observations of solar radiation, which are relied on in this paper, are taken
 with " blackened-bulb thermometers in vacuo," suspended 4 feet above the ground,
 the indications of which, when compared with those of the ordinary shade thermo-

 meters, give a measure of the intensity of the solar rays.
    The absorption of the direct solar heat-rays by the vapour of the atmosphere is

 proved in several distinct ways :
     1. It is found that the elastic force of vapour is less on the ten days in each

 month on which radiation is most powerful than on an average of the whole month,

--40 REPORT 1874.

 This is proved by five years' dailj' observations at StrathfieldTurjjiss, Hants, 1869-
 74 ; two years' at Hawsker, near Whitby, Yorkshire (1869-71) ; and one year's
 observations in 1872, at Harpenden, Herts.

    2. It was also found by the above obsei'vations that N. and N.W. winds, which

 contain little moisture, are veiy favourable to solar radiation, whereas S. and S.E.

 winds are usually accompanied by much less powerful sunshine. The N.E. winds of
 spring, which are excessively dry, are also accompanied by intensely powerful solar

 radiation.

    .3. By frequent observations during cloudless weather with nearly constant va-

 pour-tension, curves are obtained representing the daily variations in solar radiation

 produced by the changes in the sun's altitude and consequent alteration of the

 length of the path which the beams pursue through the atmosphere. From these
 the percentage of the sun's heat-rays which would be absorbed by the atmosphere

 if the sun were vertical can be approximately determined, assuming that the ten-
 sion of vapour remained as it was on the day or days of observation. It is then
possible to calculate the amount of radiation due to the altitude of the sun at noon
in the middle of each month for a constant vapour-tension, and to compare this

with the amount actually observed in each month on cloudless days. In this way it is
found that when the tension of vapour falls below the amount on the day which

furnishes the data for calculation, the radiation rises above the calculated amount,
and vice versa. In fact the sun's raj^s are more intense in winter than in summer,

when the difference of altitude at noon is allowed for, because the absolute amount
of vapour in winter is so much less. About ten or twelve per cent, is the mini-

mum of absorption of the sun's heat-rays, while the maximum equals or even

exceeds 20 per cent.
   The paper concludes with a few observations on the increase of solar radiation

with elevation above the sea-level, from which it would appear to have amounted,
between the heights of 470 to 18O0 feet, to about 5 per cent, of the amount observed
at the lower station when the sun's altitude was 20░, and to above 3 per cent, when
the altitude was 26░.

    On the Necessity for jjilacing Physical Meteoroloc/y on a Rational Basis*.
                           By Lieut. -Col. A. Stkange, F.R.S.

   The author points out the two great branches into which the science of mete-
orology is divisible, viz. that which is concerned with its great fimdamental laws,

--and that which concerns climate the first being of a cosmical, the second of a more

local character. The present paper refers principally to the first of these branches,
which he considers to have been greatly neglected, and to need being treated on
systematic and rational principles.

   He indicates the elementary considerations which point to the sun as the chief
origin of meteorological phenomena, and recommends, now that science has pro-

vided manj' of the necessary means for the purpose, that the physical study of the
great central luminary should be commenced in earnest.

   He points out that such solar researches as have been undertaken, though most

valuable as far as they go, are insufficient because their continuity is interrupted

by cloudy weather. He holds that we require a daily record of the changes which

are perpetually going on in the sun, in order to trace their course, their character,

and their laws. He points out that this indispensable object can only be attained

by establishing a certain number of stations, equipped for such rssearches, so
situated that there shall be a fair probability of clear weather daily at one or more

of them. He mentions India as peculiarly suited for the purpose on account of

the great variety of climate to be found there.

   He maintains that such investigations must devolve on the State, and lays down

the broad principles applicable to the particular case in qu.estion. The first prin-

ciple is that private enterprise should, in all matters within its scope, be encouraged

and aided in every possible way. The second principle is that the State should
step in where private enterprise fails, and itself conduct scientific research, whether
observatorial or experimental, subject to the following main conditions :

    (a) That the probable results of the research will be beueficial, in the \videst sense
of that term, to the community at large, or to the various Departments of the State.

    (b) That the research is too costly, or commercially too unremunerative, to be
undertaken and vigorously prosecuted by individuals.

    (c) That the research requires continuous uninterrupted work, extending over
A'ery long periods, and conducted by systematically organized establishments.

   The case under consideration completely satisfies these conditions. It is futile
to expect that individuals will carry on continuously work which requires nume-

rous well-equipped establishments conducted on a uniform system, the operations
of which will certainly extend over generations, possibly over centuries.

   Whilst advocating the study of the sun as the rational basis of meteorology, the

author does not desii-e to abandon those methods of observation now in use, though

they admit of improvement ; but he likens meteorology, as at pi-esent prosecuted, to
studying the steam-engine without giving any attention to the furnace and boiler.

    On the Relative Seiisitiveness of Thermometers differing in Size, SJiape, or
                     Materials. By G. J. Symons, See. Met. Soc.

   The author exhibited a series of 14 very carefully made thermometers, all differing
either in the size or shape of the bulbs, or in the materials with which they were filled,
some being filled with mercury and some with alcohol. They had been specially
constructed with a view to testing the relative sensitiveness of different patterns and
sizes. The results of the experiments had been printed in the ' Quarterly Journal

--of the Meteorological Society,' and were briefly the following : that very large

spherical mercurial bulbs are very little better than those tilled with alcohol, but

that with small bulbs mercury is much the most sensitive. The new minimum

thermometers (the bifurcated and the double cylinder) introduced respectively by
Mr. Casella and JMr. Ilicks, were highly praised. The author said that he brought
them before the Section mainly in order to ofler the loan of the entire series to any

experimentalist, with more leisure than himself, who would develop and complete

the inquiry which he had begun.

       On a New Form of Rain-gauge. By G. J. Symons, Sec. Met. Soc.

   The author exhibited and explained a new form of rain-gauge designed by him-

self to facilitate accurate observations of the rate at which rain falls in heavy storms,
and thus supply data on a subject of equal interest from a meteorological and engi-
neering point of view. The arrangement is extremely simple. The rain is collected
in a funnel 8 inches in diameter, is then led into a cylinder in which a copper float
rests on a water-surface. As rain falls the float rises, and a fine cord passing round
a horizontal axis causes it to revolve once for each inch of rain. At one extremity of
this axis are two hands attached to separate wheels of such diameter, that while one
revolves only once the other revolves five times. The former is the one attached
to the axis, and thus one hand completes a rotation for one inch, and the other for
five inches. Behind these hands is an opal-glass dial about one foot in diameter;
so that the appearance of the instrument is that of a clock, the minute- and hour-
hands being replaced by hundredths of an inch and inches. The resemblance is car-
ried further by the fact that arrangements have been made for the dial being illumi-

nated at night by gas or oil. The author expressed much satisfaction with the way

in which his design had been carried out by the maker, Mr. Pastorelli.

 Descrijytion of a Trom])e or Bhtving-Engme for giving a supply of Coal-gas

       under Pressure for Sensitive Flames. By F. Heeberx Marshall.

   The apparatus consists of a modification of the ordinary Catalan Trompe,
whereby pressiu-e is imparted to a stream of gas by tlie velocity of a fall of water
carrying- the gas with it.

  A vertical glass tube, 6 feet long and ^-inch bore, is enlarged in a funnel-shape

at the top to about 1\ inch ; into this fits tightly a cork through which pass two
tubes of about \ inch internal diameter, connected, one with the water-main
and the other with the gas-main, the tubes passing just through the cork on

the inside.

   The lower end of the large vertical tube passes through an air-tight cork to
within an inch of the bottom of a 3-pint bottle.

  A siphon with india-rubber connexion and a screw pinch-cock, having a rather

larger bore than the vertical tube, passes into the same bottle, as far removed from
the principal tube as possible, and leads to a sink or waste-pipe.

  A third tube of about J-inch bore passes through the cork about \ inch into the

bottle : this tube is connected with the sensitive jet, either directly or, better,
with the intervention of a regulator in which a few inches of benzol take the

place of the water usually employed in such apparatus. The regulator should be
large, and the tube leading into it rather less than 5-inch bore, to obtain greater

steadiness of flame.

   The working of the apparatus is frequently improved by inserting a loose piece
of glass tube, about ^ inch long and of such diameter as to remain supported in its
position, at the point where the long vertical tube begins to expand. The check
imparted to the stream of water by this contraction seems to assist the formation

of water-pistons, so to speak, in the principal tube, instead of allowing the water to

flow down the sides of the tube in a film without carrying gas with it, as some-

times happens if the supply of water be not suflicient.

   The connexions being made, and all joints air-tight, water and gas are turned
on from the mains, and the siphon started in action by holding the finger on the

sensitive jet for a moment. When all air is expelled from the bottle and

regulator, the gas is lighted, and the flame is adjusted to any desired degree of
sensitiveness by regulating the siipply of water and gas and the outflow from the
siphon, care being taken to keep 2 or 3 inches of water in the bottle.

 (hi {he Adoption (for the generalpurposes of Navigation') of Charts on Gnomonic

       Projection instead of on Mercator's Projection. By G. J. Morrison.

                                                                                                     I.

   1. The great circle course or shortest distance between any two points on the

earth's suiface is shown by a straight line on the chart. By means of a ruler,
therefore, it is easy to find out in one moment the position of the great circle

track along the whole course from point to point, and thus to see at a glance if
there be any obstacles in the way, whereas the plotting of a great circle track on a
Mercator chart involves the expenditure of a great deal of time and trouble.

   2. "When it is impossible to adopt the great circle course on account of obstacles
in the way, it is easy in a few moments to lay down the best practicable course,
whereas it is very difficult to do so on a Mercator chart.

   3. The measurement of distances on a Mercator chart is somewhat difficult,
whereas on these maps distances can be measured with a transparent scale or a
pair of compasses in a few moments.

   4. The relative position of the various points on the earth's surface is more
correctly shown on these maps than on those of Mercator.

   The great circle com-se appears to be the shoi-test and natural route, whereas on
an ordinary chart it appears to be much longer than the Mercator route, and
seamen get a better idea fi-om these charts of the proper route to follow than they
do from a Mercator chart.

                                                                                        II.

   It may be objected that :

    1. Only a small portion of the earth can be got on one sheet, and there is a
difficulty in drawing a great circle course between points situated on separate
sheets. This is true ; but by taking some pains in arranging the maps, as has been
done in this case, and by repeating portions of the earth on two or more sheets,
matters have been so arranged that scarcely any voyage can be named in which the
ports of arrival and departure cannot be found, either on the same sheet or on

opposite sheets, in either of which cases tlie course can be laid down instantly ; and
even in the rare case of two ports being found on adjacent sheets only, the course
can be laid down infinitely more easily than it can on a Mercator chart.

   2. It is impossible to find the bearing of one point from another, as can be done

on the Mercator chart by a compass and a parallel ruler.

   This really is no disadvantage. No one ought to sail along a curved course, and
no one need care to know any thing about such a course. If this objection be

seriously urged, it only proves that Mercator's charts have put false ideas into

people's heads, and that other charts are required to replace them.

      Negretti and ZamhrcCs Patent Recording and Deep-sea Thermometer.

                                   By Henry Negeexti.

   This thermometer differs from all other registering or recording thermometers in

the following important particulars :

   1. The thermometer contains only mercury without any admixture of alcohol or

other fluid.

   2. It has no indices or springs, and its indications are by the column of mercury

only.

   3. It can be carried in any position, and cannot possibly be put out of order
except by actual breakage of the instrument.

   And, lastly, it will indicate and record the exact temperature at any hour of the
day or night, or the exact temperatm-e at any depth of the sea, irrespective of

either warm or cold currents or stratum through which the thermometer may

have to pass iu its descent or ascent; this last very special quality readers this

thermometer superior for deep-sea temperatures to any others ; those which are now

used in the ' Challenger ' sounding-expedition are liable to give erroneous indica-

tions, because their indices may slip and they may become otherwise deranged ; find

vnder certahi conditions of temperature it is not possible by the old thermometers
to obtain true temperatures at certain depths. Prof. Wyville Thomson says, in
his work ' Depths of the Sea ' :

   *' I ought to mention that in taking the bottom temperature with Six's thermo-
meter the instrument simply indicates the lowest temperature to which it has been
subjected, and not necessarily that of the bottom itself;" and in confirmation Mr.
Negretti quoted a report to the Admiralty from Captain G. S. Nares, of H.M.S.
' Challenger,' dated Melbourne, March 25, 1874 :

   " At a short distance from the paclc, the surface-water rose to 32░ F., but at a depth
of 40 fathoms we always found the temperature to be 2U░ ; this continued to 300
fathoms, the depth in which most of the icebergs float, after which there is a stratum
of slightly warmer water of 33░ or 34░. As the thermometers had to pass through
these two belts of water before reaching the bottom, the indices registered those tem-
peratures, and it was impossible to obtain the exact temperature of the bottom whilst
near the ice, but the observations made in lower latitudes show that it is about 31░.
More exact results could not have been obtained even had Mr. Siemens's apparatus

been on board.''
   The thermometer described, the author believes, will be found free from the

defects of the thermometers now in use in the ' Challenger ' and other sounding-

expeditions.

   The bulb of the thermometer is protected so as to resist the pressure of the ocean,
which varies according to depth, that cf three thousand fathoms being about three

                                                                                                  4*

tons pressure on the squai'e inch. The manner of protecting the bulb was invented
by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra in 1857 (at which time a number were made for
the late Admiral FitzRoy), and has been lately copied and

brought out as a new invention by other persons.

The construction of the instrument for deep-sea temperatures

is as follows :

In shape it is like a siphon with parallel legs, all in one

piece and in continuous communication. The scale of the

thermometer is pivoted on a centre, and being attached in a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         o

perpendicular position to a simple apparatus, is lowered to any

depth that may be desired. In its descent the thermometer
acts as an ordinary instrument, the mercmy rising or falling

according to the temperature of the stratum through which it

passes ; but so soon as the descent ceases, and a reverse motion

is given to the line, so as to pull the thermometer towards the

surface, the instrument turns once on its centre, first bulb

uppermost, and afterwards bulb downwards. Tliis causes the

mercmy, which was in the left-hand column, first to pass into                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,80

meter is put in motion, and immediately the tube has acquired

a slightly oblique position, the mercmy breaks oft" at the

point D, runs into the curved and enlarged portion E, and

Feventually falls into the tube when this tube resumes its

original perpendicular position.

   The contrivance for turning the thermometer over in the sea,

either at the bottom or at any depth which may be desired,
may be described as a vertical propeller to which the thermo-

meter is pivoted ; this is fixed to a line, and as long as the

apparatus is descending the propeller remains still ; but as soon
as the line is pulled up and the ascent commences, it begins to

revolve and continues to do so until the thermometer is turned

over (which it does in less than two fathoms), and then

remains fixed and immovable.

For atmospheric purposes and observatories the thermometer

is turned over by means of a simple clockwork ; two thermo-

meters fitted as hygi'ometers can be tm-ned over as easily as
one ; and it is suggested that this instrument might supersede

the large; cumbersome, and expensive thermographs at present

in use.

One hundi-ed years have elapsed since the discovery of oxygen by Priestley. Per-
haps we should say rediscovery, for there is no doubt that about one hundred years
earlier Mayow prepared from nilre nearly pm-e oxygen, and observed and recorded

some of its most marked properties. Mayow's discovery, however, led to nothing,
while Priestley's was the most important step in that reconstruction of speculative
chemistry which was commenced by Black and carried on with surprising energy
and thoroughness by Lavoisier and his associates. I shall not detain you by enu-
merating the ways in which this discovery has affected chemistry both practical and
speculative. The preeminent position to which oxygeu was at once elevated, aud
which it so long retained, makes this altogetlier unnecessary. I wish, however, to
point out one character of the phlogistic controversy which sharply distinguishes it
from many others. The truth represented by the theory of Phlogiston was not re-
cognized with sufficient distiuctuess by the supporters of that tlieory to give them
any chance of success in opposition to a baud of devoted adherents of a view which
was clearly imderstood by all. The phlogistists were completely defeated, and the
theory ceased to exist. It has been left for chemic:il antiquaries to pick out, with
difficulty and uncertainty, a meaning from the ruins.

   I have mentioned this character because I wish to draw j'our attention lo anotlier
more recent controversy, the result of which was very different.
--46 KEPOiix 1874.

  The questious as to clieuiical constitution I'aised about forty years ago by Dumas
and the new Frencli scliool, in opposition to Berzelius, maj' now be said to be prac-

tically settled. The great majority of chemists are agreed as to what is to be

understood by chemical constitution, and also as to the nature and amount of e\i-

Howdence reciuired in order to determine the constitution of a substance.  has this

agreement been produced ? Some historical ^v^иiters seem to wish us to believe that

it is the result of the triumph of the ideas of Dumas, Gerhardt, and Laurent, and

the defeat of the dualistic radical theory of Berzelius ; that the arguments of Ber-

zelius and his followers were only useful as giving occasion for a more full and

convincing proof of the unitary substitution theory than would otherwise have beeu

called for ; that, in fact, the adherents of Dualism played the part (notimfrequeutly

supposed to be that of the conservative party in politics) of checking and criticising

the successive developments of truth, and thus allowing them lime to ripen.

In opposition to the view thus broadly stated, I woidd place another, and for the

sake of contrast shall state it also in perhaps too broad a form. That the two

theories, the dualistic radical theory and the unitary substitution theory, were both

true and both imperfect, that they imderwent gradual development, scarcely in-

ilueuced by each other, iiutil they have come to be almost identical in reference to

points where they at one time seemed luost opposed.

   I have said that the development of the one theory was scarcely influenced by
that of the other. Of com-se the facts discovered by both parties were common

property, and the development of both theories depended upon the discover^' of these

facts ; buttlie explanations of facts and the reasoning from them given by each party

seemed to the other scarcely worthy of serious consideration and were treated as

matter of ridicvile. And the habit of mind created by this mode of viewing the

opposed theory lias rendered it difficult for those who were engaged in the contro-

versy on either side to see how nearly the two theories have now come to coinci-

dence. Their language still remains different ; but as the facts are the same for both,

it is not difficult for a neutral critic to translate from the one to the other ; and if

we do so we shall see that there is much real agreement between the two modes of

representing chemical ideas, historically derived, the cue from Berzelius, the other

from Dumas, Lam'ent, and Gerhardt.

In both, chemical constitution is regarded as the order in which the ccmslituents

arc nnited in the compound; and the same fundamental notion is indicated in the one

by reference to proximate constituents, in the other by the concatenation of atoms.

To show that this is so, and that the fundamental notion can be arrived at from the

dualistic as well as fi-om the imitary starting-point, I shall cite an illustrative case.

Every student of chemical history will remembei' the view of the constitution of tri-

chloracetic acid propounded by Berzelius, and afterwards supplemented by a similar

view of the constitution of acetic acid and an explanation of the likeness of some

of the properties of these two substances. This has sometimes been spoken of as a

subterfuge of a not very creditable kind, by means of which BerzeHus apparently

saved his consistency while really yielding to the argiuuents of his opponents. But

if, instead of looking at it in the light of the substitution controversy, we consider it

in itself as a contribution to speculative chemisti-y, we at once recognize in it a

statement, in Berzelian language, of the views we now hold as to the constitution of

these acids. The view was that acetic acid is a compound of oxalic acid and methyl,

trichloracetic acid a compoimd of oxalic acid and the sesquichloride of carbon.

They differ considerably from each other, because the " copiilse " (methyl and sesqui-

chloride of carbon respectively) are different ; but their resemblance is strongly

marked because they contain the same active constituent, oxalic acid : and most of

the prominent characters of the substances depend upon it, and not upon the copula.

Let us first free this statement from what we may call archaisms of language. It

--will then assume something like the foUov^'ing form : The carbon in acetic acid is

equally divided between two proximate constituents, one of which is an oxide, the

other a hydride of carbon. Trichloracetic acid similarly contains an oxide and a

chloride of carbon, between which the carl)on is equally divided. The oxide is the

same in both acids, and is that oxide which occiu-s in oxalic acid. The hydride

and the chloride have the composition of the substances, the formulfe of which are

OjHg and Co Clj respectively. Oxalic acid undergoes chemical change much more
        --

readily than the correspondint^ hydride or chloride ; and therefore the chemical

character of acetic and of trichloracetic acids depends much more on the oxidized than

on the other constituent, and they thus hare a marlced resemblance. The oxidized

constituent is united to the other in a manner different from that in which oxalic

acid is united to bases in the oxalates, inasmuch as, while the basic water of

hydrated oxalic acid is displaced when oxalic acid imites with a base, in hydrated

acetic and trichloracetic acids there is the same proportion between the basic water

and the oxidized carbon as there is in oxalic acid.

  Now has not this a great resemblance to the view entertained by most modern

chemists, that acetic acid is a compound of the radical carboxyl (half a molecule of

oxalic acid) and the radical methyl (half a molecule of methyl gas), that trichlor-

acetic acid similarly contains the same radical carboxyl and the radical CI3, and

that the prominent chemical properties of these bodies depend upon their contain-

in^ carboxyl, and that they therefore resemble each other ?

The modern view contains nothing inconsistent with that of Berzelius ; but it no

doubt contains something more : it contains an explanation of the difference between

the manner in which carboxyl is united to methyl in acetic acid, and the manner in

which oxalic acid is united to bases in the oxalates. But it will siu'ely be admitted

--that Berzelius was here far ahead of his opponents so far ahead, that they alto-

gether failed to see his meaning, and looked upon his argument as a clumsy device.

The ti'eatment by Berzelius of the constitution of the sulpho-acids furnishes a

precisely similar case. These are now regarded as compounds of the radical

OHSO.,  (which we may call sulphoxyl). This radical is half a molecule of hypo-

sulphuric acid ; and Berzelius considered them coiipled compoimds of hyposulphiu-ic
acid, adopting at once the \-iew first brought forward by Kolbo in his classical me-

moir on the sulphite of perchloride of carbon and the acids derived from it.

I might pursue the history of the carbon- and sulpho-acids further, and ti-ace the

development of the theory of their constitution through the discoveries of Kolbe,

and his beautiful application to the cases of carbon and sulphui of Fraukland's far-

sighted speculation on the constitution of the organo-metallic bodies, pointing out

the relation of Kolbe's views of the constitution of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, and

ketones to the Berzelian theory on the one hand, and to the opinions of modern

chemists on the other ; but the gi'eater part of such an historical sketch has been

given very recently by Kolbe himself in the ' Jom-nal fiir praktische Chemie,' and

I may therefore omit it.

   It would be easy to bring forward cases to show that our present views can be
directly derived from the substitution tlieoiy and the types of Dumas and Gerhardt,

through the complications of multiple and mixed types and the labyrinthine

formulae to which these gave rise, to the wonderfully simple and comprehensive

system of Kekule ; but that is unnecessary, as this development has been fully and

ably described by more than one thoroughly competent wi-iter.

  We have been discussing a case in which Berzelius was right in considering a

--compound of carbon, oxygen, and chlorine as composed of two parts an oxide and

a chloride of carbon. It is only just that we should take some notice of cases, at
first sight similar, in which modern chemists would be inclined to think that he was

wrong. This is the more necessary, as an examination of these cases will enable

us to see what was the really valuable conti-ibution made to speculative chemistry

by the substitution theory.

' Compounds containing three elements were formulated in two different ways by

Berzelius :

 --1st. One of the elements was represented as combined with a radical composed

of the other two, as : hydrocyanic acid, H^ . Co N^ ; ether, C; IIi,, . O.
   2nd. The ternary compound was represented as composed of two binary com-

--pounds, having one element common, as : caustic potash, KO, H., ; chromochloric

acid, 2Cr03,CrCl,.

   Phosgene gas was at first formidated in the former of these ways as CO, CL ; but

latterly he was forced, in consistency, to give up all radicals containing oxygen or

other strongly electi'o -negative element*, and to write the formula of phosgene gas

   * In 1833 Berzelius was inclined to regard Cj Oj, to which he gave the name "osatyl,''
as the radical of oxalic acid and osamide.

C'0.,, CI,. Similarly, iu eveiy case -where a positi\e element or radical is combined

with two negative elements or radicals, he represented the compound as composed

--of two binary compounds, thus chloride of acetyl, 20.^ H^ 0,, (J, Hj Clg, as a com-

pomid of acetic acid and the corresponding terchloride.

This was in perfect consistency with the mode in which ternary compounds con-

taining one negative and two positive elements or radicals were formulated, as

caustic potash, KO, H2 O, sulphate of copper, OuO, SO3, &c. ; but it lacks the prac-

tical justification which can be given for the formula OjHg, C, O3 for acetic acid

for phosgene acts readily on water, forming carbonic and hydi-ochloric acids, an

action which does not take place with perchloride of carbon ; and it is not easy to

see why the latter substance should be more readily attacked by water when com-

bined with carbonic acid than when free. This diflerence did not escape the
attention of Berzelius, and led him to distinguish two modes of chemical union :--

1st. Where the constituents were held together by the electro-chemical force, and

wholly or partially neuti-alized each other, as in the oxygen and sulphur salts ; and
2nd, where a so-called " copula" was attached by an unkno^vu force to a substance

without gi-eatly modifying its chemical activity. The distinction seems arbitrary

but it was not, as is usually supposed, a mere artificial bulwark to protect the

electTO-chemical theory ; it has a real and veiy important meaning, a meaning which

the development of the substitution theory enables us to explain.

The phenomena of electrolysis, upon which the Berzelian system is based, bring

forward into great prominence one of the chemical units, viz. the equivalent ; and

the preeminent position of oxygen as the most electro-negative element made it

most natural to select the atom of oxygen as the standard of equi^alence, so that

an equivalent of any element or radical was defined as that quantity of it which

is equivalent to one atom of oxygen. Gay-Lussac's law of gaseous volumes,

which was adopted by Berzelius, and which, by a cmlous accident, happens to be

true for all elements gaseous at ordinary temperatures, led to the formulae H^ and

Clo for the equivalents of hydrogen and chlorine; but although these formulae

explicitly indicate the divisibility of the equivalents of these elements, this divisi-

bility was not recognized, and integral numbers of equivalents were alone tolerated.

Thus hydrochloric acid was wi-itteu H^Clg, ammonia Noll,,, &c., and the etATiiological

meaning of the word atom was soon lost. The use of barred letters to indicate two

atoms or one equivalent of such elements as hydi'ogen and chlorine further contri-

buted to hide the important fact of their divisibility.

The iu"st great result of the substitution theory was to change the unit of equiva-

lence, and to take as the standard the atom of hydrogen or of chlorine instead of

that of oxygen ; and although it would be most unjust to forget the services of

Dumas, Gerhardt, Laurent, and Odling in this matter, the credit of removing the

bars from 11, 01, and their comrades, and allowing the hitherto chained partners

to walk at liberty, undoubtedly belongs mainly to our distinguished colleague and

master Professor Williamson.

The establishment of the water type, or (to put it in another form) the proof that

the atom of oxygen contains two units of oxygen, inseparably united but capable of

separate action, led the way to the explanation of all the difficulties which beset the

theor}' of radicals and ccipuliie. It at once explained how two oxides or two sulphides

imite  together*                                         and  the  idea  of  "polybasic," or,  as we  should  now say, polyad
                                                      ;

atoms and radicals, was soon iised to explain theexistenceof polybasic acids, double

salts, acichlorides, and many other kinds of ternary compounds.

   But a fact does not cease to exist because it is explained. Quicklime and water

unite together, although we can now explain how they do so ; and a useful purpose
may still be served by the enumeration, as in the old dualisticformulae, of the pairs

of united equivalents. Although some of these equivalents belong to the same

atoms, it is nevertheless true that they are united in pairs. Caustic potash might

thus be formulated, K0i,H0i or i(K,0,H2 0)_; phosgene gas, i(CO,, CCIJ; and

chlorochromic acid, \(2GxGj, CrClg). These formulre are not so well suited for

general use as those now current ; but the consideration of them as acciu-ate repre-
sentations of facts may enable us to see that the copulfe of Berzelius had a real and

apparently so similnr to the double oxides and sxdphides, are .still unexplained.

-- --valuable meaning. Take, for instance, llie formula of acetic acid, H3C CO OH,

or jOIIj, 5CO2, illjO, iU^; it is this last term As^hich indicates the coupled cha-

racter of the compound. If we look upon acetic acid as a compound of carbon,
it is a coupled compound becau.se all the equivalents of carbon in it do not be-

long to the same atom, and the two atoms of carbon are directly united togethei",

and replacement of the equivalents united to one of these atoms does not very

greatly affect the function or chemical character of the equivalents united to the

other.

I have perhaps spent too much of your time upon these historical question,?. Let

us now shortly consider what is the present state of our knowledge as to chemical

constitution. This I have already defined as the order in which the constituents

Weare united in the compound.                                                                        may indeed use metaphorical language, and speak

of the relative position of atoms, perhaps deluding ourselves into the notion that

such language is more than metaphorical ; Ijut the phenomena of combination and

decomposition, although we cannot doubt that they depend solely upon the relative

position and dynamical relations of the atoms, are not alone sufficient to prove even

--that atoms exist. Our knowledge of the intimate structure of matter comes from

another sovu'ce from the study of the properties rather than of the changes of sub-

stances, and of the transformations of energy which accompany the transformations

of matter.

This is sti-ictly a branch of Chemistry : the aim of chemistry is to connect the

properties of substances and the changes they undergo with their composition,

taking this word in its widest sense ; and we must not allow om* friends in
A WeSection to cut om- science in two and appropriate the half of it.
                                                                                                                                        all frankty
--admit that Chemistry is a brancli of Physics ; but it is so as a whole no section of

it is more pm-ely ph5'sical than all the rest. To accept a narrower definition

of Chemistry is to reduce om-selves to the position which the collector occupies

among naturalists                                                                          it is to  admit that it is our business  to  provide  part  of
                                                                                        ;

the materials out of which a science in which we have no share may be constructed

by others. But we need not fear that this so-called physical side of Chemistry will

ever be divorced from the study of chemical change. The names of Faraday and

Graham among those who have left us, of Andrews among those who are still at

worlf, are sufficient pi'oof of this ; and a study of their researches will conclusively

show that great results can be looked for in this direction only from a physicist

who is also a chemist.

   Tliere are three special directions in which such investigations have alieady

--influenced chemical theory : 1st. Electrolysis, which has confirmed the equivalent

as a chemical unit, has proved that equivalents unite in pairs, thus forming the

basis of the electro-chemical theorj^ and has shown us how to estimate the amormt

of energy involved in the union of a given pair of eqxuvalents. 2nd. Vajwur-
densiti/, from which Avogadro inferred the law of molecular volumes (since proved
by Clerk-Maxwell), which has given us the molecule as a chemical miit, and
formed the basis of the Unitary theory. 3rd. Speci/ic heat, from which Dulong

and Petit infened their empirical law, which gives us the most satisfactory

physical definition of the atom as a chemical imit.

  We natiually turn to the future, and try to guess whence the next great revolution

will come. For although periods of quiet have their use, as afibrding time for filling
up the blank schedules fmnished by the last speculative change, such periods have

seldom been long, and each has been shorter than its predecessor.

But it is impossible to make a certain forecast : looking back, we see a logical

sequence in the history of chemical speculation ; and no doubt the next step

will appear, after it has been taken, to follow as naturally from the present

--position. One thing we can distinctly see we are struggling towards a theory of

Chemi.stry. Such a theory we do not possess. What we are sometimes pleased

to dignify with that name is a collection of generalizations of various degrees of
Weimperfection.
                                                                                           cannot attain to a real theory of Chemistry until we are able to

connect the science by some hypothesis with the general theory of Dynamics. No

attempt of this kind has hitherto been made ; and it is difficult to see how any such
attempt can be made imtil we know something in reference to the absolute size,

mass, and shape of molecules and atoms, the position of the atoms in the molecule,
                                                  --

and the nature of the forces acting upon them. Whence can we look for such

knowledge ?

The phenomena of gaseous diffusion, of gaseous friction, and of the propagation

of heat tlu'ough gases have already given us an approximation to the size and mass

of the molecules of gases. It is not imreasouahle to suppose that a comparative

study of the specific heat of gases and vapours may lead to some approximate

knowledge as to the shape of their molecules ; and a comparison of such approximate

results with the chemical constitution of the suhstances may lead to an hj'pothesis

which will lay the foundation of a real theory of Chemistry.

Chemistry will then become  a  branch  of  applied    Mathematics                                                      but it will  not
                                                                                                                    ;

cease to be an experimental science. Mathematics may enable us retrospectively to

justify results obtained by experiment, may point out useful lines of research, and

even sometimes predict entirely novel discoveries, but will not revolutionize our

laboratories. Mathematical will not replace Chemical analysis.

  We do not know when the change will take place, or whether it will be gradual

or sudden ; but no one who believes in the progress of human knowledge and in the

consistency of Nature can doubt that ultimately the theory of Chemistry and of all

other physical sciences will be absorbed into the one theory of Dynamics.

On the Composition of an Inflammable Gas issuing from lelow the Silt-bed in
                          Belfast. By Dr. Andrews, F.R.S.

In sinking for a well upon the premises of Messrs. Cantrell and Cochrane, in

George's Lane, Police Square, Belfast, after having passed through a deposit of

silt to the depth of 33 feet, a layer of gravel was reached, 7 feet in thickness,

and containing a quantity of organic debris. It rested upon a thick deposit of very

tenacious clay. On entering the gi-avel-bed, a large flow of water occurred, which

rose to within 4 feet of the surface of the ground, and interrupted the operation of

boring, till a pump, worked by a small steam-engine, was erected, which, so long-

as it was in action, kept the boring free from water as far as the surface of the

Agravel-bed.  workman, having lowered a light to examine the bottom of the

well, was sui-prised to see a lambent flame playing over the surfiicc. On examina-

tion this was found to arise from a disengagement of inflammable gas, which had
accumulated between the lower surface of the bed of silt and the layer of gravel.

  An iron pipe, terminating- in a funnel-shaped mouth, about one foot in diameter,

was now sunk till it reached the gas-stratum ; and the water in the well was kept

by pumping at such a level that an extra pressure of about one inch of water was

maintained upon the gas below. The gas now flowed freely, at the rate of about

40 cubic inches per minute, through the upper end of the iron pipe, and, when

ignited, burned with a yellow flame, which could scarcely be distinguished from

that of ordinary coal-gas.

  Two portions of the gas were carefully collected by displacement, the stream of

gas being allowed to pass till the whole of the atmospheric air in the vessels was

completely swept away. The connecting tubes were then carefully sealed, and the

gas was afterwards analyzed in the laboratory of Queen's College.

  A measured volume of the gas, standing over mercury, was exposed to the action,

first, of caustic potash, and afterwaids of pyrogallic acid, and the residual gas was

afterwards analyzed with the following results :

VIn this Table  is the volume of the gas, T its temperature in Centigrade

Bdegrees, the height of the barometer in millimetres, and C the height of the

mercury in the tube in which the observations were made. From these data, and

the results of the previous action of the caustic potash and pyrogallic acid, it fol-

lows that the composition of the gas was :

Marsh-gas (C HJ                                 83-75
                                                  2'44

Oxygen
                                                12-75
Nitrogen

  The density of the gas =(air 1) was found to be 0-661, which corresponds nearly

to the foregoing composition. The gas was inodorous, and contained no compound
of carbon and hydrogen except marsh-gas.

   From this analysis it is evident that the gas formed in this subterranean sheet

of water is in all respects the same as that which is produced in stagnant pools

containing leaves and other vegetable matters.

            on Metallic Iron. By I. Lowxhian Bell, F.E.S., F.C.S.

    In the operation of smelting iron the reducing agent for all practical purposes is

carbonic oxide. The power this substance possesses of depriving an ore of iron of its
oxygen is greatly weakened by the presence of the resulting carbonic acid. From

my own experiments, it would appear that when one third of the carbon in the gases

of a blast-furnace is raised to its highest state of oxidation, further action is so re-

tarded as virtually to place a limit on the economy of fuel in the process in question.
   Besides this reducing property exercised by carbonic oxide, there is a second one

which, like the former, takes place in the upper and cooler parts of the fm-naco, viz.
the splitting up of itself in considerable quantities into carbon and carbonic acid by
contact with iron. This rearrangement of elements is accompanied by an evolu-
tion of heat, and at the same time returns a quantity of carbon to the operation.

Here also, when carbonic acid exceeds certain limits, this reaction ceases.
   In certain smeltiug-works in Austria, where charcoal is employed, white pig is

Ereduced with a smaller quantity of fuel than I would have supposed possible,
  eeping the law just mentioned in view. This difference might be supposed due to

some peculiarity in the ore itself, which was of the spathose variety. It was found,
however, when coke was substituted for charcoal in a properly constructed furnace,
having a height of 60 feet, the fuel required rose from l4 to nearly 24 cwt. to the
ton of metal, which is something more than that required in this country.

   In a furnace in the county of Durham, where coke was exclusively used, I
found cyanogen combined with sodium and potassium exist in more considerable
quantities than had been hitherto suspected. Supposing it possible that these
cyanides might be more abundant in charcoal-furnaces, where the fuel is richer in
alkaline substances than is the case with mineral fuel, I had the following experi-
ments performed in the laboratory of the Clarence Iron Works by Mr. Rocholl, to
determine the effect relatively of carbonic acid in restraining the reducing and
carbon-depositing powers of carbonic oxide and cyanogen.

    Carbonic acid and cyanogen, carefully prepared and dried, were introduced in
measured quantities into a mercurial gas-holder. The specimens of oxide of iron
were exposed in porcelain tubes to a current of the mixed gases, all air having been
previously expelled. Heat was applied by means of a Hofmann's gas-furnace,
and the temperature of the interior of the tube was ascertained by means of the
electric pyrometer of Dr. Siemens, which during the experiment did not indicate
a greater fluctuation than 25░ C.

   I formerly ascertained that when equal volumes of carbonic oxide and carbonic
acid were passed over peroxide of iron at a red heat, it was impossible to remove
oxygen below that required to form proto.\ide of the metal j aii(l in like manner,

when metallic iron in the form of sponge was similarly treated, it was transformed

into porous oxide. In neither case was any deposited carbon produced.

In the present trials, the proportions of cyanogen and carbonic acid first emplo3'ed

were one volume of the former and six of the latter, because in such a mixture the

relation of oxygen to carbon is the same as that subsisting in equal volumes of the

two gaseous oxides of carbon which, as just stated, were incapable of reducing iron

to the metallic state.

 --Experiment 1. Such a mixture (1 of Cy+6 of CO.) was passed through the

tube containing no oxide of iron at a temperature of 814░ C, which was gradually

lowered. The gas as it escaped was so nearly absorbed by potash as to be

accounted for by a wace of atmospheric air remaining in the apparatus; for the
slight trace of unabsorbed gas burnt with the characteristic blue name of carbonic

oxide. It was therefore inferred that heat alone effected no change in this mix-

of iron at a temperature varying from 685░ to 711░ "0. Large quantities of nitrogen

and carbonic oxide were given off during the whole of the experiment, accompanied

bj' cyanogen and carbonic acid escaping unchanged.

The original weight of the ferric oxide was                   1'6465 gi'amme.

After an exposure of 1.3 minutes, during which 1'28 litre

of the mixed gases had passed through the tube, it

weighed                                                       1-5295   ,,

After a lapse of 2| hours, and after 8-5 litres of the gases

had passed, it weighed                                        1"5855   ,,

On analysis the substance exposed was found to consist, for every 100 parts of

iron, of

          Iron in the metallic state                          56'3

          Iron as an oxide                                    43"7

   In this case 79'9 per cent, of the original oxygen has been removed.

 --Experiment 3. Spongy iron was now exposed to the same mixture (1 Cy+G CO^)

at a temperature of 712░ to 726░ C. The issuing gases contained carbonic oxide and

nitrogen, as in the previous experiment.

The original iron weighed                                     1"314 gi-amme.

In 56 min. 6-7 litres of the mixed gases had passed through

the tube, the iron was found to weigh                         1'596    ,,

In 2 hrs. 20 min. 14 litres had been used, and the pro-

duct weighed                                                  1-600 ,,

   There is such a similarity in the composition of the products in experiments 2

and 3 as to render it probable that at the same temperature, when about 57 or 58

per cent, of the iron exists as metal, and the remainder consists of 8 equivalents of
iron united to 6 equivalents of oxj-gen, further action ceases, whether iron or its
peroxide be the substance employed.

   Here, again, 6 equivalents of oxygen are combined with 5 of iron, but the metal

    In this case the iron is almost precisely associated with the necessary oxygen to
form protoxide.

   In all these experiments cyanogen has been emplo5'ed in its uncombined state,
whereas in the blast-furnace this substance is almost entirely united with potas-
sium or sodium. The difficulty, if not indeed the impossibility, of adjusting known

proportions of a vaporized cyanide and carbonic acid induced me to use the
cyanogen in the manner described. I did not hesitate to adopt this mode of proce-
dure, because I almost invariably found the quantity of cyanogen, when compared

with the potassium and sodium in the gases, indicated the decomposition of this
compound of carbon and nitrogen during their progress through the heated con-

tents of the blast-furnace.

   In eight trials, at an aperture 8 feet above the level of the tuyeres, the average
quantities per cubic metre of gas were found to be

whereas at the point of exit of the gases, about G5 feet higher up in the furnace,
there was only found in an average of five trials :

Potassium                               7-04 gi-ammes.

Cyanogen                                2-03     ,,

                                        3-77     ,,

   In the first case 100 parts of the metals are accompanied by 51-7 per cent, of
cyanogen, whereas in the second this is reduced to 41-5 per cent. The diminution
in the potassium and sodiimi themselves is, of course, due to their condensation

among the cooler contents of the fiu-nace; and it is in this way that the great

accumulation of these cyanides and other alkaline salts can be accoimted for, and
which in one case amoimted per cubic metre of gas to :

Potassium                               73-47 grammes.

   It would of course be rash, in the absence of actual examination of the gases of

one of these Austrian fiu-naces, to ascribe their superior action to the use of char-

coal instead of coke. All, therefore, that this paper can pretend to is an indication

of the direction in which the cause of the dinereuce may lie ; for it seems clear
that oxygen may bo present in much larger proportions in a mixture of cyanogen

and carljonic acid than in one of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, and a strong
reducing and carbon-depositing tendency still retained. Possibly also the mere facts

as they are here described may not be considered devoid of scientific interest.
   In conclusion, I would remark that it is only when white iron is the object

sought for, that this imusual economy of fuel is apparent in Austria. This, I have

evaporation and expulsion of the cyanogen compound from the fm-nace at the

     On the Dissociation of Nitric Acid by various means.
        By P. Beaham, F.C.S., and J. W. Gatehouse.

The first series of the following experiments was performed by passing the

vapoiu" of nitric acid of sp. gr. 1'48 through tubes exposed to various temperatiu-es,

it being foimd that the higher the temperatm-e to which the vapom* was exposed

the greater was the percentage of HNO3 decomposed, and also that the dissociation

which occiu'red at high temperatiu-es was more complete than that which took

place at lowe"r temperatures.

By passing nitric-acid vapour tlu'ough molten tin, 2-51 per cent, of the vapom*

issuing from the retort was decomposed, and 0-7 per cent, of gas evolved. This gas

contained 9.5 per cent, of oxygen, the remainder, after explosion with hj-drogen,

being nitrogen.

By passing the vapoiu- thi-ough molten lead from 21 -28 to 31'84 per cent, was

dissociated, and from 2'96 to 4'1 per cent, of gas evolved.

The vapour being heated by means of a Bunsen's burner, 64-09 per cent, was

decomposed and 8'05 per cent, of gas evolved.

The heat from a charcoal fire, the vapom* being conducted through a hard glass

tube, decomposed about 65 per cent, of acid * and yielded 10-44 per cent, of gas.

With a charcoal fire, the vapour being passed through a porcelain tube, 89-7 per

cent, was decomposed and 13-23 per cent, of gas evolved.

In the second series, conducted by passing nitric acid through a clay pipe exposed

to various teniperatxu-es, that of a T-shaped Bimsen decomposed 71 '72 per cent,,

yielding 9'13 per cent, of gas.

Using a clay pipe heated with charcoal, 83-4 per cent, sviffered decomposition,

yielding 11-5 per cent, of gas.

In these two series of experiments the percentage of oxygen contained in the gas

collected gradually decreased from 95 per cent, in the case of molten tin to 78 4 per

cent, in the case of the charcoal fire, the remainder consisting of nitrogen and
nitrous oxide. Nitrous acid or tetroxide of nitrogen was produced largely in every

The  proportions of 0,  N,  and  N^O  could  not  be  determined  with  exactitude                                           but
                                                                                                                          ;

in the case of the T-shaped Bunsen the amoimt approximated to 79-6 per cent, of O,

10 of NjO, and 10-4 of N.

   It thus appears that the whole of the oxides of nitrogen are produced diu'ing the

dissociation of nitric acid by heat ; an approximation to the reactions occurring may

be expressed by the following formula :

                 8HNO, = 4H,0+2NO,+N,0,+N,0+N,+0,,.

   Experiments were also imdertaken by us to ascertain whether any decomposition

of nitric acid occm-red dm-ing the act of boiling.
   Pure nitric acid is not decomposed ; but if it contains nitrous acid, then decom-

position proceeds till the whole of the N^ O3 is expelled, when no fiu-ther change

ensues.

   The decomposing action of sunlight on nitric and nitrous acids was also studied.
    Pure nitric acid placed in a full bulb, sealed, and exposed several days to sun-
light, remained colourless, and without evolution of gas ; but the same acid exnosed
to sunlight in a sealed tube only partially full was powerfully decomposed, yielding
over 1 per cent, of nitrous acid and a considerable amount of gas.
   This action in sealed tubes is not continuous ; for when the nitrous acid formed

attains to about 2 per cent, of the quantity of nitric acid present, all decomposition

ceases.

   * The amount could not be accurately determined, as the heat fused the glass tube, and
a little of the acid was lost.

              The Injurious Effects of Dew-rotting Flax in certain cases.

           By William Charley, J.P., of Seymour Hill, near Belfast.

   The cultivation of the flax-plant in the field is not a matter of extraordinary
difficulty. It is the after-management that generally embarrasses the farmer, and
particularly in those districts where the crop is tried for the first time. The extension
of flax-cultivation in the British Isles would be very useful to the important
industry of the linen manufacture, and would add a remunerative crop to the
limited list of the British agricultm-ist. At present the land occupied by flax is
chiefly to be found in Ulster. The present year's return gives 102,789 acres for this
province, the rest of Ireland showing only 4097 acres. The author is not aware
of any accm-ate statistics on the subject regarding England and Scotland, but a few
thousands would probably cover the quantity of acres cultivated.

   The first difficulty that meets the inexperienced farmer after his flax is gathered
off the field is the steeping-process. The celebrated Louis Orommelin (appointed
overseer of the linen manufacture in Ireland by King William III.), writing in

--1705 on the subject of preparing flax, quaintly says : " Flax may be prepared

without watering by grassing it until such time as the stem corrupts yet it is
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

better to water it where it can possibly be done without great inconvenience."
   So far as the author can form an opinion, this plan of preparing without watering,

commonly called " dew-rotting," is quite imsuited for any but the coarsest flax,
such as would not be spun into yarn used for making bleaching cloth. There is
something in the process of steeping flax (a process more accm-ately, perhaps,
described by the common expression of retting or rotting) which seems necessary
to ensiu-e the attainment of high coloiu- when the prepared fibre is manufactured
into cloth, and arrives at the bleaching department. The fermentation, which seems

to be of a putrefactive natui-e, acts on the juices and gummy matters which cement

the woody stem to the pm-e fibre of the plant, and also not only assists the after
separation of these, which is the object of the subsequent scutching-operation, but
has such a powerful effect on the colom-ing-matter of the fibre as to render tlie
change requu-ed in bleaching much more safe and successful. But though grassing
alone is not sufficient to make a proper preparation of good fibre, it is, after the
steeping is over, a most usefid and necessary addition.

   There is another point woi-th mentioning in connexion with the steeping of flax

brackish water, such as may be met with in the low-lying districts near the sea, should
be carefully avoided. The practice of using it is now generally admitted to be

injurious to the fibre intended for white linen : it also gives a leaden dull colom-

iQ many cisja to the flax itself. With respect to iuiproveuients in the flix-steepin":
process, there is really very little to report of late years. Tho ordinary opeu-air
system ia can-ied on in much the same way as when Louis (Jrommellu wrote in 1705.
Various new plans have been suggested, and to some extent practised with more or

less success.

  --The author described several of these new plans, and concluded by saying : " The

time may arrive when a regular and extensive business may be taken up in all flax-

growing districts by enterprising individuals with the object of buying the flax

from the farmsrs in the green state, and treating it in an improved way on a large

scale, combining probably the steeping of the flax and scutching-operations in the

same establishment. Meantime let farmers who wish to make a proflt in growing

flax attend as carefully to the watering process as to the tield cultivation, and avoid

as a general rule the imperfect dew-rotting system, or the use of brackish water in

any of the pools intended for steeping this valuable plant."

                             By Thomas Fairley, F.C.S.

   It is shown that under certain circumstances chlorine and hydrogen peroxide

react so as to give hypochlorous acid : thus

                                 Cl,+Hs,0, = 2HC10.

A large excess of chlorine must be used, and the peroxide containing 2-45 per cent,

added gradually to the chlorine-water. The peroxide is acted on, and the chromic-

acid test does not show its presence in the mixture. On further addition of peroxide
much gas is given oft", which is pure oxygen.

   If we stop the addition of peroxide while there is still large excess of chlorine,-

and cautiously add ferroas sulphate solution to remove the excess, a bleaching
liquid is obtained having the characteristic smell and properties of hypochlorous

acid.

   The evolution of oxygen arises from a secondary reaction of hypochlorous acid
and hvdrogen peroxide.

                              nC104-II,0,=HCl+H,0+0,.

   The oxygen is given off" equally from the hypochlorous acid and the peroxide.
Besides hypochlorous acid I have verified this equation with calcium, sodium, and

potassium hypochlorites. Brodie has shown that a similar reaction takes place
with barium peroxide and solution of bleaching-powder in acetic acid. The reaction
of hypochlorous acid and peroxide of hydrogen explains the evolution of oxygen in
continued addition of the peroxide to chlorine-water, or its immediate evolution on

addition of chlorine-watev to peroxide.

Bramine and iodine give similar results. Their solutions in dilute alkali also

evolve oxygen with the peroxide.

In the case of iodine and peroxide the hydriodic acid formed is also acted on by

the peroxide, so that the amount of iodine at the end of the reaction, when all the

Aperoxide is decomposed, is the same as at first.  small amount of free iodine can,

thei-efore, even in cold dilute solutions, decompose an unlimited quantity of peroxide.

If an alkaline iodide or free alkali be present, then the more stable iodide is not so

readily decomposed by the peroxide.

The author reserves the discussion of hypotheses imtil he has completed experi-

ments with other oxygen acids of chlorine and sulphui*.

                    On Perchloric Acid. By T. Faielet, F.O.S.

  When ozone is passed into a solution of hypochlorous acid or hypochlorite, per-

cliloric acid is formed, probably thus

                                       HC10+03=H010,.

Ozonized air passed through a solution of sodium hypochlorite gives a liquid
\yhich, in neutral solutions, precipitates potassium li'om its compoimds as potsis-
sium perchlorate. The author is continuing his experiments to prove that the
complete molecule of ozone is absorbed as such with a view to explaining the con-
stitution of perchloric acid.

   The author has proved that hydrogen peroxide (2'45 per cent.) does not react on
chloric acid or chlorates to give perchloric acid, and that no action of any kind
takes place. The peroxide has no action on perchloric acid and its salts, 'which
in this respect diiler from the permanganates. The above-mentioned experiment
is the first of its kind involving the formation of perchloric acid at ordinary tem-

peratiires.

                     Electrolytic Experiments on some Metallic Chlorides.

                    By Professor Glabstonh and Alfred Tribe.

    During experiments on their air-battery the authors observed that if plates of
copper and platimmi be immersed in a solution of chloride of copper and be metal-
lically connected, cuprous chloride is deposited on the platimmi plate, while the
copper plate is also attacked, and a galvanic cm'rent passes through the liquid from
the metal of higher to that of lower potential. "\\'eak external currents produce a

similar electrolysis of Cu 01, into Cu CI and CI between platinum poles. Com-

binations of zinc or magnesium with platinum decompose cupric chloride still more
energetically, with the production of some metallic copper as well as cuprous
chloride on the negative plate. Precisely analogous experiments were obtained
with mercury and gold immersed in mercuric chloride, the insoluble mercm-oiia
salt being deposited on the gold plate.

On the Petrified Wood of Lowjh Neagh. By Professor Hodges, M.D., F.C.S.

   The occiu'rence along the shores of Lough iSeagh, in Ireland, of masses of
petrified wood has from very early times attracted attention, and many ancient
writers, and several modern authorities, have ascribed to the waters of this lake

remarkable petrifying qualities.
    Bischof, in his ' Chemical Geology,' also refers to the property of the water of

petrifying wood placed in it, or rather causing its impregnation "with iron, which
induced him, he says, to make a chemical analysis of it. He, however, merely
examined the insoluble portion of the matters left on evaporating the water, and
found, contrary to what he had expected, that there was an extraordinary small
quantity of earthy constituents. From the suspended matter, by means of' hydro-
chloric acid, he extracted iron and alumina, but in too small a quantity to admit
of estimation. The fact that peroxide of iron, he remarks, is the chief constituent

of the suspended matter, is in accordance with the statement, in the Philosophical
                                                               --

Transactions, that the lapidifying substance is iron, and that, иwhen the petritication
is only partial, upon burning such a wood only the petrified part comes to a glow

heat, and the ash which is left is attracted by the magnet. Bischof also made ia
partial examination of a specimen of the petrified wood, which, however, does not

sustain his views respecting the ferruginous nature of the lapidifying miaterial, as
he found it to contain only 0-54 per cent, of oxide of iron and alumina;

   The specimen of petrified wood examined by Bischof gave the following results :-i

On ignition only a feeble empyreumatic odour .was perceptible and a slight

Immense masses of the petrified wood have been found along the shores of the

lahe. Some of the pieces of wood discovered are of large size ; and one mass, de-

scribed by Dr. Barton in his lectures in Natural Philosophy, &c., published in Dublin

in 1751, weighed so much as 700 lbs. ; and there is at present, or was lately, at Lang-;

ford Lodge, near Crumlin, in the county of Antrim, a silicified trunk, ten feet long

and about the same in circumference. The specimens discovered vary very much in

hardness and in colour : when associated with lignites, they are easily split, and

dark-coloured ; but when occureing as boulders in the drift, they are bleached on
the surface white, the interior is black or dark brown. On the surface of some of

the specimens minute crystals of quartz are found. The woody structure of the

petritactions is in general well marked, and microscopic examination shows it to

be that of coniferous trees. By Ivrau.s it has been named Cupressoxyloii Pritchardi,

which among living Conifera; is represented by Cupressaceaj and Podocai-pea;.

The author on several occasions submitted the water of Lough Neagh to chemical

examination, and also made analyses of specimens of the silicified wood. These

analyses show that in no part of the lake does the water contain any considerable

amount of solid matter, and that neither in the water nor in the petrified wood is

Ato be found more than a very minute quantity of iron.         specimen of the water

which had been taken at Sandy Bay, 100 yards from the shore and four miles from

Glenavy river, near a part ░of the lake shore in which tlie petrified wood is fre-

quently discovered, when received was slightly tm-bid from finely divided flocculent

matter, and the colour, when viewed through a layer two feet in length, was pale

greyish yellow. Its taste was soft, and a considerable number of animalcules were

moving about in it. It had an alkaline reaction.

On evaporation it left a yellowish-coloured residue, which became black on igni-

tion.

Structure was clearly visible, and which was white on the outer surface and of a

and by continuing the heat, left a pale buft'-coloured residue. Contrary to what is
stated by some authorities, the wood was not affected by the magnet before or after
ignition. In no specimen has the author found the ash magnetic.

possesses no peculiar qualities, and that the lapidifying material of the petrified
wood is silicic acid and not oxide of iron.

   The examination of the specimens also clearly shows th.at the hai'dening is not
produced merely by superficial incrustation of the lapidifying silicic acid, but that
it has penetrated through almost every portion of the vegetable structure.

             On the Composition of Tea and Tea-Soils from Cacliar.
                        By Professor Hodges, M.D., F.C.S.

Notwithstanding the important place occupied by the tea-plant in the dietary of

.so large a portion of the world, its chemical examination has attracted comparatively

Webut little attention.     owe to Peligot and Mulder the most valuable investiga-

tions which have been made in connexion with it; and niore recently we have been

supplied with some analyses of the ash of teas from the laboratory of Professor

value in reference to the examination of the tea of commerce and the detection of

adulteration^

Some time ago Professor Zijller read before tliePh^'eico-Medical Society of Ei-lan-

gren a paper on the chemical investigation of a Himalaya tea (Repertorium fiir

Pharmacie, Baud xx. Ileft 8), -which possessed peculiar value, from the circum-

stance that the specimen examined might be regarded as consisting of genuine lea

without any foreign admixture, having been received from the groAvers by the late

Baron von Liebig. Professor ZoUer's investigations confirmed the correctness of

observations which he had formerly made respecting the influence which the age

of the leaves of plants exercised on the composition of the ash--that while young

leaves are found to be rich in potash and phosphoric acid, and poor in lime and

silica, the amount of lime and silica in the ash increases with the age of the plant.

As the best qualities of tea are known to consist (as will.be shown below) merely

of the very young shoots of the plant, the estimation of the amount of potash, phos-

phoric acid, lime, and silica may be usefully, as he suggested, employed in

enabling us to judge of the quality of a specimen of tea.

Tlie richness of the tea-ash in potash and phosphoric acid, showing that the tea

had been prepared from young lea-\es, suggested that the amount of matters in the

leaves soluble in water, and of nitrogen, and also probably of theine, would be large.

These anticipations were confu-med by the investigations. The extract obtained by

treating the leaves with boiling water weighed 36-38 per cent., and the nitrogen o'38

per cent., while the theine amounted to 4"95 per cent, of the air-dried leaves.

Some time ago the author had an opportunity of submitting to examination

specimens of tea grown in Cachar, under the superintendence of Samuel Davidson,

Esq., and also a specimen of fine Cachar tea forwarded to him from the same district

by l)r. Joseph Nelson. Mr. Davidson's specimens were taken from the fields in

August, and were carefully enclosed in tinfoil, and may therefore be regarded as

representing genuine, unmixed specimens of Indian tea. Mr. Davidson also kindly

supplied the following history of the crop from which the specimens were taken :

" The leaves were taken from plants in their seventh season, and consisted of the

young shoots from Avhich tea is manufactured, viz. the bud, and first, second, and

thii'd leaves down the stem. In none of the samples were there old leaves or actual

Awood.  shoot with this number of leaves is usually the growth of about twelve

days after the bud has got started to grow. The indigenous sample is from the

variety of the plant which was originally found growing wild in the jungles of these

districts. The author thinks that it is the true Thva riridis. It is a very large-

growing plant, almost a tree, and its leaves when full-grown are very large and

succulent. It vields by far the best quality of tea. The other sample was from a

hybrid plant. This is supposed to be a true hybrid between the indigenous and

China varieties, and certainly partakes very much of the peculiarities of both

varieties. The China plant is the variety, which is probablj' the correct Thea Bohca

originally imported duect from China. It is a miserable, small-growing, stunted

plant compared to the indigenous, the full-grown leaves being only about 2 inches

long, and tlie tea is inferior. The hybrid gives a good strong tea, and is a hardier

plant than the indigenous, and so is very much liked, but the more closely it

approaches to the indigenous it is the more highly prized." The specimens received

by the author had been merely dried in heated rooms. The produce of the crop
was estimated at 400 lbs. of dried tea per English acre. It is so seldom that we

are able fo obtain any precise account of the liistory of the specimens of tea and

other foreign productions which have been submitted to chemical examination, that

Mr. Davidson s report possesses especiiil importance.

  --100 parts of each variety of the tea gave the following results :

   The amount of niti-ogen and alkalies in the subsoil, it will be perceived, exceeds
that which was found in the surface-soil. This may be owing to the circumstance
that heavy rains (40 inches within four months) had fallen for some time before
the specimens were taken.

   Another sample of Cachar tea, kindly forwarded to the author by Dr. Joseph

Nelson, was also examined, chiefly for the ^m-pose of ascertaining how far we coiild

rely upon the determination of the amount of matters which are removed by heating
tea -ndth boiling water, as indicative of the presence in the tea of commerce of

exliausted tea or of foreign leaves.

    100 parts of the specimen were found to contain 4-963 parts of moisture, and the

ash amounted to 5 parts. By treating the leaves with boiling water until exhausted

of soluble matters, and evaporating the solution to dryness, an exact weighing (42-4

grains) was obtained. Determinations of the amount of nitrogen in the leaves as
received, and also in the insoluble residue, were made ; and while the nitrogen of the
original sample amounted to 4"4;2o per cent., the insoluble residue was found to
contain only 2'109 parts, the amount of mineral matters by treatment with water
being reduced to 1-56 part ; so that 68 per cent, of the total mineral matter of the
tea, and about 58 per ceut. of the nitrogen, had been removed in the infusion.

    On ilie Composition of the Fibre of the Jute-plant, and its use a^ a Textile
                   Material. By Professor Hodges, M.D., F.C.S.

    At the Meeting of the Association held in Belfast twenty-two years ago, the
 author read a report on the composition of the flax-plant, the fibre of which
 supplies the raw material of the staple industry of this part of L-eland. In that
 and subsequent reports he gave an account of a series of investigations which had
 been undertaken at the request of the Association, and in which the composition
 of the fibre and the changes which it undergoes in its technical preparation were
 for the fii'st time completely examined. The interest which these reports excited
 in this great centre of the linen industry, has encouraged him to offer some

 account of the history and chemical composition of another textile material,

 which at the time of om* former Meeting was scarcely known in this country, but
 which has lately assumed a most important place among the vegetable substances
 employed by manufacturers. Fifty years ago the fibre of the jute-plant was to be
found only in om- museums, now the quantity of it introduced into the United
 Kingdom almost equals that of the flax which we import, and exceeds the annual
importation of hemp ; and owing to the improvements which have been effected in

 the processes for its preparation, and especially in the methods of bleaching, it is,

the author believes, destined to occupy in futm'e a far more important place among
the raw material of om- textile manufactm'es. The plant which yields the fibre
Imown in commerce as jute (a name which is supposed to be derived from a coiTup-
tion of the Bengali name of the plant) is a member of the family Tiliacese, the
Linden^ or Lime-ti-ee family, which from remote periods has been cultivated by
the natives of Southern Asia for textile purposes. Two species of it are used for
the production of fibre, Corchorus capsularis and Coi-chorus olitoritis, and both
kinds are found in the jute brought to this country. The Corchorus is an annual,
the seeds of which are solvit broad-cast in the months of Mai-ch and April on

"ploughed land along the sandy banks of rivers, usually neither irrigation nor

luaniu-e being required. In August, before the seeds which replace the small
yellow flowers of the plant have ripened, and when the stems have attained the
height of about 12 feet, the crop is cut : when the seed is allowed to become fully
ripe, as is also the case with flax, the fibre becomes stifl" and hard, and the stem is
"rendered of a reddish coloiu-. The stalks when cut are tied iu bundles and placed
in tanks, usually of dirty water, and allowed to ferment, or " ret," for five or six
days, and then taken out and swimg about repeatedly in the air, by which the long
fibres are separated from the brittle wood which constituted the bark of the stem
and thus prepared, the fibres are di-ied by exposure on the groimd to the air, and,
when diT, packed in round bimdles for the mai-ket. The treatment of the plant

for the separation of the fibre is therefore precisely like the ordinary methods
used by farmers in this country in the preparation of the flax-fibre. The produce

of jute far exceeds that of flax, being, it is stated, five times as great as that which
flax afibrds. Though India is t lie great seat of jute cultivation and supplies the

fibre used in this country, yet the jute-plants, especially Corchorus olitorius,ha,\e

been long cultivated in China and other eastern counti-les. Experiments have been
made to grow the plants for textile purposes in the Southern States of America,
on the banks of the Lower Mississippi, a╗d also in Algiers, and it is said the re-

sults ai-e encom-aging,

    For some time after the introduction of jut,e, the opinion prevailed that it could
not be bleached, and was therefore of little value as a textile material. Experi-
ments made at several times proved that this was a mistake ; but imtil latelv
scai'cely any progress had been made in improving the qualities of the fibre, or
giving it the whiteness of liueu fabrics. The difficulties, however, which retarcled

64 REPORT--1874.

the success ofjute-bleacliing have, diu-ing the pi-esent year, been completely removed,
by the application of methods which have been invented by the son of the author,
and which are at present in operation. In the processes employed, the cloth or yarn,

by means of ingeniously^ arranged machinery, is made to pass in succession through

baths of alkaline solutions and hypochlorites of magnesia and soda, the magnesia

used being economically obtained from Irieserite, which is foimd in large quantities
in Germany in the kainite deposits, and has hitherto been regarded as of but little
commercial value.

   The length of the fibre of the jute of commerce is frequently no less than 12 feet
usually the lower end near the ground is dark-coloured and woody. At first the

fibre is colom-less, or only slightly coloiu-ed ; but some kinds after a time become

darker, just as wood darkens in coloxu* by the action of the air. Many specimens

preserve a dull yellowish colom-, and in appearance can with difiiculty be distin-
guished from the finer qualities of hemp. The microscope, however, shows us that

the structure of the jute is different from that of any of om- common textile fibres
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

thus, while a fibre stripped from the flax-plant is shown to consist of bimdles of
cells with thick walls and somewhat circular outline, and exhibiting a very luiuute

central space, the wall of the jute-cell is of very irregular thickness, and the cen-

tral space does not conform to the external outline, but at one part will be found

wide, while at another part it dwindles to a mere line. By this remarkable differ-

ence in the contour of the inner and outer cell-walls, jute-fibre is distinguished
from flax, hemp, cotton, and New-Zealand flax. The application of the sulphate of

aniline proposed as a reagent for woody matter by Rimge, and recommended by

Professor Wiesner, of Vienna, also affords us assistance in distinguishing it from

both hemp- and flax-fibres. Thus, while hemp is scarcely at all affected by this

action of the reagent, and flax imchanged in colour, the jute-fibre shows that it
contains a large amount of woody matter by becoming of a deep golden-yellow
coloiu'. The sulphate, however, does not enable us to distinguish jute from several
other Indian fibres.

    In connexion with the technical preparation, bleaching, &c. of the jute-fibre,
the author lately commenced a series of investigations which, though not so far

advanced as he had hoped, may not be destitute of interest. The samples of fibre
submitted to examination were of the kind known as " Red Seraigimge." The

fibre had a faint red colom-, and measured in length 10 feet 9 inches. It had been
prepared in the ordinary manner, and of course contained only those constituents

of the plant whicli remained attached to the cellular structures after being sub-
jected to the process of retting. Portions of the fibre cut into small pieces, afttr
being treated with distilled water and boiled for several hours, gave an acid solu-
tion of the colour of pale ale, which evolved an odour which suggested the aromatic

smell of moist flax-yarn. On evaporation over the water-bath, it left a brownish-
black extract, which in appearance resembled black-currant jelly ; it was translu-
cent at the edges, and was easily reduced to a light brown powder. This extract
amounted to only 0-720 per cent, of the fibre, and was found to contain sugar and

a tannic acid which gave an olive-green precipitate with persalts of iron, a fatty
substance, and a brown-red colom-ing-matter. The extract was in part soluble in
alcohol, and heated on platinum it carbonized without melting, leaving a white
ash. It contained no starch. The fibre employed, dried at 212░, was foimd to con-
tain 15-5 per cent, of moisture, and Avhen incinerated to leave 1-329 per cent, of
ash of a pale yellowish-white colour, treated by the successive action of solvents,
according to the methods described in the author's reports on flax*, and the amount
of nitrogen deterinined by Wills's method, both in the original samples and in the
fibre after the action of the solvents. The results obtained were as follows :

   The author had hoped to be able to give an analysis of the jute-plant in the
condition in which it is removed from the field ; but unfortunately a specimen
which had been forwarded from Calcutta arrived only a few days ago, and he must
therefore defer its investigation until some other opportvmity. With respect to
the magnitude of the jute manufacture, the author stated that in the present j-ear
one hundred thousand tons of the fibre were imported into Dundee alone, by direct
shipment from Calcutta, while London, Liverpool, and Glasgow received probably
half as much more. The rapidity with which, by means of improved machinery,
it can be manufactured, may be judged from the fact, tliat since the openino- of
the Suez Canal the fibre has been delivered in Dundee, spun and woven, and the
goods shipped back and paid for, within six months from the date of the bill of
lading. At the present time jute is used for the manufacture of a great vai-iety of

fabrics. In fact it will serve for the production of every kind of coarse textile

material. It is even used as a substitute for hair, and can be formed into admirable
chignons. The dust from the mills is employed to make silk hats, and the waste

fibre yields an excellent pulp for the manufacture of paper. Stair-carpets of jute,

with bright colom-s, can be sold at three pence per yard ; and woven into what are
known as carpet bed-covers, a fabric is produced at not more than one third the

price of wool.

On an Improved Vacuum Filter-pump*. By W. Jesse Lovett.

  The advantages claimed for this pump are its practical efliciency and portability,

and also its non-liability to get out of order.

It consists of a metallic cone provided with a convex metallic cover ; to the apex

of the cone is fitted a tube for carrving away waste water ; and in the middle of

the convex cover is fixed a tube which goes down nearly to the apex of the cone;

and at this end is fixed a jet formed by soldering a sijuare pyramid of brass in the

end ; the pjTamid has a hole through its centre which points straight down the

exit-tube. The square pyramid being fixed in a round tube leaves four orifices for

the -water to pass through, thus forming a rude rose-jet; and the centre hole serves

as a jet to drive the air caught by these four orifices'straight down the waste-pipe.

The upper tube being connected with a good force of water, the rose exhausts air

from the cone and drives it down the waste-pipe. One of Professor Thorpe's

admirable valves is fitted to the convex cover, and a tube connected with this ia

fixed to the filter as required.

--The average results obtained with this as a filter-pump are :
The time of filtration is reduced to about one sixth on the avera"-e.

The pump supports, as a rule, 15 or 16 inches of mercury ; this of course varies

with the fall of  water obtainable                                                         with a good fall of water residts as high  as  20

inches hav^ been attained.

  The apparatus may be used as an aspirator for drawing a current of air throuo-h
the apparatus. It may also be used as a water-blowpipe, by attaching the waste-

pipe to one of the holes of a three-bored cork; into the other holes are fixed a tube

going to the blowpipe and a tube with adjustable orifice for carrving away waste
water. The extreme length of the pump described is Cii inches.

On a S'esquisul'phide of Iron. By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F. C.S.

   This is a substance of a beautiful dark emerald-gi-eeu colour, having the compo-
sition Fe^ CP, -w^hich is produced when ferric chloride is added to a solution of
ammonia sulphide containing a considerable amoimt of hypochlorite of soda, or

whenever a persalt of ii'on containing free chlorine or a hypochlorite is precipi-

tated by sulphide of ammonium.

It forms a dark green iiocculent precipitate, appearing quite black when collected

and washed. Its fine green colom- becomes apparent when, after di'ying, it is

ground up with a perfectly white powder siich as chalk.

Its properties are rather remarkable. It is soluble to a notable extent in water

containing ammonia, and separates therefrom as   the  ammonia escapes                                                                      it  is even

soluble in alcoholic ammonia, forming in each case a bright emerald-green solution.

It is only slightly soluble in a mixtm-e of sulphide and hypochlorite rather diluted ;
neither is it more than slightly soluble in either of these alone. It is more easily

dissolved in hot water containing free ammonia.

In hydrochloric acid it dissolves with great efi'ervescence, immediately producing

perchloride of iron, Fe^ CP, in spite of the abundance of sulphm-etted hydrogen

present.

   On analysis it is proved to be a hydrated sesquisulphide of iron, answering very

nearly to the formula 2Fe^S'-t-3HO.

      On the Presence of Cyanogen in Commercial Bromine, and a means of

                    detecting it. By Dr. T. L. Phipson, F.CS.

   The author has lately discovered a notable amount of cyanogen in samples of
bromine supposed to be pm-e and issued as such for pharmaceutical purposes. It
has been long known that during the manufacture of iodine a certain quantity of
that beautiful but dangerous compound iodide of cyanogen sometimes finds its way
into one of the glass condensers ; and from the fact just alluded to it would appeal*
that a similar compound with bromine may occasionally be produced during the

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   _

luanufactiu-e of this liquid element ; this is a more serious case than the other, since
the impm-ity is dissolved and hidden in the liquid.

   The presence of cyanogen in bromine may be detected by taking an equal weight
of iron filings to that of the bromine to be examined, adding to them four or five

times their weiglit of water and mixing in the bromine gradually, stirring all the

time. The liquid must be filtered while warm from the reaction, and the filtrate

allowed to stand in a partially closed bottle ; in the com-se of about twenty-four

hom-s a precipitate of ferricyanide of iron (Berlin blue) will have formed, and may

be collected on a filter.
   If 'perfectly pure bromine were used this reaction would also enable us to detect

cyanogen in steel, and to decide whether or no it is ever present in that metal.

Address by Professor Edward Hull, M.A., F.B.S., F.G.S., President of the

                                                                     Section.

Following the example of several Presidents of the Geological Section of the
British Association, I purpose commencing oui- proceedings by an address, selecting

for my subject the volcanic phenomena of the district in which we are assembled.
But before entering upon this subject, I am sure it will be equally in accordance
with yovu- feelings and my own if I give expression to the general and deep regret

which is felt at the death (so little expected) of the late President of this Section,
Professor John Phillips, of Oxford; on the 24th of April last, in the 74th year of

his age.

  --Tlie late Professor Phillips. As the nephew and pupil of Mr. William Smith,

" the* Father of English Geology," Professor Phillips was nui-tm-ed in an atmo-

sphere of geological science which accorded well with his own tastes ; and in his
youth was the companion and assistant of his uncle in many a sui-veying-toar in

the east and north of England. His subsequent appointment as Keeper of the

Museum at York, and one of the Secretaries of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society,

--gave him opportunities and scope for pursuing his inquiries ultimately resulting

in the publication of his laborious work on ' The Geology of Yorkshire,' a work
not only abounding in local details, but containing the germs of several generali-
zations on questions relating to physical geology.

   Of his connexion with the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Professor
Phillips has left two enduring monuments in his work on ' The Palteozoic Fossils

--of Cornwall, Devon, and "West Somerset,' and that on ' The Malvern Hills and

surrounding districts ' * one dealing with the organic structures, and the other
more especially with the physical conditions of the south and west of England.

   To his future career as Professor of Geology in the University of Dublin, after-

wards, on the death of Dr. Buckland, in the University of Oxford, or as President
of the Geological Society of London in 1859 and of the British Association at Bir-

mingham in 1865, it is unnecessary for me in this brief notice to do more than allude.
Through these years and down to the time of his decease his fertile brain and

ready pen were ever at work. But the scope of his investigations was not limited

to purely geological subjects ; he was a man of many parts, and astronomical

 questions largely engaged his attention in his later years. In 1868 he visited
Italy and Vesuvius, and subsequently published a little work on the history and
structure of that mountain in a form very acceptable to that large portion of the

travelling Biitisli public which at one time or another makes the delightful pilgri-

mage to the workshop of Vulcan and the Phlegrrean Fields.

The loss of Professor Phillips's presence at the meetings of the British Associa-

tion, of which he was one of the founders, is irreparable. His genial face and

lucid words brought sunshine wherever he appeared, and threw light on every

--topic he handled; to him might well be applied the words- "quidquid tetigit

ornavit." While lamenting his loss, let us endeavour to imitate the example of

his untiring industry, his patient pursuit of the beautiful and noble in Nature, his

honesty of character, his purity of life *.  -

  --The Yolcamc District of the NortJi-east of Ireland. I have now to direct your

attention to the district of County Antrim and its neighbourhood as one claiming
our special investigation, and presenting a multitude of interesting problems con-

nected with the volcanic phenomena of the Tertiary period. By the labours of

Bcrger, Weaver, Portlock, Griffith, Brj-ce, Tate, Ilolden, and other geologists

manv of these problems have received a solution ; others remain for further dis-

cussion. It shall be my endeavour to give you a brief summary of the facts and

inferences arrived at up to this time, and to present you with a connected history
of the operations carried on by terrestrial agents in this island, from the com-
mencement of the volcanic era to its close.

   This era, though short as compared with the sum of geologic time, was in

reality vastly extended, and comprised within its limits several stages or divisions

characterized by special phj'sical conditions. Speaking in geological terms, it pro-
bably included the latter part of the Eocene and the whole of the Miocene periods,
interrupted by long pauses in the outburst of volcanic products.

   But before entering upon the narrative of events which occupied this space of
time, let us first endeavour to determine the physical limits of the theatre of these
operations ; for it may well be asked, considering the great extent to which the
volcanic products have been cleared from off the surface of the country by denu-
dation, with Avhat degree of precision can we define the original limits of the

volcanic area ?

   Let us for a moment, when replying to this question, turn to a still more recent

volcanic district for an illustration. When we ascend the cone of Vesuvius, and

from that commanding station sweep with our eyes the surrounding region, we

--find ourselves in the centre of a plain-- the Campagna of Naples formed of the

products of volcanic eruptions, but limited through three quarters of a circle by
calcareous hills of older date, and along the other portion by the sea.

   I believe that similarly, but on a far more extended scale, we can trace out the

original limits of the volcanic district of the north-east of Ireland, and that from

some elevated stations rising from the central plateau of Antrim these limits may

-be almost descried by the uprising of ridges of more ancient rocks in several
directions. Taking our stand on Tardree Hill, or Sleamish, we see to the south-

Avard the granitic and schistose ridge of Slieve Croob, projected against a back-
ground of the mountains of Mourne, culminating in Slieve Donard. Westward
the eye rests on the rugged masses of Slieve Gullion and the Silurian hills of

Newtown Hamilton. Towards the north, after passing the depression of llie
southern shore of Lough Neagh and the valley of the river Blackwater, the

enclosing ridge of old rocks, forming from this distance an apparently unbroken
line, ranges northward into Donegal and the northern shores of Lough Foyle. The

ocean now intervenes ; but a comparison of the physical characters of the Donegal

mountains with those of Islay, Jura, Cantyre, and the Western Highlands lea-\'es

the impression on my mind that the volcanic region of Antrim was limited north-

wards along the line of a submarine ridge, and that there is little reason for sup-
posing that the volcanic rocks of Mull were superficially connected with those of

--this country, on the contrary, the probability seems to be that the old ciystalline

rocks of the Western Highlands were interposed between the two regions.
    Turning to the eastward, the sea overflows an area at one time occupied by

volcanic products, but now only partially so, and we are unable strictly to define

 Magazine,' vol. vii. p. 301 (1870).

tkeir easterly limits; but it is tolerably certain that the sheets of lava did not

reach the shores of Galloway or those of the Isle of Man. Basaltic dykes, how-
ever, as is well known, traverse the north of England and the south of Scotland

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but if referable, as Professor Geikie concludes, to the Miocene period, they cannot
be included in the volcanic region as here described and understood.

   Thus the volcanic plateau of Antrim, like the Campagna of Naples, is washed
on one side by the sea, and its limits become indefinable in consequence ; but to
the south, the west, and to some extent to the north, the limits of the region are
marked out by mountains of considerable elevation. Within this region craters

poured forth lavas or other volcanic products, which extended in great sheets
imtil they were intercepted by the uprising of these natural barriers.

   The floor of the area thus partially circumscribed was formed of various

materials, as the accidents of denudation admitted. Over the central portions it

was chiefly Cretaceous limestone (or Chalk), but to the southward it was New

Ked Sandstone and Lower Silurian, and to the north, Chalk, Lias, Carboniferous,
and Lower Silurian beds in difterent directions. The whole region composed of

rocks thus distributed was probably converted into dry land towards the close of the

--Eocene period ^when, at various points, highly silicated felspathic lavas burst

forth, consolidating into sheets of trachyte porphyry, rhyolite, and more rarely

pitchstone, such as are found at Brown Dod Hill and Tardree, near Antrim, and

west of Hillsborough. These trachytic lavas were therefore the oldest of the

volcanic eruptions of the north of Ireland, and seem to have been represented by
the newer granitoid rocks recently described by Zirkel, Geikie, and Judd in the
Island of Mull on the one hand, and by the trachytes of Mont Dore in Central
France on the other. They have been described in this district by Berger and
Bryce ; but it is only recently that their relations to the other lavas have been
clearly determined ; and as such rocks are exceedingly rare in the British Isles,
I trust the Members of the Association will take this opportunity of paying a visit
to the quarries near Antrim, where they are fully opened to view. In composition,
both at Hillsborough and at Antrim, they present a felspathic base, enclosing

crystals of sanidine (or glassy felspar) and grains of quartz. At Brown Dod Hill

they are disposed in sheets, showing lines of viscous flow and dipping beneath the

overlying beds of basalt.

   As I have already stated, the outpouring of these trachytic lavas may, with
every probability, be referred back to the later Eocene period. At any rate, a

considerable interval probably elapsed before the eruption of the next series of

lavas of Miocene age, which are essentially augitic, and may be comprehended

under the heads of basalt and dolerite with their amj'gdaloidal varieties. Sheets
of these lavas were formed, from various vents, over the uneven surface of the
older rocks, and to a far greater extent, both as to area and thickness, than in the
case of the preceding eruptions of trachyte *. These beds, which are often vesi-
cular, attain in some places a thickness of 600 feet, and are surmounted by decom-
posed lava and volcanic ashes, which mark the close of the second period of

eruption.

   1 he sheets of augitic lava which were poured forth during this stage are remark-
able for their vesicular character and the numerous thin bands of red ochre
(bole or laterite) which separate the diflerent lava-flows, and which have been
recognized by Sir C. Lyell as probably ancient soils formed by the decomposition

of the beds of lava, similar to those in Madeira and the Canary Islands, resulting
from streams of subaerial origin. Microscopic examination bears out this view"]
for a thin slice of one of the more compact beds of bole from the north coast
showed that the felspar-prisms retained their form, while the augite and maofnetite
ingredients had passed into the state of an oclneous paste.

   The vesicular and amygdaloidal character of these older beds of lava shows the
probability that they have been poured forth under no greater pressure than that
of the atmosphere, and together with the evidence derived from the bands of ochre
leads to the conclusion that they have been erupted over land-surfaces. Some of

    * In this respect they resemble the corresponding rocks in Central France, where as
Mr. Scropo has shown, the trachytes have a more restricted range than the basalts
(' Volciinoes of Central France').

the vents of eruption are now visible, either in the form of amorphous masses of

trap protruded through the sheets, or of great funnels filled by bombs, Ijrokeu

pieces of rock, and ashes, such as the rock on vfhich is perched the venerable ruin

of Dunluce Castle (the ancient stronghold of the MacDonnells), or the neck erupted
through the Chalk in the coast-cliffs near Portrush *. One of these old funnels

was found b)' the late Mr. Du Noyer near this place : it forms a portion of the

crest of the ridge overlooking Belfast Lough, to the east of Cave Hill, and is
within easy reach of Members of the Association.

   The period of the formation of the older sheets appears to have been brought to

a close by the discharge of volcanic ashes and the formation of an extensive lake,

or series of lakes, over the region extending at least from the shores of Belfast
Lough to the northern coast of Antrim, in which the remarkable beds of pisolitic
iron-ore were ultimately deposited. This is the only mode of origin of these ores

which seems to me at all probable ; and I am consequently unable to accept the

views advanced by Messrs. Tate and Holden regarding their origin from basaltic
lava by a process of metamorphism. That water was present, and that the beds of
ash which underlie the pisolitic ore were stratified, at least in some instances, is
abundantly evident upon an examination of the sections at Ballypalidy, Ballymeua,
and the northern coast. In some places they are seen to be perfectly laminated in
a manner that could only take place by the agency of waterf- It would seem,
therefore, that by the combination of slight terrestrial movements a shallow basin
was formed over the area indicated, which received the streams charged with iron in

solution, draining the upland margins, from the waters of which were precipitated
the iron, possiblj' by the agency of confervoid algiie, as in the case of the Swedish
lakes of the present day (a view maintained by Mr. D. Forbes, F.R.S.), or by the
escape of carbonic acid, owing to which the iron became oxidized and was pre-

cipitated.

   Upon these uplands grew the plants whose remains occur amongst the ash-beds

of Ballypalidy, the Causeway, and elsewhere, and which have enabled Mr. Baily

to refer the strata in which they occur to the Miocene period J. In some places
the vegetation crept over the surface of the former lake-bottom as it became

shallower or was drying up, and gave rise to beds of lignite similar to those
described by the Duke of Argyll as occurring at intervals amongst the basalts of
MullД. The beds of ore, wherever they are found, belong to one and the same

geological horizon, and enable us to separate the basaltic series into two great

--divisions one below, and the other above the position of the pisolitic ore ; and

which, on maps of tlie Geological Survey, will for the future be i-epresented

by two different shades of colouring.

The ore itself is now laid open in numerous adits driven into the hill-sides, or in

open works at Island Magee, Sliane's Hill, Broughshane, Red Bay, Portfad, and

other places whence it is transported to the furnaces of Scotland, Cumber-
II,
Aland, Lancashire, and Wales.
                               new source of industry and wealth is rapidly

springing up over the .already prosperous county of Antrim, and ere many years

are over we may expect to see furnaces established at several points for smelting

the ores at the mines from which they are extracted.

   The period of volcanic inaction just described was brought to a close by fresh
eruptions of augitic lavas, which spread in massive sheets over the beds of ore,

bole, and even lignite, without materially altering their constitution. Thus on the

   t The authors referred to, while admitting the stratified character of the beds at
Ballypalidy and their formation in presence of water, consider that in all other cases the

iron-ore has been formed on a terrestrial surface ; but sections seen at Ballymena and

the north coast have led me to conclude that these beds are all more or less stratified, and

due to aqueous deposition.

north roast a band of lignite is intei-posed between the pisolitie ore below and a
massive bed of columnar basalt above, which can be followed and identified by the
size and regularity of its columns for several square miles over that district. That
this molten rock has not utterly reduced the lignite to ashes, or even entirely
obliterated the impressions of the plant-remains, has been doubtless due to the
rapidity with which a hard crust, of low conducting-power, consolidates on the
outside of a lava-stream, as has been frequently observed on Vesuvius and other

active volcanoes.

   Above this peculiarly massive bed were piled fresh sheets of basalt and dolerite

to a total depth of at least 400 feet, each flow of lava being consolidated in a
somewhat difterent manner from those above and below it, and probably separated
from them by considerable intervals of time, as bands of ochre intervene in most
instances between successive beds indicating subaerial soils of decomposed l.iva.

   The maximum thickness of the basaltic sheets of Antrim has been estimated by

Mr. Duffin and myself at 1100 feet, to which nuist be added perhaps 200 feet for
the subordinate trachytic beds, giving a total of 1300 feet for the whole volcanic

series. This is rather more than originally assigned by Dr. Berger, who places it

at 900 feet*, but it falls far short of the enormous accumulations of Mull, estimated-

by Professor Geikie at fi-om 3000 to 4000 feet ; in neither district, however, have we

the data for determining the original thickness of volcanic ejecta, as in both large

masses of material have been wasted away by denudation, and not a single volcanic
cone or crater remains behind out of all those which, probably in numbers corre-

fsponding to those of Central France, were planted over the entire volcanic region.
    The basaltic dykes, which traverse not only the geological formations subordinate

 to the bedded traps, but also the latter themselves, are, in some districts, both

remarkable and exceedingly numerous. To the south of Belfast Lough we find at

Scrabo Hill an outlying mass of bedded dolerite resting on New Red Sandstone,

and far beyond the" limits of the main masses which rise in a fine escarpment to
 the north of the Lough. There is every probability that Scrabo Hill is the site of
 a distinct focus of eruption ; but it is also remarkable for the dykes of trap, as well
 as intrusive sheets, which have been squeezed in between the beds of sandstone
 themselves. Admirable and instructive sections are laid open in the freestone-
 quarries of this hill, which will amply repay a visit. Another district remarkable
 for such intrusions is that of Ballycastle, where dykes and sheets are seen traversing
 the Carboniferous rocks, as described by Sir R. Grifiith in his admirable Report on
 the geology of that coal-field t ; while the well-known Giants' Causeway is itself
 a tessellated pavement of colunmar basalt, ti-aversing in the form of a dyke the

 horizontal sheets of older formation.

    The intrusion of the thousands of dykes of the north-east of Ireland is unaccom-
 panied by crumplings or contortions of the strata ; and if it were possible to place
 the dykes side by side, their aggi-egate breadth would cover a space several
 thousand feet in breadth. How, then, has this additional space amongst strata of
 given horizontal dimensions been obtained ? Has it been by lateral tension out-
 wards owing to inflation by means of elastic gases or vapours, or by a general
 bulging of the surface consequent on lateral pressure ? The former view, I am
 told by physicists, is untenable ; the latter is one which will probably prove more

 consonant with modem views of terrestrial dynamics.

    The results of the microscopic examination of a considerable number of speci-
 mens of augitic lavas from various parts of the volcanic district are of a generally
 imiform character. AVhether we take specimens from the largely crystalline gi-a-

 nular dolerites of Portrush or Fair Head, or the very dense micro-crystalline
 basalts of Shane's Castle, the structure and composition is found to be nearly

 uniform.

    The lava is, with very few exceptions, an amorphous or subcrystalliue paste of

 auo'ite, enclosing long prisms or plates of labradorite fel^ar, cr3'stalline grains of
 titano-ferrite, and often of olivine. Chlorite is also sometimes present as a
 " secondary " mineral. It will be observed that tliis diagnosis differs essentially

from that assigned by Dr. Zirkel as the normal structure of basalt, in which the
base is "a glass," and the other minerals (the augite, felspar, aud olivine) are
individually crystallized out*. This, indeea, is the case with the Carboniferous
melaphyres of the south of Ireland t, and probably with all the rocks in which
augite is deficient; but the basalts of Antrim contain augite so largely in excess
of the felspar that it has, in nearly every case, formed the base of the rock J.

   The basalt itself is often so rich in iron as to become an impure iron-ore. This
is owing to the presence of the metal in the form of minute grains of titaniferous
iron-ore, which is the principal cause of the black appearance of the rock, and also
as one of the components of the augite.

   From the above general review of the volcanic history of Tertiary times in the

north of Ireland it will be evident that it presents us with three distinct periods,
similar to those which Mr. Judd has recognized in the succession of events in the
Island of Mull :

    The earliest, possibly extending as far back as the later Eocene period, charac-
terized by the trachytic lavas.

    The middle, referable to the Miocene period, characterized by vesicular augitic
lavas, tuifs, and plant-beds.

    The latest, referable to a still later stage of the Miocene period, characterized by
more solid sheets of basalt and numerous vertical dykes.

   These three stages were probably separated from each other by long intervals of
repose and the cessation of volcanic action. The succeeding Pliocene period seems to
have been characterized by considerable terrestrial movements, resulting in the

production of fractures in the earth's crust, and (as my colleague, Mr. Hardman,

supposes) in the formation of that large depression which was filled with waters
having a greater area than the Lough Neagh of the present day. Some of the faults
which traverse the upper sheets of basalt, and are therefore of later date, have ver-
tical dislocation amounting to 500 or 600 feet, as, for instance, that which runs along
the valley under Shane's Hill near Larue. Such great fractures must necessarily have
been accompanied by denudation, and it is probable that many of the present
phj'sical features had their origin at this (Pliocene) period. The extent to which
the original plateau of volcanic rocks has been broken up and carried away within
such comparatively recent times is vaster than is generally supposed. As there is
evidence that the sheets of lava to the north of Belfast Lough were originally con-
nected with those of Scrabo Hill to the soutli, we must suppose tliat this arm of
the sea and the valley of the Lagan have been excavated since the Miocene period

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

while on the north-west the high elevation to which the escarpment of the basalt
reaches, leads to the supposition that the basaltic sheets spread over the ground

now occupied by Lough Foyle. Both along the west and along the eastern sea-

bord the sheets of lava are abruptly truncated, and must have extended far
bej'ond their present bounds; while many deep valleys, such as those of Glenarm,

Cushendall, and Red Bay, have been excavated.
   But the most remarkable result of the denudation, as bearing upon the subject

before us, is the complete obliteration of the volcanic cones which we may well
suppose studded the plateau. Some of these cones, at least, were contemporaneous
with those now standing upon the granitic plateau of Central France, and whicli

are but little altered in elevation since the fires whicli once burst forth from them
became extinct. But since then the north of Ireland has been subjected to
vicissitudes from which Central France has been exempted. The sm-face of the
country has been overspread by the great ice-sheet of the earliest stage of the
Glacial period, which appears to have stretched across from the Argyleshire High-
lands, if we are to judge by the direction of the glacial strice at Fair HeadД.

must be exceptional ; but tlie rule as stated above certainly holds good.

   At a later stage the country was submerged beneath the waters of the Inter-
glacial sea, which deposited the sands and gravels which overlie the Lower
Boulder-clay ; and subsequent emergences during the stage of the Upper Boulder-
clay, together with atmospheric agencies constantly at work whenever land has
been exposed, have moulded the surface into the form we now behold.

   It will thus be seen thilt the physical geologist, whether a Vulcanist or a
Neptunist, has in this region abundant materials on which to concentrate his

attention.

--Volcanic Energy. In connexion with this subject, it may not unnaturally be

expected that I should make some allusion to the \'iew3 of Mr. Robert Mallet on

" Volcanic Energy," which he has recently unfolded in the ' Philosophical Trans-

Myactions of the Royal Society '*.  limits, however, forbid more than a cursory

glance at this subject. Stated in a few words, volcanic energy, according to Mr.

Mallet, has its origin primarily in the contraction of the earth's crust, due to secular

cooling and the tendency of the interior molten matter to fall inwards and thus

leave the exterior solid shell unsupported. The lateral pressure arising therefrom

(which, as ]Mi\ Mallet shows, is vastly greater than the vertical weight of the crust)

is expended in crushing portions of the solid crust together, along lines of fracture

which are supposed to correspond to those of the volcanic cones which are distri-

buted over the earth's surface. Each successive crush produces an earthquake-
shock, and is converted into heat sufficient to melt the rocks which line the walls

of the fissure or lie beneath at high temperatures, and which, in presence of elastic

steam and gases, are erupted at intervals both of time and place.

 --In the words of the author of these views : " The secular cooling of the globe

is always going on, though in a very slowly descending ratio. Contraction is

therefore constantly providing a store of energy to be expended in crushing parts
of the crust, and through that providing for the volcanic heat. But the crushing

itself does not take place with uniformity ; it necessarily acts per saltum after
accumidated pressure has reached the necessary amount at a given point, where

some of the unequally pressed mass gives way, and is succeeded perhaps by a
time of repose or by the transfer of the crushing action elsewhere to some weaker

point."

  It cannot be denied that Mr. Mallet's theory seems to be consistent with many

observed facts connected with volcanic action. It has for its foundation an incon-
testable physical hypothesis, the secular cooling of the earth, and it seems to throw

--considerable light upon several observed phenomena of volcanic action such as the

distribution of cones and craters along gi-eat lines, the intermittent character of
eruptions, and the connexion of earthquake-shocks with volcanic outbursts. There
are some statements in Mr. Mallet's paper which few physical geologists will be

inclined to accept, such as the non-existence of true volcanoes before the Secon-

dary or Mesozoic period. The Silurian volcanic districts of North Wales and of
the west of Ireland, and the Carboniferous volcanic districts of Limerick and

Scotland, bear witness against the soundness of such a view. This statement,
however, does not necessarily invalidate the general views of the author ; and t

cannot but think that the publication of Mr. Mallet's paper has enabled us to take

a very long sti'ide in the direction of a true theory of volcanic energy.

On some new Localities for Upper Boulder-clay in Ireland. By Edward T.
       Hard MAN, F.G.S., F.B.G.S.L, of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

   In Mr. James Geikie's valuable work on the ' Great Ice-Age,' as well as in a
former memoir by him on "Changes of Climate during the Glacial Epoch"*, the
presence of an Upper Boulder-clay in this country is hardly admitted, save in the
north-eastern portion, where it is (somewhat doubtfully) allowed to exist. The
author now proposed to mention some new localities where he had observed it.

   In various parts of the counties Armagh, Derry, and Tyrone the three divisions
of the drift are met with, viz. 1. Upper Boulder-clay; 2. Stratified Sand and Gravel
(Middle Sands); 3. Lower Boulder-clay f ; but the Upper Boulder-clay can rarely
be identified with certainty, except when it rests on the summits of very high drift
hills, or where sufficiently deep cuttings are found to expose the underlying sands.
In the neighbourhood of Dungannon, the drift being extremely hilly, the whole
three members can be found in places ; and a section was exhibited and explained,
showing the Upper Boulder-clay resting on the Middle Sands, at Castle Hill,
Dungannon, Killymeal Quarry, and Gortmerron. The Upper Boulder-clay was
also observed in the Ulster Railway-cuttings at Coolhill and Coolcush, at Windmill
HUl, south, and Mullaghdun, north of Dimgannon, in the vicinity of Stewartstown,
and in the co. Derry in the low gi-ound to the north of Slieve Gallion.

   In the more central parts of Ireland, especially in the Queen's County, Carlow,
and Kilkenny, the drift also admits of a tripartite arrangement, and in general

character closely resembles that of the north ; but the whole is often loosely

described as "limestone gravel"*. In many places the Upper Boulder-clay is

found reposing on a gi-eatly denuded surface of stratified and sometimes cm-rent-
bedded sand and gi-avels, or even on the Lower Boulder-clay, as at Coonbe^,
Queen's County, south-west of Athy. In the same sti-eam (the river Douglas),

one mile to the west, the whole three members ai-e foimd superimposed.
   At various places near the town of Carlow, as at the railway bridge and at

Erindale House, the Upper Boulder-clay is found resting on denuded and current-

bedded gi-avels.

   At Archersgrove, near Kilkenny, thick Boulder-clay rests on coarse gravels,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    _

while a mile to the south the Upper Boulder-clay lies directly on tlie limestone

rock t.
   Besides the places named, a great part of these counties is covered with a very

pecuUar Boulder-clay which is inferred to be the upper, although the base is rarely

seen. It consists of a confused mass of round water-worn pebbles or paving-stones,
chiefly limestone, from 30-40 per cent., in some cases being well and deeply

scratched vn the rounded surface. These' ai-e huddled together in an unstratijied
matrix of sandy clay. It cannot be a Lower Boulder-clay, for the pebbles are
rounded by water action. It could not be relegated to the Middle Sand or Esker
Series, for the pebbles are well scratched. It can therefore only be Upper Boulder-

clay. Where Upper Boulder-clay is found restino- on the gravels, it contains at the

base quantities of these rounded and scratched pebbles.

AU these characteristics agree perfectly with its being an Upper Boulder-clay.
The glaciers which gave rise to the upper clays must have passed in many places

over the already rounded and stratified gravels with which this part of the country

was covered, and would of course remove a great deal of them. This detritus

becoming mingled together with clay and pieces of unrounded rock from places

uncovered by di-ift, would result in a confused mass of pebbles, clay, sand, and

boulders, and would naturallv contain more pebbles than boulders. This is exactly
Athe kind of stuft'that is i-isible all around Carlow and Kilkenny.
                                                                     tine section is

seen in it in the raUway-cuttings for more than three miles on each side of the

latter citv J.

   It would be difficult to explain these pebbly Boulder-clays on any other
hypothesis than the above, even were they never found lying actually on the

middle gi'avels, as they do in some places.

    On the Geological Structure of the Tyrone Coal-fields. By Edwaed T.
       Hakdman, F.C.8., F.R.G.S.I., ofthe Geological Survey of Ireland.

   The Carboniferous rocks of this district appear to resemble somewhat those of the
northern counties of England. The coal-bearing beds are true Coal-measures, but
the underlying limestone is split up by numerous sedimentary beds, the calcareous
members becoming more scarce towards the north, until finally the whole becomes
similar to the Lower Carboniferous rocks of Scotland, to which horizon Professor
Hull has referred the Coal-measures of Ballycastle, co. Antrim. They are partially
covered by newer formations, Permian, Trias, Chalk, &c., to which, as well as the
existence of some large boimdary faults, is due the preservation of the two small

patches of Coal-measures which form these coal-fields.

  --The succession of rocks in the neighbourhood of Coalisland and Dungannon is

as follows:

   The author having explained his reasons for adopting the above classification
and thicknesses, went on to describe the coal-fields in detail, commencing with the
Dungannon coal-field, which extends from near Dungannon to beyond Coal-

island ; and which, though of small area, is extraordinarily rich in coal-seams, for
it contains from 22-24 coal-beds, at least 13 of which are workable, while 17,
containing about 42 feet of workable coal, lie in 300 yards of strata. They are all
highly bituminous coals, and two of them contain valuable bands of cannel. In a
series of analyses of these coals the author found the amount of volatile matter
ranged from 37'5 to 47 '8 per cent., so that all are highly adapted for gas manu-

facture. With all this, firedamp is almost unknown.

   In the upper measures there are important deposits of fire-clay, which are
extensively used in brick- and tile-works. The ironstones are not sufliciently
abimdant perhaps to work ; but the author found the amount of metallic iron in

six specimens to range from 21-rO to 35'50 per cent. As to the resources, he
considered that there must be from 30-40 millions of tons of coal yet untouched,

only counting the coals of a yard thick and upwards, and including the smaller

coals 9 millions more.

   This coal-field is bounded on the north-west by a large fault, which brings down
the Coal-measures on the south against the Calp and Lower Limestone. It must
therefore have a downthrow of more than 2000 feet.

    North of it the limestone is foimd covered with triassic strata, without any
intervening Coal-measures for 3^ mOes, when a small trough of the Middle Coal-
measures containing the four upper Coalisland coals is found, inlaid by means of
several faults on the north, south, and west, amongst the other rocks. This coal-
field* is but 2^ miles long by \ mile wide, yet must contain the whole series of
Middle and Lower Coal-measures, MUlstone-grit, and Yoredale beds. However, the
upper beds are nearly worked out ; and supposing all the others to exist, the supply

can hardly be more than about 800,000 tons. The coal-field may still stretch away

to the eastward under the newer strata.

   A little to the north of this coal-field a little patch of Permian Limestone is found

resting immediately on the Carboniferous Limestone.

   The author proceeded to explain when and how the two coal-fields became
isolated from each other, and why in the immediate vicinity of these thick Coal-
measures the Permian or Trias are found reposing directly on the Limestone. At

 the close of the Carboniferous period those rocks were forced into a series of
 flexures or folds ranging east and west, owing to the influence of forces acting from

the northward, as Professor Hull has already shown occurred iu England during
that time*, and it is interesting to find the results of the same forces traceable here.

Denudation following, resulted in a set of plains or edges of limestone, and troughs
or basins of Coal-measures, all of which were overlapped by the deposition of
Permian or Triassic beds. (A part of the country between the two coal-fields

represents one of these limestone plains.) On subsequent denudation, and post-

tnassic faults occurring, some portions of the Coal-measures would be laid bare or
saved beneath the newer formation, while in other places close by there would be
an overlap of the newer rock on limestone, apparently as if the whole effect,

faulting and all, on the Carboniferous rocks had been produced before the Triassic
period. As the whole district is cut up by faults and rock exposures are few, the

evidence of those flexures is now obscure; yet on the whole there is enough to
justiiy this assumption, and in this way only can the phenomena observed be

accounted for.

   In conclusion the author referred to the addition made to the palseontological

knowledge of these coal-fields since the Government Survey of them was under-

taken, he and his colleague, Mr. W. H. Baily, F.G.S., F.L.S.", with Mr. E. Leeson,

having obtained many shells, bivalves, Goniatites, &c., together with plants and

fish-remains, the discovery of the last being due to Mr. W. Molyneux, F.G.S., of
Burtou-on-Trent, who first pointed them out to the aulhor.

 On the Age and Mode of Formation of Lough Nemjh, L-eland. By Edward

     T. Hardman, F.C.S., F.E.G.S.I., of the Geological Survey of Ireland.

   After describing the position of Lough Neagh, one of the largest lakes in

Europe, the author referred to the fact that its general direction agreed very
fairly with that of the principal ice-flow which had glaciated the district, and

might therefore be supposed to indicate a glacial origin. The object of the paper
was to show that this is not so, but that the lake was formed long before the

Glacial period.

   The geology of the district was briefly described. On three sides of the lake Mes

the basalt, rising as it recedes into considerable altitudes; on the east and novth-

east Black Mountain, Divis, Slemish, and Slieve-na-nee (1782 ft.) ; on the north

the ground is comparatively low ; on the north-west and west, Keady, Donald's Hill,

CamCarntogher (1572 ft.), Craigs-na-shoke (1996ft.), and Slieve Gallion  (1625 ft.).

On the south of the lake, forming very low ground, overlying the basalt and extending

some miles inland, is a thick deposit of plastic clays and sands, with lignite and

clay-ironstone.

   The basaltic ground terminates on the east and west in high escarpments, from
underneath which emerge the mesozoic strata, viz. Chalk, Greensand, I^ias, and Trias
(Keuper and Bunter), all of which can be traced on the east from Carrickfergus
and Belfast, along the valley of the Lagan to Portadowu, round by the south of
the clay deposit, and continuing on the west by Stewartstown, Moneymore, and
Magherafelt. Underlying these, following the same line, further back, are the
various members of the Paljeozoic strata, Permian, Carboniferous, and Silurian,
with, ou the west, the metamorphic rocks and red granite of Slieve Galliou.

   In this circuit the ground rises more or less rapidly as it recedes, but the general
dip of the strata, especially the newer, is towards the Lough.

   The principal inflowing rivers are the Upper Baun, Blackwater, Ballinden-y

--river, Moyola, and Mainwater the outgoing one being the Lower Bann, flowing

from the north-west of the Lough, through Lough Beg, and falling into the sea
below Coleraine.

   The most important, as well as most ancient, of these are the Upper Bann and

--Blackwater, draining the country to the south, and passing through what was

formerly the delta of one or other of them the great clay-deposit already men-

tioned.

   These beds have been refeiTed to before by previous writers, Sir Richard Griffith,
Portlock, and others, but have not been definitely placed with regard to the
basalt and drift. They lie under a deposit of drift often more than 60 feet thick,
are very thick, and extend from Balhnderry river on the west, round by Coal-
island, Roxborough Castle, Portadown, &c., ending at Sandy Bay, co. Antrim, and
reaching a distance of six mUes fi'om the shore at one place. They consist of
stratified gi'ey and blue clays, sand, and sandstone, occasionally with iron-pyrites,

irregular beds of lignite, and hard siliceous clay-ironstones. In these reed-like

plants and well-preserved dicotyledonous leaves are found, and in the clays

fragments of black wood, apparently pine and oak, but as j'et no trace of a fauna.
They dip towards the lake at from 2^-3░, which would give a thickness of 1200
feet at the shore. This must be excessive, yet as they were bored (without being
fully penetrated) to a depth of over 260 feet* (allowing for drift) in Annaghmore,
more than two miles from the shore, the theoretical depth being 260 feet, it is

possible that in some places their thickness may be 600 feet.
   The deepest part was therefore originally at the southern end, whereas it is now

at the northern, and only 105 feet at most. An ice-formed lake would be deepest

near where the ice first entered.

   The various localities where the clays may be seen (in one place resting on the

basalt) having been described, the author noticed the plentiful occurrence of round
pebbles of basalt and chalk flints in them and some beds of lignite; but in no

instance was any of the celebrated silicified wood obtained in situ, notwithstanding
the numerous excavations that have been made for the raising of the clay for
pottery manufacture. Nor does he consider that the celebrated specimens obtained
at Sandy Bay by Barton, and referred to by Scolder, Portlock, and others, were
true silicified wood at all ; for they were black, capable of being cut by a spade, and
only more or less stony, a description that would apply better to pyritous wood.
The sdicified wood is usually found in the drift, not only south, but also north of
the Lough ; and its real loctis may, with most probability, be assumed to be the

basaltic lignite beds.

   The evidence for the order of superposition of the clay-beds was summed up as

--follows : (1) In at least one instance a similar clay has been observed resting on

the basalt. (2) That where the two have been found in juxtaposition, the fonn
of the groimd, not being an escarpment, shows that the soft beds lie uppermost.

(3) That pebbles of basalt are found in them. (4) That while numerous junc-
tions of the chalk and basalt are seen, these clays are never found between them.
(5) The recent aspect of the plant-remains prevents the supposition that the clays
belong to an older period than the Chalk. Ihe only place lelt for them is therefore
between the basalt and the drift, which is seen resting on them.

    Geologists have hitherto diftered very seriously as to the age and position of these
beds. Portlock has classed a portion of them with the Nuctda-cla.js of Derry *,
which belong to the drift; Griffith with the Bovey Tracey bedst; Prof. King above
these J; Jukes has mapped them as Pleistocene, and Mr. G. H. Kiaahan Д suggests
that they are a Preglacial drift : the author proposes to class them as Pliocene, on

the following grounds :

   The basaltic outflow was followed by a period of great disturbances and disloca-
tions, accompanied by very extensive denudations, sufficient to remove in many
places as much as 1000 or 2000 feet of solid strata. Afterwards the Lough Neagh
clays were deposited. Thus we have unconformabUity together with an immense
lapse of time, which alone would justify us in placing the basalt (of acknowledged
Miocene age) and the clays in different systems. Besides, the plant-remains have
an exceedingly recent aspect, and the lignite is often not far removed fi-om peat.

On the whole, the beds bear some resemblance to the Older Pliocene of the Val
d'Amo as described by Lyell (' Student's Elements of Geology,' p. 184). The author

was glad to say that the present classification has met with the sanction of Prof.
Eamsay and Prof. Hull. These clay-beds must occupy an area of not less than 180

square miles.

    Ai-ound the mouth of the Moyola are clay-beds containing erect tree-stumps,

--forming a small delta of Postglacial date.
    Former level of the Lough. The clays being found at a height of 120 feet above
the sea in many places, prove that the waters formerly rose to at least that level,
whereas they are now but 48 feet above sea-level. They were most probably

higher, as much of the ancient mud must have been denuded away since its

deposition ; but if the shore be contoured at even 120 feet, the former area of the

lake must have been nearly double what it is now, or neai-ly SCO square miles.
The author considered the evidence to prove that the lake extended southward
towards Armagh, and but little more to the north than it now does, the deepest

part lying also to the south.

  --Time and Mode of Foi-mation. It is clear, therefore, that the lake was formed at

the close of the Miocene period (the Pliocene clays denoting the time of its
completion), and it is therefore unlikely that ice could have had any thing to do
with it, the slight trace of ice-action elsewhere dxiring that time being most
probably due to a local glacier ; but to produce any thing like the effects here to be

seen, such as the removal of thousands of feet of rock over hundreds of square miles,
would have necessitated a very intense degree of glaciation, and such as must have

left distinct traces behind it. Mr. J. F. Campbell, F.G.S.||, has indeed attributed
the shaping of this district to the ice of the last Glacial epoch. But this opinion is
hardly tenable ; for the lake, and consequently the general physical geography of
the district, was formed previous to that time.

  --The author's theory of the formation of the lake is this : After the basaltic flow

had ceased, subsidences over a large area took place, corresponding with certain
lines of parallel and transverse faults of considerable force, which can be proved to
extend across the ground comprising the plain and bed of Lough Neagh. Their
general effect would be to give to the face of the country a rudely depressed shape,

consisting of a series of steps to the north, north-west, and south, thus determining
the chief flow of water into the hollow centre, and (denudation proceeding pari
passu) gradually shaping out something like a lake-basin. The egress of the water

was provided towards the east, along what is now the valley of the Lagan, which,

no doubt, was commenced somewhere about this period. Eventually the depression

increasing towards the centre of the faults crossing the lake, caused a lateral

upheaval on each side, giving the finishing touch to the basin depression and

causing an inflow from all sides. The outflow may now possibly have begun to
take its way along the great valley of depression which it still occupies. In the
course of time large rivers carried down immense quantities of detritus into the

water-filled hollow, and spread it into a great lake-delta, silting up the gi-eater

part of the lake. Finally, it is possible that some depression of the coimtry to the

north ensued, draiaiag the lake to some extent; for near Belfast a clay-deposit

containing Nucula oblmiga, &c. has been found about 120 feet above the sea, which
is referred to Newer Pliocene age. It is uunecessaiy to trace the history of the

Lough past this point, because the physical geology has remained essentially the

same to the present day.

The basin could not have been of prebasaltic age, because the Chalk is every-

where of nearly uniform thickness, and must have formed a flat surface, probably a
plain of marine denudation, when the basalt was deposited on it, both together being

afterwards upheaved around the edges. Moreover, all the most important faults in

the district being of postbasaltic age (in part at least), the previous features of the

country must have been quite distinct from the appearance they afterwards

presented.

 --Details of the probable mode of Formation of the Lough. The author proceeded to

describe the faults which crossed the Lough, premising that they left little or no

trace, either in the shape of the ground or of the lake margin ; all that he

stipulated for being that they were the means of determining the flow of water

into, and the removal of detritus out of, the centre in the first instance.
   The principal fault is that forming the north-west boundary of the Diingannon

coal-field (where it has a throw of at least 2000 feet) running N.W., no doubt

crossing the lake, and most probably joining the great Templepatrick fault, which
has a downthrow of some hundreds of feet to the same side (the south). It appears

to die out at either extremity.

North of the last, the southern boundary fault of the Annaghone coal-field has

been traced nearly parallel to it, with a downthrow also to south, proved in a trial

for coal to be at least 300 feet, but considered to be much more.
   Further north are two large faults running towards the Lough, by Coagh ; and

these throwing towards each other would form a trough, the direction of which

would coincide with the deep part of the lake.

   Further on towards Slieve (rallion, and in the country around it, are numerous
faults, which have a considerable share in modifying the shape of the country.

   On the east side besides the Templepatrick fault there are several which can be

observed in the high grounds about the valley of the Lagan, and whose general

downthrow is rather towai'ds the Lough.

AAll the above are either partially or entirely in age postbasaltic.  large post-

triassic faidt has been observed near Dungannon, which if continued, and that it
is also postbasaltic, would pass south of the lake and upheave the groimd in the
same direction.

   The effect of all these faults would be, therefore, to cause a great depression of the
ground now occupied by Lough Neagh ; but before the final completion of that
basin, the valley of the Lagan was denuded.

   The author concluded with e^^dence as to the enormous amount of denudation
which took place over the basaltic district during the latter part of the Miocene
period, and suggested that a great part, if not the whole, of Ireland may have also
suffered at the same time, finally summarizing the chief points dwelt on as

follows.

 --Recapitulation. (1) The Lough is of an age intermediate between the Lower

Miocene and the Glacial periods. (2) It is not a true rock-basin, and could not
have been formed by ice-action either of Miocene or subsequent age, but is part of
an area of depression, and is due to the existence of one or more series of faults,
assisted by subaerial denudation. (3) That the extensive deposit of clays and
sands, &c. found on the southern shore and for some miles inland is the delta of a

former large river, which flowed very much in the same course that either the
                               '

TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.  83

Upper Bann or the Blackwater does now. (5) That these clays ai-e of considerably
later date than the basalt, and that the silicified woods may with all probability be
referred to the latter. (6) By the help of these clays we learn that the existing
physical geology, and the main features of the siuTOunding country, are due to a
period newer than the age of the basalt, but more ancient than the gi-eat Glacial

epoch, and that the great denudation which has afiected the north of Ireland at

least belongs to the same time.

Slcetch of the Oeolocjy of the N.E. of Ireland. By Professor Harkness, F.R.S.

On the Progress of the Geological Survey of Ireland. By Prof. Hull, F.R.S.

  In exhibiting the new Index of Geological signs and colours, which had j ust been

prepared for the Geological Survey of Ireland, Professor Hull gave a short sketch
of the origin and progress of the Survey, observing that it had originated in 1832

with that of the late General Portlock and his assistants, who had published the

well-known ' Report on the Geology of Londonderry, Tyrone, and adjoining districts
(1843). Along with this it had been intended to publish exhaustive reports on
the botany, zoology, and mineralogy of the districts ; and Mr. Oldham, afterwards
the Director of the Survey, was appointed to undertake the last-named department.

   Afterwards, however, the project of extending the Survey to other branches of
Natm-al History than that of Geology was abandoned ; and it was determined by the

Government of Sir Robert Peel to consolidate the Surveys of the United Kingdom
imder one head, and Sir H. T. De la Beche was appointed the first Director-Ge-
neral (iu 1844), while the Geological Sm-vey of Great Britain was placed under the
immediate direction of Professor Ramsay, and that of Ireland under Captain (after-
wards Colonel) Sir H. James, who was succeeded by Professor Oldham, with a small
staff of assistants. These oihcers commenced operations in the vicinity of Dublin,
and southward through Wicklow into Wexford. On Professor Oldham being
appointed to the Geological Survey of India, he was succeeded iu the Directorate by
the late Professor Jukes, who, with a slightly increased stafi of surveyors, including

the late Mr. Du Noyer and Mr. Kinahan, the present District Surveyor, completed

the survey of a very large portion of the south, centre, and west of Ireland.

   The districts recently completed are those of Connemara and West Mayo by Messrs.
Kinahan, Wai-ren, and Symes, of the Mourne Mountains by Mr. Traill, of "the vici-
nity of Antrim by Mr. Duffin, the Dungannon district by Mr. Hardman, and that

of Ai-magh by Mr. Egan, together with other portions of Westmeath, Longford, and

Mayo by Messrs. Wilkinson, Cruise, and Leonard.
   These maps are surveyed on the scale of 6 inches to a mile ; and the field maps

are afterwards reduced and engraved on the Ordnance maps at a scale of one inch
to a mile, which are published through the agents both in Belfast and Dublin.
These maps are not generally hill-shaded ; but it is intended to publish all the geo-
logical details of the district, north of a line drawn from Clewe Bay on the west to
Dundalk Bay on the east, on maps having the physical features shown by shading.

   The sm-vey of the Dungannon coal-field has just been completed, and the results
are being prepared for publication. This is also true with regard to the Leitrini
and Roscommon coal-districts, while a fresh survey is being earned out of the

Leinster coal-field.
    Great pains is also being taken to portray accurately the extent of the deposits

of iron-ore of co. Antrim, and considerable advance has been made in the survey

of that district.

   Professor Hull then referred to the Geological Map of Sir R. Griffith, the first

ever constructed for Ireland, expressing his high appreciation of its beauty and

accuracy.

                         By J. GwTN Jeffreys, LL.D., F.R.S.

   In compliance with a request of the late Professor Phillips, made not long before
his lamented death, the author examined all the collections of fossil shells from the
84 REPORT 1874.

celebrated Crag-bed at Bridlington ; and he furnished the Professor with a cata-

logue raisonnee of the species for the new and forthcoming edition of his work on

the Geology of Yorkshire. Dr. Jeffreys went lately, with Mr. Leckenby, to
Bridlington, when they ascertained that the Crag-bed lay under the boulder-clay,

and rested unconformably on a bed of Liassic shale of a purplish colour, which in

one place appeared to have been triturated and redeposited in the form of clay. In

this purplish clay they found a specimen of Tunitella erosa fan Arctic and

North-American shell), besides several other species which are common to the

boulder-clay and Bridlington bed. All the species from the Bridlington bed are

high northern and are now living. They are sixty-seven in number ; and a list is

subjoined. The author suggested that this deposit of shells might have originated

either in a deviation of the great Arctic current at a very remote period, or in glacial
conditions. It had clearly no relation to the Norwich Crag, as was once imagined

to be the case.

   The present direction of the Arctic current has been to a certain extent shown by

the expeditions conducted by the author in H.M.S. ' Porcupine,' during the years

1869 and 1870, to traverse the North Atlantic along the west coast of Ireland as

well as the Bay of Biscay ; and there is no doubt that it formerly reached that part

of the Mediterranean where Sicily is. One of the species (Nucula CobboldicB) has

been  hitherto known  from Japan  only                     but it is probable that when the  coralline
                                                        ;

and deep-sea zones of the circumpolar ocean shall have been explored, this species

will be discovered in the highest latitudes.

The author is inclined to reject from the li.st of Bridlington fossils the following

species, viz. Mytilus edulis, Cardimn edide, Littorina litorea, L. rudis, and Purpura

laptllus, because they are littoral, and therefore not likely to be associated with

species which belong to the coralline zone, such as Rhynchonella psittacea, Venus

fluctuosa, Dentaliurn striolutum, Admete viridvla, and Cohimbella Holholli. These
littoral shells maj' have come from the boulder-clay, and been accidentally mixed

with the shells from the deposit under consideration.

On the Occurrence of the Middle Lias at BMycastle. By G. Langtry.

   The author stated that Mr. William Gray first directed attention to the occurrence
of the Middle Lias in the county of Antrim. It is Ms impression, however, that

the area in which it is likely to be found  is very circumscribed                                                                                                                                       indeed some have
                                                                                                                                                                  ;

gone so far as to affirm that its presence is only due to boulders having been trans-

ported thither, by glacial action, from some of the western islands of Scotland.

But if this be so, why are the boulders not much more widely distributed ? The

author had not seen these blocks under such favourable circumstances as to

determine accurately whether they bear the marks                                                                               of ice-action                                                            certainly none of
                                                                                                                                                                                                     ;

those which he saw were polished, and any striations might have resulted from

workmen's tools, as all the blocks had been exhumed either in constructing wells,

flax-" dubs," or other excavations. One thing, however, is certain, that in the neigh-

bourhood of the " Workhouse," Ballycastle, no cuttings to any considerable depth

have been made without disclosing some of these Liassic blocks. Unfortunately no

outcrop occurs affording facilities for a thorough examination. Another and very

powerful reason why it is likely to be found in situ is that at Ballintoy, a few miles

off, we have a fine section of the Rhsetic and Lower Lias beds.

Mr. Gray has stated that the following species had been identified and tabu-

lated : Hyhodm reticidatus, Ag. ? ; Ammonites margaritatus, Bl. ; Pitonillus turbi-

Since this list was made out the author has procured Unicardmm cardioides,

AmmoJiites planorbis, and two other Ammonites not yet identified ; also three casts

of Pholadomya and two of Astarte ; as these latter are merely impressions, it is

almost impossible to classify them.

Some of those fossils which have been mentioned are not confined to the Middle

Lias alone, but are distributed more or less sparingly in the lower beds of the same

formation ; others, again, are almost exclusively confined to the Middle Lias marls

in Ireland.

On a RemarhahJe Fragment of Silicijied Wood from the Rocky Mountains.
  By H. Alleyne Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc, F.B.S.E., and W. H. Ellis, M.B.,

   B.A.

The object of this communication was a singular fragment of silicified wood

which had been obtained from a fossil forest in Colorado. The forest is situated

near Colorado City, about 7000 feet above the level of the sea, near Pike's Peak.

It covers an area of from 1000 to 2000 acres, and exhibits numerous erect silicified

stumps, which are placed aU round a broad depression, at one time apparently

occupied by an ancient lake. The stumps are usually three or four feet in

height, and from ten to twenty feet in diameter, and the authors gave reasons for

believing that they belonged to the same group as the " giant trees " (Sequoia

gigantea) of California, if not specifically the same.

The specimen which formed the immediate object of this paper was a fragment

about six inches in greatest length by three in width. Thin sections, examined

imder the microscope, exhibited woody fibres and medullary rays, but no disks could

be detected. Chemically, the wood is completely fossilized, and consists essentially
A --of silica.
             chemical analysis yielded : water and organic matter, 6'24 ; silica,

8.5-26; alumina, 5 '35 ; lime, C>-79; ma^esia and iron, traces. The most remarkable
point, however, was the very peculiar torm of the specimen, which led the authors

to conclude that it was a chip cut artificially fi'om the tree prior to silicihcation.

--The chief reasons for this conclusion were summed up as follows : 1. The specimen

is a fragment of silicified wood, exhibiting clean and definite surfaces at each end,
cutting directly across the fibres of the wood. It is inconceivable that the silicified

wood of an erect or prostrate trunk, not buried in the earth, should have been sub-
jected to any influences which could have produced a "jointed" structure such as
is seen in many rocks ; and if the surfaces in question were not produced by any
edge-tool, the agency by which they were formed has yet to be pointed out. 2. The

general form of the fragment is, precisely and in the minutest details, that of an ordi-
nary chip cut by an axe. 3. The upper of the two supposed cut sm-faces is curved in

the same way as is often seen in modern chips when the axe has been blimt or has
been loosely held in the hand. 4. The lower surface is an approximately clean-cut

plane, but exhibits numerous successive ledges or inequalities corresponding with the
concentric layers of the wood. Similar parallel ledges or steps can be observed in
any recent cliip, when the axe used has been blunt; and they are due to the fact that
the edge of the axe has made a succession of slips in cutting through the successive
concentric layers of the wood, these layers differing from one another in hardness.

   The authors concluded, therefore, that the specimen was a chip cut by one of the
prehistoric inhabitants of North America from one of the ancient Sequoias of Colo-
rado by means of a copper axe.

On Favistella stellata and Favistella calicina, with Notes on the Affinities of
   Eavistella and allied Genera. Bif H. Alletne Nicholson, M.B., JD.Sc,

    F.R.S.E., Professor of Biology in the College of Physical Science, Neweastle.

   In this communication the author fully discussed the validity of the genus Favis-
iella, Hall, and its relation to the older genus Columnaria of Goldfuss. It was

shown that the Faridella stellata of Hall was beyond reasonable doubt identical
иwith the form previously described by Goldfuss under the name of Columnaria
alveohda. Strict adherence to the law "of priority would, therefore, demand the sup-
pression of the former. It was further shown, however, that the name of Columnaria
alveolata had by general consent become fixed upon a coral from the Trenton Lime-
stone of America, which diftered essentially from the form so named by Goldfuss in

his original description. The author concluded that one of three courses should be

--adopted: 1. Favistella smd Columnaria maybe considered identical. This would

be strict justice, but woiild be attended with the inconvenience that a new genus
would have to be founded for the reception of the forms which have usually been
regarded as typical Columnarite. 2. The genus Columnaria, as redefined by M'Coy
and Hall, may be adopted, only those forms with rudimentary septa being in-

cluded in it, whDst the forms with complete septa are placed under Favistella, Hall.

We3. may consider the development of the septa as in itself not a character of

sufficient importance to justifS' generic separation. In this case it would simply be

necessary to expand the genus Colnmnaria of Goldfiiss so as to receive the forms
assigned to the genus by subsequent writers. The genus would then include two

--groups of corals one with marginal and rudimentary septa ( Cohimnaria of M'Coy,

Hall, &c.), the other with complete septa (Colnnimiria of Goldfuss and Favistella

of Hall). This coxirse appeared to the author to be upon the whole the most advi-

sable one.

   The author enumerated the characters of Favistella stellata, Hall, and described a

--new species under the name of Favistella {Columnaria) calicina, as follows: Co-

rallum aggregate, subhemispheric or pyriform, rarely exceeding three inches in diar

meter and two in height. Corallites more or less cylindrical, rarely prismatic, from
less than one line to two lines in diameter, averaging one line and a half The coral-

lites are never completely amalgamated by their walls, and are only rarely in direct

contact tlu-oughout their entire height. On the contrajy, each corallite is enveloped

in a strong and completely separate epitheca, marked by vertical ridges and encircling

strife, and they diverge from the base in such a manner that they are usually sepa-

rated from one another by more or less conspicuous intervals near their calices.
Septa alternately large and small, twenty-eight or thirty in number altogether, the
primary ones nearly reaching the centre, the secondary ones marginal. Tabulae well
developed, complete, about three in the space of one line. Increase by calicular
gemmation, apparently in combination with parietal budding.

Description of Species of Alecto and Hippothoa from the Loiver Silurian

   Mocks of Ohio, with a Description of Aulopora arachnoidea. By H. Al-

   LEYNE Nicholson, M.D., D.Sc, F.R.S.E.

   In this communication the author described the following fossils from the
Hudson-River Group of South-western Ohio :

  --1. Hippothoa inflata, Hall, sp. This is the Alecto injlata described by Hall from

the older formation of the Trenton Limestone. Though in certain respects re-
sembling some of the species of Alecto, the author expressed the opinion that this
beautiful little species was an undoubted Hippothoa. The cells are pyriform,
attenuated below, uniserial, and springing dii'ectly from one another, and the oval

--cell-mouths are placed on the front faces of the swollen cells.
   2. Alecto frondosa, James. This species, named by Mr. U. P. James in his
'Catalogue of the Silurian Fossils of Ohio,' was now for the first time described by

the author. It forms anastomosing networks or thin expanded crusts parasitic upon
Strophomena alternata. The cells are generally dispersed in two, three, or more
rows, long and tubular, immersed below, but elevated towards the apertures, which

--are circular, terminal, and of the same diameter as the tube itself.

distinguished by its much more slender habit and graceful form, and by having

its cells disposed in a double or single series. It presents a close superficial
resemblance to Aulopora arachnoidea. Hall, from which, however, it can be readily

distinguished.

columns of Oiinoids. The cells are larger and more prominent than in the two
preceding species, and are more closely and in-egularly an-anged.

 --6. Aulopora arachnoidea, Hall. The author gave a fidl description of this species

for the purpose of separating it from Alecto auloporoides, which it closely resembles

in external appearance. Though very similar to Alecto in many respects, it can be

refen'ed with considerable confidence to the genus Aulopora.

Descriptions of New Species of Cystiphyllum /rom the Devonian RocJcs of
     North America. By H. Alletne Nicholson, 3I.D., D.Sc, F.E.8.E.

   No less than seven species of Cystiphyllum have akeady been recorded as oc-

curring in the Devonian rocks of North America, viz. C. vesicidosum, Goldfuss,
C. Senecaense, Billings, C. grande, Billings, C. svdcatum, Billings, C. Americanum,

Edw. & H., C. afjgregatum, Billings, and C. mundulum, Hall. To these the author
now added the following three species, all of which were obtained by him from the

Corniferous Limestone of Canada and the State of Ohio.

 --1. Cystiphyllum Ohioense, Nich. This is a very minute species, averaging not

more than six lines in length, with a remarkably deep, pointed, and not oblique
calice. It possesses very distinct septal striae, but is not furnished with any radici-
form prolongations of the epitheca. It is most nearly allied to C. tm(ndulu7n, Hall,
from the Devonian of Rockford, Iowa, but is distinguished by its smaller size, the
smaller number of its septa, and its much deeper and more pointed calice.

Loc. Common in the Corniferous Ijimestone of Columbus, Ohio.

 --2. Cystiphyllum sqtuimosum, Nich. This species is readily distinguished by its

extraordinarily flattened and scale-like form, due to the extreme obliquity and
shallowness of the calice, the flattening of the dorsal surface, and the total disap-

pearance of the lateral surfaces. No other species of the genus even approaches C.

squamosum in these characters, aud these are therefore of themselves sufficient to
characterize the species. Lav. Corniferous Limestone, Columbus, Ohio.

  --3. Cystiphyllutn fruticosum, Nich. This species is remarltable for being compound,

and for forming large colonies composed of numerous cylindrical, straight or slightly
Hexuous corallites, which are about three lines in diameter, and are placed about two
lines apart. The internal structure is that of Cystiphyllum. Its composite character
sufficiently distinguishes C. fruticosum from all previously recorded species of the
genus except C. aggregatum, Billings, and from this it is separated D}' its totally
different form and mode of growth. Loc. Corniferous Limestone, Wainfleet and

    On the Columnar Form of Basalt. By W. Chandler Robeets, F.C.S.

   The author briefly stated what were the views hitherto held by geologists as to

the method by which the jointed prismatic sti'ucture had been produced. He spe-
cially alluded to the experiments made in 1804 by Mr. Gregory Watt, who showed

that when basalt was melted and slowly cooled, globvdar structures appeared in the
solidifying mass, a fact which led Mr. Watt to believe that the mutual compression
of such spheres resulted in the formation of hexagonal prisms. The author pointed
out the objections to this theory, and described the results of experiments he had

made on the effect of heat on certain brick-like masses of fire-clay and sand. When

these masses are heated to redness (a point far below that at which they would fuse),
they contract from 3 to 4 per cent., and the unequal strain which attends the con-
traction produces a columnar structure closely resembling that of certain beds of
basalt which occur in the valley of the Ardeche.

    This stiuctm'e can be produced at will, but it is necessary that the fire-clay should
not be uniformly heated.

   He concluded by comparing the columnar form of starch, which had assumed its

                                                                                                    7*

with coliminar basalt which has imdoubtedly cooled fi-om a fluid state.

          On the Permian Breccias of the Country near Whitehaven.
           Bif E.. Russell, C.E., F.G.S., H.M. Geological Survey.

The subject of this brief notice is the Permian breccia of the district near White-

haven.

   Besides its exposure on the coast at Barrowmoulh, many detached patches of this
breccia occur further inland, between Bigrigg IMoor and Rowrah, being much more

largely developed over the latter area than it is at the former place. The section at

Barrowmouth is well known, but in the latter distiict it has not previously been

--described in any published memoir.
   The author considered : 1st, its occurrence ; 2ud, its composition ; 3rd, its forma-

tion.

   1st. From the coast it rises rapidly along the cliiF to the top of the ridge, and
winding round by Preston Hows runs down into the St. Bees valley near Stanley

Engine ; on the opposite side of the valley it shows itself in Parkhou.se Beck,

w^hence it extends from Lund Moor by Pallaflat to Egremont. The line thus
roughly traced is the northern boundary of the main portion of the Permian rocks,
иwhich, dipping to the south-west, extend southward into the Fumess disti-ict.

   Northwards the St. Bees sandstone is brought in from Scalegill Hall to north of

Summer Grove by the Growgarth and Ingwell faults, and the breccia crops out

from under this sandstone in the valley near Keekle cottage. It also occupies a

narrow strip between two parallel faults, having a N.W. and a S.E. direction, ex-
tending from Frizington Hall across Weddiker to north of Walkmill Bridge. West

of Frizington Hall a fault puts in the St. Bees sandstone at Eheda, but on the
upcast side of the fault east of Rheda the breccia forms a well-marked ridge from

near Millj'eat to Howgate.

   Eastwards it again occurs on the downcast side of the Yeathouse fault, and is
seen in the Whitehaven, Cleator, and Egrement Railway near Yeathouse station

gradually to pass up into the Permian sandstone, the angle of dip being 15░ at

W.N. 58░  It extends to the north-east until it is cut oft' by the continuation of

the Groft's faidt through Kirkland How, but is once more brought in on the

north-east of the Arlecdon fault, foi-ming a partial outlier from Rowrah Head by

Ashby Banks and St. Michael's Church to Arlecdon.

It is also found near the top of Steel Brow, and between Blenkett Rigg and High

Tutehill, and near Gilgarran.

   The section at Barrowmouth shows the unconformity of the breccia to the under-
lying strata most distinctly, inasmuch as the surface of the Whitehaven sandstone

is water-worn, and the lower bed of the breccia lies in and fills up those eroded
hollows. This is still more marked between BaiTowmouth and Egremont, where

it overlaps Cosil-measures, Grits, Garboniferous Limestone, and finally rests on Lower

--Silurians, east of the last-named place.
   2nd, its composition. The material of which this breccia is composed consists

of small angular and subangular fragments of Garboniferous Limestone (in some in-

stances partially dolomitized), quartzose sandstone, altered ashes, greenstone, clay-

slate, vein quartz and syenite, imbedded in a limy and sandy mati-ix, and cemented

by peroxide of iron, sometimes so firm and hard that the imbedded fragments will
cut through along with the mati-ix in which they are enclosed when the rock is

broken, in other cases so loose and friable that each individual fragment can easily

be detached from the main mass, ^^^lile it is generally made up of the rocks above

mentioned, it varies from a breccia consisting of large ang-ular pieces of Garboni-

ferous Limestone, to that in which the contained rocks are clay-slate and altered

ashes.

   иSrd, its formation.--Notwithstanding the angular and subangular character of the

pebbles, there is much regularity in the stratification, and the distinct bedding
shows that the materials must have been deposited in deep and still water ; so that
we cannot ascribe their formation to the transporting power of running water or
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                93

tidal waves and currents, for the continued action of these causes would have de-
stroyed that distinctive characteristic, viz. the angular shape of the fragments, and
the pebbles would have been rounded.

   It is evident that we must seek for some other cause ; and it seems to the author

that the agency of ice will alone enable us to arrive at a probable solution of this

question.

   He is inclined to think that icebergs, as they parted and floated away from the

glacier, would hardly deposit their burden of moraine matter in the quiet and
gradual manner in which the materials composing this breccia must have been
accumulated ; besides, none of the fragments show any trace of ice-sti'iae, which
might naturally have been expected to exist if this had been the means by which

they were deposited.
    In the seas of the Arctic region, the freezing of the water forms a sheet of ice

along the shores. "When thaw sets in, tons upon tons of rock debris, loosened by
the frost, tumble down and collect on the ice-foot. The combined effects of heat
and wind break up this floe-ice into immense sheets, which float away, and melting
in the open sea, gradually deposit their load over the bed of the ocean.

   Considering this fact in relation to the question now before us, we may be able to

account not only for the angular fragments, but also for the stratified nature of this

breccia, as well as the absence of ice-markings on these fragments. Thus the frosts
of Permian times would freeze the water and waste the pre-existing rocks, and the
loosened materials would accumulate on similar floe-ice ; these floes, after breaking
up, would float away and deposit their burden in tranquil water, giving rise to that
regular bedding which is so characteristic of this breccia. Granting this to con-

tinue for a sufticient length of time, and we may easily account for the formation of

a breccia from 90 to 100 feet thick, as in the present instance.

  On Geological Sections in the co. Down. By AVilliam A. Tkaill, M.A.I.,
                  F.R.G.S.I., of H.M. Geological Survey of Ireland.

   The author exhibited three sheets of geological sections, lately completed by him
and published by the Geological Survey of Ireland, illustrating the geology of the

CO. Down and a small portion of the- co. Antrim, accompanied by a geological map

of the entire county on the scale of one inch to the mile (as published), having the

different lines of sections laid down thereon. The sections themselves were drawn

to the natural scale, and six inches to the mile.
   Section I. ran from Aunalong, aboiit 7 miles south of Newcastle, across the

Moiume Mountains, Slieve Donard (2796 feet high), to Slieve Croob (1755 feet high),
thence N.W. by Moira to Derrymore Point on Lough Neagh.

   Section II. from Narrow-water near WaiTenpoint, E.N.E., across the Mourne
Mountains and Slieve Donard to Newcastle.

    Section III. from Soldier's Point, at the entrance, to Carlingford Lough, N.N.E.,
across the Mourne Mountains to Newcastle.

    Section IV. from Killinchy on the west side of Strangford Lough, N. by Castle
Espie and Scrabo Hill to near Holywood on Belfast Lough.

   The author gave a brief sketch of the geology of the entire co. Down, with the
probable order of succession of the different rocks composing it, having representa-
tives of both the older and the newer formations, and igneous rocks of very different

ages.

   The county for the most part consisted of Lower Silurian rocks, extending from

the Copelands to Carlingford Lough, being part of the large Silurian tract stretching
into the south of Scotland, and belonging chiefly to the " Caradoc"' or " Bala " beds,
while the Ijlandeilo beds occm- in some places, though a line of demai'cation be-
tween them had not been determined.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

--94 REPORT 1874.

    These beds have been thrown into a number of large flexures, minor contortions,
and crumplings, as represented in many places on the sections.

    Contemporaneous with these beds are a number of felspathic ashes, interbedded
felstones, and intrusive felspathic and minette dykes ; these, for the most part, occur
along the lines of bedding and are inclined and contorted with them. They are
mostly to be found in the Portaferry and Bownpatrick districts *.

    After these there seems to come the Granite of Slieve Croob, by some thought to
be of metamorphic origin, and being probably of Palaeozoic age t-

    Subsequent to this Granite, or at any rate after the great contorting up of the Silu-
rian beds, there occur a large number of dykes, nielaphyres, dolerites, and diabase,
penetrating those contorted beds, mostly in vertical dykes, and which are of an age
anterior to the Mourne Granite. Of these, the chief source seems to have been towards
the south of the county ; and many of the old pipes or vents are still to be found, as
on Slieve Moughanmore, Leckanmore, and Slieve Martin f.

   The Carboniferous rocks seem to follow next ; but the remains of them are only
to be found in three localities, viz. at Soldier's Point, at Castle Espie, and at Holy-
wood. They probably extended over a large portion of the county, but have sufi'ered
great denudation, and these isolated patches alone remain. Whether the Coal-
measures did exist over the Lower Limestone here, as most probably they did, we
have now no trace of them whatever remaining, they have been entirely swept away
and this denudation seems to have been earned on till the Silurian rock was laid
bare over most of this district.

   Here may be mentioned the occurrence of the Permian beds in two localities, but

each of very small extent, viz. near Cultra on the shore of Belfast Lough, and iden-
tified by the presence of such fossils as Bakewellia antiqua, Schizodus Schlotheimi,
Productus horridus, and Turbo helicimis ; these beds rest directly and unconformably
upon the Lower Limestone*.

   The other locality is about 2^ miles S.E. of Moira, where a small patch of breccia
and earthy magnesian limestone occurs, resting directly on Silurian beds*.

   Next seems to occur the Granite of the Mourne Mountains, in its fidlest and
widest sense an eruptive Granite, carrying up the Silurian beds with it, and cutting
off" the older melaphyric dykes at the junction, as is so well seen in many places,
especially on Slieve Aluck f-

   Subsequent to this Granite, there are two distinct sets of igneous rocks penetrating

it and the SUurian beds adjacent, with their older dykes. These may be classed as

quartziferous porphyries and felstones (basic), as found on Slieve Meelmore and

Slieve Bearnagh. And last of all some basalt dykes, which are supposed to be of

Tertiary age.

   The author then described in detail the several sections, pointing out the relation-
ships between the diflerent formations and the different igneous dykes penetrating

them.
   Referring more minutely to the Scrabo-Hill section, as having a special and more

local interest, on accoimt of their recent search for coal in that neighbourhood, he
described the upward passage from the Silurian beds near Killinchy to the Carboni-
ferous or Lower Limestone and Limestone Shale at Castle Espie, where the lime-
stone is largely worked and burned in a Hoffman's kiln, at the works of Samuel Mur-
land, Esq., a thickness of 45 feet being attained by the limestone in the quarries. This
limestone extends for about Ij mile towards Comber, but is covered with a thick

head of Drift. It dips northward under the New Red Sandstone formation, which

in this part of the county comes in and forms the flanks of Scrabo Hill, filling up the
old valley of denudation extending from Strangford Lough to Belfast Lough. The
section showed the succession of beds through the Bunter Sandstones, Waterstones,
and Keuper Sandstones, to the cap of dolerite forming the top of the hill, with an

elevation of 540 feet. This dolerite or hypersthene rock may be associated with

the basaltic plateau of the co. Antrim, possibly as an outlier, or a separate pipe

may exist somewhere to the westward of the summit.

  This trap penetrates the New Red Sandstone beds in horizontal sheets and in

flows, which have since beeu denuded away. These are all well seen in a number of

quarries which have been opened along the sides of the hill ; which show, however,

that the Sandstone beds have not been displaced, except near the margin of the

dolerite.

Passing over the top of Scrabo Hill, the same succession of beds are met with,
down to the Siliu-ian rocks, occupying the high ground between it and Belfast Lough
                                                                                                                                                                             ;

                                                                                                                                    the Banter

beds are again crossed over.

    In conclusion, the author referred to the question whether coal will be found in the
neighbourhood of Newtownards or Scrabo Hill, where borings had been carried on
for some time past.

   From the one-inch map it was shown that the New Red Sandstone, along almost

its entire margin, rested directly on the Silurian beds, at Castle Espie on the
Lower Limestone, and that at Cultra the Permian beds rested directly on the
Lower Limestone.

  Now is it the least probable that if the Coal-measures did exist hereabouts that

we should have been unable to find any trace of their outcrop along this entire line

ofjunction of the New Red Sandstone and underlying rocks ? Though they probably
may have existed, they all disappeared with the great denudation which took place
before the deposition of the New Red Sandstone. Another evidence against the

presence of the Coal-measures is, that the Permian beds near Moira rest directly on
the Silurian rocks.

Additional evidence is to be found in the borings which were made towards the
end of the last century in this district ; and in every case where the New Red Sand-
stone was pierced through, the Silm-ian rocks were met with ;
were made to a depth of 240 feet.                                                                                     some of these borino"-s

   Of the borings lately made in this district, none were carried sufficiently deep to
prove what existed underneath. It is to be regretted that one, sunk at Cherry valley

north of Castle Espie, was stopped at a depth of about 120 feet, without penetrating

the New Red Sandstone, as the author considered that within 20 or 30 feet more the

underljdng rock would have been entered, and proved whether the limestone ex-

tended even that far to the northward under the New Red Sandstone, to which

distance he hardly thought it did.

   From these and numerous other considerations the author believed that now no

Coal-measures exist in this locality, and that he was justified in excluding them from

a position on the geological section across Scrabo ifall, and that thus the co. Down

was deprived of the hope of obtaining coal.

On the Discovery of Microzoa in the Chalk-flints of the North of Ireland.
                           By Joseph Weight, F.O.S.

In consequence of the extreme hardness of the Irish chalk (White Limestone)

geologists until quite recently had failed to find in these beds any of those Microzoa
which occur so abundantly in rocks of the same age in England. In 1872 the author

discovered that the soft powdery material frequently found inside the cavities that are
so often met with in flint, on being washed and cleaned, yielded Foraminifera, Ostra-

coda, and sponge-spicula in abundance, this powder being, in fact, a portion of the
old sea-bottom of the Cretaceous times. The flints when newly quarried are usually
hard and compact throughout, and it requii-es exposure to the action of the weather
to change the limestone frequently occurring into the powdery material.

Nearly all the Foraminifera and Ostracoda examined chemically by the author
                                                                     in a few instances

derry, and Down ; and among the many specimens collected from these various

stations has recognized, besides corals and Polyzoa, 69 species of Foraminifera, 11

species of Ostracoda, and 33 forms of sponge-spicula ; many of these attain line pro-
portions, being much larger than those usually obtained from the washings of English
chalk. Having found that the " Paramoudras " as well as the ordinary flints usually

contain sponge-spicula in quantity, he has been led to consider that flints in most
instances have originated in a sponge or some other organism round which the silica
accumulated according to well-known chemical laws. The Foraminifera are very
numerous both in individuals and species ; the following genera are well repre-
sented : Trochammina, Lituola, Lagetia, Nodosmia, Deutalina, Frondiculana, Fla-
hellina, Pleurostoniella, Lingidina, Marginulina, Vagimdina, Planularia, Cridellaria,

that the duties of the Chair would have been more fitly discharged by many who

have attended the Meetings of the Association more regadarly and laboured to pro-
mote its objects more continuously than I have been able to do.

    Foi-tunately the increasing importance and the vast extent of the subjects com-
prised under the head of Biology have led to a division of the business of this
Section into the separate departments of Anatomy and Physiology, Botany and

Zoology, and Anthropology ; and it is a great relief to me that the departments of

Botany and Zoology and of Anthropology, respectively, will be presided over by
gentlemen of the highest eminence in those subjects, and that Anatomy and Phy-

siology, in which I am more immediately interested, will alone come under my
direct supervision. It has occurred to me that, in attempting to give a stronger

impulse and a more systematic direction to scientific inquiry, the time ordinarily
 devoted to an introductory address could not be more profitably occupied than by
 bringing into as great prominence as possible some of the great revolutions in our

knowledge of Anatomy and Physiology which have taken place in my own time
and imder my own immediate observation.

    I remember, as if it were yesterday, the elucidation in the Museum of the Royal

 College of Sm-geons of Edinbm-gh of the newly discovered cell-theory by the late

--distinguished Professor of Anatomy in Edinburgh, John Goodsir his account of

 the production of ulceration by cell-growth, of the characters of the corpuscles of
 bone, of the structure of lymphatic glands, and of the germinal centres of base-
 ment membranes as they were then imderstood. This was the time when the

 teaching of Histology was first established in Great Britain. Two 'students, of
 whom 1 was one, formed the first class imder the most enthusiastic of teachers, my

 old friend Dr. Hughes Bennett. The University of Edinburgh had just passed
 through what was probably the most brilliant period in its history. The race of
 the last of the Mmiros was well nigh run ; the great discoverer of the difference
 in the motor and sensory nerves. Sir Charles Bell, was still living ; the aristocracy
 of Scotland had only just ceased to crowd the class-room and witness the brilliant
 and successful experiments of Dr. Hope. The day of CuUen, of Home, and Duncan,
 and Macintosh was over but there still remained in the University the most loved

                                                                                                                                          ;

 and revered of teachers, the benevolent Dr. Alison, Sir Robert Christison, Sir George
 Ballinghall, and Mr. Syme, Dr. Abercrombie still practising his profession in the

  city.

    At this period the great discoveries of Schleiden and Schwann seemed likely to
 upset all that had previously constituted Physiology. The idea that aU tissues

--were either composed of cells or had been formed of cells that nucleated cells

--elaborated all the secretions and formed the excretions that their energy lay at

the very root of the formation, the reproduction, and the function of every tissue

and organ, was a revelation of such astounding simplicity as might well upset men's

minds and prevent their seeing beyond.

  No one who did not live through that time will, I believe, ever realize the

eagerness and anxiety with which every new statement of the action of cells was

--received and added to the previous knowledge of their amazing power or, on the

the other hand, be able to judge of the feeling half akin to disappointment which

was experienced as each succeeding attack was made on this charming theory,

showing it to be really human, very human indeed.

Cells were then understood to constitute the mass of all organs (the liver, spleen,

kidney, and brain), and to be the main agents in the discharge of their functions

to exist and gi'owupon the definite membranous walls of the glandular vesicles and

--ducts to be fed by blood brought to the attached surface of membranes which

seemed almost everywhere to form an absolute separation of the cellular part (the

potential gland) from the non-essential blood- and lymph-vessels, the nerves, and

framework of the organ. It seemed almost a pity that these little microscopic

deities shoidd be hampered by the necessities of their own existence, that thej^

Nowshould need such base things as blood-vessels, nerves, and packing materials.
how strangely are matters changed ! What if it should turn out that these appa-

--rently independent little beings are not independent at all that they are only the

dilated endings of nerves. To this subject I shall refer again by-and-bj.

This great cell-theory has now given place to what I think is certain knowledge,

that living matter may move, perforin all the functions of assimilation and nutri-

tion, and reproduce its like without having any of the essential characters of a cell.

A living mass of protoplasm may change its shape, alter its position, feed and nourish

itself, and form other matter having the same properties as it has and yet be per-

fectly devoid of any structure recognizable by the highest powers of the microscope.

Mr. Lister showed that the contraction of pigment-cells in the skin changes the

position of the pigment- granules, driving them alternately into the processes and

the body of the cell. Kiihne, Golubew, and Strieker observed changes of form in

amcebffi (white blood-corpuscles and embryonal capillaries, respectivelj') after the

application of electrical stimuli ; and Briiclve observed contraction in the pigment-

cells of the skin of the chameleon after excitation of the sensory nerves ; whilst

Kiihne noticed contraction in corneal cells after excitation of the corneal nerves.

Thus obvious movements in fixed cells or masses of protoplasm are proved to

result from the operation of various stimuli, including ner^иous stinuili.

But all cells are not fixed. The blood-cells, fixed, as cells of organs, at an early

period, become free in the blood-fluid and are moved along by the forces which cir-

culate it until a second time they enter into tlie composition of the solid tissues by

penetrating the walls of the blood-vessels and moving along the substance of the

tissues for purposes which are not yet wholly explicable.

   What natm-alist will not at once suggest how frequently this process of alternate

fixation and movement of animal forms occurs low down in the scale ? and yet how

startling is it in man! how impossible to reconcile with our former ideas of

the existence of membranous coverings, of cells, surfaces, and of gland-ducts!

But, with or without explanation, the facts nmst be recognized ; the floating

blood-cells are really the very cells which once formed the substance of the lym-

phatic glands, the spleen, and other organs ; and they do, in fact, move through the
walls of the blood-passages, and wander about freely in what we call solid tissues.

Oiu" knowledge of this circulating fluid has marvellously increased. The dura-

tion of the life of any of its particles is but short ; they die and their places are

occupied by others, as was the case with our forefathers, and will be the case with

ourselves. It is now a matter of observation, which commenced with Hirt of

Zittau, that after every meal an amazing number of white corpuscles are added to the

blood : breakfast doubles their proportion to the colom-ed corpuscles in half an hour

supper increases their proportion three times; and dinner makes it four times as great.

They come from such solid glands as the spleen. In the blood going to the spleen,

their proportion is one to two thousand two hundred and sixtv ; in that returning

from tlie spleen it is one to sixty. Every organ and eveiy tissue changes this fluid
aud, to luy mind, perhaps the most stupendous miracle of organization is the
steady mainlenauce of but slightly variable characters in the living and moving
blood, which is every moment undergoing changes of difl'erent kinds as it circulates
through each tissue aud organ in the body.

    Yet with all this change there is an invariable transmission of the parental cha-
racters by continual descent from pai-ticle to particle as each takes the place of a
former one ; and thus each organ continues to discharge the same function from
year to yeai'. Animals of the same Icind retain the old number of organs, the same
shape of body, aud similar modes of life. There is no sign of commencing life, no

coining of new ^ntal power, no production of living out of dead matter. The
original life extends its limits ; it operates in a more extended sphere ; but it is the
same life, it operates in the same way, it never fails to be recognizable in the in-
dividual by the same chai-acters as it had when it was first known. Whatever

other functions it discharges, it acts continuallj' in obedience to the first great law
it increases and multiplies aud replenishes the earth.

   Let us now for a few moments compare om- former views of the sti-uctiu'c of
animal membranes with the present ones. The skin (covering the outer sm'face of

the body), the mucous membranes, the serous linings of the great internal cavities
aud of the blood- and IjTuph-vessels, and the lining membranes of joints were all
alike v-iewed as if formed of a definite membrane covered on one side by cells, and

--on the other supplied by blood- aud lymph-vessels and by nerves the membrane

covering in the latter parts and effecting an absolute separation of the cells from
the vessels aud nerves, which were uniAersally believed never to penetrate into the
cellular layer. The cells were regarded as the parts actively engaged in the per-

formance of the functions, the vessels and nerves aiding thereto supplying materials
to be acted on by the cells, and the nerves regulating the amoimt uf action at par-
ticular times for special purposes. The diseased conditions, like the functions, were

kept perfectly distinct ; and we had one set of diseases of the epithelial or cellular

parts, and another and a diiferent set of diseases of the membranes and of the parts

below.

I think the first occasion on which the public faith in these views was seriously

shaken was when the late distinguished Professor of Medicine in St. Andrews, Dr.

John Reid, died of what was called an epithelial cancer of the tongue. Microsco-

pical examinations showed that the disease existed in the cellular covering of the

Atongue.  sufiicient cause for it was supposed to exist in the in-itation caused by

sharp points of the teeth, to cover which a protecting silver plate was constructed.

The diseased parts were removed with the greatest skill and care by Sir William

Fergusson, and subsequently by the late Dr. James Duncan, assisted by Mr. Goodsir

aud Mr. Spence, now Professor of Sm-gery in the University of Edinburgh. Every

conceivable care was taken by these attached friends of the poor sufferer to remove

every trace of the disease ; but it progressed steadily aud destroved this valuable

life.

   At this period no one could imderstand the extension of an epithelial disease
through a basement membrane ; and therefore the aflection of the adjacent lym-
phatic glands was explained by supposing the diseased action to have been propa-

gated from cell to cell along the epithelial surface of the lymphatic vessels.

   Not long afterwards the sternly truthful and accurate Sir James Paget declared,

in terms of terrible significance to the sufl'erers from this disease, that epithelial

cancer takes a little longer time than ordinary cancer to do its fatal work.

   And it soon became thoroughly well known that the glands of the skin, the hair-

bulbs, and the teeth are produced by a local development of the deep cells of the cu-
ticle, extending far below the line of the basement membrane or cutis, and through
the position which it was supposed to occupy, as though no membrane were there to
hinder them.

   Thus the basement membrane which was supposed so arbiti-arily to separate the
cells on one surface of membranes from the vessels and nerves on the otlier, gives
way at once before an increased development of the cells, whether in the formation

of new organs or the extension of disease. And the membranous walls of capillai-y

 same way as solid particles enter into find traverse the substance of the protoplasm

 of an amoeba or other mass of sarcode.

     Whilst physiologists were engaged in these observations, the late Master of the
 Mint, Mr, Qi-aham, was conducting a series of experiments of the most remarkable
-kind, and of the utmost importance to physiology, as well as to chemistry and

--physics. He found it necessaiy to separate two sets of substances as crystalloids and

 colloids, the colloids being penetrable by the crystalloids as readily as water, the

 crystalloids (such as hydrochloric acid and common salt) passing through organic
membranes with groat freedom, whilst many of the colloids, such as albumen and
gum, will not penoti-ate them at all. This discovery has enabled the chemist to
separate crystiilloids from colloids by dialysis, even when they occur in the most

--minute proportions for instance, to separate 80 or 90 per cent, of a ten-thousandth

part of arseuious acid in twenty-four hours from porter, milk, or infusions of viscera,

substances notoriously difficult to analyze. And it has enabled physiologists to ex-
plain how animal membranes are traversed by various substances which could not

pass through them without being clianged from t'lie colloidal into the crystalloidal
form. Thus the colloidal starch and albumen of our food scarcely admit of absorp-

tion until in the process of digestion the starch becomes sugar and the albumen
albuminose, crystalloidal bodies which pass through animal membranes with groat

facility. Andagain, this crystalloidal albuminose, after having passed into the

tissues through the membranous walls of the vessels, may become a second time a

colloid, and be deposited and fixed as tissue-substance, ready in its turn to be per-

meated by crystalloids either for temporary or more durable purposes in the

economy.

   The effect of this gre.at discovery of Mr. Graham's shows how impossible is the

advance of physiology without a corresponding advance in om- knowledge of che-

mistry and physics.
    If basement "membranes, the walls of blood-vessels, and of cells are made up of col-

loidal matter, we can easily understand how they are peneti-ated by crystalloids ; and

in like manner it is perfectlj' possible that they m.ay be traversed by other substances

--in solid forms as, for instance, the walls of blood-vessels by the corpuscles of the

blood. No wonder that there is a continual deposition and removal of the consti-

tuents of the tissues, if so slight a change as that from the crystalloidal to the col-

loidal form, and the reverse, makes such perfectly marvellous differences in the

relations of these substances to each other.

   We must look upon the tissues of an animal bodv as we do upon the substance

of an amoeba, and recollect how penetrable the sui-faces and tissues of animals are
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

then we shall cease to be startled when we see these parts become the seat
of entirely new deposits, or find them traversed by migi-ating blood-curpuscles as

freely as a colloid is penetrated by a ciystalloid.

   It" is impossible to foresee what may be the result to physiology of this gieat

advance in our knowledge of the varying relations of substances to each other

according as they present themselves at different times in the opposite physical

conditions which were described by Mr. Graham as crystalloidal and colloidal.
But it is plain that we cannot continue to look upon animal membranes as forming

such decided barriers against the penetration of one tissue by another, or by foreign
matters, as was once supposed.

   Let me now direct your attention to the present aspect of the question how far
basement membranes limit the distribution of vessels and nerves and separ.ile them

from the cells of glands and membranes.

   Mr. Bowman, in his admirable researches Into the anatomy of the organs of sense,

discovered that the filaments of the nerves of smell have a remarkable structure-
that they are nucleated, finely granular, contain no white substance of Schwann,
and resemble the gelatinous ner\-e-fibres. The epithelial surface, too, of the

olfactory region Mr. Bowman described as differing greatly from that of the

adjacent parts of the nasal mucons membrane, and as being of a dark sepia tint.

Subsequent examinations by Iloyer, Max SchuUze, and Lockhart Clarke confirmed

--these statements ; and those of Schultze demonstrated that the cells are of two

kinds : one elongated and filled with yellowish granular protoplasm, exposed at the
outer end of each coll, and containing a clear oval nucleus in c-lccr protoplasm in ita

                                                                                               8*

deeper part, wliich is first attenuated and tlien expanded into a broad flattened

process, apparently connected with the connective tissue ; the other cell, the proper

olfactory cell, a thin, fibrous, rod-like body, is moniliform or varicose, connected

below with the out-runners of a nerve-cell, and in birds and amphibia furnished

with one or more hair-like processes, which at the free end come directly into contact

with odorous particles. Exner in 1872 denied the distinctness of these two forms

of cells, stating that there are all intermediate forms, and that both forms are con-
nected with a deep network continuous ^vith filaments of the olfactory nerve. But

Dr. Newell Martin, in a paper published in the November Number of the ' Journal
of Anatomy and Physiology,' maintains that the two kinds of cell are distinct,

though their characters approximate very closely in the instance of the frog. He

inclines to the belief that, as both forms of cell are so distinct from ordinary epithe-

lium, they are all oliactorj' cells.

The only conclusion which can be drawn from these observations is that in this

situation the olfactory nerves divide into myriads of small finger-lilce processes,
which, exposed on the free surface of the membrane, are actually engaged in feeling

at the odorous particles to inform us of their characters.

This single insttmce, so thoroughly proved, would be sufficient to destroy our

former ideas that nerves are spread out under basement membranes and never pene-

trate an epithelial layer.

   But this is not the only case of the kind. The general relations of the gustatory
nerves to the epithelial cells of the tongue have been described by Axel Key as

similar in the fungiform papillre of the frog, and by Schwalbe and'Lov^n in the

gustatory cells of the circumvallate and of some of the fungiform papillae in men
and animals. On the protected sides of the circumvallate papilliB a peculiarity in

the shape and arrangement of the epithelial cells produces a series of taste-cones,
the central cells of which are furnished with hair-like prolongations similar to those

of the olfactory cells.

   In the otolith-sacs and the ampullae of the semicircular canals of the ear, the
nerve-filaments, having lost their white substance, become connected with peculiar
auditoi'y cells and end in hair-like processes between the epithelial cells. In the
cochlea, too, notwithstanding the complication of the examination produced by the

rods of Oorti, there is reason to believe that the cells supporting hairs which pro-
ject beyond the epithelial surface are connected with the primitive nerve-fibrils of
the plexus below.

Of the recorded instances in which nerves pass through basement membranes to

get into direct contact or continuity with the superjacent epitlielial cells, none is

so striking as that of the salivary and other glands, if there be the least ground for

the remarkably detailed observations and suggestions of Pfliiger. They are of so
much importance and interest in connexion with the whole process of secretion,

that I ofter no excuse for directing your attention to them, even though it may be

proved that the act of secretion is not attended with such marvellous and extensive

changes of structure as Pfliiger supposes. Up to a certain point his observations

may be easily and abundantly contimied                                                                                                                                                          beyond  that  there is much greater difti-

culty ; but this Meeting offers one of the most favourable opportunities for extending

our Imowledge by bringing different observers into easy communication with each

other, and enabling each to help the rest by stating the means by which he had

overcome what seemed at first to be insuperable difficulties in the progi-ess of an

investigation.

   Pfliiger calls attention to the very variable characters of the alveoli, the secreting

cells, and the excretory ducts of the salivary glands. These parts, which were
believed to have very determinate sizes and characters, he declares to differ very

greatly in different parts of the same gland. Tlie alveoli, occupied by what we

understand as secreting or glandular epitlielial cells, and the excretory ducts, lined
by columnar epithelium, he thinks he can prove to be but dilforent stages of deve-
lopment of the same structures, produced on the ends of the myriad nervous fila-
ments supplied to these glands.

   On this view glandular epithelial cells must be regarded as special organs of

teriiiination of nevve-fibrils, like the auditory cells, touch-corpuscles, olfactorv cells,

muscular fibre-cells, and the like--the relation between such structures and the

   nerves becoming so close that it may be difficult, perhaps impossible, to define their

   respective limits. Pfliiger has figm-ed the nuclei of the cells of the alveoli of the

   sahvary glands, the salivary cells, connected with a delicate fibre, "which often

   pierces the surface of the cell in contact with the membrana propria, and gives

   the cell the appearance of being stalked. This appearance has also been seen by

   Schliiter, Otto Weber, Gianuzzi, Boll, and Kolliker; and, indeed, tlie appearance

   which Pfliiger has figured may be seen by any one who will take the trouble to

   examine the salivary glands of the common cocla-oach (Blatta oriadalis). This

   Erocess was  shown  to  me  myl)y fi-iend  and  pupil,  Mr.  Charles  Workman                                                     and  I
                                                                                                                                  ;

   ave several preparatious which show a similar process to that which Pfliiger has

   observed and figured ; but that it is as clearly connected with the nucleus of the cell

   as he describes it I am not prepared to affirm. Pfliiger says it is hollow, and often

   discharges a large quantity of tenacious material which clearly proceeds fi-om the

   nucleus.

      In the interior of the gland there are ducts lined with a thick but single layer of
   columnar epithelium, the cells of which are clear and nucleated near their free end,
   but furnished with a large number of extremely fine varicose hairs at the end con-
   nected with the membrana propria. This epithelium becomes thicker as the ducts
   proceed towards their connexion with the alveoli ; and as transpai-ent drops can be

   seen transuding from the ends of the cells when saliva has been made to flow by

   irritation of the gland, Pfliiger concludes that they are important secretory organs.

   Such ducts frequently form loops, or bend suddenly, or possess diverticula. The
   epithelium of the ducts, which carry the secretion out of the gland, is of a difierent

   and apparently less important Idnd.
      Pfliiger directs special attention to the gi-eat number of nei"ves connected with the

   alveoli. He has identified them in fresh specimens by their investment here and

   there by an ordinary double-contoured medulla, by their being blackened by perosmic
   acid, by their varicosities, and by tracing them to larger and more easily recogni-

   zable nei'ves. He finds them branching in great numbers amongst the cells of the

   alveoli, and traces their fibrils to the nuclei of the cells, sometimes after they have
   been connected with multipolar gnnglion-cells. Or nerves covered by medulla and
   sheath, and containing numerous varicose axis cylinders, branch, enlarge, and
   become covered with protoplasm set with nuclei, forming what Pfliiger calls a
   protoplasmic foot, and supposes to be a structme intermediate in character between

   nervous and glandular tissue. And on the surface of the ducts lined by columnar

   epithelium a nerve divides into a pencil-like tuft of A'aricose fibrils, each of which
   Pfliiger says is directly continuous with one of the processes of a columnar epithelial
   cell. I have frequently seen the pencil-like tuft of varicose fibrils on the surface of

   the ducts lined by columnar epithelium ; but it is not so easy to be sure that the
   fibrils are connected with the processes of the cells. However, the statement is

   made in the most positive way by Pfliiger, who has made those glands the subjects

   of very special and lengthened investigation ; and his drawings atford very strong
   corroborative testimony of the value of his statements. Moreover, in independent

   obser\'ations on the pancreas, he has also traced the nerves to endings in the secre-

   ting cells.

   HeI3ut Pfliiger has gone greatly finther than this.          has figiured the hair-like

   processes at tlie attached end of the colunmar cells in all stages of transition into

   salivary cells of new alveoli ; and haviug previously found the nerves connected by

   varicose fibrils with protoplasmic masses set with nuclei, he concludes that it is

   possible that the salivary cells are developed on the ends of the nerves without

   interference of their own nuclei, and that, as a continual new formation of alveoli

   and salivary cells implies the atrophy and disintegration of corresponding older

   parts, the alveoli with pale offshoots of various forms which he has seen in moles

   are evidences of such atrophy.

   With these numerous instances in which nerves are alleged to pjiss through

   membranes to be connected with the cells on their surfaces, as if these were their

   special modes of termination, we might well be content until there has been time

   for further investigation by independent observers. But there are yet other in-

   stances. Langerhans described, in 1868, a fine network of fibres in the skin, fi-om

   the superficial part of which fine non-medullated fibres pass out of the cutis and

I
--103 REPORT 1874.

end in the MalpigMan layer of tlie epidermis. He saw in the epidermis also well-

marked cells which gave off several processes towards the horny layer, and one long

slender process which passed through the Malpighian layer into the cutis. He

considers these cells to he nervous, and their peripheral processes to he the terminal
parts of the nerves of the sMn. 0. J. Eherth agrees in the main with Langerhans,
and recognizes fine nerve-fibres passing from the nerves of the cutis into the deeper
layer of cuticular cells, and also star-and-spindle-ehaped cells in the cuticle, which

he suggests may he nervous structures, though he has not traced them in connexion

with nerve-fibres.

   On the surface of young fishes and Amphibia F. E. Schutze has described nerve-
hairs aiTanged in the form of tufts or brushes very much as is the case in the organ

of hearing : in this instance the brush-like endings of the nerves are probably con-
nected with touch.

   Oohnheim has described the corneal nerves as forming a superficial plexus under
the anterior elastic lamina; from this perforating branches pass pei-pendicularly
through the lamina, and then, under the epithelium, break up into brush-like or
star-shaped finer branches, which form a plexus giving off fine nerves at tolerably
regular intervals between the deep columnar cells and the more superficial sphe-
roidal ones, and dividing at length into their finest branches, which end by some-
what swollen extremities in the most superficial epithelial layers. Thus the exqui-
site sensibility of the front of the eye, like that of the olfactory or gustatory mucous
membranes, may be accoimted for.

   When I look upon the vast amount of research which has been applied to this

department of Biology for some years past, and think that the instrument which
has afforded the gieat means for it was onlj' perfected so as to be capable of use for
such purposes about 1820, 1 cannot but congratulate the Section on the abundant

fruits we are reaping.
   And when, in addition, I contemplate the amount of certainty which physical

 science has imparted to physiology by furnishing the means of examining and
 accurately measuring the rates of transmission of nerve-cm'rents, of obtaining tra-
cings of the respiratory movements and of the arterial pulsations, of examining the

retina in the living eye and the larynx of a living man almost as readily as if these

 parts were exposed in a dissection, I cannot but conclude that this nineteenth cen-

tury has been afready distinguished as a very notable one for Biologj-, and especially

 for Physiology.

    Considering that so much time is required for making a single careful obser-
 vation, it is very fortunate that so large an an-ay of inquirers and so much taleut
 are employed upon the subjects in which we are interested, and that once a year we

 have this admirable opportunity of listening to the results of inquiries instituted by

 the most eminent men in all parts of the world, and of hearing different views

 advocated with the greatest eai-nestness and yet with perfect good humourj and a
 rigorous determination to rest satisfied with nothing but the truth.

           Address to ilie Department of Botany and Zoology,

               By Dr. Hookee, C.B., D.C.L., Pres.B.S.

  I have   chosen  for the  svibject  of my Address  to  you from  the  chaii-  to  which  the

^

Council of the British Association has done me the honom- of calling me, the

--carnivorous habits of some of om- brother organisms plants.
Various observers have described with more or less accmacy the habits of such

vegetable sportsmen as the Simdew, the Venus's ffy-trap, and the Pitcher-plants, but

few have inquired into their motives; and the views of those who have most

accurately appreciated them have not met with that general acceptance which they

deserved.

   Quite recently the subject has acquii-ed a new interest, from the researches of
Mr. Darwin into the phenomena which accompany the placing of albuminous sub-

                                                                                           I

stances on the leaves of Drosera and Pintjuictila, and which, as Dr. Burden

Sanderson has remarlred, prove in the case of jyioncea that this plant diu:ests exactly

the same suhstances, and in exactly the same way, that the human stomach does*.
With these researches Mr. Darwin is still activelj^ engaged ; and it has been with

the view of rendering him such aid as my position and opportunities at Kew

afforded me, that 1 have, imder his instructions, examined some other carnivorous

plants.

   In the com'se of my inquiries I have been led to look into the early history of

the whole subject, which I find to be so little Imown and so interesting that I have
thought that a sketch of it, up to the date of Mr. Darwin's investigations, might
prove acceptable to the members of this Association. In di-awing it up, I have

fjeen obliged to limit myself to the most important plants ; and with regard to such
of these as Mr. Darwin has studied, I leave it to him to announce the discoveries

which, with his usual frankness, he has communicated to me and to other friends ;

whilst with regard to those which I have myself studied (Sairacmia and Nepenthes)

I shall briefly detail such of my observations and experiments as seem to be the

most suggestive.

                                                    DlON^A.

   About 1768 Ellis, a well-known English naturalist, sent to Linnaeus a di-awing
of a plant, to which he gave the poetical name of Dioncea. " In the year 1765," he

writes, "om late worthy friend, Mr. Peter CoUinson, sent me a di-ied specimen of

this curious plant, which he had received from Mr. John Bartram, of Philadelphia,
botanist to the late King"t. Ellis flowered the plant in his chambers, having
obtained li^иiug specimens from America. I will read the accoimt which he gave
of it to Linnoeus, and which moved the great natm-alist to declare that, though he
had seen and examined no small number of plants, he had never met with so

wonderful a phenomenon J :

   " The plant, of which I now enclose you an exact figure with a specimen of its
leaves and blossoms, shows that Nature may have some views towai-ds its nom-ish-

ment, in forming the upper joint of its leaf like a machine to catch food : upon the

middle of this lies the bait for the imhappy insect that becomes its prey. Many

minute red glands that cover its surface, and which perhaps discharge sweet liquor,

tempt the poor animal to taste them ; and the instant these tender parts are imitated
by its feet, the two lobes rise up, grasp it fast, lock the rows of spines together, and

squeeze it to death. And further, lest the strong efforts for life in the creatme just

taken should serve to disengage it, three small erect spines are fixed near the middle

of each lobe, among the glands, that eftectually put an end to all its struggles. Nor
do the lobes ever open again, while the dead animal continues there. But it is

nevertheless certain, that the plant cannot distingiush an animal fi-om a vegetable

or mineral substance ; for if we introduce a straw or pin between the lobes, it will

grasp it full as fast as if it was an insect "Д.
   This account, which in its way is scarcely less homble than the descriptions of

those mediaeval statues which opened to embrace and stab their A-ictims, is sul>.
stantially correct, but erroneous in some particulars. I prefer, however, to trace
out our knowledge of the facts in historical order, because it is extremely important

to realize in so doing how much our appreciation of tolerably simple matters may

bo influenced by the prepossessions that occupy om* mind.

  We have a slxiking illustration of this in the statement published by Linnteus a

few years afterwards. All the facts which I have detailed to you were in his
possession yet he was evidently imable to bring himself to believe that Natm-e

                                                 ;

intended the plant (to use Ellis's words) " to receive some uom-ishiuent from the
animals it seizes ; " and he accordingly declared that as soon as the insects ceased
to struggle, the leaf opened and let them go ||. lie only saw in these wonderful
actions an extreme case of sensitiveness in the leaves, which caused them to fold up

wlien irritated, just as the sensitive plant does ; and he consequently regarded the
capture of the disturbing insect as something merely accidental, and of no import-

ance to the plant. He was, however, too sagacious to accept Ellis's sensational

account of the coup de (/race which the insects received from the three stiff hahs in
the centre of each lohe of the leaf. Linnseus's authority overbore criticism, if any

were offered ; and his statements about the behaviour of the leaves were faithfully

copied from book to book.
   Broussonet (in 1784) attempted to explain the contraction of the leaves by

supposing that the captiu-ed insect pricked them, and so let out the fluid which
previously kept them turgid and expanded *.

   Dr. Darwin (1791) was contented to suppose that the Dimesa surrounded itself
with insect-traps to prevent depredations upon its flowers t-

    Sixty yeai-s after Liunteus wrote, however, an able botanist, the Kev. Dr. Cm-tis

(dead but a few years since), resided at Wilmington, in North Carolina, the head-

quai'ters of this very local plant. In 1834 he published an accoimt of it in the

--' Boston Jom-nal of Natm-al History ' t, which is a model of acciu-ate scientific

observation. This is what he said : " Each side of the leaf is a little concave on
the inner side, where are placed three delicate hair-like organs, in such an order
that an insect can hardly traverse it v^dthout interfering with one of them, when the
two sides suddenly collapse and enclose the prey, with a force surpassing an insect's
efforts to escape. The fringe of hairs on tlie opposite sides of a leaf interlace, like
the lingers of two hands clasped together. The sensitiveness resides only in these
hair-like processes on the inside, as the leaf may be touched or pressed in anj'^ other
part without sensible effects. The little prisoner is not crushed and suddenly
destroyed, as is sometimes supposed, for I have often liberated captive flies and
spiders, which sped away as fast as fear or joy could carry them. At other times I
have found them enveloped in a fluid of a mucilaginous consistence, which seems
to act as a solvent, the insects being more or less consumed in it."

   To Ellis belongs the credit of divining the pm-pose of the capture of insects by
the Dioncea. But Curtis, besides making out the details of the mechanism, by

ascertaining the seat of the sensitiveness in the leaves, also pointed out that the

secretion was not a lure exuded before the capture, but a true digestive fluid pom'ed
out, like our own gastric juice, after the ingestion of food Д.

    For another generation the history of this wonderfid plant stood still ; but in

1868 an American botanist, Mr. Canby, who is happily still engaged in botanical

research, while staying in the i)toФФФ-district, studied the habits of the plant
pretty carefully, especially the points which Dr. Curtis had observed. His first
idea was that " the leaf had the power of dissolving animal matter, which was then
allowed to flow along the somewhat trough-like petiole to the root, thus furnishing

the plant with highly nitrogenous food." By feeding the leaves with small pieces

of beef, he found, however, that this was not so, but that these were completely
dissolved and absorbed ; the leaf opening again witli a dry surface, and readj' for

another meal, though with an .appetite somewhat jaded. He foimd that cheese

disagreed horribly with the leaves, turning them black, and finally killing them.
Finally, he details the useless struggles of a CuraiUo to escape, as thoroughly
 establishing the fiict that the fluid already mentioned is actually secreted, and is
 not the result of the decomposition of the substance which the leaf has seized.

Д I am indebted to Mr. Warner, of Winchester, for pointing out to me that the seat of

eensitiveness in the leaves of Bionaa was discovered thirty years earlier than this by

Sydenliam Edwards, the botanical draughtsman. The fact is stated (1804) in tlie de-

scription of plate 785 in the twentieth volume of the ' Botanical Magazine,' then edited

--by Dr. Curtis's English namesake. I quote Curtis's remarks: "These small spines are

mentioned and figured by Ellis, and supposed by him to assist in destroying the entrapped

animal                                 but  that  tliey are  the  only  irritable  points,  and  that any other  part  of the leaf
                                    ;

may be touched with impunity, was discovered by our draughtsman, Mr. Edwards, several

years ago, when taking a sketch of the plant flowering at Mr. Liptrap's, Mile End, and

has since been repeatedly confirmed. The same observation was made, without knowing

it had been previously noticed, by our friend Mr. Charles Konig."

This Curculio being of a resolute uatiu-e, attempted to eat his way out ; " when
discovered he was still ali^e, and had made a small hole through the side of the
leaf, but was evidently becoming very weak. On opening the leaf, the fluid was
found in considerable quantity around him, and was without doubt gradually over-
coming him. The leaf being again allowed to close upon him, he soon died " *.

   At the Meeting of this Association last year. Dr. Burdon Sanderson made a
communication, which, from its remarkable character, was well worthy of the
singular history of this plant ; one by no means closed yet, but in which his obser-
vations will head a most interesting chapter. It is a generalization (now almost a
household word) that all living things have a common bond of union in a sub-
st.ince (always present where life manifests itself) which imderlies all their details
of structure. This is called protoplasm. One of its most distinctive properties is
its aptitude to contract ; and when in any given organism the particles of proto-

plasm are so ai-ranged that they act as it were in concert, they produce a cumulative
effect which is very manifest in its results. Such a manifestation is found in the

contraction of muscle ; and such a manifestation we possibly have also in the con-

traction of the leaf of Dioncca.

    T!ie contraction of muscle is well loiown to be accompanied by certain electrical

phenomena. When we place a fragment of muscle in coimexion with a delicate

gah anometer, we find that between the outside surface and a cut sm'face there is a

Nowdcfiuite cm-rent, due to what is called the electromotive force of the muscle.

when the muscle is made to contract this electromotive force momentarily dis-
appears. The needle of the galvanometer, deflected before, swings back towards
the point of rest ; there is what is called a negative variation. All students of the

vegetable side of organized nature were astonished to hear from Dr. Sanderson that

experiments which he had made proved to demonstration that when a leaf of
Biontea contracts, the efiects produced are precisely similar to those which occiu-

when muscle contracts f.
   Not merely, then, are the phenomena of digestion in this wonderful ^lant like

those of animals, but the phenomena of contractility agi-ee with those ot animals

 also.

   Not confined to a single district in the New World, but distributed over the

--temperate parts of both hemispheres, in sandy and marshy places, are the curious

plants called Sundews the species of the genus Drosera. They are now known to
be near congeners of Dioncea, a fact which was little more than guessed at when
the cm-ious habits which I am about to describe were first discovered.

    Within a yeai- of each other two persons (one an Englishman, the other a
 German) observed that the curious hairs which everyone notices on the leaf of
 Droserci were sensitive. This is the account which Mr. Gardom, a Derbyshire

--botanist, gives of what his friend Mr. Whateley, " an eminent London surgeon " J,

 made out in 1780 : " On inspecting some of the contracted leaves we observed a

 small insect or fly very closely imprisoned therein, which occasioned some astonish-

 ment as to how it happened to get into so confined a situation. Afterwards, on

 Mr. AVhateley's centncally pressing with a pin other leaves yet in their natmal and

 expanded form, we observed a remarkable sudden and elastic spring of the leaves,

 so as to become inverted upwards and, as it were, encircling the pin, which evi-
 dently showed the method by which the fly came into its embarrassing situation "Д.
 This must have been an accoxmt given from memory, and represents tlie movement
 of the hairs as much more r.apid than it really is.

     In July of the preceding year (though the account was not published till two
 years afterwards) Eolh, in Germany, had remarked in Brosera rottmdifolia and
 longifolia " that many leaves were folded together from the point towards the base,
 and that all the hairs were bent like a bow, but that there was no apparent change

--ou tlie leaf-stalk." Upon opening: these leaves, lie says : " I foimd in each a dead

insect 5 hence I imagined tliat this plant, which has some resemhlance to the
Dwiitea nmscijnda, might also have a similar moving power."

" With a pair of pliers I placed an ant upon the middle of the leaf of Z). rotuncU-

folia, but not so as to disturb the plant. The ant endeavoured to escape, but was

held fast by the clammy juice at the points of the hairs, which was drawn out by

its feet into fine threads. In some minutes the short hairs on the disk of the leaf

began to bend, then the long hairs, and laid themselves upon the insect. After a

while the leaf began to bend, and in some hours the end of the leaf .was so bent

inwards as to touch the base. The ant died in fifteen minutes, which was before

all the hairs had bent themselves " *.

These facts, established nearly a centmy ago by the testimony of independent

observers, have up to the present time been almost ignored ; and Tr6cul t, writing

in 1855, even thought that the facts were not true.

 --More recently, however, they have been repeatedly verified : in Germany by

Nitschke, in 1860 1 ; in America by a lady, Mrs. Treat, of New Jersey, in 1871 Д ;
in this country by Mr. Darwin, and" also by Mr. A. W. Bennett ||.

   To Mr. Darwin, who for some yeai-s past has had the subject imder investigation,

we are indebted, not merely for the complete confirmation of the facts attested by

the earliest observers, but also for some additions to those facts, which are

extremely important. The whole investigation still awaits publication at his hands

but some of the points which were established have been announced by Professor

Asa Gray in America, to whom Mr. Darwin had commimicated them Д. He foimd

that the hairs ou the leaf of Drosera responded to a piece of muscle or other animal

su1)stance, while to any particle of inorganic matter they acted less eificiently, and

the periods of subsequent reexpansion were vsddely difiereut. To minute fragments

of carbonate of ammonia they were more responsive.

The residts of Mrs. Treat's experiments I will give in her own words :

" Pifteen minutes past ten Iplaced bits of raw beef on some of the most vigorous

leaves of Drosera lonr/ifolia. Ten minutes past twelve two of the leaves had folded

around tlie beef, hiding it from sight. Half-past eleven on the same day, I placed

living flies on the leases of D. longifolia. At twehe o'clock and forty-eight

minutes one of the leaves had folded entirely around its victim, and the other

lea-\-es had partially folded, and the flies had ceased to struggle. By half-past two

four leaves had each folded aroimd a fly. The leaf folds from the apex to the

petiole, after the manner of its vernation. I tried mineral substances, bits of dry

chalk, magnesia, and pebbles. In twenty-four hours neither the leaves nor the

bristles had made any move in clasping these articles. I wet a piece of chalk in

water, and in less than an horn- the bristles were cur\-ing about it, but soon unfolded

again, leaving the chalk fi-ee on the blade of the leaf."

Time will not allow me to enter into frnther details with respect to Dioncea and

Drosera. The repeated testimony of various obseiTers spread over a century,

though at no time warmly received, must, I think, go a long v/ay tovrards satisfying

you that in this small family of the Droseracece we have plants which, in the first

place, captiu'e animals for pui-poses of food ; and, in the second, digest and dissohe

them by means of a fluid which is pom-ed out for the  purpose                             and, thirdly,  absorb
                                                                                       ;

the solution of animal matter which is so produced.

Before the investigations of Mr. Darwin had led other persons to work at the

.subject, the meaning of these phenomena was very little appreciated. Only a few

years ago, Duchartre, a French physiological botanist, after mentioning the views

cf Ellis and Cm-tis with respect to Dioncea, expressed his opinion that the idea

that its leaves absorbed dissolved animal substances was too evidently in disagree-

ment with oxu- knowledge of the function of leaves, and of the whole course of

vegetable nutrition, to deserve being seriously discussed^.

Terhaps if tHe Ih-os0-ace^ were an isolated case of a group of plants exhibiting

propensities of this kind, there might be some reason for such a criticism. But I
Wethink I shall be able to show j'ou that tliis is by no means Ihc case.
                                                                          have

now reason to believe that there are many instances of these carnivorous Iiiibits in

different parts of the vegetable kingdom, and among plants which have nothing

else in common.

   As another illustration I will take the veiy curious group of Pitcher-plants .

peculiar to the New World. And here also I think we shall find it most conve-

nient to follow the historical order in the facts.

                                                     Sarracenia.

    The genus Sarracenia consists of eight species, all similar in habit, and all natives
 of the eastern States of North America, where they ai-e foimd more especially^ in
 bogs, and even in places covered with shallow water. Their leaves, which give
 them a character entirely theu" own, are pitcher-sliaped or trumpet-like, and are
 collected in tufts springing immediately from the ground ; and they send up at the
 flowering-season one or more slender stems bearing each a solitary flower. This

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ^

 has a singular aspect, due to a great extent to the umbrella-like expansion in
 which the style terminates ; the shape of this, or perhaps of the whole flower,

 caused the first English settlers to give to the plant the name of Side-saddle

 flower*.

    Sarracenia jmrpurea is the best Imown species. About ten years ago it enjoyed
 an evanescent notoriety, from the fact that its rootstock was proposed as a remedy
 for small-pox. It is found from Newfoundland southward to Florida, and is fairly
 hardy under open air cultivation in the British Isles. At the commencement of the
 seventeenth century, Clusius published a figiu-e of it, from a sketch which found
 its way to Lisbon and thence to Paris t- Thirty years later Johnson copied this in
 his edition of Gerard's ' Herbal,' hoping " that some or other that travel into foreign
 parts may find this elegant plant, and know it by this small expression, and bring

Ait home with them, so that we may come to a perfecter knowledge thereof" J.

 few years afterwai-ds this wish was gi-atified. John Tradescant the younger found
 the plant in Virginia, and succeeded in bringing it home alive to England Д. It
 was also sent to Paris from Quebec by Dr. Sarrazin, whose memory has been com-

 memorated in the name of the genus by Tom-nefortl].
    The first fact which was observed about the pitchers was, that when they gi-ew

 they contained water. But the next fact which was recorded about them was
 cm-iously mythical. Perhaps Morrison, who is responsible for it, had no favoiu-able
 opportunities of studying them, for he declares them to be, what is by no means

 really the case, intolerant of cultivation (" respuere cultmam videntiir "). He speaks

 of tlie lid, which in all the species is tolerably rigidly fixed, as being furnished by
 providence with a hinge 5[. This idea was adopted by Linnseus**, and somewhat

 amplified by succeeding writers, who declared that in dry weather the lid closed
 over tlie mouth, and checked the loss of water by evaporation. Catesby, in his

 fine work on the Natm-al History of Carolina, supposed that these water-receptacles
  might " serve as an asylum or secure retreat for numerous insects, from frogs and
 other animals which feed on them "ft ; and others followed Linnfeus in regarding

 --the pitchers as reservoirs for birds and other animals, more especially in times of

 drought "praobet aquam sitientibus avicidis"tJ.
     The superficial teleology of the last ceutmy was easily satisfied, without looking

 far for explanations ; but it is just worth while pausing for a moment to obser\'e

tliat, althougli Linufeiis had no materials for making any real investigation as to

the purpose of the pitchers of Sarracenias, he rery sagaciously anticipated the

--modern views as to their affinities. They are now regarded as very near allies of

Papaveracece precisely the position whicli Linnaeus assigned to them in his frag-

mentary attempt at a true natural classification *. And, besides this, he also sug-

gested the analogy which, improhable as it may seem at first sight, has been worked

out in detail by I3aiIlon between the leaves of Sarracenia and water-lilies. Lin-

naeus seems to have supposed that Sarracenia was originally aquatic in its habits,

that it had Nym2ihcea-\mQ leaves, and tliat when it took to a terrestrial life its

--leaves became hollowed out, to contain the water in which they could no longer

floatt in fact he sliowed himself to be an evolutionist of the true Darwinian type.

   Catesby's suggestion was a very infelicitous one. The insects which visit these
Elants may find in them a retreat, but it is one from which they never return,

jinnseus's correspondent Collinson remarked, in one of his letters, that " many poor

insects lose their lives by being drowned in these cisterns of water " J ; but William
Bartram, the son of the botanist, seems to have been the first to have put on record,

at tlie end of the last century, the fact that Sarracenias catch insects and put them
to death in the wholesale way that they do Д.

  Before stopping to consider how this is actually achieved, I will carry the history

a little further.

In the two species in which the mouth is unprotected by the lid it coiild not be

doubted that a part, at any rate, of tlie contained fluid was supplied by rain but
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

in Sarracenia variolaris, in which the lid closes over tlie mouth, so that rain cannot

readily enter it, there is no doubt that a fluid is secreted at the bottom of the

pitchers,_which probably has a digestive function. William Bartram, in the pre-

face to his ' Travels,' described this fluid ; but he was mistaken in supposing that it

acted as a liu-e. There is a sugary secretion which attracts insects, but this is only

foimd at the uj)per part of the tube. Bartram, however, must be credited with the

suggestion, which he, however, only put forward doubtfully, that the insects were

dissolved in the fluid, and then became available for the'alimentation of the plants.

Sir J, E. Smith, who published a figure and description of Sarracenia vartolaris,

noticed that it secreted fluid, but was content to suppose that it was merely the

gaseous products of the decomposition of insects that subserved the processes of

vegetation ||. In 1829, however, thirty years after Bartram's book, Burnett wrote

a paper containing a good many original ideas expressed in a somewhat quaint

fashion, in which he very strongly insisted on the existence of a true digestive

process in the case of Sarracenia, analogous to that which takes place in the

stomach of an animal ^.

Our knowledge of the habits of Sarracenia variolaris is now pretty complete,

owing to the observations of two South Carolina physicians. One of them. Dr.

Macbride, made his observations half a century ago, but they had, till quite

recently, completely fallen into oblivion. He devoted himself to the task of
ascertaining why it was that Sarracenia variolaris was A-isited by flies, and how it

was that it captured them. This is what he ascertained :

" The cause which attracts flies is e-vidently a viscid substance, resembling honey,

secreted by or exuding from the internal surface of the tube. From the margin,

where it commences. It does not extend lower than one fourth of an inch. The

falling of the insect as soon as it enters the tube is wholly attributable to the
downward or inverted position of the hairs of the internal surface of tlie leaf. At

the bottom of the tube split open, the hairs are plainly discernible, pointing down-

wards                           as the eye  ranges  upward  they gradually become  shorter and  attenuated,
                             ;

till at pr just below the surface covered by the bait they are no longer perceptible

to the naked eye, nor to the most delicate touch. It is here that the fly cannot

take a hold sufficiently strong to support itself, but falls " **,

Dr. Mellichamp, who is now resident in the district in which Dr, ilacbride

made his observations, has added a good many particulars to cm- knowledge. He

Hefirst investigated tlie fluid which is secreted at the bottom of the tubes.                   satis-

fied himself that it was really |secreted, and describes it as mucilaginous, but

leaving in the mouth a peculiar astringency. He compared the action of this fluid

with that of distilled water on pieces of fresh venison, and found that after fifteen

hours the fluid had produced most change, and also most smell ; he therefore con-

cluded that  as the  leaves when                          stuffed  with  insects  become  most  disgusting  in
                                                       \

odour, we have to do, not with a true digestion, but with an accelerated decom-

position. Although he did not attribute any true digestive power to the fluid

secreted by the pitchers, he foimd that it had a remarkable anaesthetic effect upon

flies immersed in it. He remarked that " a fly whea thrown into water is very

apt to escape, as the fliud seems to run from its wings," but it never escaped from

the <SФrracmtФ-secretion. About half a minute after being thrown in, the fly

became to all appearance dead, though if removed it gradually recovered in from

half an hour to an hour. According to Dr. Mellichamp, the sugary lure discovered

by Dr. Macbride at the mouth of the pitchers is not foimd on either the yoimg

ones of one season, nor the older ones of the previous year. He found, however,

that about May it could be detected without difficulty ; and, more wonderful still,

that there is a honey-baited pathway leading du-ectly from the ground to the

mouth, along the broad wing of the pitcher, up which insects are led to their

destruction *.

From these narratives it is evident that there are two very different types of

pitcher in Sarracema, and an examination of the species shows that there must

probably be three. These may be primarily classified into those with the mouth

open and lid erect, and which consequently receive the rain-water in more or less

abundance ; and those with the mouth closed by the lid, into which rain can hardly,

if at all, find ingi-ess.

   To the first of these belongs the well-known S. purpurea, with inclined pitchers

and a lid so disposed as to direct all the rain that falls upon it into the pitcher

also S.Jlava, rubra, and Druimnondii, all with erect pitchers and vertical lids. In

these three the lid in a young state arches over the mouth, and in an old state

stands nearly erect, and has the sides so reflected that the rain which falls on its
upper surface is guided down the outside of tlie back of the pitcher, as if to prevent

the flooding of the latter.

   To the second group belong S. jisUtacina and -S". vanolaris.
   The tissues of the internal surfaces of the pitchers are singularly beautiful. They
have been described in one species only, S. purpurea, by August Vogl f ; but from
this all the other species which I have examined differ materially. Beginning

fi'om the upper part of the pitcher, there are four surfaces, characterized by ditt'erent
tissues, which 1 shall name and define as follows :

   1. An attractive sm-face, occupying the inner surface of the lid, which possesses
stomata, and (in common with the mouth of the pitcher) with minute honey-

secreting glands ; it is further often more highly coloured than any other part of

the pitcher, in order to attract insects to the honey.

  A2. conducting surface, which is opaque, formed of glassy cells, which are pro-

duced into detiexed, short, conical processes. These processes, overlapping like

the tiles of a house, form a surface down which an insect slips, and affords no foot-
hold to an insect attempting to crawl up again.

  A3. glandular surface (seen in S. purpurea), which occupies a considerable

portion of the cavity of the pitcher below the conducting surface. It is formed of
a layer of epidermis with sinuous cells, and is studded with glands; and being
smooth and polished, this too affords no foothold for escaping insects.

  A4. detentive sm-face, which occupies the lower part of the pitcher, in some cases

for nearly its whole length. It possesses no cuticle, and is studded with deflexed,
rigid, glass-like, needle-formed hairs, which further converge towards the axis of

tlie diminisliiug cavity ; so that an insect, if once amongst tliem, is effectually de-
tained, and its struggles have no other result than to wedge it lower and more

firmly in the pitcher.

  Now it is a very cm-ious thing that in S. purpurea, which has an open pitcher

so formed as to receive and retain a maximum of rain, no honey-secretion has

hitherto been found, nor has any water been seen to be secreted in the pitcher ; it

is further the only species in Avhich (as stated above) I have found a special glan-

dulaj surface, and in which no glands occur on the deteutive surface. This concm'-

rence of circumstances suggests the possibility of this plant either ha\'ing no proper
secretion of its own, or only giving it out after the pitcher has been filled with rain-

water.

   In S. Jlava, which has open-mouthed pitchers and no special glandular sm-face,
I find glands in the upper portion of the detentive smface, amongst the hairs, but
not in the middle or lower part of the same surface. It is known that S. Jlava

secretes fluid, but under what precise conditions 1 am not aware. I have foimd
none but what may have been accidentally introduced in the few cultivated speci-

mens which I have examined, either in the full-gi-o\vn state or in the half-grown,
when the lid arches over the pitcher. I find the honey in these as described by the

American observers, and honey-secreting glands on the edge of the wing of the

pitcher, together with similar glands on the outer surface of the pitcher, as seen by

Vogl in S. purpurea.
   Of the pitchers with closed mouths, I have examined those of S. variolaris onlj',

whose tissues closely resemble those of S. Jlava. That it secretes a fluid noxious to
insects there is no doubt, though in the specimens I examined I found none.

   There is obviously thus much still to be learned with regard to Sarracenia, and

I hope that American botanists will apply themselves to this tash. It is not pro-

bable that three pitchers so differently constructed as' those of S. Jlava, purpurea,

and variolaris, and presentiug such differences in their tissues, should act .simi-

larly. The fact that insects normally become decomposed in the fluid of all, would

suggest the probability that they all feed  on  the products of decomposition                                                                                                                   but as
                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

--yet we are absolutely ig-norant whether the glands within the pitchers are secretive

or absorptive, or both if secretive, whether they secrete water or a solvent ; and

if absorptive, whether they absorb animal matter or the products of decomposition.

It is quite likely that just as the saccharine exudation only makes its ajipearance

during one particular period in the life of the pitcher, so the digestive functions
Wemay also be only of short duration.
                                            should be prepared for this from the case

of the Dioncctt, the leaves of which cease after a time to be fit for absorption, and

become less sensitive. It is quite certain that the insects which go on accumulating

in the pitchers of San-acenias must be far in excess of its needs for any legitimate

process of digestion. They become decomposed ; and various insects, too wary to

be entrapped themselves, seem habitually to di'op their eggs into the open mouths

of the pitchers, to take advantage of the accumulation of food *. The old pitchers

are consequently foimd to contain living larvte and maggots, a sufficient proof that

the original properties of the fluid which they secreted must have become exhausted t;

and Barton tells us that various insectivorous birds slit open the pitchers with their

beaks to get at the contents J. This was probably the origin of Linnfeus's state-
ment, that the pitchers supplied birds with water.

The pitchers finally decay, and part, at any rate, of their contents must supply

some nutriment to the plant by fertilizing the groimd in which it grows.

bution, being found at An elevation of 5000 feet on the Sierra Nevada of California,

trumpet-sliaped tubes, with very oblique open mouths, the dorsal lip of which is
drawn out iuto a long, sleuder, arching, scarlet hood, that hardly closes the mouth.
The slight twist in the tube causes these mouths to point in various directions, and

they entrap very small insects only. Before arriving at a state of maturity the

plant bears much larger, suberect pitchers, also twisted, with the lip produced into

a large inflated hood, that completely arches over a very small entrance to the

Acavity of the pitcher.  singular orange-rod, flabby, two-lobed organ hangs from

the end of the hood, right iu front of the entrance, which, as I was informed last

week by letter from Professor Asa Gray, is smeared with honey on its inner surface.
These pitchers are crammed with large insects, especially moths, which decompose
in them, and result in a putrid mass. I have no information of water being found

in its pitchers iu its native country, but have myself found a slight acid secretion

in the 3''oimg states of both forms of pitcher.

   The tissues of the inner surfaces of the pitchers of both the young and old plant

I find to be very similar to those of Sarracenia variolaris and S.Jlava.

Looking at a flowering specimen of Darlhuitonia, I was struck with a remarkable

analogy between the arrangement and colouring of the parts of the leaf .and of the

flower. The petals are as highly coloured as the flap of the pitcher, and between

each pair of petals is a hole (formed by a notch in the opposed margins of each)

leading to the stamens and stigma. Turning to the pitclier, the relation of its flap

to its entrance is somewhat similar. Now we Imow that coloured petals are spe-

eitilly attractive organs, and that the object of their coloiu- is to bring insects to
feed on the pollen or nectar, and in this case, by means of the hole, to fertilize the
flower ; and that the object of the flap and its sugar is also to attract insects, but
with a A'ery different result, cannot be doubted. It is hence conceivable that this
marvellous pLant lures insects to its flowers for one object, and feeds them while it

uses them to fertilize itself, and that, this accomplished, some of its benefactors are

thereafter Im-ed to its pitchers for the sake of feeding itself

   But to return from mere conjecture to scientific earnest, I cannot dismiss Dar-

UiH/tonia without pointing out to you what appears to me a most ciu'ious point in

its history ; which is, that the change from the slender, tubular, open-mouthed, to
the inflated closed-mouthed pitchers is, in all the specimens which I have examined,

absolutely sudden in the indi\'idual plant. I find no pitchers in an intermediate

stage of development. This, a matter of no little significance in itself, derives ad-

ditional interest from the fact that the young pitchers to a certain degree represent

those of the Sarracenias with open mouths and erect lids, and the old pitchers
those of the Sarracenias with closed mouths aud globose lids. The combination of

representative characters in an outlying species of a small order cannot but be re-

gai'ded as a marvellouslj^ significant fact in the view of those morphologists who

hold the doctrine of evolution.

                                    Nepenthks.

The genus Nepenthes consists of upwards of 30 species of climbing half shrubbj'

plants, natives of the hotter pai'ts of the Asiatic Archipelago from Borneo to Cey-

lon, witli a few outlying species iu New Caledonia, iu Tropical Australia, and in

the Seychelle Islands on tlie African coast. Its pitchers ai'e abundantly produced,

especially during the yoimger state of the plants. They present very considerable

modifications of form aud external structure, and vary greatly in size, from little

more than an  inch  to  almost   a  foot  in  length                             one species,  indeed, which I have
                                                                              ;

here from the mountains of Borneo, has pitchers which, including the lid, measure

a foot aud a half, aud its capacious bowl is large enough to di-own a small qua-

druped or bird.

The structure of the pitcher of Nepenthes is less complicated ou the whole than

that of Sarracenia, though some of its tissues are much more highly specialized.

The pitcher itself is here not a transformed leaf, as in Sairacenia, nor is it a trans-

formed leaf-blade, like that of Diona-a, but an appendage of the leaf developed at

its tip, and answers to a water-secreting gland that may be fcen terminating the

mid-rib of the leaf of certain plants. It is furuislied with a sialic, often a very long

one, which, in the case of pitchers formed on leaves high up the stem, has (before

the fidl development of the pitcher) the power of twisting like a tendril round

neighboiu'ing objects, and thus aiding the plant in climbing, sometimes to a great

height, in the forest.

In most species the pitchers are of two forms, one appertaining to the young, the

other to the old state of the plant, the transition from one form to the other being

gradual.  Those of the yoimg state  are  shorter and more inflated                                                                                                 they have broad
                                                                                                                                                                ;

fringed longitudinal wings on the outside, which are probably guides to lead insects

to the mouth ; the lid is smaller and more open, and the whole interior siu'face is

covered with secreting-glands. Being formed near the root of the plant, these

pitchers often rest on the ground ; and in species which do not form leaves near the

root, they are sometimes suspended from stalks which may be fully a yard long,

and which bring them to the ground. In the older state of the plant the pitchers

are usually much longer, narrower, and less inflated, trumpet-sliaped, or even coni-

cal ; the wings also are narrower, less fringed, or almost absent. The lid is larger
and slants over the mouth, and only the lower part of the pitcher is covered with

secreting-glands, the upper part presenting a tissue analogous to the conducting-

tissue of Sarracenia, but very different anatomically. The difference in structure of

these two forms of pitcher, if considered in reference to their different positions on

the plant, forces the conclusion on the mind, that the one form is intended for

ground game, the other for winged game. In all cases the mouth of the pitcher

--is furnished with a thickened corrugated rim, which series three pm-poses it

strengthens the mouth and keeps it distended, it secretes honey (at least in all

the species I have examined under cultivation, for I do not find that any other

observer has noticed the secretion of honey by Nepenthes), and it is in various spe-

cies developed into a funnel-shaped tube that descends into the pitcher and prevents

the escape of insects, or into a row of incm-ved liooks that are in some cases strong
enough to retain a small bird, should it, when in search of water or insects, thrust

its body beyond a certain length into the pitcher.

 --In the interior of the pitcher of Nepenthes there are three princip.al surfaces an

attractive, conductive, and a secretive siuface ; the detentive surface of Sarracenia

being represented by the fliud secretion, vidiich is here invariably present at all

stages of gi-owth of the pitcher.

The attractive surfaces of Nepenthes are two, those, namely, of the rim of the

pitcher and of the under surface of the lid, which is pi-ovided in almost every

species with honey-secreting glands, often in great abundance. These glands

consist of masses of colls, each imbedded in a cavity of the tissue of the lid and

encircled by a guard-ring of glass-like cellular tissue. As in Sarracetiia, the lid

and mouth of the pitcher are more higlily coloured than any other part, with the

view of attracting insects to their honey. It is a singular fact that the only species

known to me that wants these honey-glands on the lid is the N. ampullaria, whose

lid, unlike that of the other species, is thrown back horizontally. The secretion of

honey on a lid so placed would tend to lure insects away from the pitcher instead

of into it.

   From the mouth to a variable distance down the pitcher is an opaque glaucous

"surface, resembling in coloiu* and appearance the glandular surface of Sarracenia,

and like it affording no foothold to insects, but otherwise wholly different ; it is

formed of a fine network of cells, covered with a glass-like cuticle, and studded

with minute reniform transverse excrescences.

The rest of the pitcher is entirely occupied with the secreti\e surface, which

consists of a cellular floor crowded with circular glands in inconceivable numbers.

Each gland precisely resembles a honey-gland of the lid, and is contained in a

pocket of the same nature, but semicircidar, with the moiitli downwards, so that

the secreted fluid all falls to the bottom of the pitcher. In Nepenthes Raffiesiana

three thousand such glands occur on a square inch of the inner sm'face of tlie

pitcher. I have ascertained that, as was indeed to be expected, they secrete the

fluid which is contained in the bottom of the pitcher before this opens, and that

the fluid is always acid.

   The fluid, though invariably present, occupies a comparatively small portion of

the secretive surface of the pitcher. When the fluid is emptied out of a fully formed

pitcher that has not recei\-ed animal matter, it collects again, but in comparatively

very small quantities ; and the formation goes on for many days, and to some

exteut, even after the pitcher has been removed from the plant. I do not find that

placing inorganic substances in the fluid causes an increased secretion, but I have
twice observed a considerable increase of fluid in pitchers after putting animal

matter in the fluid.

   To test the digestive powers of Nepenthes I have closely followed Mr. Darwin's
treatment of Dionma and Drosera, employing cubes of boiled white of &Дg, raw
meat, hbrine, and cartilage. lu all cases the action is most evident, in some sur-

prising. After twenty-fom* hours' immersion the edges of the cubes of white of egg

are eaten away and the sm-faces gelatinized. Fragments of meat are rapidly re-

duced                           and pieces of fibrine weighing several grains dissolve  and totally disappear
                             ;

in two or three days. With cartilage the action is most remarkable of all ; lumps

of this weighing eight and ten grains are half gelatinized in twenty-four hours, and

in three days the whole mass is greatly diminished, and reduced to a clear trans-

parent jelly. After drying some cartilage in the open air for a week, and placing

it in an unopened but fully formed pitcher of N. Raffiesiana, it was acted upon
similai'ly and very little more slowly.

   That this process, which is comparable to digestion, is not wholly due to the

fluid first secreted by the glands, appears to me most probable ; for I find that very

little action takes place in any of the substances placed in the fluid drawn from

pitchers and put in glass tubes ; nor has any followed after six days' immersion of
cartilage or fibrine in pitchers of N. ampullaria placed in a cold room, whilst on

transferring the cartilage from the pitcher of N. atnpuUaria in the cold room to one

of N. Rafflesiana in the stove it was immediately acted upon. Comparing the

behaviour of fibrine, meat, and cartilage placed in tubes of Nepentlies-^mA, with

that in tubes of distilled water, I observed that their disintegration is three times

more rapid in the fluid ; but this disintegration is wholly different from that
which follows the immersion of these substances in the fluid of the pitcher of a

living plant.

                                small portions of meat,  \-2 grains, all  seems to be   absorbed
--In the case of                                                                                                                  ;  but

with 8-10 grains of cartilage it is not so a certain portion disappears, the rest

remains as a transparent jelly, and finally becomes putrid, but not till after many

days. Insects appear to be acted upon somewhat difierently ; for after several days'

immersion of a large piece of cartilage I found that a good-sized cockroach, which

had followed the cartilage and was drowned for his temerity, in two days became
putrid. After removing the cockroach the cartilage remained inodorous for many
days. In this case no doubt the antiseptic fluid had permeated the tissue of the
cartilage, whilst enough did not remain to penetrate the chitinous hard covering of
the insect, which consequently decomposed.

In the case of cartilage placed in fluid taken from the pitcher, it becomes putrid,

but not so soon as if placed in distilled water.

   From the above observations it woidd appear probable that a substance acting as

pepsiue does is given off from the inner wall of the pitcher, but chiefly after placing

animal matter in the acid fluid ; but whether this active agent flows from the glands,
or from the cellular tissue in which they are imbedded, I have no evidence to show.

   I have here not alluded to the action of these animal matters in the cells of the
glands, which, as has been observed by Mr. Darwin in Drosera, produces remark-
able changes in their protoplasm, ending in their discoloration. Not only is
there aggi'Cgation of the protoplasm in the gland-cells, but the walls of the cells
themselves become discoloured, and the glandular sm'face of the pitcher that at
first was of a uniform green, becomes covered with innumerable brown specks
(which are the discoloiu-ed glands). After the function of the glands is exhausted,

the fluid evaporates and the pitcher slowly withers.

  At this stage I am obliged to leave this interesting investigation. That Xepmi-

thes possesses a tnie digestive process, such as has been proved in the case of Drosm'n,

DioiKsa, and Pinc/meula, cannot be doubted. This process, however, takes place in

a fluid which deprives us of the power of following it further by direct observation.

We cannot here witness the pom-ing out of the digestive principU; we must assume

its presence and natm-e from the beha^иiour of the animal matter placed in the fluid

in the pitcher. From certain characters of the cellular tissue of the interior walls

amof the pitcher, I             disposed to think that it takes little pai-t in the processes of

either digestion or assimilation, and that these, as well as the pouring out of the
acid fluid, are all functions of the glands.

   In what I have said, I have described the most striking instances of plants which
seem to invert the order of nature, and to draw their nutriment (in part at least)
from the animal kingdom, which it is often held to he the function of the vegetable

kingdom to sustain.
    I mio-ht have added some additional cases to those I have already dwelt iipon.

Probahlv, too, there are others still unknown to science, or whose habits have not

yet been detected. Delpiuo, for example, has suggested that a plant first described

--by mvself from Tierra del Fuego Caltha dioncecefolia* is so analogous in the

structure of its leaves to Dionaa, that it is difficult to resist the conviction that its
sti-ucture also is adapted for the captiu-e of small insects 1".

   But the problem that forces itself upon our attention is, how does it come to pass

that these singular aberrations fi-om the otherwise uniform order of vegetable

nutrition make their appearance in remote parts of the vegetable kingdom ? why are
they not more frequent ? and how were such extraordinary habits brought about or
con'ti-acted ? At first sight the perplexity is not diminished by considering (as we
may do for a moment) the natm-e of ordinary vegetable nutrition. Vegetation, as

--we see it everywhere, is distinguished by its green colour, which we know depends

 on a peculiar substance called chlorophyl a substance which has the singular
 property of attracting to itself the carbonic acid gas which is present in minute
 quantities in the atmosphere, of partly decomposing it so far as to set free a portion
 of its oxygen, and of recombining it with the elements of water, to form those sub-
 stances, "such as starch, cellulose, and sugar, out of which the fi-amework of the
 plant is constructed. But, besides these processes, the roots take up certain matters

 from the soil. Nitrogen forms nearly fovu- fifths of the air we breathe, yet plants
 can possess themselves of none of it in the fi'ee uncombined state. They withdraw
 nitrates and salts of ammonia in minute quantities from the groimd, and fi-om these

 they build up with starch, or some analogous material, albuminoids or protein
 compoimds, necessary for the sustentation and growth of protoplasm.

    At first sight nothing can be more imlilic this than a Dioncea or a Nepenthes
 capturing insects, pouring out a digestive fluid upon them, and absorbing the albu-

 minoids of the animal, in a form probably directly capable of appropriation for its

 own nutrition. Yet there is something not altogether wanting in analogy in the
 case of the most regularly constituted plants. The seed of the castor-oil plant, for

 example, contains, besides the embryo seedling, a mass of cellular tissue or endo-
 sperm filled with highly nutritive substances. The seedling lies between masses of
 this and is in contact with it ; and as the warmth and moisture of germination set
 up changes which bring about the liquefaction of the contents of the endosperm,
 and the embryo absorbs them, it grows in so doing, and at last, having taken up all
 it can from the exhausted endosperm, develops chlorophyl in its cotyledons imder

 the influence of light, and relies on its own resoiu-ces.

   A large muniber of plants, then, in their young condition boiTow their nuli-itive

 compounds ready prepared ; and this is, in effect, what carnivorous plants do, more
 or less, later in life. That this is not merely a fancifid way of regarding the rela-
 tion of the embryo to the endosperm, is proved by the ingenious experiments of Van
 Tieghem, who has succeeded in substituting for the real, an artificial endosperm,
  consisting of appropriate nutritive matters f. Except that the embryo has its food
 given to it in a manner which needs no digestion (a proper concession to its in-
  fantine state), the analogy here with the mature plants wliich feed on organic food

  seems to be complete.

    But we are beginning also to recog^nize the fact that there are a large number of

  flowering plants that pass through their lives witliout ever doiiig a stroke of the
  work that gi-een plants do. These ha^ e been called saprophytes. Monotrojia, the
  curious bird's-nest orchis {Neottia Nidus-avis), Epipor/iiivt, and Coi-allorhiza are
  instances of British plants which nom-ish themselves by absorbing the partiallj'

decomposed materials of other plants in the shady or marsh)' places which they

inhabit. They reconstitute these products of organic и decomposition, and build

them up once more into an organism. It is curious to notice, however, that the

tissues of Neottia still contain chlorophyl in a nascent though useless state, and

that if a plant of it be immersed in boiling water the characteristic green colour

reveals itself*. Epipof/imn and Corallorhiza have lost their proper absorbent

organs ; the}- are destitute of i-oots, and take in their food by the surfaces of their

imdergroimd stem-structures t.
   The absolute difference between plants which absorb and nourish themselves by

the products of the decomposition of plant-structures, and those which make a

Wesimilar use of animal stiiictures, is not very great.                                                  may imagine that plants

accidentally permitted the accumulation of insects in some parts of their structure,

and the practice became developed because it was found to oe useful. It was long

ago suggested that the receptacle formed by the connate leaves of Dipsacus might

be an incipient organ of this kind f ; and though no insectivorous habit has ever been

brought home to that plant, the suggestion is not improbable.

Linnfeus and, more lately, Baillon Д have shown how a pitcher of Sarracenia may
Webe regarded as a modification of a leaf of the Nymphcsa type.
                                                                                                                                        may imagine

such a leaf first becoming hollow, and allowing debris of different kinds to accu-

mulate these would decompose, and a solution would be produced, some of the
                                        ;

constituents of which woidd diffuse themselves into the subjacent plant-tissues.

This is in point of fact absorption ; and we may suppose that in the first instance

(as perhaps still in Sarracenia jiurpurea) the matter absorbed was merely the saline

nutritive products of decomposition, such as ammoniacal salts. The act of di-

gestion (that process by which soluble food is reduced without decomposition to a

soluble form fitted for absorption) was doubtless subsequently acquired.

The secretion, however, of fluids by plants is not an unusual phenomenon. In

many Aroids a small gland at the apex of the leaves secretes fluid, often in consi-

derable quantities                                                                                       and the pitcher of Nepenthes is, as I have shown elsewhere ^,
                                                                                                   || ;

only a gland of this kind enormously developed. May not, therefore, the wonderful

pitchers and carnivorous habit of Nepenthes have both originated by natural selec-

tion out of some such honey-secreting gland as we still find developed near that

Wepart of the pitcher which represents the tip of the leaf ?                                                                            may suppose insects

to have been entangled in the viscid secretion of such a gland, and to have perished

there. Delpino has recorded the fact that the spatlie of Alocasia odora secretes an

acid fluid which destroys the slugs that visit it, and which he believes subserves

its fertilization**. Here any process of nutrition can only be secondary. But

the fluids of plants are in the gTeat majority of cases acid, and when exuded would

be almost certain to bring about some solution in substances with which they came

in contact. Thus the acid secretions of roots were foimd by Sachs ft to corrode

polished marble surfaces with which they came in contact, and thus to favour the

absorption of mineral matter. The subsequent differentiation of the secreting organs

of the pitcher into aqueous, saccharine, and acid would follow, pari passu, with the

evolution of the pitcher itself, according to those mysterious laws which result in the

con-elation of organs and functions throughout the kingdom of Nature, and which, in

my apprehension, transcend in wonder and interest those of the origin of species.

The solution of albuminoid substances requires, however, besides a suitable acid,

the presence of some other albuminoid substance analogous to pepsine. Such sub-

stances, however, are frequent in plants. Besides the well-known diastase, which

--converts the starch of malt into sugar, there are other instances in the synaptase

then, if the fluid secreted hy a plant should prove to possess the ingredients neces-

sary for the digestion of insoluble animal matters.

These remarks will, I hope, lead you to see that though the processes of plant-

nutrition are in general extremely different from those of animal-nutrition, and

involve very simple compounds, yet that the protoplasm of plants is not absolutely

prohibited from availing itself of food such as that by which the protoplasm of

animals is nourished ; under which point of view these phenomena of carnivorous

plants will find their place as one more link in the continuity of nature.

Address to the Department of AnthropoJogy . By Sir William R. Wilde,

    M.D., M.R.I.A., Chevalier of the Order of the Polar Star of Sweden.

I have to thank the Association for having honoured me with the Directorship

of the Anthropological Department of the Biological Section. It will be in the

recollection of some of those I have the honour of addressing, that when this

Association last met in Dublin, in 1857, I had the pleasing duty of conducting a

--large section of some of its most distinguished members to the Western Islands of

Aran off the coast of Galway the last fortified resting-place of one of the earliest

races that occupied this island, and who, with their faces turned to the far West,

may have had some dim notion in their minds (even at the time of their expulsion

from the mainland) of that exodus which was canied out by other means than
man's unaided hand in our own time.

I cannot refrain here from alluding to a personal as well as public loss which I

and the British Association have sustained in the death of one of its most ardent

original promoters and one of its most hard-working officers. Learned in a vast

-- --variety of pursuits unflagging in whatever he took in hand exact in his know-
-- --ledge energetic in his investigations not discursive, but rather chary in his

--friendships, yet always courteous and willing to lend a helping hand to the

beginner (as I and others know) lived and died Professor Phillips, of Oxford.

--and his manufactures, arts, and degrees of intelligence in his different phases of life

Association.

  How am I to treat this vast subject during the short space allowed for the

delivery of an address ? Suppose I were to confine myself to what has been done

during the past year, I might, by carefully culled accounts, present you with the

physical characters, customs, and arts of the Ashantees with whom we have so

lately come in contact ; or, again, I might refer to those discoveries on the

Troad that so vividly bring before us some of the arts and sciences described by

Homer, and particularly those ornaments and utensils that show cultivation of a

peculiar kind in potteiy and metal work, especially of gold, belonging to a very

remote era. I s?iy peculiar, because I think we are too much in the habit of attri-

buting high cultivation in social life, morals, and domestic virtues to those peoples
whose remains present specimens of great metallm-gic skill or a taste for the

ceramic art.

  Concerning the investigations so admirably conducted by Dr. Schliemann, we must

few paltry thousands in aUowiug England to put its sickle into the harvest and

reap some of the golden grain illustrative of the time of Homer and his contem-

poraries, which others may can-y off to enrich the ai-t treasures of countries not

--perhaps so wealthy in their exchequer as the British Empire was not acceded to.

I cannot in passing refrain from alkiding to two of these archfeological researches

so grapliically brought forward by Mr. Gladstone in his critical review of ' Homer's

Place in History,' which appeared in last June's 'Contemporary Review.' In

one of these notices he alludes to the fact of a number of implements and utensils,

found by General Cesnola in Cj'prus, " exhibiting so extensive a use of uncom-

bined copper, and so clear and wide an application of that metal to cutting pur-

poses, as at once to suggest a modification of the theories of those who, in

arranging what may be termed their metallic periods, assume that the age oi

bronze invariably came in immediate succession to the age of stone." And, again,

referring to the gi-eat Find on the Troad, he writes, " The excavations, according

to our present information, present to us copper as the staple material of the im-

plements, utensils, and of the weapons (so far as they were metallic) of the inha-

bitants of Troy ;--so do the poems." No better authority could be adduced on the

latter subject; but if the learned writer had inspected our great collection of

antique metal work in the National Museum of the Eoyal Irish Academy before it

was disarranged, and had he done the author of the ' Descriptive Catalogue ' of these

antiquities (written eighteen years ago) the honour of reading the dissertation on our

--early metallic work, he would' have seen that copper weapons, tools, and implements

were the " forerunners of the mixed metal bronze or brass " in Ireland.

I am not going into the subject of the single or multiple origin of man; nor do

I intend discussing the question of the cave-man, or the race whose early imple-

ments, weapons, and tools are found in the drift.

  Upon the subject of what is termed ''Prehistoric^' I may possess peculiar opi-
nions. What is prehistoric ? Does it mean pre-Adamite ? cr does it refer only to

the times when some scribe wi'ote down, from word of mouth, the bardic tale, the

Wegenealogy or annal, no matter of what era ?      do not know where nor by whom

these annals were first committed to writing, nor what means were taken to alter

them                             but we  possess  what cannot be falsified by the scribe ;  and although styled
                              ;

{)rehistoric, they are fiir more truthfully historic than the writing that no doubt was

argel}' interfered with, and which, if old, now requires a gloss to interpret it. The

grassy mound or circle, the stones erected into a cromleach, the great sepulchral

mound, the cinerary um, the stone weapon or tool, the gi-ain-rubber for triturating

cereal food, the hai-jioon for spearing fish, the copper and bronze tools and weapons,

--and the gold ornaments of the most early tribes, all now are, in their way, far moi'e

truthful than any thing that could have been committed to writing, even if there

were letters in that day. They are litanies in stone, doginata in metal, and ser-

mons preaching from the gi'assy mound.

But how ai"e we to use or apply these early scriptures of history so as to advance

Anthropology and to educate the public mind ? That is a serious question, well

worthy the attention of this Association. One means, at least, is by properly

arranged museums, to which, I am happy to say, the working man may now resort
for recreation and instruction upon almost every day of the week, when his business

permits. I must here say a word upon the suljject of museums. If you would not

--nave museums like what we remember them to have been incongi-uons collec-

tions of all manner of articles, including cracked china, painted or engraved

oyster-shells, heads of New-Zealanders tattooed, ostrich-eggs, and, as Romeo found

in the shop of the apothecary, "an allit^ator stuffed and other skins of ill-shaped

--fishes," you must make soniie sort of archseological arrangement; and it ought to

be upon some definite scheme or plan, not fanciful or incongruous, but historic,

technical, or art-teaching. The educated man can pick out for himself articles that
give him instruction, or that support or militate against his own special theory
but he has come to the inquiry with a skilled eye. The public mind should be

educated by skilled artists, not merely amused by amateur decorators *.

   * The compartment now used as a " reading- room " at the Eoyal Irish Academy was
specially constructed by Government for a Museum from its foundation to its roof, and
was, as all such structures should be, well lighted from the top. It was I who proposed
the extension of the Museum into another room, and the influence of Lord Talbot de Ma-

laliide largely assisted to procure the funds for that object.

                                                                must be cautious

in accepting the absolute words of documents transmitted from these times, such as

those giving descriptions of a memorable light between two heroes, which state
that one of them wore among his defensive armour a mill-stone enveloped in a

silken fabric upon his stomach !

  Now I do not desire to press any special theory of museum arrangement upon

this Meeting, but I do wish to impress upon it the necessity for having some plan

adopted for educational purposes in Antiquarian Collections. I do not care what

that arrangement is, provided it is upon a definite plan ; but except for some special

purpose, or in accordance with the request of the donor, I certainly object to having

placed in immediate contiguity early bronze shields, antique celts and swords,

together with crosiers and crucifixes illustrative of the Christian period.

I care not whether a museum is to be arranged according to the system of mj'

old friend and instructor Thomsen, of Copenhagen, as by the stone, bronze, iron,

--and other "Ages," provided such can be faithfully carried out or whether my own

system of Material and Use may be adopted ; but this I do assert, that in this pre-

sent age of enlightenment some system should be pursued by which the public

would be both interested and instructed. I do not think that any Government

should support a museum that was not properly arranged.

   Instead of entering into the wide domain of Anthropology generally, I shall follow

the example of my predecessor, Dr. Beddoe, regarding Yorkshire, and confine my

remarks to the subject of the early races who peopled Ireland in consecutive order,

their remains stiU existing, and an inquiry as to what vestiges of those different

waves of population remain at the present hour.

To attempt a solution of this question, it is necessary to take a wider area than

that afforded by an island adjoining the north-west of Europe, but which presents

the remarkable peculiarity of having been in all probability the last resting-place of a

section of that great Aryan or Indo-European race which spread from the Euphrates

to the Polar regions.

   In tracing the footprints of man we have, as I have already stated, to consider the

relics he left in the various countries which he trod, the vestiges of his language,

and the physical and psychological characteiistics still attaching to his modern repre-

sentatives. In so doing we must consider the dim traditions, genealogies, heroic

and bardic tales, rhymes, legends, religions, popular superstitions, folk-lore,

romances, and all that description of knowledge which has been handed down from

times denominated Prehistoric to the present day.

These traditions were in process of time embalmed in annals when the art of

writing became known, along with the genealogy, the tale, or historic incident, in

either prose or rhyme, which had been recited by especially instructed and, let me

add, specially gifted orders of people from age to age. So the Assyrian characters

cut or embossed on stone or brick preserved the records of conquests. So the ' Iliad '

and the ' Odyssey ' were no doubt oraUy transmitted long before letter-words were

inscribed upon the bark, the palm-leaf, the papyrus, the waxen tablet, or the vellum.

They were thus kept alive in the minds of the people, and largely helped to pre-

serve the Greek language until it performed one of its greatest duties, nearly nine-

teen centuries ago, in the wide-spread diffusion of the records of Christianity.

There was a time when a large portion of the plains and non-mouutainous parts

of Europe were tangled forests traversed by great livers running generally towards

the south and west. According to Norwegian authorities, the Lapps were the

primeval race on our Continent, and were driven northward by each successive wave

of population that, creeping round the shores of the Caspian, the Black Sea, and the

Mediterranean, or passing out between the hills of Ceuta and Gibraltar (then called

the "Pillars of Hercules "), came along the shores of Spain, Gaul, and Belgium.
  That the skin-clad man with his stone, bone, and wooden weapons and tools, his

shell ornaments and rude unglazed pottery (the primitive nomadic hunter and
fisher) arrived in Ireland and occupied its plains, forests, and fastnesses in that same

state of life in which we find similar primitive races of mankind in the present day,

--here contending with the hear, the wolf, the fox, the osprey, the seal, and the
--otter for his food, as his predecessors did with the aurocli in mid-Eiirope,

have not the slightest doubt. I think the reindeer and the elephant, and pro-
bably the musk-ox, had become extinct before man's arrival in Erinn, and I have

always inclined to the idea that he was not contemporaneous with that great

monarch of the cervine race, the Irish Elk ; but in this opinion, however, I may be

mistaken.

Standing on the coast of Great Britain he could, with the practised eye of the

hunter, have discerned from the Welsh mountains the hills of Erinn ; and he coidd

have clearly seen Donaghadee from Port Patrick.

But whether he came adrift upon a plank or raft, or in a singlestick canoe, is

more than I can even specidate upon. 1 hat there were inhabitants in Ireland at the
time of the arrival of these first recorded colonists I have but little doubt. Whether

these or subsequent races were the men who erected the Lacustrine habitations,

the Pftthlbouten of Switzerland, and their analogues the Cranor/uen of Ireland, or

banqueted in the Kitclien-niiddens of Jutland, requires a further investigation of

their remains.

With these rather lengthened preliminary remarks, which I thought necessary

for the information of strangers, or those not specially acquainted with the subject,

it is now my particular province to tell you something of the early races of the land
we live in, and their representatives still existing among its present population.
With respect to the authenticity of the early chronicles and legends that relate the

--history of these immigrations so much sneered at by one set of inquirers and so

--faithfully believed in by another let me make two obsenations, one chronological

and the other topographical. Our Irish Annals were first committed to writing by

Christian scribes in either Gaelic or Latin, and were not only intermixed with

classic story, but with scriptural incidents, particularly those relating to the dis-

persion of mankind after the deluge. Of a portion of their chronology there can,

however, be little doubt ; for in recording cosmical phenomena, such as eclipses of
the sun or moon, the approach of comets and the like, they scarcely differ by a

year fi'om that great astronomical and chronological work, 'L'Art de verifier les
dntes,^ computed by the French philosophers hundreds of years after those Annals

were last written or transcribed. This synchronism, to say the least of it, is re-

markably confirmative of those very early Irish Annals. It is just possible that

long before the age of alphabetic writing some means by tallies, runes,^ or

other devices may have been invented for fixing the agea of these cosmical

phenomena.

  Now the other incident is of equal authenticity in confirmation of the historical

statement of our earlv records. Long, long before the Christian era it is there

--Asaid that a battle took place on a certain plain in Mayo ; and an incident con-
nected with the fight is thus told :  king or chief was surprised in early morning,

while performing his ablutions at a deep well, by three warriors of the enemy, who

came upon him unawares. He was saved by the prowess of one of his attendants,

who killed his three assailants, and then died upon the spot. Hundreds of years

passed by, the locality around had been cultivated and grazed upon again and

again ; still the valley," the well, the subterranean watercourse with its fairy legends,

the hurliug-field, the cairns, circles, pillar-stones, and other surrounding topogra-

phical features remained. The gallant soldier who laid down his life for his royal

master was buried where he fell ; and as the army (stated to have been thousands

-- --strong) passed by, each man as was the custom of the day threw a pebble on his

grave, then called and still known as "The cairn of the one man." Not long

ago, with the written legend in my hand, and possessing a full knowledge of the

localitv, and accompanied by a few stalwart Connaught men, I proceeded to the

spot, told my incredulous auditory the tale of their ancestors, dug and lifted stone

after stone until we came upon a small chamber under a large flag, wherein we

found deposited a beautifid cinerary urn containing some black earth and frag-

ments of burnt human bones. The septilchre, with its surrounding stone circle,

umstill exists on the battle-field of Moytura Conga, and the decorated  is in the

Museum of the Royal Irish Academy.

It has been objected to our Irish manuscripts that, from the material on

which they were wi'itten, the form of their letters, their philological construction,

and their illuminations, none of them was written earlier than the ninth or tenth

century ; some, indeed, go so far as to say that there is not an Irish MS. later

Nowthan the twelfth or thirteenth century.  granting all that, what does it prove ?

Not that the historic instances recorded were concocted by the scribes of these

times, but that these vellum or paper manuscripts were copied from eai-lier writings

which were founded on anterior materials. That they were interpolated, glossed,

and changed in many instances from centurj'^ to century in process of transcription

from the time they were first committed to writing, is but a repetition of what has

occurred in other countries. But, even in more modern and so-called civilized

times, has not history been falsified to please the pride of a ruler or to pander to

the prejudice of a party ? Where, I would ask, are the early rolls of " The Law ? "

Where are the original manuscripts relating to or after the first century of the

Christian era ? Where, except in Egypt (that gi'eat laud of embalmment) or at

Nineveh, do we find a bit of writing two thousand years old ? Are not learned

artists and philologers even now disputing as to the dates of the Psalter of Utrecht

and the Codex of Upsala ?

  To my surprise Mr. James Fergusson, in discussing the subject of our Irish

--histories, at p. 197 of his valuable book on 'Rude Stone Monuments,' says,

when alluding to the battles of Moytura, " Before the introduction of writing
into a covmtry, how long could so detailed a narrative as that which we possess,

and one so capable of being verified by material evidences on the spot, be handed

down orally as a plain pro.:.e narrative ?" Surely my friend does not deny the

vocal tradition of history by means of memory ; and if he merely objects to the

accounts of the battle of Moytura and other Irish tales from their being in prose,

it is right for him to know that they are 7wf all in prose, but partly in the rhyth-

mical style of the period. The introduction of prose at the time of the use of letters

can be accounted for by the fact that when the Schannaghie or rhymer found

" a hole in the ballad," he supplied the legend in a prose version to the scribe, or

that the scribe shortened the narrative by a prose version of his own.

Passing over, as probably apocryphal, the old tales related in the bardic legends

of the Lady Kaisar and her ships, we come to Parthalon, the great Grecian hero,
who landed in Dublin Bay, and whose cohorts conquered the aborigines, as related

by the annalists. I should not have introduced him, but that there is a remarkable

confirmation of the legend aflbrded by the topographic and antiquarian examina-

tion of the locality. This invader and his followers occupied, it is said, Ben-Eider,

now called the " Hill of Howth," and the " old plain of the valley of the Flocks,"

along the shores of Dublin Bay, styled " the Strand of the Birds," jpassiug all round

from Belscadden to Bray Head ; and who had, no doubt, a " Pale " for themselves

as others had in later times.

  A Thaum or pestilence attacked that people, and they are said to have all died.

Upon the age of this catastrophe, or the numbers who died of it, I cannot specu-

late                      but I believe that when flying from the seacoast and plains to the mountains
                       ;

a large number perished and were buried on the slopes of Tallaght, so called

because it was the Thuum-Lacht where the plague-stricken people were interred, and

where occasionally Kistvaens are turned up containing decorated urns, having

mwithin them incinerated bones. Several of these are still existence ; and when

I stand at the northern end of this gi-eat plain of Dublin, said to have been colonized

by Parthalon, my foot is on his reputed cromleach at Ben-Eider.

Of the Femorians, Nemedians, and other minor invaders we need take no notice,

as they have left nothing after them by which to track their footprints. The

annalists, or at least the transciibers, probably believed that these people all came
direct from the Ark, after resting for a while on Mount Ararat, or that they were
descended direct from Japhet, or from Gog and Magog. Cuthites were not known

here then.

   I will now tell you what has been the result of my own examination of the races

.that migiated to, or are said to have conquered, Ireland.

A pastoral people called Firbolgs, said to be of Greek or Eastern origin, and pro-

bably a branch of that race that, ha-snug passed through Europe or round its shores,

Wearrived in Ireland.                                                           will call them Celts, as I do not know much of the Phoe-

nicians or Carthaginians. They had laws and social institutions, and established

a monarchical government at the far-famed Hill of Tara, about which our early

centres of civilization sprung, and around which we liave now most of those great

pasture-lands which, notwithstanding this island being described as " a marsh satu-
rated with the vapours of the Atlantic " and " surrounded by a melancholy ocean,"

on the shore of which the wretched inhabitant might sit and sigh for the time of

--his exodus and the hour of his exile these plains of Meath that can beat the world

for their fattening qualities, and supply neighbouring countries with their most

admired meats.

I cannot say that the Firbolg was a cultivated man, but I think he was a shep-

herd and an agriculturist. I doubt if he knew any thing, certainly not much, of

metallurgy                                                         but it does  not  follow that  he    was  a mere  savage, no more than  the
                                                     ;

Maories of New Zealand were when we first came in contact with them.

The Firbolgs were a small, straight-haired, swarthy race, who have left a portion

Aof their descendants with us to this very day.                                                              genealogist (their own country-

man resident in Galway about two hundred years ago) described them as dark-

haired, talkative, guileful, strolling, unsteady, и' disturbers of every Council and

Assembly," and " promoters of discord.'' 1 believe they, together with the next

two races about to be described, formed the bulk of our so-called Celtic population

combative, nomadic on opportunity, enduring, litigious, but feudal and faithful to

their chiefs                                                       hard-working      for  a  spurt (as  in  their  annual  English  emigration)
                                                                ;

not thrifty, but, when their immediate wants are supplied, lazy, especially during

the winter.

To these physical and mental characters described by MacFirbis let me add

those of the unusual combination of blue or blue-gi-ey eyes and dark eyelashes

with a swarthy complexion. This peculiaritj' I have only remarked elsewhere in

Greece ; the mouth and upper gum is not good, but the nose is usually straight. In
many of this and the next following race there was a peculiarity that has not been

alluded to by writers--the larpix, or, as it used to be called, the pommn Adami,

was remarkably prominent, and became more apparent from the uncovered state of

the neck. The sediment of this early people still exists in Ireland, along with the

fair-complexioned Dannans, and forms the bulk of the farm-labourers, called in

popular phraseology Spalpeens, that yearly emigrate to England. In Connaught

they now chiefly occupy a circle which includes the junction of the counties of

Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, and Sligo. They, with their fair-faced brothers (at

present the most numerous), are also to be found in Kerry and Donegal ; and they

nearly all speak Irish.

By statistics procured from our Great Midland Western Railway alone, I learn

that on an average 30,000 of these people, chiefly the descendants of the dark Kr-

bolgs and fair Dannans, emigrate annually to England for harvest work, to the great

advantage of the English farmer and the Irish landlord. The acreage of arable land

for these people runs from two to six acres.

   Connecting this race with the remains of the past, I am of opinion that they

were the first rath or earthen-mound and enclosure makers ; that they mostly buried

their dead without cremation, and, in cases of distinguished personages, beneath

the Cromleach or the Tmuulus. Their heads were oval or long in the antero-

posterior diameter, and rather flattened at the sides: examples of these I have

given and descanted upon when I first published my Ethnological Researches,

which have been fuUy confirmed by the late Andreas Retzius. It is, however,

unnecessary, even if space or advisability permitted, for me to allude to such mat-

ters, as that great work the ' Crania Britannica ' has lithographed tj-pical speci-

mens of this long-headed race.
  The next immigration we hear of in the 'Annals' is that of the Tvatha-de-Dannang,

a large, fair-complexioned, and very remarkable race ; warlike, energetic, progressive,

skilled in metal work, musical, poetical, acquainted with the healing art, skilled in
Druidism, and believed to be adepts in necromancy and magic, no doubt the result

of the popular idea respecting their superior knowledge, especially in smelting and
--123 REPORT 1874.

in the fabrication of tools, weapons, and ornaments. From these two races sprang

the Fairy Mythology of Ireland.
   It is strange that, considering the amount of annals and legends transmitted to

--us, we have so little knowledge of Druidism or Paganism in ancient Ireland. That,

however, may be accounted for in this wise : That those who took down the
legends from the mouths of the bards and annalists, or those who subsequently

transcribed them, were Christian missionaries whose object was to obliterate every

vestige of the ancient forms of faith.

   The Uannans spoke the same language as their predecessors, the Firbolgs.
They met and fought for the sovereignty. The " man of metal " conquered and
drove a great part of the others into the islands on the coast, where it is said the

Firbolg or Belgic race (so called) took their last stand. Eventually, however,
under the influence of a power hostile to them both, these two peoples coalesced,
and have to a large extent done so up to the present day. They are the true old
Irish peasant and small farming class.

   The Firbolg was a bagman, so called, according to Irish authorities, because he
had to carry up clay in earthen bags to those terraces in Greece now vine-clad. As
regards the other race there is more difficulty in the name. Tuath or Tuatha
means a tribe or tribe-district in Irish. Dannan certainly sounds very Grecian ; and
if we consider their remains, we find the long, bronze, leafed-shaped sword, so
abundant in Ireland, identical with weapons of the same class foimd in Attica
and other parts of Greece.

    Then, on the other hand, their physiognomy, their fair or reddish hair, their size,

and other circumstances incline one to believe that they came down from Scandi-
navian regions after they had passed up as far as they thought advisable into North-
western Europe. If the word Dane was known at the time of their arrival here, it
would account for the designation of many of our Irish monuments as applied by
Molyneux and others. Undoubtedly the Dannan tribes presented Scandinavian
features, but did not bring any thing but Grecian art. After the "Stone period,"
so called, of which Denmark and the south of Sweden offer such rich remains, I look
upon the great bulk of the metal work of the North, especially in the swords in the
Copenhagen and Stockholm Museums, as Asiatic ; while Ireland possesses not only

the largest native collection of metal weapon-tools, usually denominated " celtf,"
of any country in the world, but the second largest amount of swords and battle-

axes. And moreover these, and all our other metal articles, show a well-defined

rise and development from the simplest and rudest form in size and use to that of
the most elaborately constructed and the most beautifully adorned.

   I believe that these Tuatha-de-Daunans, no matter from whence they came,

were, in addition to their other acquirements, great masons, although not ac-
quainted with the value of cementing materials. I think they were the builders
of the great stone Cahirs, Duns, Cashels, and Caves in Ireland ; while their

predecessors constructed the earthen works, the raths, circles, and forts that
diversify the fields of Erinn. The Dannans anticipated Shakespeare's grave-digger,
for they certainly made the most lasting sepulchral monuments that exist in Ireland,

such, for example, as New Grange, Douth, Knowth, and Slieve na Calleagh and

other great cemeteries. Within the interior and around these tombs were carved,
on unhewn stones, certain archaic markings, spires, volutes, convolutes, lozenge-
shaped devices, straight, zigzag, and curved lines, and incised indentations, and a
variety of other insignia, which, although not expressing language, were symbolical,
and had an occult meaning known only to the initiated. These markings, as well
as those upon the urns, were copied in the decorations of the gold and bronze
work of a somewhat subsequent period. The Dannans conquered the inferior tribes
in two celebrated pitched battles, those of the Northern and Southern Moytura.

On these fields we still find the caves, the stone circles, the monoliths, and dol-

mens or cromleachs that marked particular events, and the immense cairns that
were raised in honour of the fallen chieftains.

   Although many of the warriors of the Firbolgs fled to their island fastnesses on
the coasts of Galway and Donegal, no doubt a large portion of them remained in
the inland parts of the country, and in that very locality to which I have adverted,
which is almost midway between the sites of the two battles, in a line stretching
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  123

between Mayo and Sligo, where in time the two races appear to have coalesced

by that natural law which brings the dark and the fair together.

   Moreover it has been recorded that the conquering race sent their small dark
opponents into Connaught, while they themselves took possession of the rich lands
further east, and not only established themselves at Tara but spread into the
south. It is remarkable that in time large numbers of the Dannans themselves
were banished to the West, and likewise that the last forcible deportation of the

native Irish race (so late as the seventeenth century) was when the people of
this province got the choice of going " to Connaught or Hell," in the former of
which, possibly, they joined some of the original stock. The natural beauty of the
lakes and mountains of Connaught remains as it was thousands of years ago ; but
no doubt if some of the legislators of the period to which I have ali-eady referred
could now behold its fat pasture-plains, they might prefer them to the flax lands

of Ulster.

   These Dannans had a globular form of head, of which I have already pub-
lished examples. For the most part I believe they burned their dead or sacri-

--ficed to their manes, and placed an urn with its incinerated contents human or
--animal in the grave, where the hero was either stretclied at length or crouched in

an attitude similar to that adopted by the ancient Peruvians, as I have elsewhere
explained. These Irish urns, which are the earliest relics of om- ceramic art that
have come down to the present time, are very graceful in form, and some of them

most beautifully decorated, as may be seen in our various museums.
   Specimens of this Daunan race still exist, but have gradually mixed with their-

--forerunners to the present day. Here is what old MacFirbis wrote of them two

hundred years ago: " Every one who is fair- haired, vengeful, large, and every
plunderer, professors of musical and entertaining performances, who are adepts of

druidical and magical arts, they are the descendants of the Tuatha-de-Dannans."

They were not only fair but sandy in many instances, and consequently extensively

freckled.

    It is affirmed that the Dannans ruled in Ireland for a long time, until another

--inroad was made into the island by the Milesians said to be brave, chivalrous,

skilled in war, good navigators, proud, boastful, and much superior in outward
adornment as well as mental culture, but probably not better armed than their
opponents. They deposed the three last Daunan kings and their wives, and rose

--to be, it is said, the dominant race assuming the sovereignty, becoming the aristo-

cracy and lauded proprietors of the country, and giving origin to those chieftains

that afterwards rose to the title of pettv kings, and from whom some of the best

families in the land with any thing like Irish names claim descent, and particularly

those with the prefix of the " O " or the " Mac." When this race arrived in Ireland

I cannot tell, but it was some time prior to the Christian era. It is said they came
from the coast of Spain, where they had long remained after tlieir eastern emigration.

   Upon the site of what is believed to be the ancient Brigautium, now the entrance
to the imited harbours of Corunna and Ferrol, stands the great lighthouse known
to all ships passing through the Bay of Biscay. Witliin this modern structure still

exists the celebrated " Pharos of Hercules," which I investigated and described

many years ago. That tower, it was said in metaphorical language, commanded a
view of Ireland, and as such became the theme of Irish poems and legends. Cer-

tain it is that sailing north or north-westward from it the ships of the sons of

Milesius and their followers could have reached Ireland without much coasting. If
the story of Breogan's Tower is true, then it must have been erected in the time
of lime-and-mortar building, and that is during the Roman occupalion of Iberia

and Gaul. How many thousands, rank and tile, of these Spanish Milesians came

here in their six or eight galleys and tried the fortunes of war from " the summit
of the ninth wave from the shore " and conquered the entire Dannan, Firbolg, and

Femorian population, I am unable to give the slightest inkling of, no more than

I can of the so-called Phoenician intercourse with this country. Perhaps vdthout

going into the fanciful descriptions of the "Battle of Venti-y Harbour,'' or the

Southern conquest of Ireland by the Iberian Milesians, we may find some more
trustworthy illustrations of Spanish dwellings in the architecture of the town of

Galway, and some picturesque representatives in the lithe upright figures and raven-
                                                                                                                                                                         --

haired, but blue-eyed maidens of the City of the Tribes. Here is what old MacFirbis,

who, I suppose, claimed descent from the sous of Milesius, wrote about them:

"Every one who is white of skin, brown of hair, bold, honourable, daring, pros-
perous, bountiful in the bestowal of property, and who is not afraid of battle or

combat, they are the descendants of the sons of Milesius in Erin."

   This high panegyric is only equalled by the prose and verse compositions of the

ancient bards and rhymers and the modern historians, who have recorded the deeds

of the great warriors, Ith, Heber, and Heremon, whose descendants boast to have
been the rulers of the land. Even Moore, although he wrote such beautiful lyrics
concerning this race in his early days, yet when he came to study history he felt

the same difficulty I do now. I do not dispute then' oi'igin or supremacy ; but I fail

to distinguish their early customs, their remains, or race from those of the Fil-

bolgs or Dannans whom they conquered, and who left undoubted monuments

--peculiar to their time.

  Now all these peoples the piratical navigator along our coasts, the mid-Europe

primitive shepherd and cultivator, the Northern warrior, and the Iberian ruler

mywere, according to  view, all deri^-ed from the one Celtic stock. Tliey spoke the

same language, and their descendants do so still. When they acquired a knowledge

of letters they transmitted their history through the Irish language. No doubt they

fused but somehow a quick fusion of races has not been the general characteristic
                                ;

of the people of this country. Unlike the Anglo-Norman in later times, the Mile-
sian was a long way from home ; the rough sea of the Bay of Biscay rolled between
him and his previous habitat ; and if he became an absentee he was not likely to
find much of his possessions on his return. It is to be regretted that while we

have here such a quantity of poetical and traditional material respecting the Mile-

sian invasion of Ireland, the Spanish annals or traditions have given us but very

little infonuation on that subject.

It would be most desirable if the Government or some Irish authority would

send a properly instructed commissioner to investigate the Spanish annals, and see

whether there is any thing relating to the Spanish migrations to Ii-eland remaining

in that country.

Besides the sparse introduction of Latin by Christian missionaries in the fifth

centurj', some occasional Saxon words springing from peaceful settlers along our

coasts and in commercial emporiums, and whatever Danish had crept into our

tongue around those centres where the Scandinavians chiefly located themselves,

and which were principally proper names of persons and places that became fixed

in our vernacular, we find but one language among the Irish people until the arrival

of the Anglo-Normans at the end of the twelfth centuiy.
   The linguistic or philological evidence on this subject is clearly decisive. The

residue of the early races already described spoke one language, called Gaelic ; so
did the Scotch, the Welsh, and probably, in early times, the Britons and the

Bretons. It was not only the popular conversational tongue used in the ordinary

intercourse of life, but it was also employed in genealogies, annals, and other

records in a special character, not quite peculiar to this country, but then common

in Europe. Much has been said about the necessitj' for a glossary of our ancient

MSS., such as those at Saint Gall, in Trinity College, in the Royal Irish Academy,

and in Belgian and English libraries                                                                                                                                     but there are very few ancient languages that
                                                                                                                                                                      ;

do not require to be glossed in the present day, even as the words of Chaucer do.

The Government are now, under the auspices of our Master of the R0II.9, and the

special direction and supervision of Mr. J. T. Gilbert, giving coloured photographs
of some of our ancient writings, and have promised that some of our remaining

manuscripts will be translated. I see no occasion now for waiting for more ela-
borated philological dictionaries or glossaries while there are still some few

Irish scholars in the country capable of giving a free but tolerably literal transla-

tion of these records that do not require any great acumen in rendering them
into English. Is history to wait upon the final decision of philologists respect-
ing a word or two in a manuscript, and decide as to whether it may be of Sanscrit
or any other origin ?

 --No doubt some of my hearers may ask, What about the Oghams (or Ohams) ?

do they not show a very early knowledge of an alphabet ? As yet this is a moot

Aquestion.  rude pillar-stone, havin^ upon it a tolerably straight edge, was

in early times notched along its angle which served as a stem-line, by nicks formed

on it, and straight or oblique lines, singly or in clusters, proceeding from the

stem. The decipherers of these inscriptions have, one and all, agreed upon the

fact that these lines represented letters, syllables, or words, and that the language

is either Irish or Latin. Therefore the persons who made them must have been

aware of alphabetic writing and grammar. These carved monoliths are chiefly

found in Kerry and Cork. Upon some of them Christian emblems are figured.

The incising of the stone has evidently been performed by some rude instrument,

either a flint or metallic pick ; and it is remarkable that these pillars present scarcely

any amount of dressing.

  In Connaught, in my youth, the exception in remote districts was where the

person spoke both English and Irish. In 1851, when we flrst took a Census of the

Irish-speaking population, after the country had lost three-quarters of a million of

people, chiefly of the Irish race, we had then (to speak in round numbers) one and

a half million of Irish-speaking population. In 1861 they had fallen ofl' by nearly

half a -million ; and upon the taking of the last Census in 1871 the entire Irish-
speaking population was only 817,865. The percentages, according to the total

--population in our diflerent provinces, were these : In Leinster 1-2, in Munster 27-7,

in Ulster 4-6, and in Connaught 39-0 ; for the total of Ireland 15'1. Kilkenny and
Louth are the counties of Leinster where the language is most spoken. In Munster

they are Kerry, Clare, and Waterford ; in Ulster, Donegal, where 28 per cent, of the

population speak Irish ; but in Connaught, to which I have already alluded as con-

taining the remnant of the early Irish races, we have no less than 56 per cent, of

Irish-speaking population in the counties of Mayo and Galway respectively. Of

my own knowledge I can attest that a great many of these people cannot speak

WeEnglish.  thus see that of the population of Ireland, which in the present day

might be computed at about five and a half millions, there were, at the time

of taking the census in April 1871, only 817,865 ; and I think I may prophecy that

that is the very largest number that in future we will ever have to record. On
mythe causes of this decadence it is not
                                          province to descant. These Celts have

been the great pioneers of civilization, and are now a power in the world. Are they

not now numerically the dominant race in America r and have they not largely

peopled Australia and New Zealand ?

  We have now an-ived at a period when you might natiu-ally expect the native

annalist to make some allusion to conquest or colonization by the then mistress of

the world. Without ofi^eiing any reason for it, I have here only to remark that

neither as warriors nor  colonizers did the  Romans  ever  set  foot  in  Ireland                            and
                                                                                                          ;

hence the paucity of any admixture of Roman art amongst us.

To till up a hiatus which might here occur in our migrations, I will mention a
Aremarkable circumstance.
                           Christian youth of Romano-Saxon parentage, and

probably of Patrician origin, was carried off in a raid of Irish marauders, and em-

ployed as a swine-herd in this very Ulster, the country of the Dalaradians, and

lived here for several years, learning our customs and speaking our language. He

escaped, however, to Munster, and thence to his native land of Britain or Nor-

mandy, from whence he returned in a.d. 432 with friends, allies, and missionaries,
and passing in his galley into the mouth of the Boyno, walked up the banks of thai

famed stream, raised the paschal tire at Slane, and speedily introduced Christianity

throughout Ireland.

    In thus briefly alluding to the labours of St. Patrick, I wish to be understood to

say that about the time of his mission thei-e was much Saxon intercourse with this
country, and the great missionary had not only many friends but several relatives

residing here, and some of them on the very banks of the Boyne ; and I believe

that a considerable amount of civilization and some knowledge of ChristiaTiity had

been introduced long previously ; so that, although old King Laoghaire or Loury
and his Druids did not bow the knee to the Most High God, nor accept the
teaching of the beautiful hymn that Patrick and his attendants chanted as they

passed up the grassy slopes of Tara, still there were many hundred people in

Ireland ready to receive the glad tidings of the gospel of salvation.

   Having tinished with the JMilesians, we now come to the Danes (so called), the
126 KEPORT--1874.

--Scandinavians or Norsemen The Pagan Sea-Kings who made inroads on our

coasts, despoiled our churches and monasteries, but at the same time, it must be con-
fessed, helped to establish the commercial prosperity of some of our cities and towns

from 796 to the time of the battle of Clontarf, a.d. 1014, when the belligerent

portlf.n of the Scandinavians were finally expelled the country. During the time I

havo specified, Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford belonged to these northern people.

Th y iiot only coasted round the island and never lost an opportunity of pillage

aiyi plunder, but they passed through the interior and carried their arms into the

very centre of the land. The Danes left us very little ornamental work beyond

what they lavished upon their swords and helmets ; but, on the other hand, it should
be borne iu mind that there are no Irish antiquities, either social, warlike, or eccle-
siastical, in the Scandinavian Museums.

Concerning their ethnological characters I must again refer to the ' Crania Bri-

tannica.' In the records thej'were designated strangers, foreigners, pagans, gentiles,

--and also white and black foreigners ; so tliat there were undoubtedly two races the

dark, and the fair or red, lilte as in the case of the Firbolgs or Dannans. They

were also styled " Azure Danes," probably on account of the shining hue of their

armour.

I believe the fair section of that people to have been of Norwegian origin, while

the dark race came from Jutland and the coast of Sweden ; and botli by the Orkneys,
the coasts of Scotland, and the Isle of Man. Their skulls were large and well-

formed                                     they  had  a thorough                                                       knowledge  of metal  work,  and especially                                               iron  ;  and,  as  I
                                        ;

have shown elsewhere, their swords and spears wei'e of great size and power, the

fonner wielded as a slashing-weapon, while those of their earh^ opponents were of

bronze, weak, and intended for stabbing. In nowhere else in Europe (that I am

aware of) have these rounded, pointed, or bevelled heavy iron swords been found
except in Ireland and Norway.

   Large quantities of Danish remains have been discovered in deep sinkings made

in Dublin ; and several weapons, tools, and ornaments, believed to be of Scandinavian
origin, have been found within a few inches of the surface on one of the battle-

fields on the south side of the LifFey, within the last few years. Upon most of
these I have already reported and given illustrations. I may mention one circum-

stance connected with this race. I never examined a battle-field of the Danes, nor

a collection of Danish weapons or implements, that I did not find the well-adjusted
scales and weights which the Viking had in his pocket for valuing the precious
metals he procured either by conquest or otherwise.

Although considered hostile, these Scandanavians Vikings must have frater-
Wenized with the Irish.
                                                                                                                       know that they  intermamed                                                     for,  among  many other
                                                                                                                                                                                                   ;

instances that might be adduced, I may mention that during the battle of Clontarf,

when Sitric, the Danish king of Dublin, looked on the fight from the walls of the

city, he was accompanied by his wife, the daughter of the ag-ed kins-, known as

"Brian the Brave."

   When, however, the Irish chieftains were not fighting with one another, they

were often engaged in petty wars with the Scandinavians, who, iu tura, were

attacked by their own countrymen, the " Black Gentiles," especially on the plain

of Fingall, stretching from Dublin to the Bo3'ne, and which the white race chiefly
occupied. It must not be supposed that the battle of Clontarf ended the Danish

occupation of Ireland                                                                                                  they still held the cities of Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford
                                                                                                                    ;
--at least, and largely promoted the commercial prosperity in these localities a pros-

perity which has not yet quite departed. I should like to present you with some

remains of the Scandinavian language, but the materials are very scanty.

  We are now coming to a later period. The Romans had occupied Britain,

the  Saxons followed                                                                                                   the Danes had partial possession for                                           a time :  the Heptarchy
                                                                                 ;

prevailed, until Harold, the last of the Saxon kings, fell at Hastings, and

England bowed beneath that mixture of Norman, Gaulish, Scandinavian, and

general Celtic blood that William brought with him from the shores of France.

The Saxon dynasty was at an end, but the Britons of the dav accepted their fate
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;

the higher elevating the lower, among whom they have permanently resided, must

always tend to great and good ends in raising mankind to that state into which I
hope it will yet please Providence to call him.

I must hasten on. Tlie Anglo-Normans came here in 1172, a very mixed race,

Whybut their leaders were chiefly of French or Norman extraction.   they came,

or what they did, it is not for me to expatiate upon. I wish, however, to correct

an assertion commonlj' made, to the effect that the Nonnan barons of Henry II,

then conquered Ireland. They occupied some towns, formed a " Pale," levied

taxes, sent in soldiery, distributed lands, and introduced a new language ; but the

"King's writ did not run;" the subjugation of Ireland did not extend over the

country at large, and it remained till 1840 and the five or six following years to

complete the conquest of the Irish race, by the loss of a tuberous esculent and the

governmental alteration in the value of a grain of corn. Then there went to the

workhouse or exile upwards of two millions of the Irish race, besides those who

died of pestilence. Having carefully investigated and reported upon this last great

European famine, I have come to the conclusion just stated, without taking into

consideration its political, religious, or national aspects, so far as this communica-

tion is concerned.

   It appears to me that one of our great difficulties in Ireland has been the want

--of fusion not only of races, but of opinions and sentiments, in what may be called

a " give and take " system. As regards the intermixture, I think there cannot be

a better one than the Saxon with the Celt. The Anglo-Normans, however, parti-
ally fused with the native Irish for Strongbow married Eva the daughter of King

                                                                                                                                                                            ;

Derniod ; and from this marriage it has been clearly shown that Her Most Gracious

Majesty the present Queen of Ireland and Great Britain is lineally descended.
Several of the noble warriors who came over about that period have established

gi-eat and wide-spread names in Ireland, among whom (not to be tedious) I may

mention the Geraldines in Leinster, the De Burgos in Connaught, and the But-

lers in Munster, as is manifest from the name-rolls of the country ; and they and
their descendants became, according to the old Latin adage, " more Irish than the

Irish themselves."

Look what the intermixture of races has done for us in Ireland ; the Firbolg

brought  us Agriculture ;  the Dannan the chemistry and mechanics  of metal work
                                                                                                                              ;

the Milesians beauty and governing power ;  the Danes commerce and  navigation
                                                                                                                 ;

the Anglo-Normans chivalry and organized government ; and, in later times, the

French emigrants taught us an improved art of w^eaving.
   It would be more political than ethnological were I to enter upon the discussion

of that subsequent period which would conduct us to the days of Cromwell or the

Boyne, or, perhaps, to later periods, involving questions not pertinent to the pre-

sent occasion.

   I must here say a word or two respecting Lish art. In architecture, in decorative
tone-work, from archaic markings that gave a tone and character to all subsequent

art, in our beauteous crosses, in our early metal work, in gold and bronze, carried

on from the Pagan to the Christian period, and in our gorgeously illuniinated

MS. books, we have got a style of art that is specially and peculiarly Irish, and
that has no exact parallel elsewhere, and was only slightly modified by Norman or

Frankish design.

   Time passed, as it is passing now, and events accumulated political affairs inter-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

rain"-le, but the anthropologist should try and keep clear of them. At the end of

the reign of Elizabeth a considerable immigration of English took place into the
south of Ireland. Subsequently the historic episode of the " Flight of the Earls,

O'Neill and O'Donnell, brought matters to a climax ; and the early part of the reign

of the first James is memorable for the " Plantation of Ulster," when a number of
Celtic Scots with some Saxons returned to their brethren across the water ; and

about the same time the London companies occupied large portions of this fertile
province, and the early Irish race were transplanted by the Protector to the West,
as I have already stated. It must not be imagined that this was the first inmiigi-a-
tion. The Picts passed through Ireland and no doubt left a remnant behind them.
In consequence of contiguity, the Scottish people must early have settled upon our

northern coasts. When tte adventurous Edward Bruce made that marvellous

inroad into Ireland at the end of the fourteenth century and advanced into the

bowels of the land, he carried with him a Gaelic population cognate with our own

people, and in all probability left a residue in Ulster, thus leavening the original
Firbolgs, Tuatha-de-Dannan, and Milesians, with the exception of the County
of Donegal, which still holds a large Celtic population speaking the old Irish
tongue, and retaining the special characters of that people as I have already de-

scribed them. This Scotic race, as it now exists in Ulster, and of which we have
specimens before us, I would sum up with three characteristics. That they were

courageous is proved by their shutting the gates and defending the walls of
Derry ; that they were independent and lovers of j ustice has been shown by their
establishment of tenant-right; and that they were industrious and energetic is

manifest by the manufactures of Belfast. Do not, I entreat my brethren of Ulster,

allow these manufactures to be jeopardized, either by masters or men, by any dis-
agreenients, which must lead to the decay of the fairest and wealthiest province
and one of the most beautiful cities in this our native land.

      Note on Variation of Leaf-Arrangement. By Hubert Aiet, M.D.

    Approaching the problem of leaf-arrangement from a Darwinian point of view,
it is important to observe the variations which arise at the present day in the
disposition of leaves in different individuals of the same species ; for it is reasonable
to suppose that variations of the same kind have arisen also in former ages, and the

problem would be solved if we could see that the accumulative tendency of such
variations (starting from some simple form of leaf-arrangement) would uatm-ally
result in the production of all the complex forms of leaf-arrangement which now

 exist.

    The chief general featm-e of leaf-arrangement being the dispo.sition of leaves in
parallel ranks, vertical or spiral as the case may be, the variations which present
 themselves at the present day are of two kinds :

     First, there are variations in the timnher of leaf-ranks.

    Second, there are variations in the obliquity of ranks, their number remaining the

 same.

    The object of this paper is especially to put on record some observations which
 illustrate the first of these two kinds of variation.

" parasite " invading the various algae in question, in accordance with the new view,

then the parasites attacking each must be mutually quite distinct species, and, taken
on the whole, marvellouslt/ choice in their selection of " host."

Proceeding on the latter assumption, two of the forms now brought forward

would have to be regarded as two " new species," falling either under the genus

Ephebella, Itzigsohn, or Gonionema, Nylander. The three other forms would pro-
bably have to be referred as "new species " to Spilonema, or one of them, wanting

paraphyses, to Lichenosplicei-ia, Bornet.

For the new view much that has been advanced by its supporters is very cogent

and striking, if not yet conclusive.

But in " lichens " like Ephehella, Gonionema, Ephehe, Spilonetna, Lichenosphceria,

in which it is the "alga" which builds up the outward configuration of the thallus,

and which simply harbours latent within it the parasite, the latter making itself

externally evident only by its exserted apothecia, does it not seem inconsistent to

describe the characters of the thallus of the alga as part and parcel of those of the

--" lichen ? " Thus Bornet, in giving the characters of Lichenosphceria Lenonnandi,

describes it generically thus : " Thallus tenellus, ramosus, fruticulosus, fere omnino

stigonematoideus, basi corticatus ; " and specifically he speaks of it as " Thallus fusco-

niger, tomentoso-intricatus." 27ms, for so far going on the Schwendenerian view,

is nothing more nor less than describing the characters of " Sirosiphon divaricatus,

Kiitz." (the plant invaded by the "parasite ") ; but when he goes on to describe the

apothecia, the paraphyses, the spermogonia, the spores, he is giving the characters

of the parasite and the real " new species."

There can be little doubt but that amongst these Scytonematous and Sirosiphona-

ceous Algae quite truly distinct forms occur, but that, on the other hand, there can

be almost as little doubt but that Kiitzing has very greatly overrated their number.

Now it is hard to conceive that one and the same parasite would care very much

which of forms so closely resembling it invaded in order to pursue its course of life.

Sirosiphon divaricatus seems not to differ much from S. alpinus (one of those now

brought forward with apothecia) : now what vei-y perceptible barrier is there to the

supposition that the parasite which invades the former to form Lichenosphceria

Lenormandi, Bornet, might not at another time invade the latter ? Would it then
fructify in the same way, show spores alike, &c. ? But the " parasite " which does

really invade the latter (as shown by this paper) is tiot the same. Are these Scyto-

nemicolous and Sirosiphonicolous parasites, then, so extremely choice ?

Again, two very closely allied forms of Scytonema now brought forward likewise

showed vei-y distinct parasites, as evinced by their spores, whilst those of one of
t,hФm much resembled that of Sirosiphon pulcinatus, an alga in itself sufficiently

unlike the other.

In objection to the new theory, though it has much to say for itself, in the mean

time and whilst it is, as it were, on its trial, it might be asked at what period of the

life of the Scytonema or Sirosiphon does it become invaded by the parasite ? at
what part of the thallus does it make an entry ? It must be near the base, or at all

events not very high up, for the hypha is foimd growing pretty neaxlj pa7-i passu

with the growth of a branch of the alga and in the same general direction. But

why might not the hypha grow in the opposite direction ? Might it not sometimes

enter near the apex and grow backward ? Might we not sometimes expect to find

hyphae sticking out from broken-up or distorted examples of these algae, and thus

revealing themselves (without the whole mass being boiled in potash) whilst o}i

their ^vay to other examples of quite the sayne alga ? Or must the hypha apper-

taining to a particular plant have had its commencement from a spore which foimd
its way to, and alighted somewhere externally upon, the particular Scytonema or

Sirosiphon ?

An experimental decision of the " gonidia-question," so far as it relates to these

tScytonematous and Sirosiphonaceous forms, is surrounded by not a few practical
Adifficulties.
                " sowing " of spores upon the algae (as Eeiss did for Nostoc) in a

natural condition could only be can-ied out by an observer residing in or close to

the subalpine situations where these plants dwell, as they could not be cultivated

elsewhere. In order to obtain the spores he would further have, most probably, a

troublesome preliminary search, and, on the other hand, there would hardly be a
                                                                              ;

certainty of the plants selected for inoculation being themselves previously destitute

of hyphae or apothecia. Of course, small portions from various places in a tuft of
any given al(/a could be previously well examiued, which, though if, indeed, found
to represent the alga " pure and simple," would not render it absolutely conclusive
that some other portion of the tuft might not already have been invaded by the
"parasite." However, having selected some plants for experiment they should be
well inoculated with spores, and portions removed from time to time for examina-
tion and experiment. If foimd satisfactory it would be interesting to try spores
from the same and from different species, in order to see the result, and whether the
seeming fixity of the forms and the apparently extreme choiceness of the parasites

be true or not, or ultimately whether the theory itself be true or not. Whether,
for the time being, the truth of the new theory be previously assumed, or its un-
tenability be presupposed, would matter very little, if only the suitable opportunity
and ready field of operation were at command of the observer. It would seem as
if in this way only can either presupposition be justified or negatived.

On the Form of Pollen-grains in relation to the Fertilization of Flowers.
                        By Alfred W. Bennett, F.L.S.

Although a common form of pollen-grain not unfrequently runs through a

whole group of plants, yet more often the form is found to be adapted to the par-

ticular requirements of the species in respect of its mode of fertilization, and varies

even within a small circle of affinity. In those plants which are fertilized by the

agency of insects, there are three general modes in which the form of the grain is
Weadapted for the purpose.
                                 have, first (and this is by far the most common

form), an elliptical grain with three or more longitudinal furrows, as in Ranunculus

Ficaria,  Aucuba japonica,  and  Bryonia  dioica                              secondly, spherical or elliptical,
                                                                           ;

and covered with spines, as in many Compositse, Malvaceae, and Cucm-bitacese

and thirdly, where they are attached together by threads or a viscid excretion, as

in the Fuchsia, Evening Primrose, and Michardia cethiopica. In those plants, on

the contrary, which are fertilized by the agency of the wind, as most grasses, the

Hazel, and Populus balsamifera, the pollen is almost perfectly spherical when dry,

unfurnished with any furrows, and very light and powdery. The genus Viola

furnishes two very markedly different forms of pollen-grain : in one, the section to

which V. canina and odorata belong, they have the ordinary elliptical 3-furrowed

form, and every point of the structure of the style and stigma is favourable to fer-

tilization by bees ; in the other, the section to which V. tricolor belongs, the grains

are very much larger, and either hexagonal or pentagonal, and the style and stigma

are adapted for fertilization by very minute insects, such as Thrips. In all species

of the order Cruciferae at present examined, the pollen has the most common form.

Pringlea antiscorbtdica, the " Kerguelen's Land Cabbage," has been shown by

Dr. Hooker to be in all probability wind-fertilized, from the following considera-

--tions : the absence of petals, the absence of honey-glands, the exserted style, the

stigma being covered with long papillae, and the apparent entfre absence of winged

insects in Kerguelen's Land. The form of the pollen supports the same view, being

very minute and perfectly spherical, extremely difierent, therefore, from every other

known plant of the order. In the cowslip and primrose there is a imiform dif-

mference size between the pollen-gi-aius fi'om flowers belonging to the two dimor-

phic forms, that of the short-styled being always considerably larger than that of

the long-styled form.

Mosses of the North-east of Ireland. By S. A. Stewart.

Turner in 1804 enumerated as Irish 230 species of mosses, Dr. Taylor in 1836

mentions about the same number, and Dr. David Moore in 1872 gives a list of 385

Irish species, to which the author of the present paper adds foui- others, making

389, or more than two thirds of the British mosses. Thus, relatively to the

British flora, Ireland has qmte as large a proportion of mosses as she has of flower-

ing plants, proving that Irish muscology has not been neglected. No separate lists

of the mosses occm'ring in the northern coimties have been published ; but after

consulting the records of Dr. Taylor in the ' Flora Hibemica,' and the valuable list

of Irish mosses by Dr. Moore, also some detached papers on the subject and his

own impublished notes, the author ascertains that the number of species occurring

in the distiict amoimts to 225, or more than one half of the Irish mosses. The

district is defined to consist of the coimties of Down and Antrim, with a sm.all

portion of county Deny bordering on Antrim. The list includes a number of rare

mosses. The following have not been previously recorded as Irish : Ftssidens

incicrvis, Schw., var. Lylei, found only on a greensand rock on the Black Moimtain,

near Belfast ; Tayloria serrata, in small quantity near the summit of Benbradagh

that it dies of old age in about thirty years after it is grown from a seed, that to
eradicate the disease it must be grown from the seed, and it must be planted
beyond the range of infection emitted by old infected varieties. The author
believes that the range of infection does not extend beyond a few hundred yards.

                         By C. J. B. Williams, M.D., F.E.S.

   These specimens were prepared by Miss E. Dyke Poore, who had foimd as many

as 230 species on the shores of Jersey. This remarkable abimdance and variety
of seaweeds, as well as their luxuriant growth. Dr. Williams attributed partly to
the position of the Channel Islands, receiving tides and currents from the great
Atlantic as well as the channel ; and partly to the remarkable clearness and purity

of the sea-water as contrasted with that of the muddy shores of the southern and

eastern coasts, due to the chalk, marl, and sand of their shores, whereas those of

Jersey consist chiefly of clean primitive rocks, which form little debris and no mud.
Tm-bid water is uufavom-able to growth, by intercepting the light as well as by ita
mechanical eflects on delicate organisms.

   The method by which Miss Dyke Poore prepares the specimens so as to preseiTO

--their colour and minute structure so perfectly is not novel, but may be referred to

this principle that as these delicate forms and organisms are developed and sup-

ported in a medium of nearly the same specific gravity as their own, so they must
be kept disentangled and cleansed as much as possible in sea-water, and transferred

to fresh water for the purpose of washing away the salt and of laying them out
only immediately before the processes of drying and pressing. Thus prepared, and
fixed by a slight brushing of skim-milk or weak solution of isinglass, they may be
kept in a book, or sent by post between pasteboards without damage ; but light
and damp may still injure them.

                On some Points in the Histology of Myriothela phrygia*.
                                By Prof. Allman, F.E.S.

    The endoderm of that portion of the body which lies at the distal side of the
 gonosome, and which carries the papilliform tentacles characteristic of the genus,
 is composed of numerous layers of large polyhedi-al cells with clear contents and a
 brilliant nucleus. Internally it forms thick conical processes which project into

 the body-cavity, while externally it is continued in an altered condition into the

 tentacles. At the free end of the internal processes there are abundantly developed
 among the large clear cells smaller spherical cells filled with opaque brown granules.
 These cells are easily detached and isolated, and may be then seen lying free in the
 body-cavity. Where the endoderm passes into the cavity of the tentacles, it loses

 its large clear-celled condition, and consists of small round cells loaded with opaque
 brown granules.

    External to the endoderm and interposed between this and the ectoderm
 is the fibrillated layer. This is remarkably well developed. Its component

fibrillae run circularly round the body, and form a continuous fibrillated mem-

 brane so strong as to remain entu-e after the tissues on both sides of it have

been broken down. No obvious membrane distinct from this and forming a sepa-

rate " Stiitzlamelle " could be detected. It is continued as a thinner membrane
into the tentacles, where it lies between the endoderm and ectoderm of these

processes.

    The ectoderm is mainly composed of two or three layers of small round cells

filled with yellowish granules. Among these cells the thread-cells may be seen

lying at various depths from the sm-face. The ectoderm retains this structure over
the body and tentacles ; but between the proper ectoderm and the fibrillated lamina
of the body a peculiar tissue may be demonstrated. This consists of a layer of cells,
from each "of which there proceeds a fine process which can be distinctly traced
into the fibrillated membrane. In this membrane the cell-processes lose them-
selves ; and they could not be followed into direct continuation with the fibrillae in
the way in which Kleinenberg traced the prolongations of cells apparently having
the same significance in the ectoderm of Hydra. These cells differ also from those
described by Kleinenberg in Hydra in their being nowhere superficial. In a trans-
verse section of the body in Myriothela the caudate cells form a distinct zone
immediately external to the fibrillated lamina and between this and the proper
ectoderm. They are strongly stained by magenta, while the fibrillated membrane
takes up scarcely a trace of the colour. It is impossible not to see in this tissue

elements referable to a very primitive type of the nervous system.

    * [Received after the close of the Belfast Meeting. Printed with the authority of the
Council.-- G. G.]
--136 REPORT 1874.

   But perhaps the most remarkable point of structure is to be found in a peculiar tissue
which 18 developed between the endoderm and ectoderm of the tentacles. It occupies
the summit of the tentacle, where it is interposed between the continuation of the
fibrillated membrane of the body and the ectoderm, forming here a hemispherical
cap over the endodermal cavity of the tentacle. It is composed of colourless,
transparent, closely applied prisms, which extend at right angles to the walla of the

cavity. It strongly suggests the rod-like tissue of the retina.

On Chlamydomyxa labyrinthuloidea (n. g. et sp.), a new Sarcodic Freshwater
                            Organism. By WiLLrAM Archer.

This paper gives an account of a novel sarcodic organism from fresh water,

presenting a very considerable resemblance to those two congeneric marine forms
regarded as the type of a new family instituted by Cienkowski, and named by
him Labyrinthulea. In Schultze's ' Archiv fiir mikr. Anatomic,' in a memoir
entitled " Ueber den Bau uod die Entwickelung der Labyrinthuleen " (see

also Quart. Journ. Micr. Sci. vol. vii. p. 277), that author gives an account of the

new organisms so named, found by him amongst algae on piles in the harbour of

--Odessa. These, as stated by him, are characterized by being composed of three

elements or constituents the central mass, the spindles, and the Jilamentary tracks

(" Fadenbahn," Cienk.). In the organism now brought forward we have all these

--elements that is to say, the central sarcodic " body-mass," the "spindles," and the

"filamentary tracks." In all the filamentary tracks are minute, extremely slender

hyaline threads, emanating from the central mass, stretching far and wide into the

surroimding water, and forming an irregularly connected, much ramified, arbo-

rescent framework, along which the spindle-shaped bodies travel slowly in great

numbers, away from the central "headquarters." But the main distinction (apart,

of course, from minor diflerences of colour and the like) between the " spindles " in

Oienkowski's forms and the present is that in the latter they are not nucleated,

whilst in the former they are. Another distinction is that in the present organism

the aggregate body-mass presents a remarliable tendency to become repeatedly

encysted or coated with a thick hyaline multilaminated covering, the densely arbo-

rescent body-mass being only now and again protruded through a torn-like opening

in the covering ; this covering gives the cellulose reaction on the application of

iodine and sulphuric acid. Another important distinction lies in the fact that the

body-mass possesses, immersed in its substance, numerous irregularly figured deep

crimson-coloured pigment-granules, giving to the organism, viewed imder mode-

Arate powers, a decidedly red colour.   further difference of importance in the

present form is its " parasitic " habit, or, at least, the fact that in a younger state of

existence it inhabits the cells of aquatic plants, such as Sphagnum, the immersed

leaves of Eriophorum, sedges, &c., or   (in Connemara)  the  tissues of Eriocaulon
                                                                                                                                                    ;

from these hosts it protrudes by-and-by, becomes re-encysted, and at last removed.

A minor distinction occurs in the fact that the spindles here are of a bluish hue,

not, as in Oienkowski's forms, either orange-coloured or colourless.

   This curious organism is manifestly one of which at present no record exists ; its
true nature is somewhat problematic, its "facies " is that of a " Labyrinthulean," but

the non-nucleated spindles are seemingly a bar to its admission as yet to a place

in that group ; it does not resemble any of Hackel's Monera, it has no seeming

immediate affinity to Rhizopoda, and, so far as we can see, must continue for the

present an isolated problematic production which Mr. Archer would mean time

suggest should remain in abeyance, standing under the designation Chlamydomyxa

Alabyrinthuloidea.  lengthened description and illustration will appear elsewhere

of this curious and puzzling organism.

                   On the Distribution of the Species of Cassowaries.
By P. L. ScLATEE, M.A., F.R,S., Secretary to the Zoological Society of London.

After some general observations on tlie systematic position of Casuarius and of

its allied form Drotnam, the author proceeded to remark on the great increase in

our knowledge of the species of the former genus that had recently taken place.

One species only (the Casuarius galeat%is) had been until lately recognized, whereas

at the present time there was evidence of the existence of at least seven or eight

Newdistinct species distributed over  Guinea and the adjoining islands.

The Zoological Society of London had received, on the 27th of May last, a li^dng

Cassowary which appeared to belong to a species hitherto unrecognized. This bird

had been obtained at the southern extremity of New Guinea, in the early part of

1873, by Dr. Haines, the Medical Officer of H.M.S. ' Basilisk,' and brought to

Sydney, where it remained imtil February of the present j^ear in the Botanic

Gardens. Thence it had been brought to England in the ship ' Parramatta,' under

the care of Mr. Broughton.

The species, which the author was intending to describe before the Zoological

Society as Casuarius picticoUis, was closely allied to Bennett's Cassowary (C. Ben~

netti) and Westerman's Cassowary ( C. Westermani*), and belonged to the same
section of the genus, distingiushable by the transverse ridge across the helmet and

the want of caruncles on the neck.

The author then pointed out the principal characters distinguishing the seven

species of Cassowary known to him, as shown in the subjoined Table, and made

remarks on theii' distribution, which were illustrated by reference to a map of New

Guinea and the adjoining islands :

a. Casse lateraliter compressa : appendicula cervicis duplici.
       1. C. galeatus, ex Ceram.
       2. C. hicarunculatus, ex inss. Aroensibus.
       3. C. australis, ex Australia.

b. Casse transversim compressa : appendicula cervicis uidca.
       4. C. uniappendiculatus, ex Papua.

c. Casse transversim compressa : appendicula cervicis nulla.
       5. C. Westermanni, ex Papua.
      6. C. picticoUis, ex Papua merid.
       7. C. Bennetti, ex Nov. Britann.

was limited to tlie present act in which the animal was engaged, or, at most, took

in very little beyond it, the native impulse or desire seeking each step in succession
by itself, because the animal's power of thgught coidd not take in the end of the

series.

  A typical case of intelligence in the dog was similarly analyzed ; and it was shown

that the dog bad the power of thinking a particular act as a part of a series, combining

with the idea of that act a thought of the series of acts, each with its eS'ect, and all
with their residt. It was pointed out that this power of forming a plan to attain an
end, which was possessed by the dog, diflered from man's power of design in this

respect, that man can not only think an act as part of a series leading to a result,

but that he has the further power of believing, with more or less certainty, that
each step in the series of acts will be followed by the consequence connected with
it in thought. This implies inference from past experience, and inference is the
process of imparting to the idea of a fact the degree of assurance which belongs to

it as a case of a general principle.
   Characteristic instances of intelligence in the baboon and the orang-outang

were minutely analyzed ; and it was shown that while these manifested an intel-
ligence to which the dog could not attain, the superiority consisted in the power
of combining in an assured sense of reality with tlie idea of an object some abstract
coexistence or succession which had been gathered from similar objects as a uni-
formitjf of experience ; that is, in the power of thinking a case of a general principle

with the belief which belongs to it as such.
    This step of mental development in the orang-outang compared with the dog

is similar in its essential nature to the previous step, which may be observed in the
dog compared with the lower vertebrate animal. Each is a new power of combining

thoughts which otherwise would have required a long course of repetition in con-
junction with each other before they could by association have grown together ; and
each combines those thoughts in a closer and more vivid union through the medium

--of anew element namely, sense of progi'ess towards an end in the one case, and

belief in the maintenance of a uniformity in the other.

    It was shovra by a general survey of the highest kinds of intelligence manifested
by the various classes and orders of vertebrate animals, coupled with a minute

analysis of apparently contrary instances, that vertebrate animals may be divided in

respect of their mental powers into three groups, of which the lowest can comprise
in one act of thought only what can be perceived by sense all at the same time
the second can comprise in one act of thought a series of successions in time so as

to think a single object of sense as part of such a series ; and the third can comprise

in one act of thought an entire class of coexistences or successions so as to conibine

with a particular fact the common element of coexistence or succession belonging to
the class. To the first group belong the vertebrate animals below the Rodent order
of Mammalia. In the second gToup the Rodents may claim a place (though their
powers of pin-pose are small), along with the orders of Mammalia above them up
to the Quadrumana. To the third gi-oup belong the monkeys, the Anthropoid apes,

and man.

    With these facts of the development of intelligence, the facts of the development

of the brain are in striking correspondence. " For the cerebrum of the oviparous

vertebrata corresponds only with the anterior lobe of the human cerebrum. It is
among the Rodentia that we meet with the first distinct indication of a middle

lobe ; while the posterior lobe makes its first appearance in monkeys, and is
distinctly present in the Anthropoid apes " (Carpenter's ' Mental Physiology,'

p. 116). And the inference at once occurs, that the functions of the anterior lobe

belong to the act of thinking single objects of sense, those of the middle lobe to
the act of thinking such objects with a sense of a succession of them and as part
of that succession, and those of the posterior lobe to the act of thinking a coex-
istence or succession of them as a case of a general principle.

    In confirmation of this inference, the other features ot brain-development were
considered ; and it was shown that the analogies of the nervous system seem to
indicate that the increased development of the fibres of the brain serves to make
the action of its diiferent parts consentaneous, so as to give correspondence to the
muscular action of the two sides of the body and strength and steadiness to
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;

thought, this function being more needed as powers of thought are developed which
are less closely connected with sense ; and accordingly the great ti'ansverse com-
missure appears first, in any degree of development worthy of notice, in the Rodents
along with the middle lobe. The increased size of the cortical layer and the number
and depth of its convolutions probably give an increase in the amount of thought

and in its analysis. And the cerebellum, connected as it is principally with the

spinal cord, seems to be a store of force which, having been set in action by the
contracted muscles through the posterior nerves, continues to maintain, through
the anterior nerves, the stimulus to muscular action, so as to keep up the action of
the muscles which have been set in action till it is altered or suspended by the action
of other nervous centres. Thus no other development of the brain seems to have
any tendency to give that extension to thought which was assigned to the three
lobes. The convolutions and the fibres improve the action of the brain rather than
enlarge the range of its objects ; but the development of each additional organ of

intelligence extends the range of the objects of thought. And it is as superadded

developments that the three lobes appear, both in the vertebrate series of animals
and in the development of the embryo of man.)

   liastly, it was shown that the course of development of cerebral fimction which
had been inferred from facts was in accordance with the general analogies of deve-
lopment, as giving the powers which were needed in the struggle for life ; for
the primary function of the cerebrum being to direct the actions of the body by
the thoughts of the mind to the attainment of desirable ends, the intelligence of
which it is necessary that it should be the instrument is knowledge of the ends

and knowledge of the means. And the development of that intelligence consists

--of three steps the power of thinking objects as desirable or imdesirable, the power

of thinking actions as leading to ends, and the power of knovdng objects to be
desirable and actions to be efficacious. Accordingly the first lobe of the cerebi-um
should be developed to combine in thought qualities with things as their substance,
the second lobe should be developed to think acts in time with a view to their end,
and the third lobe should be developed to think a fact with the belief which

belongs to it as a case of a general principle.

   Along with the power of thinking each of these classes of objects would come,

--in a greater or less degree, in proportion to the other developments of the cerebrum
   the power of thinking their relations and comparative attributes, and that of com-
bining them with each other and with emotions, desires, and aversions.

   And if it were objected to these inferences that considerable portions of the
cerebrimi may be removed vdthout any apparent mutilation of the powers of

thought, it might be observed that the acts of the mind become by association so
connected with each other, that in each thought there are many associated elements,
and that the corresponding seat of cerebral activity should be not in one but in many
localities throughout the brain. Even if some of these were removed, the action
 of the others woidd still by association elicit and be elicited by the accustomed
 impressions of the sensorium and stimulation of the centres of muscular action.

On a new Form of Microscope for Physiological Purposes.
                   By EicHABD Caton, M.D.

This paper consisted of a description of a microscope modified with a view to

the easier examination of the tissues of warm-blooded animals. Hitherto the phe-

nomena of circulation &c. could only be studied in the mesentery and omentum

this instrument is intended to render practicable the examination of other tissues,

as, for example, the subcutaneous cellular tissue and the brain-membranes. The

front half of the stage, as ordinarily constructed, is removed, so as to allow the

Abody of the animal to be brought into close contact with the object-glass.  small

glass trough, one third of an inch in diameter, containing salt-solution, is attached

to the centre of the stage immediately under the objective. The piece of tissue

to be examined is laid across the glass trough, and held in position by two pairs of
small stage-forceps. As the object cannot be moved about on the stage so as to

bring any part of it as required under the object-glass, a corresponding movement

is given to the body of the microscope by a simple mechanical arrangement. The
stage-trough containing salt-solution is warmed by a very simple hot-water
apparatus, the temperature being registered by a stage-thermometer in the usual

manner.

 Preliminary Notice of an Inquiry into the Morphology of the Brain and the

             Function of Hearing. By Professor Cleland, Oalway.

   In this paper it was demonstrated that the flocculus is a lateral projection from
the third cerebral vesicle, and that the optic thalami are not developed in the first
cerebral vesicle but in the constriction between it and the second. The author's
hypothesis is, that the cerebral hemispheres are derived from the front of the first
cerebral vesicle by a process of longitudinal fission, similar to that which he had
formerly shown to take place in other cephalic structures (Phil. Trans. 1862),
that the primary optic vesicles have a closer connexion with the second than with
the first cerebral vesicle, and that the olfactoi-y bulbs, optic vesicles, and flocculi
are serially homologous ; and he judges that the flocculi are connected with the

sense of hearing.

                                                   By Professor T. H. Huxley, F.B.S.

In his paper " On the Structure and Development of the Skull of the Common

Frog " (Phil. Trans. 1871), Mr. Parker states that, in the fourth stage of the tad-

pole *, " the hyoid arch has made its second great morphological change ; it has

coalesced with the mandibular pier in front and with the auditory capsule above

(plate V. figs. 1-4, and plate vi. fig. 8, s.h.m., i.h.m.). The upper part, or suprahyo-

mandibular {s.h.m.), is attached to the auditory sac much lower down and more

outward than the top of the arch in front                            This upper distinct part is

small                             it answers to only the upper part  of the Teleostean  hyomandibidar ;  there
                               ;

is a broad sub-bifid upper head answering to the two ichthyic condyles, then a
narrow neck, and then behind and below an 'opercular process' (op.p.). Below

this the two arches are fused together; but the hyoid part is demonstrated, just

above the commencement of the lower third, by the lunate fossa for the ' styloid

&condyle' (plate V. figs. 2 4, Ф<.A.)." (pp. 154, 165.)

   In the sixth stage " the ' suprahyomandibular ' (fig. 3, s.hin.) has become a fi-ee
plate of cartilage of a trifoliate form " (p. 164).

   In the seventh stage "the 'suprahyomandibular,' losing all relation to the

hyoid arch, becomes now part of the middle ear. . . . The essential element of the

middle ear, the stapes (st.), was seen in the fourth stage ; the condyles and oper-

cular process of the hyomandibular are now being prepared to form an osseo-

cartilaginous chain from the 'membrana tympani' to the stapes. Under these
conditions a new nomenclature will be required ; and this will be made to depend

upon the stapedial relationship of the chain, notwithstanding its different morpho-

logical origin.

--" I shall now call the lobes of this trifoliate plate of cartilage as follows namely,

the antero-superior ,' suprastapedial,' the postero-superior ' medio-stapedial,' and'

the freed opercidar process ' exti-ast ape dial ' (s.st., m.st., e.st.).

"The stapes (st.) sends no stalk forwards to meet the new elements, but they

grow towards it; this will be seen in the next stage." (pp. 169, 170.)

   As the question of the origin of the columella auris in the Vertehrata is one of

considerable morphological importance, I have devoted a good deal of time during

the past summer to the investigation of the development of this structm-e in the

myfrog ; and it is perhaps some evidence of the difficulty of the inquiry, that

--142 REPORT 1874.

conclusicas do not accord with those enunciated by Mr. Parker in the very excel-

lent and laborious memoir which I have cited.
   I find, in the first place, that there is no coalescence of the mandibular with the

hyoidean arch, the latter merely becoming articulated with the former.

   Secondly, Mr. Parker's " suprahyomandibular " is simply an outgrowth of the

mandibular arch from that elbow or angle which it makes when the pedicle by
which it is attached to the trabecula passes into the downward and forward inclined

suspensorial portion of the arch. This outgrowth attaches itself to the periotic

capsule, and, coalescing with it, becomes the otic process, or "superior crus of the

suspensorium," of the adult frog.

The hyoid arch, seen in the fourth stage, elongates, and its proximal end attaches

itself to the periotic capside in front of the fenestra ovalis, and close to the pedicle

of the suspensorium, which position it retains throughout life.
   The columella auris arises as an outgrowth of a cartilaginous nodule, which

appeal's at the anterior and superior part of the fenestra ovalis, in front of and

above the stapes, but in immediate contact with it. It is to be foimd in frogs and

toads which have just lost their tails, in which the gape does not extend further
back than the posterior margin of the eye, and which have no tympanic cavity, as

a short and slender rod, which projects but very slightly beyond the level of the
stapes, its free end being continued into fibrous tissue, which runs towards the sus-

pensorium, beneath the portio dura, and represents the suspensorio-stapedial liga-

ment of the Urodela.

   This rod elongates, and its anterior or free end is carried outwards as the tym-
pano-eustachian passage is developed. At the same time the free end becomes

elongated at right angles to the direction of the rod, and gives rise to the " extra-
stapedial " portion, which is imbedded in the membrana tympani. Ossification

takes place around the periphery of the middle of the rod ; thus the medio-stapedial

is produced. The inner portion becomes the rounded or pestle-shaped supra-
stapedial, but retains its primitive place and connexions ; whence we find it in the

adult articulated in a fossa in that part of the periotic capsule which forms the

front boimdary of the fenesti-a ovalis, but in close contact with the stapes.

The columella auris of the frog, therefore, is certainly not formed by the meta-

morphosis of any part of either the mandibular or the hyoidean arches, such as

they exist in the fourth stage of larval development.

It may be said further that the columella undoubtedly appears to be developed

from  the side walls  of the  auditory  capsule  in  the  same  way as the stapes                                                          and
                                                                                                                                        ;

some appearances have led me to suspect that it is originally in continuity with

the stapes, but I am not quite sure that such is the case.

Are we to conclude, therefore, that the columella is a product of the periotic

capsule, such as the stapes has been assumed to be ?

  Here, I think, there is considerable ground for hesitation. It appears to me
that the stapes is not so much " cut out " of the cartilaginous periotic capsule as

the result of the chondrification of a portion of that capsule which remains un-

chondrified longer than the rest.

Moreover the Urodela all possess a band of ligamentous fibres which extends

from the stapes to that part of the suspensorium with which the hyoid is connected

and to the hyoid itself. It is conceivable, and certainly not improbable, that this

stapedio-suspensorial ligament represents the dorsal extremity of the hyoidean

arch. But the columella auris in its early condition in the frog so nearly resembles

the stapedio-suspensorial ligament partially chondrified, that it is hard to suppose

that one is not the homologue of the other ; in which case the columella, and even

the stapes itself, may, after all, represent the metamorphosed dorsal end of the

hyoidean arch or the hyomandibular of a fish. And it must be admitted that the

relation of the portio dui'a nerve to the hyomandibular of a ray speaks strongly in

favour of this view.

        On the Decomposition of Eggs*. By William Thomson, F.C.S.

   Researches on this subject were commenced by the late Dr. F. Crace-Calvert and
myself about the beginning of October 1870, and continued during the following

18 months.

  We made many series of experiments, among which I may mention first some

good whole eggs were set aside on a shelf and examined from time to time to
observe the action of ordinary atmospheric air. The shells of some set aside in

the same way were pierced by a fine needle. Some were exposed in this way to

dry and others to moist atmospheres, some to constant and others to constantly
vai7ing temperatures. The effects were observed of placing some close to putrid

meat, and others, for the sake of comparison, in good air ; the air in both cases was
kept heated to between 80░ and 90░ F. for manj' weeks. Experiments were made
by exposing them in different gases, moist and dry ; some with their shells whole,
and some pierced by a fine needle ; and, lastly, the effects of placing on the shell
the dried germs of different agents of decomposition, and also of placing the eggs in
water and other solutions containing different animalculae &c. in active life, were

observed.

   Besides these experiments, however, we examined rotten eggs obtained from dif-
ferent vendors at different times of the year, and the results from aU may be summed

up generally as follows:

   That eggs with their shells perfect are attacked and decomposed by one, two, or
all of three different agents of decomposition. The first we termed' " The Puti-id
Cell," the second " The Vibrio " and the third " The Fungus Decompositions."

   " The Putrid Cell" we have found to spring entirely from the yolk; and it

seems to be the morbid growth of the bioplasm, which, had the egg been hatched,
would have gone to form the blood, bone, and tissues of the chicken.

    These cells gradually enlarge to several himdred times their original size, and at
the same time other cells develop in their interior. Ultimately the parent cell
bursts, and those in the inteiior take independent existence, and undergo the same
process of development. These cells convert oxygen into carbonic dioxide ; and

in one case, where an egg, which we ultimately found to have been decomposed

solely by this agent, was enclosed in an atmosphere of oxygen contained in a
bottle of 18-ounces capacity for 118 days, only 0-2 per cent, of oxygen remained,
9506 per cent, of carbonic dioxide and 4-74 per cent, of nitrogen, together with a
much smaller amount of other gases, were present. But oxygen is not necessary to
the growth of this peculiar ferment. In two eggs laid on the same day, which were
carefully and thoroughly varnished with shellac, and set aside on the same shelf,
exposed to the air for 1 year and 9 days, and then broken and examined, one was
found to be quite good, and free from smell or any germ of decomposition ; whilst
tlie other, on being struck with the point of a knife, burst open, and scattered part
of its contents in all directions. It was completely decomposed, and emitted a very
bad smell. The yolk was completely mixed up with the white ; and on micro-

scopical examination no other germ could be observed except multitudes of these
" putrid cells." If this ferment be mixed with water and whole eggs immersed

therein, these cells will penetrate the shells of the eggs and develop in their con-
tents. Germs of different animalculse are generally found on the outside of the

shells of eggs ; and when thus placed in water these animalculse develop and swim

about in the liquid.

In the above experiment it was remarkable to observe that four different kinds of

animalculse developed in the water in which the eggs were placed. One of these
we termed the "screw;" it had exactly the appearance of from one and a half to

two and a half turns of a corkscrew ; its body remained rigid, and propelled itself

along by turning quickly round, on the same principle that a corkscrew penetrates

a cork. The next two we termed respectively the unifilamented and bihlamented

fluke. Under the microscope they appeared like flukes, but their real appearance
resembled that of an egg. Some possessed one and some two filaments about three

times the length of themselves ; and by aid of these, which they switch into a
quick peristaltic motion in front of them, they were enabled to swim quickly along.
The fourth kind was the ordinary vibrio, which, together with the putrid cell,
were the only agents of decomposition which we ever found to penetrate the shell

of a whole egg and develop in its interior. In several other experiments eggs

were left in fluids containing immense numbers of these animalculse, but in
no case did we ever find that they had been able to pass through the shell of a

whole egg.

  --The Vibrio-decomposition. The class of animalculae to which we give the name

of " Vibrios " has been described in former papers by the late Dr. Crace-Calvert

before the Association. They resemble a worm in appearance. Their bodies

remain straight and rigid, and in most fluids which contain them some swim about
or move to and fi'o, and many are generally observed to be motionless and apparently

quite dead. The germs and dried bodies of these animalculse are wafted about in

the atmosphere, and seem to be natural to it. They are never found originally in

the contents of an egg, but are often found to be the cause of decomposition in

rotten eggs.

If the outside of the shells of eggs be kept dry fi'om the time they are laid, this

make tlieir way through the shell. If, however, the shell be kept wet for some time,

Athe egg is certain to become putrid by the agency of the vibrio.                                                                                  little of the albu-

menous contents dialyzes out, and thus gives the necessary food for the develop-

ment and growth of the vibrios or their germs, which are everywhere floating about
and it is only when they attain to a certain degree of vitality in the moisture on the
outside that they can make their way into the interior. These vibrios absorb oxy-

gen and give out carbonic dioxide. Eggs which are kept wet in oxygen very soon

become very putrid through this vibrio decomposition ; but in coal-gas and carbonic
dioxide the growth of the animalcule is prevented, and the egg generally remains

food. Vibrios were found in many eggs which had their shells pierced and were

ept dry                                     but in some, where                                              the shells were pierced, vibrios did not appear ;  the

If dry eggs are placed in a constant current of air they will seldom, if ever, be

attacked by this agent of decomposition ; the air-current seems to prevent them
from taking root on the shell ; but if, on the other hand, they be protected from

air-currents, this fungus generally makes its appearance and penetrates the shell.
The filaments then begin to spread in all directions. In some cases all sides of the
shell are boimd firmly together by these filaments, stretching from all sides ; so that
the egg could not be opened by the usual modes of operation, and the shell had to
be completely torn to pieces, or the binding filaments cut with a knife. In all cases

the filaments entwine into each other in the albuminous contents, forming themselves

into a semitransparent half-coagulated looking mass, and in many cases into a thick
coating of about the consistency of cheese. The greatest facility is afforded to this
fungus to pass through the shell when it is damp, as moisture enables the fungus to
take root ; and it is remarkable that, when penetration of the shell has thus taken
place, the calcareous matter of the shell is loosened, and when the outside is rubbed

it feels rough to the fingers. Its growth is entirely prevented by carbonic-acid gas
and coal-gas. Hydrogen and nitrogen do not permit it to grow, although they do

not seem to bo actually poisonous to it. It absorbs oxygen and liberates carbonic
dioxide, so that it flourisnes most luxuriantly in the former gas. Eggs decomposed

by the Pcnwiliu╗i-tila,nient9 emit no smell, as the round spores do not develop under
liquids or at the parts to which the filaments penetrate ; but the spores soon begin
to grow from the surface of any of the filaments exposed to the air, and the egg
then begins to exhale a mouldy smell.

   The filaments decompose the albumen, and liberate, among other products, a large
proportion of nitrogen, which we have ascertained beyond doubt by enclosing eggs,
in specially fitted bottles, in atmospheres of pure oxygen. As an example, on ana-
lysis of the resulting gas in one experiment, we found :

       On Modern Ethnoloqkcd Migrations in tlie British Isles.
                           By Dr. Beddoe, F.E.S.

Various causes have led in our own times to an extensive amount of migi'ation of

our people, executed peaceably, gradually, and by individuals or by families. lu

Britain a constant stream of population sets towards the capital, to a great extent

from distant counties, and including a considerable proportion of the upper and

middle classes. Elsewhere in Britain, and in Europe generally, the migration, as

a rule, talves place from poor to rich districts, from ill-employed to busy, from hilly

to plain, from rural to oppidan, from healthy to unhealthy districts. The efiect of

--mere proximity is often overborne by other circumstances. In Scotland there are

two currents one towards England and the other towards Glasgow. It is the
more Celtic of our people that form the masses which are attracted to our large

towns. Thus Glasgow receives a rapid influx of Irishmen and Highlanders. In

Edinburgh the case is diflerent, although there the Celtic element is strong in the

lower classes. In Liverpool this element is strengthened by constant Irish, Welsh,

and Scotch immigration. Irish blood abounds in most of the colliery districts of

the north of England. London has not a large proportion of Irishmen. In Ireland

itself Dublin was   formerly, but Belfast  is now, the  great  focus of  attraction                                               and
                                                                                                                               ;

even many of the smaller towns have attracted to themselves the neighbouring

Celtic population.

 Note on the River-Names and Popidatiotis of Hihernia, and their Relation to

                  the Old World and America, By Hyde Claeke.

    Having pointed out that a Celtic explanation for rivers in these islands is not
allsufficient, he called attention to the circumstance that the same names as in Ii'e-
land and Britain were found in Ancient India and elsewhere. Thus, Tamaros
and Tmnarns, Tavn and Tava, Tina and Tyna, Senus (Shannon) and Sonus, Tamesa
and Adamas, Tamion and Temala, Ausuha (Moy) and Sohanus, Ramus anAArabius,
Tobias and Attabas. Beyond this he referred to the conformity of these British and
Indian names with those of ancient civilized America, as Tamaros and Tamar, Senus
and Sinu, Ausoba and Sibu, Tamioii and Tamoin, in compliance with the general
fact of the almost identity of Indian and Peruvian names. This was referable, not
to the Phcenicians, but to that much earlier period of ci\ilization of the Sumir and
Accad in Babylonia, and to be called Sumirian, when the world was of one oificial
speech, and great monumental cities were raised by people speaking allied languages
in Southern Europe, Asia Minor, Babylonia, India, Indo-China, Peru, and Mexico,
To this epoch were to be referred the gold ornaments of Ireland and the fire-worship
of Baaltin, and perhaps the round towers in their origin. With regard to the very
varied population of Ireland, beyond Celtic, English, and the Basque, or so-called
Iberian types, Mr. Clarke considered it should be compared for higher and lower

Caucasian types. He recommended a close investigation of the names of places.

        Note on the Phoenician Inscription of Brazil. Bi/ Hyde Claeke.

   The author doubted its authenticity on internal evidence, as King Hiram would
not send an expedition from Eziongeber on the Eed Sea to America. The Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans, Australia, North and South America were known in the earliest

stages of learning in Babylonia, and were distinctly taught in the doctrine of the
Four Worlds by the School of Pergamos, and which lingered till the discoveries of
Columbus. The Canaanites were of the same speech as those allied to Sumir and

Accad of Babylonia, who had spread civilization throughout the world, and had occu-

pied and foimded Peru and Mexico. Although the Imowledge only existed in a
misunderstood tradition among the Greeks and Romans, it was accessible to the
Phoenicians ; and Hiram would have despatched his expeditious from Tyre, or
from Spain, and not from Eziongeber.

The Agaw Race in Caucasia, Africa, and South America.
                        By Hyde Ciaeke.

   The author gave a copious account of this family of languages as one of those

which denoted a general migration throughout the world. He first examined the

Abkhass of Caucasia, which he identified with the Achaia Vetus. Of this branch

he gave a detailed accoimt, suggesting that they were the Havilah of Genesis, the

Akaiusha of the Egyptians, and that tbey gave name to the people L-nown in Greece

as Achivi, and in the west as Aqiiitani. Passing to the Nile region, he compared

the language and gi-ammar of the Agaw and of the Falasha or Black Jews. In

India, he referred to the Kajunah and Gadaba as possibly allied. Tracing the

migration across the Pacific, he showed how widely spread the langiiage is, under

the names of Guarani and Omagua, in Brazil and Paraguay, driven forward by the
Aymara and Inca empires of the after-Sumirian migration.

Mr. Clarke suggested that some of the earlier river-names of the Old World and

America were Agaw, referring to Iberus, Siberis, Tiberis, Liparis, Baris, Para,

Parana, Parahyba, Paraguay. The Agaw race had never constituted cities and

kingdoms                                          such belonged  to  the  later  Sumirian  epoch.  In South America,
                                               ;

although covering such a vast extent, the people were in the same political con-

dition as in Abvssinia or Caucasia.

          A Note on Circassian and Etruscan. Bi/ Hyde Claeke,

   The author found that the Circassi tu was closely related to the Otoiui, Turahu-
uiara, Cora, and liuasteca of Mexico. This Circassian migration must have pre-
ceded that of the Sumirians across the Pacific, of the Aymaras and Incas in Peru,
of the Maya in Yucatan, and the Aztek in Mexico. At an historical period the
Otoniis are foimd turning back and attacldug the Mexican kingdoms. The relation-
ship of Otomi to the languages is distant, but yet showing the same affinities as
Circassian does to the Sumirian gi-oup in the Old World, and notably to Etruscan.
The Etruscan he regarded as distinctly Sumirian, on the evidence of its words, its
grammatical foi-ms, its numerals, mythology, and topographical names. The par-
ticle tl was foimd in Circassian and in Etruscan languages.

A Prelimhiary Note on the Classification of the AJcka and Pygmy Lanyuages

                            of Africa. By Hyde Claf.ke.

   This was an inquiry undertaken at the request of the Italian Geographical Society
with regard to the dwarfs seen by Schweinfurth, Miani, and Professor Owen, and

now at Naples. The language is not related to the languages of the Bushmen,

Mincopies, Fuegians, Shoshons, and other short races. It conformed to that of the

Obongo, the discovery of which by Du Chaillu in West .\frica had been discredited,

but was thus confirmed. Its other African relations were with the Moko, Rungo,

Gonga, Ankaras, and Wuni ; for besides the Pygmies of the Nile, the ancients had
referred to Pygmies in India. Mr. Clarke had made a special examination and
found traces of Akka and Obongo where they would naturally be distributed among

the Garos, the Nagas, and the Gadaba, Savara, &c. The African types were di-
stinctly traceable in languages related to the Caiib in South America, as Bauiwa,
Ueanambeii, Tocantins, &c. It is evident, however, that the shorter races and
languages are mixed up with those of more powerful Dahomans and Caribs, which

will have to be divided. The Akka words for woman are of the most ancient type,

and preserved by us and other civilized races to this day. The whole formation is
prehistoric. Thus tooth, tusk, horn, and bone afford the names for elephant and
Dull, and leg for fowl.

    With regard to the neighbours of the Akka, the Niam-Niam, Mr. Clarke stated
that the course of the migration was that of the boomerang (of Col. Lane Fox) in
 a line of legends of cannibals, filed teeth and tailed men from Afi-ica, through the

 Australasian archipelago to Australia.

On the Blstrilution of the Baces of Men inhabiting the Jiimmoo and Kashmir
                Territories. By Feedeeic Deew, F.G.S., F.E.G.S.

   From their position at the very north-west corner of India, at that part of its

mountain barrier which has been the seat probably of some of the earliest settle-

ments of the races which now form the chief part of the population of India, these

territories both present ethnological problems of the deepest interest, and aflbrd a

rare store of facts available for their solution. In this paper the author desires to

contribute some facts from his own observation without attempting much in the
way of inference from them.

   In the enumeration of the races the principle is adopted of taking them as they
exist now in communities having common characteristics (what may be called
nations, even though they may not in most cases possess political uni^), and not
the principle of tracing out each caste in the various localities. For instance,
among the Dogras, Paharis, and Kashmiris, there are many of the Brahman caste,
and to the two former several other castes are common. The tracing of each caste
through the various nations in the hope of throwing light on their origin would

be an interesting task, but the author has not been able to collect materials for

it. He has taken the broad distinctions of commimities as they actually exist, and

mapped them village by village.
   The distribution, as well as the characteristics, of the difierent races ia much

affected by the physical features of the country. Geographically, the first division
is to be drawn between those on the south-west side and those on the north-west
aide of the snowy range which makes the watershed between the Cbinab and
Jhelam rivers on the one hand and the Upper Indus on the other.

   In the basins of the Chinab and Jhelam (in the latter of which is included the
covmtry of Kashmir) are found the four races Dogrds, Pahdris, Kashmiris, and
Chibhdlis. All these are of Aryan origin, and, though differing among each other,
have all a countenance of distinct Aryan type.

   The Dogras occupy certain portions of the outer ranges of the Himalayas, fi-om
the foot of the hills at a level of 1000 feet above the sea to heights of 3000 and
perhaps 4000 feet. They are a race of fair height, but slim ; active, but not power-
ful. They have well-formed and rather delicate features. Their complexion is of
a brown colour, like that of the almond-husk, but rather darker. They are divided
up into castes, in great part corresponding with those foimd among the other Hindus.

   The Pahdris* occupy the higher mountains next beyond ; their dwellings are at
heights from 3000 or 4000 feet up to 9000 or 10,000 feet ; they are, moreover, in
some cases, sitiiated between mountains of much greater altitude. The men of this
race are stronger, of a more powerful frame, than the Dogras, but still they are
active. They have good features, thoroughly Aiyan, a good brow, and a decidedly
hooked nose. Both in appearance and disposition they are very different from the
Dogr.as ; their habitat among the hills where snow falls has been the cause of many
diflerences both in their customs and their nature.

   In the Kashmiris, whose race is the next to be mentioned, the differences which
existed between the Dogras and the Paharis (at all events as far as physique is con-
cerned) are carried further. The Kashmiris have a very powerful frame, broad
shoulders, muscular backs, and strong limbs. In feature they present probably the
best form of the Aryan type of countenance. They commonly have a high and wido
forehead, a square brow, and a well-shaped nose, which in the older people becomes

curved.

   The Kashmiris occupy their own enclosed valley of Kashmir, and have spread
from it somewhat and formed isolated colonies, both in the neighbom-ing hills and

at a greater distance.
   Inquiry has at different times been instituted about the Kashmiri language, and

a good deal of information has been given, both as to its vocabulary and its grammar,
notably by Mr. Bowring, Sir George Campbell, and Dr. Elmslie. The author is not
in a position to add to this ; but he wishes to point out what has hitherto not been
observed, that the Kashmiri is one of a group of languages or dialects. The
I'aliaris before described speak not one but several dialects, and these are closely

connected with Kashmiri. One of these may be reckoned as about halfway between

Dogii and Kashmiri (Dogri itself being connected with Panjabi and Hindi), while

other of these dialects approach still more closely to Kashmiri. Some special cha-

racteristics of that language, such as the occurrence of ts and z, where in Hindi
dialects ch andj would occur, are found in all the Pahari languages.

   We thus find that, in language as well as in physique, a passage more or less

gradual can be traced from the Dogi-as, through the Paharis, to the Kashmiris.

   To understand our next division, we must first consider the religion of those races

that have been enumerated.
    Of the Dogi'iis, by far the larger portion are Hindus. The Paharis are almost

entirely Hindus. The Kashmiris, originally Hindus, have been so far Muhamma-

 danized that perhaps only one tenth remain of their old faith, and nine tenths

are followers of Muhammad.

   Now the Chibhdlis, our next race, are all Muhammadans. They consist of people

of two, or possibly of three, of the former divisions who have become Muhamma-

 dan and have acquired, partly from that reason, and partly from geographical sepa-

 ration, such characteristics as may now entitle them to be called a race. The

 Chibhalis extend from the outermost hills between the Ohinab and Jhelam rivers
 northwards over mountains of 8000 and 10,000 feet in height. Those in the

    * The word Pahdri means in the Hindi dialects " mountaineer." The Dogras, how-
 ever, commonly restrict the use of it to denote the particular race in question, and I follow
 the practice for want of another name.

southern part of this area are distinctly Dogras who have been converted to Muham-

madanisni. Further north they seem to have been originally more like the Paharis.
Yet further north, those called in this paper Chibhalis have possibly a greater

ethnological connexion with the Kashmiris.

  We have now reached the high mountains. These are so lofty and inaccessible

that the inhabitants are restricted to the valleys which ramify among them.

Here to the north and north-east of the snowy range we find one race of

Aryan origin, the Ddrds. These Dards, as has been shown by an examination of

their languages (into which Dr. Leitner, if not the first, has been by far the most

complete and successful inquirer), and as can be inferred from their physiognomy,

are of Aryan origin. Into these territories they came from the north-west, gradually

migrating                                          their furthest point in  a southerly direction is four days' march  short of
                                                ;

the capital of Kashmir ; in reaching this they spread over the watershed into the

basin of one of the tributaries of the Jhelam ; to the south-east also spreading

they reached to within the boundary of Ladakh. Their villages are at levels from

4000 feet high (in the Indus valley near to Gilgit) up to 10,000 feet.

The Dards are tall men, broad-shouldered, and well-proportioned ; they are bold

and active mountaineers. They have a good cast of countenance, though they

seldom reach to the degree of being handsome. Their haii- is generally black, but

sometimes brown ; in this they show a difterence fi'om all the other races we have

dealt with, among whom black hair is, the author believes, universal. Their eyes

are either brown or hazel ; he does not think that he has seen any blue.

  For religion, the Dards of these territories had formerly an idolatry of which we
know little, and which may or may not have resembled that of the Hindiis. They

have now become for the most pai-t Muhammadan; but a few villages, from their

contact ^vith the Ladakhis (a contact probably that occurred before the introduction

of Muhammadanism), have adopted the Buddhist faith.

  We now leave the Aryan and come to three subdivisions of the Tibetan race.

   People of this race ex'teud all along the Indus valley and into the vaiious tri-

butaiy valleys from Chinese Tibet down to below Skardii. At one spot only within
the territories we are treating of are they found on the south side of the snowy
range. These Tibetans must have come from the south-east, where the main mass

of their race now live. They must have come, in search of a livelihood, across a
long stretch of uninhabitable country. As they reached parts of the Indus valley

fit for grazing and for dwelling in, they stayed with their flocks, herds, and tents.

Again, they found their way further down the valley to where cultivation was

practicable, and there they became agricultural.

Of our three subdivisions all speak dialects of the same Tibetan tongue, and all

have something of the Tibetan or Chinese cast of features. There are, first, the

Chdmpds, those on the south-east ;                                          these  are  still  nomadic  tent-dwellers                                                      they
                                                                                                                                                                        ;

have sheep and goats and yaks ; they occupy high-level valleys at altitudes of 14,000

and 15,000 feet, changing' their camp according as the season of the year gives most

pasture in one place or another.

   Next are the Ladakhis, settled Tibetans, dwellers in villages at heights of from

13,000 down to 10,000 feet.
   The people of these two subdivisions, the Champas and the Ladakhis, are

Buddliists.

   The thii-d subdivision is the Balii race. The Baltis were formerly the same as
the Ladakhis, but now they so far differ from them that they have become Muham-
madan, and have acquired peculiarities that arise from the customs which that

religion brings with it.

   Thus with these various races has been filled up the space, all or neaily all the

habitable ground, of the territories named.
   Of the bearing of the facts of distribution on the general question of the mode of

peopling of these countries, little more can at present be said than that it seems

quite clear that the Tibetans came into the area we are dealing with from the
south-east, and that the Dards came into it from the north-west and north. Of the

four races enumerated on the south side of the snowy range, the course of migra-
tion is not plain. But it is something to know the connexion that exists between

each of them--to know that, in spite of the diflerences, one can pass, not very gra-
--150 EEPORT 1874.

dually, perhaps, but still without any great break, from the Kashmiris to the Dogras,

who themselves are related not distantly to the people of tli8 plains of India.
   The races spoken of are those which make the great majority of the population

of the various districts mapped. In some parts these are mixed up with the small

numbers of the remnants of the pre-Aryaa inhabitants. Among the Dogras and

Paharis, the tribes or castes called (in ascending order of social position) Dums,

Meghs, and Dhiyars are of this older blood. Among the Kashmiris, a low caste,

called " Batal," seem from their position and occupations to have a similar origin.
The Dards also, and the Tibetans as well, contain certain classes whose partial

social separation from the others may denote that they have sprung from such an
old source ; but if so, they have become much more nearly allied, by mixing of

blood, to the Dards and Tibetans respectively, whom they live with, than is the

case with the low castes among the Dogras.
   Maps illustrating the subject of this paper have been prepared, one of which,

enlarged, was shown to the Section. The author desired it to be understood
that it was chiefly the information on geographical distribution of the races as
laid down on this map that was original ; the enumeration of most of the races had
been made by previous authors; especially was acknowledgment due to Sir G.

Campbell's paper "On the Ethnology of India" in the Journal of the Asiatic

 Society of Bengal.

    The Degeneracy of Man. By the E,ev. Joseph Edkins, Pelcing, China.

    This paper was divided into four sections. In the first the question was stated.
Races occupying a continent are more civilized than those which inhabit islands
at a great distance from continents. The intellect of nations sinks in power under
 geographical conditions of an unfavourable nature.

    The influences which tend to improve the human race and aid its progress

 were enumerated, viz. genial climate, intercourse with civilized races, religious

 iTaining, the discovery of metals, &c.

    The unfavourable influences were then detailed, viz. loss of knowledge, restricted
 acquaintance with nature, &c.

    Asia was probably the birthplace of the whole human family ; and the question

 is, therefore, whether the inhabitants of Polynesia, America, and Africa are not
 all degraded Asiatics, and the Europeans improved Asiatics.

    To help in solving this question linguistic, moral, social, and religious facts
 must be collected and compared.

     This paper simply drew together a few facts from China, Polynesia, and America.
    Though the question of degeneracy chiefly affects savages, the paper stated that
 there were some things in regard to China which deserved consideration.
    The second section treated of China. China, though isolated by the Tartarian
 desert and the mountains of Tibet, showed vestiges of communication with the
 west, both recently and in extreme antiqjiity.
    The old signs of connexion with Wes1;fern Asia were the cycle of sixty, made by
 the combinations of ten and twelve, a dual philosophy, a hebdomadal division
 of time, a doctrine of five elements, wl^cli require us to assume ancient connexions
 with Babylon. To these should be added the arts of weaving, writing, astronomical

                                                                                     _

 calculations, divination, agriculture, which seem to show that Chinese primeval
 civilization was certainly not self-originated.

     Subsequently the degeneracy of China was prevented by the opening up of
 communication with the west and by other causes, such as the establishment of
  education through the country.

     The extension of the Chinese empire, so as to embrace Turkestan and Cochin
  China, about 1900 years ago, and the introduction of Buddhism, which taught the
  Chinese Hindoo science, and with it Greek science, powerfully tended to prevent

  the decline of the Chinese intellect.
     It was then pointed out that China has been a civilizing mother to all the neigh-

 bouring nations. Corea was civilized, and Japan through Corea. The coins, paper
  money, politics, and arts of Japan are all copies of Chinese types.

                              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                            151

   The fruitfulness of Chinese civilization among all her neighbours should lead us
to expect that its influence has reached much further, viz. among the islands of the

Pacific and on the American continent.
   The third section treated of Polynesia. Hindoo ideas of religion and cosmogony

penetrated beyond Java into some of the Polj-nesian islands. Chinese navigators

used to malce voyages to Ceylon and still more distant points in the Indian Ocean.

A thousand years before Christ there was extensive commerce in the Indian Ocean

carried on by the various inhabitants of western nations.
   The extension of the Malay and Polynesian languages from the Sandwich Islands

to Madagascar should be looked at in the light of this fact. The military enter-
prises, mercantile activity, and spread of the arts in the Indian and Pacific Oceans

of that time are lost to history; but the sculptured remains in Easter Island, the
striking indications of Semitic influence, and the existence anciently of a higher

knowledge of navigation than now indicate degeneracy in the Polynesians.
   The knowledge of their own traditions is rapidly disappearing, as shown in the

experience of missionaries resident in tie islands. The Rev. W. Gill, of Mangaia, by

great efibrt obtained amounts of old cosmological and mythological beliefs, and he

is now the sole depository of them, the old people that supplied them having died

and left no disciples to transmit the knowledge of them. This is proof that the
knowledge of these islanders tends to become more and more circumscribed as the

ages roll on.

   The Polynesians all count, or could once count, to a hundred, and did so when

their ance.stors spoke a common lauguage. This is proof of former high civilization
for decimal notation, though consistent with savage life when isolation has caused

degeneracy, always bespeaks civilization in the time of a nation's early history.
   If the I'olynesians, as these facts show, were formerly civilized, it was because

of their connexion with Asia. That connexion is proved by identity of customs
and beliefs with those of Asia ; for example, the practice of circumcision in Tonga
with other Semitic customs, the belief in paradises and a pantheon, which remind
the inquirer of India. Their language has words arranged in a Semitic order,
agreeing also with the order of words in the Siamese and Anuamite languages.
The Polynesians avoid the mention of the proper name of persons held in honour.

Their honorific phraseology is in this and other respects very like the Chinese.

Among the Chinese linguistic peculiarities found in the languages of Polynesia
may be mentioned the extensive use of numeratives between numbers and nouns,

as in the Ponapean. This is not Aiyan, nor Semitic, nor Ural Altaic ; but is both

Chinese and Polynesian, and exists extensively in the Caroline Islands. It is a

fact of the greatest importance in the linguistic part of the argument.

   The logic may here be reversed. The connexion with Asia being proved, dege-
neracy is proved too. Among the races of Asia the northern were in one respect
inferior to the Polynesians, as shown by the want of identity in names of number.

   The fourth section was on America. The geometrically constructed mounds in

North America prove deterioration.
   In America the facts are mixed ; in Polynesia they are of one kind. In America

the facts point to North Asia and to South Asia ; in Polynesia the facts point to

Southern Asia only.

    In America the art of writing, belief in paradises and future punishment, the use

of  idols  in  temples,  &c.  indicate  connexion  with  Southern Asia                                                 so also traditions
                                                                                                                    j

of the deluge and certain linguistic laws.
   The best hypothesis for the origin of the Mexican and Peruvian civilization is

an immigration within the tropics and across the Pacific. The small islands of
the Pacific represent much larger tracts which have at some unknown epoch
become submerged. The ancient civilization of Polynesia points out the path by
which the higher products of the intellect in the form of civilized ideas and customs

could most conveniently find their way to America.
   The Mexican idea of the deluge is of South-Asiatic origin. The Mexican pictm-es,

idols, and temples resemble those of Southern Asia rather than those of China.
   The doctrine of future punishments, as believed by North-American tribes, is

more like the ideas ofSouthem Asia.
   The Northern Asiatic languages havo strongly marked peculiarities, which are

found in some of the most widely-spread Indian languages. Professor Rochrig, in
his tract on the Dacota language, points out the intensitive in adjectives as a remark-
able instance of resemblance in that Indian tongue to the Mongol.

Dacota : sa-pa, Mack ; sap-sa-pa, very black.
Mongol : hara, black ; hab-hara, very black.

While the Dacota resembles in many respects a Tartar language, it places the ad-

jective after the substantive, in whicfi respect it departs from the Northern Asiatic

type, and follows the Polynesian, the Siamese, and the Semitic.

It is this mixture of linguistic principles which forms the key to solve the problem

of the origin of the North-American languages. The Dacota language is now

accessible to ethnological inquiry in the exceptionally good dictionary and grammar

Aof the llev. S. R. Riggs, both included in the Smithsonian series.  predominant

Tartar structure is the basis of the language ; a limited Polynesian element, with
certain features of home growth, form the remainder of the type. The facts of the

Dacota are fatal to the theory of some American philologists, who, on a priori and

unscientific grounds, refuse to recognize the possibility of a common origin to the

Ural, Altaic, and Dacota languages.

The author proceeded to say that a remarkable instance of mixture occurs in the

case of the Algonquins, in recent times the most widely spread of the North-

American races. Their language is fundamentally of the northern Asiatic type, as

may be seen in Howse's grammar of the Cree ; and they have the adjective in its

right place, but they are more Indian and less Asiatic than the Dacota. In regard

to religion, however, they have mixed elements. The offerings to ancestors are

Northern Asiatic and Chinese. Their view of the future state is so nmch of the

Southern Asiatic type, that it embraces transmigration, which was unknown to

China and Tartary before the spread of Buddhism.

The Patagonian religion, as recently described by M. Glardon, is strikingly like

that of Siberian tribes, and he grounds upon their beliefs an eloquent defence of the

doctrine of the imity of the human race.

The paper concluded with tlie statement that whether the Mexicans be compared

with the Southern Asiatics or the existing Indian tribes with the Mongols and

Tm-ks, the process alike gives proof of degeneracy.

                                    Longevity at Five score eleven Years.

                    By Sir G. Duncan Gibb, Bart., M.D., LL.D.

   The author had brought forward nine examples at the previous meeting of the Asso-
ciation of persons who had overstepped the century by several years ; and now his
tenth instance of a female still living at Tring, in JHertfordshire, who had attained

her hundred and eleventh birthday in April last, was given. He first gave some

tables, carefully compiled by Mr. Henry Ranee, of Cambridge, containing 84 in-
stances of persons whose age extended from 107 to 175 ; 40 of these were under
130, and 44 above that age ; and he considered that three fourths of the total
number might be taken as con-ect. The proof of tliat was the instance he brought
forward of Mrs. Elizabeth Leatherlund, now alive in her 111th yeai*, the baptism

of whom was given from the register of the parish of Dover in Kent. This was

fm-ther confirmed by the di-owning of her sou and his family, and other persons, to
the number of thirty-seven, at Hadlow in Kent in 185.3, in the hop country, by a
catastrophe mentioned and described in the papers of the time. Her son was
then 59, and if now alive would have been 80, his bii-th occurring when his
mother was 29 or 30. Other corroborative circumstances were stated, clearly

establishing the great age of the old dame, who was of gipsy descent. The author

then described her condition, the result of a careful personal examination at Tring in
October 1873. She walked with the aid of a stick, was short in stature, bent with
age, complexion brownish, countenance a series of thick folds, and she had several

sound teeth. She chatted away continually in a clear distinct voice, and was in
possession of all her faculties, though somewhat impaired. Slie is a little deaf,
takes snuif, her skin was as soft as velvet, and her hair quite grey. She was thin,

and the muscles of her neck stood out in bold relief. All her internal organs were
in perfect health, lungs, heart, &c., and her pulse was as regular and soft as in a girl
of 18. In fact the changes of old age, as mot with in persons from 70 to 80, had
not taken place in any of the tissues of the body, being thus similar to the nine
other cases examined by the author. She was, of course, feeble ; but, taking all things

together, that did not prevent her reaching to her present exceptionally great age.

--Her age, the author said, taught us two lessons one was the absence of senUe

changes for the most part in centenarians, which was the chief reason of their
attaining to such a great age ; the other the occurrence now and then of instances
wherein even six score years is reached, if not more. To ignore all past cases of
extreme ultra-ceutenarian longevity because we cannot get at their proofs at the
present day, he considered unphilosophical and unscientitic ; for there existed as con-
scientious and painstaking inquirers after truth then as exist now, whose statements
and recorded facts must not be wholly ignored, as every honest investigator well
knows.

            Notes on the rude Stone Monuments of the Khasi Hill Tribes.

                 Ry Major H. H. Godwin- Axtsten, F.R.G.S. ^c.

   In continuation of previous communications on these monuments, the author

gave some further details derived from another visit to the Khasi Hills. Ho

described the monoliths standing in the village of Nougshai, near Shillong. At-
tention was also directed to the cairns in the Khasi HUls. These cairns are to be
seen only on the north side of the Khasi plateau. Similar cairns were, however,
observed by the author near North Munipur.

On the Character and Distribution of rudely worked Flints in the Counties of

Origin and Characteristics of the People in the Counties of Down and Antrim ;
      an Ethnological Shetch. By the Rev. Canon Hume, D.C.L., LL.D.

Omitting all but a passing notice of the early inhabitants of the district, the

writer started from the beginning of the seventeenth century. The resident Irish

were then one assimilated, if not a homogeneous people ; and the English and

Scotch immigrants formed two other great constituents. The former were traced

from the shore of the channel at Oarrickfergus, past Lisburn, and along by the

Lagan  and  Bann   and the shores of  Lough Neagh                                                                                                                      while the latter passed inland,
                                                                                                        ;

from the projecting points of Galloway and Cantyre, by Donaghadee and Carrick-

fergus. These were known respectively, imtil within the last few years, as the

English and Scotch districts, the native Irish occupying the mountains and bogs.

In illustration of the general subject, the writer referred in detail to numerous

topics, showing that the characteristics are preserved to this hour with more or less

distinctness. Thus the names of townlands are often translated, and their English

equivalents used; but in a far greater number of instances a family surname is

affixed to Bally, Bun, Rath, Fort, or Lisna. And the surnames themselves are

curioiis, those of English, Irish, and Scotch origin occupying their respective

localities, though some, lilfe Moore, Smith, Thomson, Hamilton, Johnson, and

Patterson, are widely dithised. In other instances, especially in the Irish disti'icts,

particular names are confined within narrow local limits, like the names of the

Highland clans. In their case also epithets become surnames, especially those

indicative of complexion, so that new sm-names, such as Roe and Bawn, arise like
Roy and Dhu in Scotland. Surnames are also translated, so that many persons

have two distinct names, an Irish one and an English one, as M'^Giirnaghau,

Gordon ; Ilamish,  James ;  M'^Elshender, Alexander                                                                                                                    M<^retrich, Fitzpatrick.  The
                                                                                                                                                                    ;

evidence from manners and customs is very marked. There are the three types of

cider and mead, while the Scotchman rejoices in brose, porridge, and oatcake, and
the Irishman is confined to the use of the potato and some cheap condiment.

   So lately as 1820 Irish was spoken occasionally in the mountainous districts of
both counties, and broad Scotch near the coast and in a direct line inland ; while in
the English district Shakspeare was read without the help of a glossary, and the

expressions in ' L'AUegro ' and ' II Penseroso ' were those of daily life. Now much

of this has passed away, and there is a well-defined provincial dialect, but with very
marked local differences. There is a large amount of traditional ballad poetry, and

many of the pieces which were published by Percy and Scott are well known to
hundreds who never saw them in print. But the most permanent difference is

found in the creeds of the people, for time does not appear to effect any appreciable
change. In large and in small districts, not only here but in all Ireland, the rule
is for one of the three religious communities to amount to more than 50 per cent,
of the gross population ; the exception is for the three to exist in approximately

equal number. The Irish as a whole are Roman Catholics, the Scotch are Presby-
terians, and the EnglishTrotestant Episcopalians. In the county of Down one creed

preponderates in 81 per cent, ofthe places which were separately enumerated in 1861;
in the province of Ulster the percentage is 78, and in aU L-eland 86. Though this
variety of population is sometimes attended with inconvenience, as in the case of
popular riots, it is on the whole beneficial, by the sustained rivalship, not of indi-

viduals merely, but of large associations of men. And the writer pointed with

confidence to the state of the district in corroboration of his sentiments.

                On the Anthropology of Prehistoric Peru.
By T. J. Hutchinson, F.R.O.S., late H.B.M. Consul for Callao.

This memoir was illustrated by photographs, diagrams, and sketches of many

ruins of prehistoric Peru. With these were illustrations of several items of Mr.

Hutchinson's collection of Peruvian antiquities, now being exhibited at the Bethnal

Green Museum in London. The paper commenced by recording how little is

known up to the present of the glorious days of Peru, long before the time of the

Incas ; and the author conveyed his agi-eement with Mr. Baldwin as to the original

South-Americans (notably those of Peru) being the oldest people on that continent.

It proceeded to show how little dependence was to be placed on the romantic

gasconading of the Spanish writers, with regard to the Incas, of whose fabulous

origin and mythological genealogy no account was ti'aced by them to a period

further back than about seven centuries ago, or close to the time when William the

Conqueror came to England. It likewise discussed the wi-itings of various authors

of whose works translations have been recently published by the Hakluyt Society,

mshowing them to be full of anomalies and contradictions, the vain attempt to

make the Incas be considered the earliest civilized race of Peru. The grandeur

in extent of the ancient burial-mounds was a wonderful thing. It was shown by

the diagrams and illustrations. The colossal work of those done by human hands

(and some of them measuring from 20 to 24 millions of cubic feet) proved what

a superior race these early Peruvians must have been. The difference in mm-ale,

as in physique, of modem Peruvians and Chinese was commented upon to sug-

gest that there could not have been (though supposed by very high authority)

a homogeneity of ori^n. The paper further made a compai-ison of the burial-
mounds explored by Messrs. Squier and Davis in the valleys of the Ohio and

Mississippi, with those examined by the author in Peru. This showed the greater

magnitude of the works in the latter country as regarded their size, although in

Amathematical construction both presented a similarity.  curious feature in the

Peruvian mounds, as well as ruins of fortresses, consists in the fact that their

terraces, bastions, squares, and other architectural features have an almost invari-

able measurement in multiples of twelve. The prehistoric ruins of Peru, described
by Professor Raimondy in his recent work on the mineral riches of the department

of Ancachs, were mentioned as highly interesting. Extraordinary things are the
tombs cut out in the solid rock. But more wonderful still is the fact that these

areof a stony formation, entirely different to the geology of the neighbourhood in
which they are found, thus evidencing that these immense boulders, which are of

diorite, though invariably observed amongst sandstone strata, have baen brought
over the mountains and through the valleys of these apparently impassable Andes.
The modus operandi of such transport is as yet an insoluble problem. One of the
rock griives is described as fashioned in the shape of an egg (cut crossways), the
upper part serving as a lid to cover the body when deposited within. The author
concludes that, until a better system shall be adopted of examining ruins of burial-

grounds, mounds, and fortresses than has hitherto prevailed, the most we can learn

of prehistoric Peru will be little better than guesswork, dreaming, and speculation.
The paper touched on the hyperbolical stories about Peruvian gold (rich though
the country is in minerals), on the ancient navigation by haUas, and the wonderful

--works in art and manufacture of the early Peruvians : " One of these primary tribes

of people who, leaving no chronicle or history behind them but their works, have
gradually disappeared from the face of the earth by some of those mysterious and
inscrutable laws which Divine Providence dispenses for the rise and fall of the
races of mankind." The author added that in the ' Guide to Belfast ' compiled by
members of the Belfast Naturalists' I'ield-Club for the use of members of the

--British Association, the following statement was made at page 194, imder the head

of " Sepulchral Monuments : " " The popidar idea is that all or nearly all the old
forts were constructed by the Danes; but this is quite en-oneous. The gi-eater
number of our ancient national monuments were erected hundreds of years before
the lauding of the Danes in Ireland." Just such a popular and erroneous idea as
this existed in Peru with reference to the great works there being accredited to the

Incas, whereas they were daily finding out that they were erected, like the Irish
forts and mounds, hundreds if not thousands of years before there was an Inca in

the land. He added that the process of inhumation used in prehistoric times in

Ireland seemed to have been the same as in Peru.

A Glimpse of Prehistoric Times in the North of Ireland.

                By William James Knowles.

In many parts of the north of Ireland, especially along the sea-coast, quantities

of flint flakes are foimd, collected together or lying scattered about, supposed to be

the remains of flint-implement manufactories. Recently there have been found by

the author at Portstewart, co. Derry, mixed up with such flakes, between 500

and GOO manufactured articles, such as scrapers, arrowheads, &c., together with

fragments of broken pottery, numerous bones and teeth of horse, ox, dog, &c., and

shells mostly of the same species as are now found along the sea-shore in that

neighbourhood. The objects are found in pits excavated by the wind among sand-

hills about a mile from Portstewart, and near the mouth of the River Bann, and

have fallen to the bottom of those pits out of blackened layers seen on the sides.

These blackened layers represent the ancient sm-face at the time the place was

occupied by the prehistoric races, and are now covered over with sand from about

10 to 30 feet in thickness. The wind removes the sand as the sides of the pits

crumble down, leaving the flakes, manufactiured articles, teeth, and bones in the

bottom. Scrapers amoimt to about GO per cent, of the manufactured articles,

arrowheads only 2 per cent. ; and the great preponderance of scrapers and paucity of

arrowheads was accounted for on the grounds that scrapers were easier of manu-

facture than .arrowheads, and flakes suitable for tlie manufacture of the one were

more abundant than those that would do for the other. Besides, scrapers would

likely be employed in the preparation of skins for clothing ; and that being a home

operation many of them would bo found, while an-owheads would be used at a

distance, and therefore would not be so likely to be found near the place of manu-

facture. Several scrapers with concave scraping-edges were found, and are supposed

to have been used in stripping bark ofl" young branches for the purpose of curing

skins, or for touching up portions of the slrin after being gone over by the scraper

circular stones with holes in the centre, one whole but very poor stone celt, and a

portion of a broken one were found ; but it is rather remarkable that no trace of
any thing resembling a flint a.xe was found in a place where flakes, cores, and manu-
--156 REPORT 1874.

factured flint implements are so abundant. The flint used appears to be rolled

flints gathered on the shore ; but if the prehistoric races of the north of Ireland

were the flint-implement manufacturers for the whole of Ireland, as the author

believes was the case, he considers that the supply of rolled and drift flints would

be inadequate, and that we may look for evidence of mining having been carried on

to obtain flint.

  A circular stone with a flat edge, that could have been used for grinding grain,

and several pieces of the top of a quern were found, from which the author con-

cludes that the ancient people cultivated gi'ain of some kind. There were no shell
movmds found, like the " Kitchen middens," nor were there any fish-boaes found,

which was considered strange owing to the sea and a good fish river like the Bann
being so near. Some of the bones were cut previous to breaking them to extract

the marrow ; and two bones were found manufactured into articles of use, one of

which might have served as a whistle, and the other resembles a tool used by

thatchers, called a " spurtle." From the fact of finding the spurtle, and there
being several heaps of large stones among the sand, it was concluded that the pre-

historic races resided permanently here and in thatched houses. No trace of

ornament of any kind was found, but from finding several rubbed ochreous stones

it was believed they painted the skin. The pottery was of two kinds, but that

most abundant was coarse and similar in shape and ornamentation to sepulchral

urns.  One  human  bone was  found                           but  the  author  stated that he was unable to
                                                          ;

decide whether they burned their dead before burial or whether they were cannibals.

Traces of fire were common. He was of opinion, from their so patiently cutting the

bone previous to breaking it to get the marrow, that they were not a ravenous

people, and that food was abundant. He hoped, in conclusion, that further search

would give us a clearer insight into the manners and customs of this ancient people.

  The Metliods of a Cojnplete Anthropology. By the Rev. T. M'Cann, D.D,

   Anthropology is defined to be the stiidy of all the phenomena of the individual

man. Man is a being who not only digests and assimilates, but also knows and
feels. The former phenomena are considered in the Department of Anatomy and

Physiology. The results of the faculties called mental alone are left for consideration
in the Anthropological Department: these are the most important to man as such.
This Department is only partially anthropological, while it confines its attention to
the manifestations of mind in life and social customs. At present subjective obser-
vation and experiment (psychology) are excluded. Practically this is best, though
theoretically it is wrong and imscientific. But it is not possible wholly to exclude
them ; in point of fact psychological phenomena are very largely introduced. The

author then referred to the introduction of such subjects into the President's
Address for this year ; and in order that such questions should be thoroughly dis-
cussed, he proposed that papers on psychology alone should be read on one of the days
appointed for sectional meetings, or to form a separate department for this subject,

or else to originate a Society where men of opposite schools could meet and debate

these disputed points as has never been done previously.

                   On M'Lennan's Theory of " Primitive Marnage."
                               By Joseph John Muephy.

   The author accepted Mr. M'Lennan's theory that in the earliest societies marriage
in one sense was unknown, and that marriage (and consequently paternal autho-
rity) began with the practice of bride-stealing ; but he dissented from Mr. M'Lennan's
theory that the impulse to bride-stealing arose from the scarcity of women from the
practice of female infanticide. There seems to be no suflicient evidence of this

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

and such a practice would tend to the extinction of the tribe practising it. The
writer attributed the impidse to bride-stealing partly to the desire of each man to
have a wife of his own (which in the earliest times could be only as the residt of
capture), partly to the instinctive impulse to mix the race. So soon as any tribe
adopted bride-stealing generally, and as a consequence marriage and paternal

authority, the social cohesion produced by paternal authority would give that tribe
an ascendency among its neighbours, and cause its customs to spread.

On " An Aye of Colossi," with Examples, hy Photographs and Dratvinc/s, of
   the various Colossi extant in Britain and Ireland. By J. S. Phen]6, F.S.A.,

    F.B.Q.S.

   This was the continuation of a subject commenced by the author at Bradford.
Some instances of similar customs between the Egyptians, early people of America,
and Chinese (the latter being, in his opinion, the most modern) were refen-ed to as
showing a similarity of treatment and worship of the Nile and the Mississippi rivers
by the vast similitudes found along the margins of each, indicating that the ancient
constructors of these similar designs on both rivers had a common origin ; hence
that it was probable that America was peopled by Western-Asian emigration prior
to the central parts of Europe or even of Central Asia, as the facility for a coast-
line route would be much greater than an overland one to migratory people.

   Subsequently a new feature presented itself in Egypt, of which he saw no
evidence in America, the absence of which was well accounted for. In Egypt the
River Nile became identified as the gi-eat beneficent serpent from the actual support
of the Egyptian nation, through the river casting its great annual slough of mud, as
the serpent casts its skin, giving a really tangible meaning to the adoption by the
Egj'ptians of the casting of the sei-pent's skin as an emblem not only of revivification
but of immortality, the actual permanence of the nation depending upon it.

   In China, which he considered peopled subsequently to America, the same featiu?e
was found in a new phase. Instead of vast rivers being bordered with the great
Colossi found in Egj'pt and America, artificial winding ways or courses, of sinuous
and symmetrical an-angement, leading to tomb-temples, as in Egypt, were found,
bordered with huge representations of animals as various and as mysterious as
similitudes on the Mississippi rivers ; and these courses or ways were, as far as he

--liad at present been able to learn, called serpents by the Chinese a fact by no means

improbable in a country where the serpent or dragon is a religious emblem even to
the present time. From these similar customs he concluded people of the same stock
had at some period introduced the same customs, modified by time and locality, and
that the periods of such introduction were of a very remote date. The evidence he
had obtained as to the Chinese custom was very kindly given him by Mr. William
Simpson, who had travelled extensively in Asia and America.

   After giving these facts as to an age of Colossi, he again brought forward,
amongst some of the Colossi of Europe, those of the British Isles, natural as well as

artificial, showing in several cases that where huge natiu-al similitudes of the human

form or countenance were apparent, there vast artificial figm-es (some in Britain
being larger than any other representations in the world) were to be found : the

--giant in Sussex 240 feet high, that in Dorsetshire 180 feet in the vicinity of the first

there being a great sphinx-like head on an isolated rock, which was a reputed Celtic
deity, and vast human and other animal semblances on Dartmoor in the direc-
tion of the second. The great countenances in the white rocks near the Giants'
Causeway appeared to have suggested similar simulation, as Pennant mentioned
such a figure in the Isle of Arrau just opposite, and a great lithic representation of
the human form still exists in Sligo. ,The Colossi of Easter Island and of
Elephanta, EUora, and Bamian were then referred to. In the case of the Dorset-

--shire giant, he considered it probable that Caesar had seen this as well as the figure

at Wilmington the one being, as he had before pointed out, ne.ar tlie place of his

landing, the other on his way to Lidford, in the country of the West Britons,
where, according to tradition, ho and his army had been hospitably entertained

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;

and he considered Caesar's statement that the people had many such vast im.ages

thus sufficiently attested.
   In consequence of the observations of Dr. Beddoe as to the interest attaching to

the question, and the importance of ascertaining if any evidences of cremation could
be found, he had been, he thought, successful in obtaining such evidences, though
he gave reasons why, if there had not been such evidences nor any trace of them
--158 REPORT 1874.

in any pai-ticular figure, it should not affect tlie argument. The evidences he found
were direct and indirect. On the hreast of the giant in Sussex, at ahout a foot
below the surface, he found a large number of small particles of burnt clay. On
subsequently opening a tumulus on the Clyde he found precisely similar pieces of
burnt earth ; and on carefully reading again the account given by Strabo, he foxmd
the area was filled with hay and straw, in other words with vegetation hastily
gathered and dried ; and as the sedgy margins of streams near this gi-eat figure
would afford such material most readily, and if (as it no doubt was) this was hastily
collected and torn up, portions of the clay-soil would adhere to the roots, and sucli
portions on being burnt would exactly resemble the burnt particles he had found.
The indirect evidence was, that for obvious reasons he expected to find the largest
amount of cremative matter at the feet of the figure, but on going to excavate it was
found that an extensive square area had been removed to a depth of two or three
feet ; and he considered this could only have been done in consequence of the
soil so removed being found to be particularly rich, and for that reason worth

removal.

On "Natural Mythology" and some of the Incentives to its Adoption in Britain
                and Ireland. By J. S. PnENi:, F.S.A., F.R.G.S.

Tn this paper the author carefully abstained from any subject which might

approach to natural theology, but confined himself wholly to instances of a mytho-

logical impersonation of remarkable natm-al objects, giving as an instance of hia

argument " the image which fell down from Jupiter."

  A very large photograph of the Sphinx of Egypt was exhibited, for the purpose

of showing the weathering of the stone, the characteristics of which led the author

to think that the original and natural condition of the rock before being sculptured

into its present form was that of a human similitude, and that this very fact had

suggested the artistic laboiu- displayed upon it. The diagrams showed a number of

curious appearances of rocks in various parts of the world, some almost as like the

human coimtenance in their purely natural condition as the Sphinx is at present.

He thought that the localities of such objects had been sought as places of venera-

tion, and no doubt for the celebration of religious and even sacrificial rites, and

around them, as on Dartmoor, which abounded in such appearances, were tumuli

and bari'ows of the dead. In such barrows were often found objects now preserved

in museums ; but these he considered, though generally looked on as the most im-

portant relics of the past, were not nearly so important as the positions of the

barrows themselves with their surroundings. In looking at matters in this way he

found in a number of instances, where the result of death in strife was not in

question, that the sites were of peculiar and most interesting selection, as the place

sacred to former worship by the deceased, his natural Gods (the sun, river, and rock-

idols), &c. were all studied in the selection of the place where he reposed. Hence

siu'vivors and visitants to such tombs would soon identify (under the changes from

weather and various natural effects produced by mist and varieties of light) these

semblances with departed persons ; and this once the case, every such similitude

would be identified as the place of abode of some mythological spirit, power, or

divinity, to which henceforth the place would be held as dedicated. That such

matters were noticed by the ancients was clear from Ptolemy's description of the

Capo del Orso, in the Mediterranean. All would be struck with the peculiar

mythological personage Proteus as perhaps the strangest of the classic deities ; but

those who have witnessed the wonders of mirage in the Grecian archipelago and the

Straits of Messina would comprehend how easily the superstitious and alarmed

mind would see a Proteus or a Cyclops. Dartmoor and other similar places had

the most siuprising changes in appearance                                                                                                                                                              and the same feeling would see in them
                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;

            The Origin of the Moral Idea. By C. Stakiland Wake.
  Among even the lowest savages actions such as murder, adultery, and theft are

looked upon as crimes, although they are not thought to be " immoral," as this term
                               ;

THANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  159

is understood by us, the idea of immorality being wbolly absent from the minds of
such peoples. _ This is proved by the fact that it is only under pai'ticular conditions

that those actions are disapproved of. The belief entertained by the person who

suffers that theft and cognate actions are " wrong," is due to the idea of ^jersmial
rii/ht, arising from the activity of the instinct of self-preservation. Interference
with the "property" thus acquired would be resented as being wrong, and by
association the idea of right in connexion with such property would instinctively bo
formidated, and would idtimately be transferred to others possessing similar pro-
perty. It is owing to the fear of retribution that actions originally viewed as indif-
ferent come to be treated as immoral. All primitive peoples recognize the " rio-hts

of the dead," the neglect of which they believe M'ill bring on them the wrath ot░the

denizens of the spirit-world. This belief gives rise to the idea that it is a duty to

do what the spirits are supposed to require ; and if by any means they are thought
to disapprove of murder, adultery, and theft, these actions will come to be viewed as
immoral. But as the moral attributes ascribed to the Gods are merely the reflex of the
minds of their worshippers, the moral advance must first have been made by man

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         )

and probably this would be by the influence of some priest or chief, superior to his
fellows, who sought to ameliorate their social condition. The negative virtues would
be developed the soonest, but the active vu*tues of benevolence would ultimately be
recognized. These are foimded on the social affections, which can be traced back
to the maternal instinct, if not still further to the sexual instinct which accompanies
that of self-preservation with animals even of the lowest grade. The imion of these
instincts forms the true basis of morality. The reference to the instinct of self-
preservation is requisite to supply the notion of " right," which is wanting to Mr.

Darwin's theory of morals, as well as to the phase of utilitarianism of which
Mr. Herbert Spencer is the exponent.

         On Irish Crannogs and their Contents. By W. F. Wakejiak.

   The word " crannog," derived from the Irish word crann, a tree, means a wooden
edifice. The Irish crannog was simply an island, altogether or partly artificial,
circular or oval in form, the margin strongly staked with piles of timber, and the
whole enclosed by rows of palisading. Within the enclosure were usually one or
more log-houses. The boats used by the crannog builders were generally of great
length, very narrow and shallow, and formed out of a single oak tree. The author
believes that in not a few instances the islands may be referred to the Neolithic
age, and in many cases to the bronze period. Nevertheless some of the crannogs
were occupied up to recent times, and were frequently used by the makers of pot-

teen, or illicit whisky.

              On a Leaf-wearing Tribe on the Western Coast of India.
                                  By M. J. Walhouse.

   The author described the Koragors from observations made when posted at
Mangalore. These Koragors are a remnant of an aboriginal slave-caste, now num-
bering only a few hundreds. One of their distinctive peculiarities is that the women
wear aprons or screens of woven twigs and green leaves. Formerly both sexes
wore these aprons for clothing ; but the custom is now confined to the women, and
is useless, since it is woni over the clothes. It furnishes, however, a cui-ious instance
of how what was once a badge of degradation may survive as a cherished observance
for it is now considered that it would be unlucky to leave oft' these aprons. In spite,

however, of this belief, the custom appears to be dying out.

                      GEOGEAPHT.

Address by Major "Wilson, R.E., F.B.S., F.R.G.S., Director of the Topogra-

   phical Department, Horse Guards, War Office, President of the Section.

The President of the Roj'al Geographical Society has so recently delivered his

Anniversary Address, that if I were to attempt to trace the progress of geographical

discovery during the period that has elapsed since the Meeting of the British As-

sociation at Bradford in September last, I could scarcely avoid repeating much that

has ali-eady been said in far abler terms than I have it within my power to com-

mand. Still there are, at the present moment, certain subjects of such very general

interest, and of so much importance, that they cannot well be passed over in any

address to the Geographical Section of the British Association.

It has, I believe, been usual in the addresses to this Section to select some special

subject for remark ; and I will therefore, if you will allow me, before alluding to
the geographical achievements of the year, draw your attention to the influence

which the physical features of the earth's crust have on the course of military ope-

rations, to the consequent importance of the study of Physical Geography to all

those who have to plan or take part in a campaign, and to the contributions to geo-

graphical science that are due, directly or indirectly, to war and the necessity of

preparing for war. I do this the more readily from a feeling that sufficient

importance is not attached to the study of geography as a branch of military sci-

ence, and that of recent years officers in our foreign possessions and colonies have

not received that encouragement which they might have expected to engage in geo-

graphical research, as well as from a hope that new life may be given to that spirit

of enterprise and love of adventure in strange lands and amongst strange people

which have so long distinguished the officers of both services.

To show how varied are the conditions under which war has to be carried on,

and how much its successful issue may depend on a previous careful study of the

phj'sical character of the country in which it is waged, it is only necessary to remind

you of the recent operations on the Gold Coast, brought to a successful issue in an

unhealthy climate and in the heart of a dense tropical forest, where an impenetrable

undergrowth, pestilential swamps, and deep rivers obstructed the march of the

troops ; of the Abyssinian Expedition landing on the heated shores of the Red Sea,
and thence, after climbing to the lofty highlands of Abyssinia, working its way

over stupendous ravines to the all but inaccessible rock crowned by the fortress

--of Magdala ; of the march of the Russian columns across the steppes and deserts of

Central Asia to the Khivan oasis one month wearily plodding through deep snow,

the next sinking down in the burning sand, and saved from the most terrible of

disasters by the timely discovery of a well ; and, lastly, of the great struggle nearer

home, the last echoes of which have hardly yet passed away, when the wave of

German conmiest, rolling over the Vosges and the Moselle, swept over the fairest

provinces of France.

The influence of the earth's crust on war may be regarded as twofold : first,

that which it exerts on the general conduct of a campaign ; and second, that which

it exerts on the disposition and movement of toroops on the field of battle. Military

Geography treats of the one. Military Topography of  the  other                        and  it  is well  to
                                                                                    ;

keep this broad distinction in view, for, as with Strategy and Tactics, they stand

in such close relation to each other that it is not always easy to say where Geography

ends and Topography begins. Of special importance in the first case are great inequa-

lities or obstacles that confine or obstruct the movement of large bodies of troops, and

those features which retard or accelerate their march, whether they be moimtain-

ranges, ravines, or defiles with inaccessible sides, deep crevasses (such as those

washed out in some steppe-coimtries by winter rains), extensive plains, dense forests,

rich cultivation (such as that of the valley of the Po, which confines all movements

to the roads), enclosed country like that of England and Ireland, great marshes

(such as that of the Beresina and Pripet), or running or standing water that cannot be

crossed without a bridge or boats. Of no less importance are those features which

do not allow of the employment of large masses of troops or of special arms, such
                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

                                                                              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                                      161

as Cavalry and Ai'tillery, as well as those circumstances that render the subsistence

of large armies difficult or impossible. In the second case all inequalities of the

ground, however slight, the nature of the soil and the ett'ect which rain has upon

it, the extent and character of the vegetation and cultivation, and all buildings,

whether isolated or collected into towns and villages, are of more or less

importance.

   The climate of the theatre of war must always have an important influence on
military operations, and should be the subject of careful study. Our own experience

in the Crimea shows how much suffering may be caused by want of forethought in

this respect. General Verevkin's remarkable march of more than a thousand miles,

from Orenburg to Khiva, with the thermometer ranging from --'24P to 100░, without

the loss of a man, shows what may be accomplished with due preparation. Nor

should the geological structure of a country be overlooked in its influence on the

varied forms which the earth's crust assumes, on the presence or otherwise of

water, on the supply of metal for repairing roads, and (if we may trust somewhat
similar appearances on the Gold Coast, at Hong Kong, and in the Seychelles) on

the healthiness or unhealthiness of the climate.

In any campaign undertaken by England, the sea must always play an im-

portant part as the great base of operations and main line of communication with

the mother country. Special consideration must be given to the facilities which

the coast-line of the theatre of war offers for effecting a landing ; to the anchorages,

shoals, roads, inlets, harbours, and depth of water along the coast ; to the influence

of the winds, tides, and currents on the entrance to harbours ; to the nature of the
mouths of rivers ; and to the time, force, and duration of periodical storms, and

their effect on navigation.

  A general knowledge of the geography and topography of a country is, however,

in itself insufficient for military pui'poses ; it is necessary, in addition, to know the

present state of roads and bridges, the depth and width of streams, the state of the

soil and of its cultivation &c., and especially the best means of turning the ground to

account for the object in view. This information is obtained by what are called

Military Reconnaissances.

It is scarcely necessary to remind you that though mountain-ranges and rivers

materially  affect                                                       the  operations                   of war,                         they  are by  no  means                                                       '

                                                                                                                                                                    insurmountable

Ochterlony penetrating into the heart of the Goorkha country by a wild mountain

track, the rear divisions of Napoleon's army at Leipsic sacrificed from a neglect to

reconnoitre the Elster, show how close the examination of a country should be.

This is, however, hardly the place, nor woidd there be time, to discuss the minuter

details of military geography and topography ; they will be found in the works

especially devoted to the subject.

will often ensure success. It was this class of knowledge, possessed in the highest

degree by all great commanders, that enabled Jomini to foretell the collision of the

French and Prussian armies at Jena in 1807, and in later years enabled a Prussian

officer, when told that MacMahon had marched northwards from Chalons, to point

unerringly to Sedan aa the place where the decisive battle would be fought. Chief

Justice Daly, in his address to the American Geographical Society, drafrs attention

to the Franco-German War aa " a war fought as much by maps as by weapons,"

and attributes the result to "skilful militaiy movements, performed by an army

thoroughly acquainted with all the geographical features of the country over which

it was moved ;" and, he adds, " It teaches us that if the fate of a nation may depend

upon a battle, a battle may depend on a knowledge of geography."

--162 REPORT 1874.

As, then, all military operations must be based on a knowledg-e of the country in

which they are to be carried on, it should never be forgotten that every country

contiguous to our o-wn (and the ocean brings us into contact with almost every

country in the world) may be a possible theatre of war, and that it is equally the

duty and policy of a good government to obtain all possible information respecting

it. More especially is this the case with regard to the little-known districts,

inhabited by uncivilized or but partially civilized races, that lie beyond the fron-

tiers of many of our foreign possessions and colonies. Is it with much satisfaction

that we can turn to the efforts made by this country to acquire that geographical
knowledge which may be of so much importance in time of need ? Though we
had for years had military establishments on the Gold Coast, and though we

had, more than once, been engaged in hostilities with the Ashantees, and might
reasonably have expected to be so again, no attempt appears to have been made

to obtain information about the country north of the Prah, or even of the

so-called protected territories. The result was, that when the recent expedition

was organized, the Government had to depend chiefly on the works of Bowdich,

Dupuis, and Hutton (written some fifty years ago), and on a rough itinerary of

the route afterwards followed by the troops, for their information relating to the

country and its inhabitants. Nor is the Gold Coast an exceptional case: with

settlements at Singapore and Penang we know absolutely nothing of the interior

Howof the Malay peninsula, and not much of the adjacent islands.          little have

the garrisons of Aden and Hong Kong contributed to our knowledge of Arabia and

China ! What advantage has been taken of the presence of the officers who have

--been in Persia during the last ten years to increase our knowledge of that country
   knowledge which would be very useful at present in the imsettled state of the
Howboundary questions on the northern and north-eastern frontiers ?
                                                                          little has

been added to our knowledge of Afghanistan since the war in 1842 ! and what

part did India take in Trans-Himalayan exploration before Messrs. Shaw and Hay-

ward led the way to Yarkand and Kashgar ?

It was with feelings of no slight satisfaction that many of us heard last year

that the policy of isolation and seclusion which India appeared to have adopted, as

the last soldier of Pollock's relieving force recrossed the Indus, was at last to be

broken, and that an expedition, well found in every respect, was to be sent to

Kashgar. It seemed an awakening from the long slumber of the last thirty years,

during which we were content to stay at home in inglorious ease, resting under the

shadow of the great mountain-ranges of Northern India, whilst we sent out Mirzas

and Pundits to gather the rich store of laurels that hung almost within our grasp.

--Far be it from me to depreciate the valuable services of those gentlemen services

fi'equently performed at great personal risk and discomfort ; but who can compare

the results they obtained with those that would have been brought back by English

officers, or by travellers such as Mr. Shaw, Mr. Ney Elias, and others ?

If it be true (and few will be disposed to doubt it) that arctic exploration is one

of the best schools for officers of the navy, it is equally true that exploration on

shore is one of the best schools for officers of the army. The officer who has had
for weeks or months to depend on his own resources, organizing his own commis-

sariat and transport, fighting his way amidst hardship and discomfort against all

difficulties, will be found to possess many of the most valuable qualifications for

active service in the field ; and not the least of these will be that eye for ground,

or ready appreciation of relative height and distance, which often comes like a

second sense to the explorer.

It has been said that if officers travelled in countries where Government could no

longer protect them, they might be killed by the natives, and that then, if the

murderers were not punished, England would suffer loss of prestige ; but is this the

case ? Did any loss of prestige follow the murder of Couolly and Stoddart in Bok-

hara or of Hayward in the mountains of Gilgit ? It is hard, too, to believe that

the danger of loss of life has not been somewhat exaggerated v/hen we find mission-

aries living for several years in comparative security at Coomassie ; Maltzan, Halevy,

and others exploring Southern Arabia ; Ney Elias crossing China at a time when
political circumstances made travelling more than usually unsafe ; Prjewalsky,

with six Kuzaks, wandering about China for nearly three years, and spending
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  1G3

several months on the northern borders of Thibet ; Shaw and Ilayward finding
their way independently to Kashgar ; and, finally, the Kashgar mission hospitaljly
received not only by the Amir of Kasligar, but by the Kirghiz of the Pamir anil
the Mir of AVakhau. As a matter of fact, the number of travellers who lose their

lives at the hands of the natives of the countries in which they are travelling is

quite insignificant when compared with the number of those who return in safety.
Let us, then, hope that the Kashgar mission may date the commencement of a new
era during which geogi-aphical enterprise may be encouraged, or, at any rate, not
discouraged, amongst the oflicers of the ai'my ; and that if few will now deny that
a knowledge of Ashantee, of Yemen, of the northern and north-eastern frontiers of
Persia, of Merv, Andkhui, TVIaimaua, Badakhshan, and Wakhau would have been
of importance in the year just passed, it may not be forgotten that a knowledge of
these countries may be of still more importance in a not far-distant future.

   May we not take a hint in this respect from oiu" now near neighbours in Central
Asia, the Russians ? No one who has followed their movements can fail to have

been struck by the intense activity of their topographical staif, an activity that can

only be compared to that of England at the period when Bm-nes, Eldred Pottinger,
Wood, Abbott, ConoUy, and others, whose names are ever fresh in our memories,
were penetrating into the wildest recesses of Central Asia. No sooner is Khulja
occupied, than parties start out to examine the mountain-passes beyond ; the cap-

tm-e of Sarmarcand is followed by an exploration of the Zerevshan valley ; Khiva

Amuhas scarcely fallen before detachments are out in all directions sm'veying the

and tracing the canals that give life to the oasis ; rarely does a caravan start for

Manas, Urumtchi, or any place of which little is known without an accompanying
topographer. Persia has been traversed in various directions by members of the

staff", and, as there has already been occasion to notice, Captain Prjewalski has

found his way to the northern plateau of Thibet.
   The records of the Royal Geographical Society and of the Geographical Section

of this Association show how much has been accomplished by individual officers

of the English army, too often without assistance ; and that if encouragement were

given to them there would be numbers of men able and willing to compete with

the Russians in the great field of geographical exploration.

   I pass now to a consideration of the contributions of war to geographical

science ; and amongst these it is perhaps hardly necessary that I should mention

the very obvious manner in which military- operations teach us geogTaphy by

directing our attention for the time being to the coimtry in which they are being
carried on, or the dfrect geographical results that have followed many cam-

paigns from the days of Alexander to cm" own. I have no doubt that last

winter many persons whose previous knowledge of Ashantee was confined to a
vague feeling that it was somewhere on the west coast of Africa, were following
the coiu'se of the operations with intense interest on the maps issued by our geo-
graphical establishments : and if any one will take tlie trouble to compare the maps

of Asia published fifteen j'ears ago with those of the present day, he will see at

once how much the cause of geography has gained by the Russian campaigns
against the Khanates. The Russians are indeed far in advance of us in all that

relates to those survey operations and that geographical exploration wliich should

 always be carried on simultaneously with the advance of an expeditionary force

into an unknown or but partially known coimtry ; they have long since realized

the importance, almost necessity, of accurate geographical knowledge based on
 soimd systematic sm-vey, and having learned, in time, the lesson that opportunities

once lost may never be recovered, make every effort to take advantage of those

 that are ottered to them. In the expedition against Khiva, each column had
 attached to it an astronomer and small topogi-aphical staff*, whose duty it was to,

 fix the geographical positions of all camps and map the route and adjacent countiy,

 whilst officers on detached duty were instructed to keep itineraries of their routes

which might be fitted into the more accurate survey. On the fall of Khiva an
 examination of the Khanate was at once commenced ; and it was even thought

 necessary to send Col. Skobelof, disguised as a Turcoman, to survey the route by
 which Col. Markosof should have reached the Oasis. It is much to be regretted
 in the interests of geography that some such svstem was not adopted during the

                                                                                                  12*

recent operations on the Gold Coast, and that so little, comparatively speaking, has

heen added to our knowledge of Ashantee and the Protectorate. The conclusion

of peace with King Coifee, and the efi'ect that must have been produced on the

inland tribes by the destruction of Ooomassie, appear to offer facilities for the exa-

mination of a new and interesting region, which it is to be hoped will not be neg-
lected by those who are able and willing to take part in the arduous task of

Afi-ican exploration                                                                           and I ti-ust that before many years hare passed we shall know
                                                                                            ;

much more than we do at present about the Prah, the Volta, the great trade-routes

leading from the coast to Centi-al Africa, and of the open grassy country abounding

in game which is said to lie between Coomassie and the lofty mountain-range

called on our maps the mountains of Kong.

The most important military contributions to geography have undoubtedly been

those great topographical survey's which are either completed or in progress in

every country in Europe, except Spain, Tm-key, and Greece. Fredeiick the Great

was, I believe, the first to recognize that in planning or conducting operations on a

large scale, as well as in directing many movements on the field of battle, a com-

mander should have before him a detailed delineation of the ground of a whole or

part of the theati-e of war. To supply this want Frederick originated Military

Topography, which, in its nan-ower sense, may be defined as the ai-t of representing

ground on a large scale in aid of militai-y operations. It was found, however, that

dm-ing war there was rarely sufficient time to construct maps giving the requisite

information, and thus the necessity arose of collecting in peace such data as would

enable maps to be prepared that should show the extent, relative position, and

comparative height and steepness of mountain-ranges, as well as their connexion

with each other, the course of the rivers, the direction of the main lines of com-

munication, the position and importance of towns, the extent of morasses, forests,

and other obstacles to the fi-ee movement of troops, and which at the same time

should distinguish by different depths of shade those places over which troops

could or could not be manoeuvred.

In this necessity may be seen the origin of all national topogi'aphical surveys,

including our own, which was commenced as a purely military survey in 1784 by

General Roy, and transferred in 1791 to the old Board of Ordnance. The gradual

development of these surveys, and the various stages through which they have

passed before reaching their present state of excellence, need not be noticed here

but it may be remai'ked that, whilst in all foreign countries the topogi-aphical maps

haA'e retained their essentially military character, the Ordnance Survey maps have for
many years past been constructed with the paramount view of their general

utility to all classes in the kingdom, and the military character of our topographical

map on the one-inch scale has had to give way to the civil requirements of the
WeState.
                      find also on the Continent that the Cadastral surveys are conducted bv

a civil department of the State, the topographical surveys by the War department";

whilst in our own country aU operations connected with the Cadastral and topo-

graphical surveys are concentrated in one department, the Ordnance Survey, which

since 1870 has formed part of a purely civil department of the State, the Office of
Works.

   Side by side with the large establishments engaged in the production of the to-
pographical maps, there have gi'own up in most countries extensive departments,

sometimes employing from fifty to sixty officers, whose duty it is to supplement the

maps of theii- own and foreign countTies by the collection of all information of
whatever nature that may be useful in time of war, to arrange and classify the
information thus collected, to prepare what may be called militaiy-geographical-

statistical descriptions of all possible theatres of war whether at home or abroad,

to study the science of marches, the influence of ground on the movement of troops,

the best and most rapid means of concentrating and moving large bodies of troops,

and to plan campaigns under varied circumstances. The brief interval that elapses

between the declaration of war and the commencement of hostilities, the rapid

movements of armies, and the short duration of campaigns at the present day have

shown more clearly than ever the imperative necessity of previous preparation for

war                   and tlie publication of the great surveys of most European countries has given
                   ;

an impetus heretofore unknown to the studies I have alluded to. In our own country
                                                                     ;

the Crimean war gave birth to a small topographical and statistical department

but only foiu" yeai's ago its staff consisted of but three officers, and even now it is

hardly as large as one of the sections of its continental brethren.

   The progress of the European sinveys, and especially of our own, has been marked
by many results which have indirectly influenced the advancement of geographical
science. Amongst these may be mentioned the improvements in instruments

made during the progress of the Triangulation, the invention of the Drummond

Light, of Colby's compensation bars, &c., the connexion of the English and Con-

tinental systems of triangulation, the pendulum observations at various places,

the measurement of arcs of the meridian, the comparison of the standards of

lengths of foreign countries, of India, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope, with

our standard yard, which has recently been completed at the Ordnance Sm-vey

Office, Southampton, &c. In the same category may be placed the improvements
in the art of map -engraving, in the application of chromo-lithography to the pro-

duction of maps, as exemplified in the Dutch process of Col. Bessier and in the

Belgian maps, and the emploj'ment of electrotvping to obtain duplicates of the

original plates. By the latter process copies are taken of the engi-aved plates in

different stages of their progress, and with different classes of information engraved

on the different copies, which if mixed together would have confused them. Thus
the one-inch map of England is published in outline with contours, with the hills com-

plete but without contours, with the geology, &c. The art of photography has been

largely employed in the production of maps, and its use is on the increase both in this

country and on the continent, and especially in the Government Departments in India.

The method of copying maps by photogi-aphy without any error in scale or any distor-

tion that can be detected by the most rigid examination was first proved to be prac-

ticable and was adopted in the Ordnance Survey Department in 1854 by Major-

General Sir Henry James, for the pm-pose of facilitating the publication of the Govern-
ment maps of the United Kingdom on the various scales. Since that date the

necessity of rapidly producing, multiplying, enlarging, and reducing maps has

tended towards the development of the various photographic processes which have

been brought to a high state of perfection, such as photozincogTaphy, photo-

lithography, heliogravure, Col. Avet's process used in Italy, papvrotype, &c. Some
idea of the extent to wbich these processes are carried may be gathered from the

fact that during the last five years photographic negatives on glass covering an area
of 10,071 square feet were produced at the Ordnance Survey Office for map-making

piu-poses alone, and from these negatives 21,760 square feet of silver prints were pre-

pared and used in the various stages of the survey. An area of 959 square feet of

the negatives was also used in producing 13,595 maps on various scales by the photo-

zincographic process, which was also introduced by Major-Gen. Sir Henry James.

It was by similar processes that the Germans were enabled to provide the enormous
number of copies of the various sheets of the map of France required during the

war of 1870-71.

The topographical maps of European coimtries vary considerably in scale, the

manner in wliich the groimd is represented upon them, and the style of their execu-

tion. Proposals have at times been made for the adoption of a common scale, but
they liave not hitherto met with much success ; still, however, Sweden, Norway,

Denmark, Prussia, Saxony, Switzerland, Italy, and Western Russia have each a

map on a scale of  ^^    and it is much to be regretted that Austria, when

                       ;

commencing a new map of the entire monarchy, did not adopt this scale instead of

that of .  Q  . On the flat surface of a sheet of paper all inequalities of the ground

must be represented conventionally, either by hachures, by contours, or by a com-

bination of both : each system has its advocates, and the maps of foreign coimtries

present examples of all ; but it may be remarked that the use of contours is becom-

ing much more general than it was a few years ago. Any comparison of the maps

of the various countries would necessarily occupy much time, so I will only add that

as specimens of engraving the sheets of oxu" one-inch map are unrivalled, and that no

foreign maps can compare for accuracy of detail and beauty of execution with the

sheets of our six-inch survey. Our gi-eat national sm-vey is the most matliematically

accurate in Europe ; and it speaks much for the ability of the officers who have

brought it to its present state of perfection, that from the very first they recognized

the necessity of extreme scientific accuracy in their work, and that they have never

had to withdraw from the position they have taken up with regard to the many

questions of detail that have arisen from time to time.

  Before concluding this portion of my address, I would draw your attention to the

appliances used in the minor schools of this country for teaching geography, as they

would seem to need some improvement. The subject is perhaps hardly one that

comes within the province of the Royal Geographical Society, which has done so

much to encourage the study of geography in our public schools ; but it might well

be taken up by one of the numerous Committees of the School Boards of our large

towns. The appliances to which I allude are models or relief maps, wall-maps,

atlases, and globes.

The use of models as a means of conveying geographical instruction has been

too much neglected in our schools                                                                                                                                   if any one considers                  the  difficulty a  pupil has
                                                                                                                                                                 ;

in understanding the drawing of a steam-engine, and the ease with which he grasps

the meaning of the working model, and how from studying the model and com-

paring it with the drawing, he gradually learns to comprehend the latter, he will

see that a model of ground may be used in a similar manner to teach the reading

Aof a map of tlie same area.                        teacher would probably find the same difficulty in

enabling a pupil who had lived all his life in a level country, such as the great

plains of Russia, to form from a map a mental picture of a great mountain-range,

as in teaching one who had never seen a steam-engine to realize what it was and

its mode  of                action  from a simple                                                                                                         di'awiug                                   the  model in each case would form a
                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;

connecting link.

Relief maps of large areas on a small scale have their uses, but they are unsuit-

able for educational purposes on account of the manner in which heights must be

exaggerated to make them appear at all ; this objection, however, does not apply

to models of limited areas on a sufficient scale, which always give a truthful and

eftective representation of the ground. The difficulties attending the construction

of accurate models, and their consequent cost, have proved serious obstacles to

theircommon use in our schools                                                                                                                            but models are readily built up from contoured
                                                                                                                                                       ;

maps, and the means of forming in this manner an instructive series of models

of our own country, with ease, rapidity, and at slight expense, are quickly accu-

mulating as the six-inch contom-ed sheets of the Ordnance Sm-vey are published.

Instruction in Geography should begin at home; and I would suggest that as

tlie six-inch sm-vey progresses every good school throughout the country should

be provided with a model and map of the district in which it is situated. If

this were done the pupils would soon learn to read the model ; and having once

succeeded in doing this, it would not be long before they were able to under-

stand the conventional manner in which topographical features are represented

on a plane surface, and acquire the power of reading, not only the map of
their own neighbourhood, but any map which was placed before them. With

these models topographical studies, which might be the same for all schools,

should be supplied, such as a representation of a coast region, a mountain-lake

with surroundmg hills, a volcano, or an alpine district with glaciers ; and it

would add much to their value if they were accompanied by bird's-eye views

and landscape sketches. In Switzerland nearly every school has a model of the

country ; in Austria, France, and Germany models are largely employed for

instructional purposes ; they have long been in use in our military schools and

colleges ; and models of the environs of Plymouth with corresponding portions of
the six-inch map are used somewhat in the manner I have suggested. The demand

for models on the Continent has natm-ally resulted in their extensive manufacture
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and some good specimens have been produced by Delagrave of Paris, Wagner of

Berlin, and others ; but they do not give all that is required, and are capable of

much improvement.

In our Wall-Maps I think we have been too much inclined to pay attention to

the boundaries of countries, and to neglect the general featm-es of the gi-ound. It

is difficult to say whether the maps have followed the teachers or the teachers the

maps but                    I fear instruction  in  physical                                                                                                        geography too                         often comes after  that  in

ledge of the physical features of the earth. My meaning may perhaps be explained

by reference to a wall-map, probably well known to every one, that of Palestine,
which frequently disfigures rather than ornaments the walls of our school-rooms.
In this map there ai-e usually deep shades of red, yellow, and green, to distinguish

the districts of Jud?ea, Samaria, and Galilee, and perhaps another colour for the
Trans-Jordanic region, with a number of Bible names inserted on the sm'face,

whilst the natural featmes are quite subordinate and sometimes not even indicated.
There is, perhaps, no book that bears the impress of the country in which it was

written so strongly as the Bible ; but it is quite impossible for a teacher to enable

his pupils to realize what that coimtry is with the maps at present at his disposal.

How little distinction is made on the maps between the great corn-growing plains

of Philistia, the vine- and olive-clad hills that stand roimd about Jerusalem, the

deep depression of the Dead Sea, and the pasture-lands of the Moabite plateau !

and how little do they bring out those peculiar features which in a country the

size of Yorkshire enabled the Psalmist to be familiar at the same time with the
snows and alpine flora of the Lebanon and Mount Hermon, and with the intense

heat and tropical vegetation of the Jordan valley.
   The first object of a wall-map shoidd be to show the geographical features of

countries, not their boundaries ; and for this purpose details should be omitted, and

tlie gi-ander features have special attention paid to them. Many attempts have been
made in this direction on the continent, by representing the ground by contours, or

by zones of altitude distinguished hj tints, more or less deep, of the same or difierent
colours, by giving prominence to rivers, coasts, &c., by reducing the importance of
names by wi-iting them small, and by inserting dotted lines instead of bright colours
to mark boundaries. None of these attempts have been quite successful ; but they
indicate progress in the right direction, and are deserving of attention in this

country.

   In school atlases the same fault may be traced, physical features being too often
made subordinate to political divisions ; and there is also in many cases a tendency

to overcrowd the maps with a midtitude of names, which only serve to confuse the
pupil and divert his attention from the main points.

   The use of globes in our schools should be encouraged as much as possible, as
there are many physical phenomena which cannot well be explained without them

and they offer far better means of conveying a knowledge of the relative positions
of the various couutries, seas, &c. than any maps. If a pupil once learns from a
globe the places traversed by the principal parallels and fom- or eight equidistant

meridians, with the most important places near their points of intersection, he will
liud more than half his difficulties overcome. The great expense of globes has
hitherto prevented their very general use, but some experiments are at present being

made with a view to lessening the cost of their construction, which it is hoped may

be successful.

   I cannot pass from this subject without alluding to that class of map which gives

life to the large volumes of statistics which are accumulating upon us with such

rapidity. On the continent these maps are employed to an extent unknown in this

country, both for pm-poses of reference and education, and they convey their informa-

tion in a simple and effective manner. Amongst them may be noticed maps showing

the administrative, historical, and statistical featm'es of Germany, the distribution
of religious professions in Russia, the industrial maps of the same country, the
agricultural maps of Austro-IIungary, &c. Several interesting maps of this nature

were exhibited at Vienna last year, one of which maybe noticed as illustrating the

statistics of the coal-trade in German^', showing at a glance the districts supplied

by each separate coal-field and by imported coal, as well as the proportion of home
and foreign coal consumed in those places where there is competition.

   I will only detain you to notice briefly a few of the most important geogi-aphical
events of the year; and foremost amongst these ranks the publication of Dr.
Schweinfurth's worlf, which every one has recently been reading with so much

interest and pleasure. Dr. Schweinfurth, who received the Founder's Medal of the
Royal Geographical Society this year, is, I am happy to say, amongst us at present,

and has contributed a valuable paper on the oases of the Libyan Desert. Dr.
Gerhard Rohlfs is prepai-ing an account of the remai-kable journey which he made

last winter in the unknown parts of the Libyan Deaert, one of the features of which

was a march of thirty-six days between Dakhleh and the oasis of Jupiter Ammon

without finding a single well. Sir Samuel Baker's record of the expedition from

which he has recently returned will shortly be published ; and the journals of Dr.
Livingstone, which form a most important contribution to geogi-aphical know-

--ledge, are being prepared for publication by his son.
   Africa. Lieutenant.Oameron, R.N. , has reached Ujiji, and extracts from a journal

which he has sent home will be read to you ; the observations which he has made are of

high value, and the presence of a trained surveyor on the shores of Lake Tanganyika
Acannot fail to be followed by great results.
                                               short report of Dr. Nachtigal's

travels has been prepared for this Section ; and Dr. Rowe, who acted as Chief of the

Staff to Sir John Glover during his recent operations on the Gold Coast, will read
an interesting paper on the country passed through on the march to Coomassie, and

thence to the coast. Two engineer officers. Lieutenants Watson and Chippindall,

have recently left England to join Colonel Gordon at Gondokoro, with the special

object of sm'veving the territory over which Colonel Gordon has been appointed

Governor by the Khedive. As the officers are well supplied with insti-uments, &c.,
most important results, including, I hope, a survey of the Lake-distarict, may be

expected from their labours. Of Colonel Gordon's progress a few notes will be

communicated to you. Li Algeria the French have been actively engaged on the

eurvey of the country, and the exact level of the Chott Melghir has been deter-

mined. Mr. Stanley's second expedition to the east coast of Afi'ica, under the

auspices of an English and an American newspaper, should not remain unnoticed

and I cannot pass from Africa vdthout expressing my deep regret at the death of Dr.

Beke, whose travels in Abyssinia were rewarded by the gold medal of the Society,
and whose observations in that country were, from their great accuracy, of so much

--service during the Abyssinian wai\
   Asia. The survey of Palestine (a work which has been said by a distinguished

German geographer to mark the commencement of a new era in geographical

research) is progressing favourably, and has led to the formation of an American

Society for the exploration of the country east of Jordan, which has already

done good service in the field, and of a German Society for the exploration of

Phoenicia. The Rev. Dr. Porter, from whose labours in Palestine every one

who has visited or takes an interest in the country has derived so much profit

and pleasure, will read a paper on the lesser-known parts of Eastern Palestine,

which he has recently visited, and a paper on the progress of the survey has

been prepared by Lieut. Conder, R.E., the officer in charge. Our own survey

is, I regret to say, languishing for want of funds, whilst that of the Americans is

receiving that support from the people which it deserves ; the serious loss which

the fund has experienced in the death of Mr. Drake, who recently succumbed to an

attack of fever at Jerusalem, and who had previously devoted his best energies to

the work, must be still fresh in your memories. Lieut. Gill, R.E., who accom-

Bpanied Col. V. iker last year on a tour to Meshed and the head waters of the

Atrek, has prepared an account of their journey, which will be found to contain

much information on the important questions connected with the north-eastern

frontier of Persia. Some most interesting particulars of the visit of a portion of

Mr. Forsyth's mission to the Great Pamir and Wakhan have been kindly supplied

by Col. Biddulph, R.A., fi-om letters received from his brother. Captain Biddulph.

The vast importance of this journey, both as regards the geography and topography

of the Pamir, and the light which it throws on the boundaries of Wakhan, cannot
be exaggerated. The success of the party has, however, been purchased by the loss
of Dr. Stoliczka, who died from the effects of fatigue and exposure within a few
marches of Leh. Mr. Delmar Morgan has prepared a very valuable paper on early

Russian exploration in Central Asia, which will be found to be of great interest

and Mr. MacGahan, the enterprising correspondent of the ' New York Herald,'

whose adventurous journey across the Kyzil-kum desert obtained for him, from

the Russians, the title of molodijetz (a brave fellow), has forwarded some interesting

details relative to the geographical work of the Khivan Expedition.
   The Russian scientific expeditions for the exploration of the delta of the Oxus,

the old bed of the Yany Darya, and of the Aral-Caspian steppe have been for some

time at work, aud will doubtless collect sufficient data for the solution of the many

Amuinteresting questions connected with the former courses of the  and the Syr.

As an English officer (Major Wood, R.E.) is said to have accompanied one of the

expeditions, we may hopa for early information respecting the results of the expe-

dition. Amongst the features of the year is the number of interesting works either

Eublished or about to be so : works by Mr. MacGahan on the Khivan Campaign,

 y Sir F. Goldsmid on Persia and the Persian Telegraph have appeared ; and we are

promised works on Central Asia by Mr. Dilke and Mr. Schuyler. Capt. Prjewalski

IS engaged on an account of his journey to Thibet, and the Russian Government are

preparing an official accoimt of the Khivan campaign.

In Austi-alia the great geographical event of the year has been Colonel Warburton's

journey from Alice Springs, near Mount Stuart, on the line of overland telegraph, to

Rocbourne, in Nickol Bay, for which he was awarded the Patron's Gold Medal of the

Royal Geographical Society. Such particulars of the journey as have been

forwarded to me through the courtesy of the Colonial Office and of ^h: Button, the

Agent-Genej-al for South Australia, will be communicated to you. By the latest

accounts Mr. Forrest, whose name is so well known in connexion with Australian

exploration, had left the hitherto explored parts of Western Australia for the

Central Telegraph line. Mr. Forrest's route was to be from Champion Bay by

Mount Luke to Moimt Gould on the Murchison River.

  An account of the travels of Mr. Miklucho-Maclay, the Russian naturalist, in
New Guinea has receatly been published at St. Petersburg, and will, I hope, appear
in an English form, as the importance of New Guinea, lying on what will be the

great trade-route from Australia to China, is daily becoming more apparent.

In America, whilst the coast and inland surveys have been progressing. Dr.

Haydon, who was the first to disclose to us the strange beauties of the Yellow-

stone region, has been engaged in exploring a country equally wild and picturesque,

the eastern half of Colorado, where a vast number of sandstone peaks, presenting

an extraordinary variety of form and colom-, rise up to heights of from 12,000 to

14,000 feet. Other expeditions have been doing good service in the Yellowstone

country, Arizona, Oregon, and the Aleutian Islands, amongst them one sent out by

Yale College, which, besides exploring new countiy, brought back five tons of speci-

mens from the great fossil beds of Oregon and other places for the College museum.

I cannot help thinking that in sending out these expeditions (for this is only one

of a series) for the examination of the geography, geology, botany, zoology, &c. of

some special district, Yale College has set an example which might well be fol-

lowed by our own universities, aud that Dublin, Oxford, and Cambridge might

take more part than they have hitherto done in what may be called scientific

exploration in the field. In the north the survey of the interoceanic railway

through British territory has been completed, and my old friend and fellow traveller

Captain Anderson, R.E., has been engaged, as chief astronomer of the International

Boimdary Commission, in running the forty-ninth parallel through the unliuowu

country between the Missom-i and Saskatchewan, and a short account of the demarca-

tion of the parallel and the country through which it passes will be read to you.

In the south Commanders Lull and Selfridge have found practicable routes for

ship-canals, from Greytown by Lake Nicaragua to Brito on the Pacific, and by way

of the Atrato from the Gulf of Darien to a point near Cupica on the Pacific ; the

cost of the latter is estimated at twelve million poimds.

   In South America Professor Orton has been extending our knowledge of the

Amazon countiw ; and I may mention the activity which the Peruvian Govern-

ment are showing in promoting the exploration of the little-known districts of

Peru. Mr. Hutchinson, late Her Majesty's Consul at Callao, will read a paper

" On the Commercial, Industrial, and Natural Resources of Peru," which will be
found to contain much interesting information respecting that country.

Dr. Carpenter will, I hope, give us some account of the cruise of Her Majesty's

ship ' Challenger,' which cannot fail to interest the people of this town from Pro-

fessor Wyville Tliomson's former conne.xion with it.

   Captain Warren, R.E., whose name is so well known from his work at Jeru-
salem, has forwarded a valuable paper " On Reconnaissance in Unknown Countries ;"

liarly his own, the "Application of Photography to Military Purposes." Monsieur
Maunoir, the Secretary of the French Geographical Society, has forwarded a paper

" On the Objects to he obtained by the International Congress," to be held at Paris

in the spring of next year, to which I would especially direct your attention ; and an

interesting communication " On the Ordnance Survey of Ireland " and the "Uses
to which tlie Maps are applied " has also been received.

   I regi-et that I am not able to give any definite information on the probability of

GoTernment assistance to Arctic exploration ; but I vmderstand that the impression
produced on the members of tlie deputation which recently had an interview with
the Prime Minister on the subject wos that he was not imfavoiu-able to such

assistance.

    Admiral Sherard Osborn has kindly forwarded a paper on " Routes to the North

Pole ;" and Lieut. Ohermside, R.E., who accompanied Mr. Leigh Smith last year on a

yery remarkable voyage to Spitzbergen, will read an accoimt of the discoveries
they were enabled to make.

    The reports of the officers of the ' Polaris ' have been published, expressing con-
tradictory opinions as to the possibility of their having been able to reach a higher
latitude. As regards the general subject of Arctic exploration, there can, I think, be
no doubt that that by Smith's Sound would yield the most important scientific re-
 sults, and would at the same time offer great facilities for reaching the pole itself. It
 should not be forgotten that all recent Polar expeditions sent out from this country
 have been desp.itched with the special object of ascertaining the fate of Sir John
Franklin, and that discovery was not a principal object. AVhen, too, we consider
that in these expeditions Aj-ctic travel was reduced to a very perfect system, that
 the distance from the point reached by the ' Polaris ' to the Pole is less than has
 already been performed in some of the sledge-journeys, and that no life has ever
 been lost on a sledge-journey, it is impossible to doubt that a well-<irganized expe-
 dition would be able to reach the polar area. In the words of a well known arctic
 explorer, " AVhat remains to be done is a mere flea-bite to what has already been
 accomplished." Morton, the second mate of the ' Polaris,' says, as the result of his
 third voyage, that he is " more than ever convinced of the practicability and possi-

bility of reaching the Pole;" and if I may express my own opinion, it would be, in

 the words attached to a picture at the last Exhibition of the Academy in London,
 " It is to be done, and England ought to do it."

                             The JRoutes to tlie North Polar Berjioyi.

               By Eear- Admiral Sheeakd Osborn, G.B., F.B.S., 6,'C.

    In this paper the additional 120 miles towards the North Pole reached by the
 last American Expedition under the late Captain Hall of the ' Polaris,' via Baffin's
 Strait and Smith's Sound, were urged as a new and cogent argument in fav'our of the
 sending out of another Arctic Expedition by the British Government in the same
 direction. Pointing out that the Polar Sea comprised within the 70th parallel of
 latitude leaves a space of 2400 miles wide (about equivalent to the distance from
 England to Halifax), and that a line through the pole from Grinnell Land, in
 America, to Cape Taimyr, in Asia, is only half the distance of the route from
 Spitzbergen to Behring's Straits, the author relied on the saving of 800 miles of
 unknown land or sea as his chief reason for advocating the former way. As addi-
 tional arguments for this selection of a passage through the American archipelago,

 he remariced that the European Arctic islands may be fairly deemed to end 120
 miles north of the Spitzbergen group, whilst the few Asiatic islands are not known

 to occur nearer than 15░ of the Pole ; that the northern lands of the western hemi-
 sphere have been ti-aced up to the 84th parallel (or siglited to that supposed distance),
 within 3G0 miles of the Pole, and with no symptom of termination ; and that
 Greenland itself, up to 83░ on the western and 77░ on the eastern side, has

 been found to abound with animal and vegetable life. He also noticed the long

 --and deep channels, mostly north and south or east and west, dividing the Ame-

 rican group Smith's Sound (1600 miles, so far as yet explored) being noted as
 the longest strait known, and the continuous southerly motion of ice down the
                                                                                                       .

              TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                       171

latter pointing to the existence of a preat polar ocean whence the drift of ice (and

of wood, as seen by the crew of the ' Polaris ') issues, there being no other adequate
outlet. To avoid this enormous outpour of ice, Admiral Osborn would follow the

Greenland coast on the western shore, trusting to find himself, during the brief
Arctic summer, in a comparatively navigable sea near the pole, across which Asia
might be reached. Other proposed routes were once more discussed and rejected,

the earlier ill-starred G erman Expeditions being especially condemned, though gi-eat
praise was given to the crew of the ' Hansa ' (whose commander, Koldewey, now

agrees with the author as to Smith's Soimd being the only practicable route).
The statement that Hall's crew sighted land in the 84th parallel was thought
likely to bo correct, because arctic lands asserted to have been sighted on former

occasions have always been reached subsequently.
   In reply to the question " Cui bono ? " on arctic routes generally, Admiral Osborn

relied on the peculiar scientific value attaching to observations made in the polar
area, whether mathematical, meteorological, hydrographical, or botanical (in the

latter case especially as regards palfeontology) ; and he claimed the support of the

Iloyal Society and its learned President, Dr. Hooker, in these opinions.

              On Mr. Leigh Smith's Voyages to Spitzhergen.

                   By Herbert Chermside, Lieut. JR.E.

This paper was divided into the following sections :--I. On the track and out-
line of Mr. Leigh Smith's three voyages to the Spitzbergen seas ; II. On the

Ahydrogi-aphy of the Greenland Sea ; HI. survey and physical sketch of Spitz-

bergen and the sea to the east. In the first voyage, in 1871, the most favourable
season was encountered. The north-eastern portion of Spitzbergen was found to

be of nearly double its supposed extent ; but, unluckily, want of preparation for an

Arctic winter and the lateness of the season put an end to further exploration.

In the second voyage, in 1872, attempts (unsuccessful for want of steam-power)

were made not so much along the land as to penetrate the polar pack. In the

third, a steamer was used for exploring and a sailing-ship as the reserve ; but the

unfavourable state of the ice prevented the former from penetrating beyond lat. 81░,

her most interesting work being the exploring of the unvisited portion of the north-

east land, and the relief of the Swedish Government Expedition, found frozen-in

in one of the bavs on the northern coast. The author described the conditions of

air and water in the Greenland Sea, illustrating by temperature soundings the pro-

bability of finding in some seasons navigable water leading to very high latitudes.

He especially referred to three routes by which attempts at navigation might be
made, viz. along the west coast of Spitzbergen, the east coast of Greenland, and
the east coast of Spitzbergen ; but was of opinion that the two latter are more

adapted for wintering and spring sledge-expeditions, owing, in the former case, to

the ice-encumbered state of the sea and .the narrow and quickly closed channel
alono- the laud, and in the latter to the shoal depth of the sea and the almost

certainty of land or an ice-barrier, the cessation in the summer of the southward

flow hardly encouraging the idea of a navigable channel in this direction. He
also made some observations on the glaciers of Spitzbergen, all of which he proved

to be more than sixty years old, and on the lowness of the snow-line, and its pro-

bable causes. Striking examples were adduced of the rapidity of upheaval now

going on, illustrated by the depths found around grounded bergs, the heights of

which were measured, "and the immense distances inland and heights above the

water at which whale-bones and drift-wocd (but little decayed) were discovered.

He was of opinion that the whole of the recent additions to the north-east land
                                                          century, under  the  sea                and
were, at  no  more distant  period  than  the  sixteenth                                       ;

this idea he supported as well by these evidences of upheaval, as by the changes
to be found between the land as it now exists and as represented in the old Dutch

   The author objected, from his own observations, to the theorj- that circulation is

due to dillerence of temperature alone, asserting that it is owing to diflerence of
saHnity as well as of temperature. According to him, the water on the west coasts

of Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla is of a temperature far above the normal one of

the latitudes, and the isotherms below the surfoce are higher with increasing depth

in many places in the Arctic Ocean ; but here, owing to the sea shoaling near the
land against which the currents are forced by the earth's rotation, they rise rapidly

to the surface, producing its high temperature and the comparative mildness of the

climate found on those coasts. In the deep sea of the Arctic Ocean the warm water

is found below, being a northward flow ot equatorial water of sufficient salinity to
outweigh the brackish polar water, even at a comparatively high temperature.

As evidence of such water being equatorial, he observed that where, as oft" Spitz-

bergen, it is found at the surface, it is heavier than that of the seas both to the

east and west, these results being the mean of daily observations with delicato
hydrometers. The northward set of the current from distant latitudes was illus-

trated by the fact of a bean of a pod-beai'ing plant of the Gulf of Florida having
been found on the coast of Nova Zembla, and numerous objects, evidently di'ifted
from Norway, on the Spitzbergen coast. The agreement of the deep-sea temperature
observations of Mr. Leigh Smith's three cruises, during which the same route was

twice travelled over, was shown to be very close in many cases ; these, again, accord-
ing in a remarkable way with those of early explorers, the maxima in identical

localities being usually rather less in the recent soundings, as might be expected

from the use of protected thermometers. The possibility of a warm current plung-

 ing under ice and reappearing is suggested by the open water found on the west

 coast of Spitzbergen in the depth of winter, and separated from that of the Nor-

 wegian coast by a barrier of ice often more than 250 miles wide. This current, as

Lieutenant Cliermside presumed, may run in a submarine stratum to the north-

 west corner of Spitzbergen ; and he was of opinion that if any land exist to the

north-east, there must here again be a surging up of the warm waters against the

 coast, and a consequent chance of navigation in summer.

On the Results of the ' Challenger ' Researches into the Physical Conditions

     of the Deep Sea. By "William B. Cahpenter, M.D., LL.D., F.R.S.

  The author referred to the Lecture delivered by him "On the Temperatm'e of

the Atlantic " at the Royal Institution of Great Britain on 20th March last, and

to another delivered before the Royal Geographical Society (vide no. iv. of vol.
xviii. of the ' Proceedings,' " Further Inquiries on Oceanic Circulation "). The
subject was brought forward as being of special interest to the Belfast public, from
the circumstance that Professor Wyville Thomson, head of the scientific staff, was
long resident among them, and that it was in their city the subject was originally
started. The author publicly admitted the priority of Lenz in his theory of

oceanic circulation.

On the Demarcation of the International Boundary between Canada and the
   United States (1872-73). By Captain S.Anderson, R.E., Chief Astronomer

I^. A. B. Commission.

  A detachment of 44 Royal Engineers left Liverpool on 22nd August, 1872,

and reached the frontier at Pembina on 20th September. Here astronomical and

surveying parties were organized, and whilst the former determined the boundary-

line at points 20 to 30 miles apart by zenith-telescope observations, giving a result

with a probable error in latitude of 10 feet, the latter surveyed the country for a

distance of from 6 to 15 miles north of the boundary. During the winter the

parties were at work between Red River and the Lake of the Woods, for in that
swampy country (the nature of which is sufficiently well known from the surveys
of Dawson and other Canadians) that season is most favourable for such operations.

Besides the observations indicated, the longitude of Pembina was carefully deter-
mined by electric telegi-aph, a series of instrument-levels was carried along the

boundary, and magnetic and meteorological observations were taken.

In the summer of 1873 the survey to the westward of the Red River was

begun                            and as the  country had  not previously been  explored,  it was  deemed

establishing depots, &c. Owing to the necessity of carrying supplies, includin?
even wood and water, the total strength of the Commission was raised to 276

persons. In the course of that season 437 miles of boundary were surveyed, the
latitude and longitude of 38 points ascertained, 10 principal astronomical stations
determined by zenith observations, and meteorological, magnetic, and barometrical

observations made. At Pembina, the Red River is 75 yards wide, 10 feet deep in
summer, and 752 feet above the sea. From this point westward the boundary

crosses 3o miles of fertile alluvial prairie land ; it then traverses for 12 miles the
rugged and wooded Pembina mountains and enters the Great Plains (1400 feet
above the sea). These plains have a poor soil, granite boulders are scattered about,

and patches of luxuriant gi-ass are met with only in hollows. Supplies of wood
or water cannot here be depended upon for 68 miles. These plains are altogether
unfit for agricultural pui-poses, though available as pasture. By an ascent of 200
feet, the boundary then enters the Turtle Mountains, well wooded and full of
little lakes ; and after 34 miles again emerges upon the open plain, which it
traverses for 138 miles further west, at an average elevation of 2000 feet. The
soil here is sandy, and the scanty bunch-gi-ass only affords pasture for a few herds
of antelopes. At a distance of 280 miles from the Red River the plain ceases, and
by a gradual ascent of 250 feet enters upon the Great Coteau, a prairie extending
north and south, and leads to a remarkable plateau (2250 feet) composed of a
series of irregular ridges which extend for 33 miles, when the boundary traverses

for 15 miles a district of alkaline lakes, the white deposits from which contrast
strangely with a bright crimson plant growing on their margins. After this the
boundary enters the basin of the Missouri, the soil becomes clayey .and very friable
and is^ cut up by rain into deep ravines. Leaving this rugged district after 30
miles it enters a more undulating country (2300 feet). Lignite coal, in seams
2-5 feet thick and available as fuel, was found here, but very little wood. The

character of the country continues the same for 70 miles, the extreme reached.
Buffaloes were rarely met with, as within the last fifteen years they have migrated
from the vicinity of" the Red River to the country 600 miles west.

   The surveying parties suffered much from mosquitoes and from violent thunder-
storms, which converted the plain into a vast lake in June and July, followed by
six weeks of drought, when prairie-fires frequently occurred. On 22ud September

the equinoctial snow-storms set in from the north-west, lasting for five days. In

spite, however, of these unfavourable climatic conditions, the health of the working

parties continued good.

   It would appear from the Report (which was accompanied by maps and photo-
gi-aphs) that, excepting a small tract in the immediate vicinity of the Red River, the
country explored holds out no inducements to settlers.

         On the Oases of the Lyhian Desert. Si/ Dr. G. Schweinfurth.

   After refen-ing to the small knowledge hitherto possessed of the Lybian Desert,
and the recent additions to it by Nachtigall and Rohlfs, the author described his
owTi exploration of the great oasis El-Khargeh (the outer), distinguished from
Dakkel (the inner), the basis of Rohlfs's expedition, three days' journey further

westward. He reached the capital of this outer oasis (of the same name) in

.Tanuary, after five and a half days' march (190 kilometres, almost south) from
Sivot. At the end of April he returned to the shores of the Nile via Girgeh, the
result of his journey being a triangulation on a measured basis of 3^ kilometres.
The oasis is 120 kilometres in length, and so formed as to resemble the bottom of
a gigantic valley, the width of which appears very much to exceed the Nile at its

broadest. On the north and east it is bounded by mountains detached from the

Lybian plateau, composed above of hard, brilliant, red nummulite chalk, and below
of chalk of dazzling whiteness. As a whole, it is not uninterruptedly verdant,
being of the usual monotonous yellow, but with black and green spots. These
little islands, as it were, are the arable portions, the springs suiTOunded by acacias,
the fields, palm-groves, brooks, and ponds. lie dwells with animated language

--174 REPORT 1874.

terraces of vegetation of these enchanting spots. The ten inhabited portions are

stated to have 5700 inhabitants, dwelling in restricted and fortitied situations,

owing to their continual dread of surprise by Tripolitanian hordes. In Khargeh

itself the houses are absolutely built over the streets, being, as it were, on piles

supported by rough beams, through which the inhabitants grope in a stooping

postui-e. Though using a language differing but little from that of the modern

Egyptians, they betray no facial characteristics of the latter, being apparently the

remains of one of the numerous Lybian races of the hieroglyphical Berber nations,

of more northern extraction. They are of signally livid complexion, owing to

prevalence of fever from miasma. Vaccination is enforced. They are lax in

their observance of the rules of the Prophet, and do not possess a single trace of

Christian tradition. Five large temples (500 years B.C.), seven Koman castles,

hundreds of wells, the Necropolis of liibe, and other remains testify to the great

former prosperity of the oasis. Close to Doosh is the dwelling of a commander in

the time of Trajan, in excellent preservation. The (Christian) Necropolis of Hibe

is in wonderfully perfect condition. Its construction deviates entirely from Egyp-

tian models, and follows the Roman rather than the Greelv style. Embalming was

certainly practised here by Christians of the first five centuries. The various in-

scriptions on rocks, dating through a series of epochs, afford a strange picture of

the slowness with which time cifects transformations of surface. Seveuty-ff\'e

springs, all of the earliest antiquity, care in use, and no new ones are ever opened.

They are periodically cleaned by divers, at the risls: of their lives, for a few copper

piastres. jVn Egyptian engineer has, however, found water at (50 to 100 metres in

the  Dakhel  oasis                          and  there  is  no  doubt  that  the district  could  be  restored  by

artesian wells to its former prosperity. The author thinks it least improbable that

the water has its source in the Nubian Nile, probably above the cataracts of Wady

Talfa ; but he seems to doubt all the explanations attempted for its origin, by

stating that all these springs are thermal, far exceeding the average temperature of

the year, and consequently of the upper strata of the Sahara. There are no traces

of a bed of a former current from the Egyptian Nile valley westward through

which the Nile might have floAved, although an imaginary series of oiisis valleys

mafigures in all maps. It is strange, ne^-ertheless, that " Bader-bela                                " (i. e. riAer

without water) is a frequent local name for valleys and sandy wadys. The soil of

the oasis chain betrays no traces of the clay alluvial laud of the Nile, there are

no fish in any of the waters, and the botanico-geographical facts recapitulated by

the author also negative the idea of the Nile having ever flowed here. After

entering upon the various geological features of the district at some length, he

thinks it safe to assume that the subterranean water of the oasis is equal to that

of a first-class river. The scheme of irrigation is primiti-se, neither draw-wells

nor wheels being known, and much is wasted, becoming impregnated with salts

from some of the strata; and these salts, and the encroachment of quicksands,

which usiup the finest jiarts of the oasis, are very prejudicial to cultivation. The

sand hills are continuously advancing from north to south, with a gentle inclination

westward, forming a crescent-like arch. The largest are in Dakhel, where they are

insurmountable by camels, and prevented llohlfs's advance. All Egyptian plants,

except the hog's bean, are found in the oasis, many cere.als being cultivated, and

rice and barley especially thriving. The date is uaturallv the staple of the agri-

culturist, and the bearing trees are estimated at 80,000, taxes being levied on the

number of trees and the area of the cultivated soil. One tree, sixty years old,

with sixfold ramifications of long shooting branches, is stated as probably not to

be matched in the whole world. The camel cannot be acclimatized, owing to the
damp summer miasma and plagues of midges ; but donkeys, cows, buffaloes, and

sheep are easilj' reared. The indigenous mammalian fauna is extensive (including

five carnivora) ; stationary birds are few, but migatory birds abound, though,

singularly enough, neither ducks nor geese are found in the waters of the oasis.

All the oases on the east of the Lybian desert have the same flora, and the

explored part yielded 225 species, which would probably only be increased by one

fourth if more thoroughly worked. Nearly half of them are connected with the

culture of rice. Even in its most toi-pid state, the soil appears nowhere wanting in

vegetable germs.

      Dr. O. NachtigalVs Explorations in Africa, 1869-74.

              By E. G. EavexXstein, F.B.G.S., F.S.S.

   The German Emperor having resolved to forward to the Sheikh of Borneo a

number of valuable presents, iu recognition of the kindness shown by that poten-

tate to several German travellers who had visited his country, Dr. G. Nachtigall,

at that time body-phvsician to the Bey of Tunis, volunteered to accompany them.

A long residence in Isorthern Africa, and a thorough knowledge of the language

and the customs of the country, peculiarly qualified him for the duty he had under-
taken. Furnished with mercurial barometers, aneroids, a hypsometer, and ther-

mometers, he left Tripoli on the 18th February, 18G9, and, following the usual
road via Sokna, arrived at Murzuk on the 27th March. The caravan traffic between
Murzuk and Borneo having been interrupted iu consequence of raids undertaken by

the Welad Sliman against Bilma, and there being no immediate prospect of its
being resumed within a reasonable period, Nachtigall determined to employ his
enforced leisure bv paying a visit to Tibesti, an oasis of the Eastern Sahara

inhabited by the Tibbu'Reshade, and never previously visited by a European. He

left Murzuk on the (3th June, and after thirty-six days' journey reached Tao, the
first inhabited spot of that oasis. At the time of Nachtigall's visit most of the

inhabitants had retired to the hills or to Bardai, a fertile valley beyond the lotty
mountain-range which intersects Tibesti from north to south. The traveller's
reception was by no means favourable ; but he nevertheless persevered, and passing
a remarkable extinct crater and a mountain pass G700 feet in height (the highest

mmountain of the district attaining an altitude of 7900 feet), succeeded making

his way to Bardai. But there he nearly fell a victim to an infuriated mob, and
only owed his life to the kindness of one of the most influential chiefs of the

place. Kept a close prisoner and unable to explore the country, Nachtigall, after
a month's detention, sought safety in flight, and, after undergomg indescribable
hardships, reached Murzuk in safety on the 8th October. On the 18th April
 he was able to start for Borneo, the capital of which he reached on the Gth July,
 1870. The Sheikh received him with the greatest kindness, and facilitated his

 proposed geographical researches in every way. Nachtigall first directed his steps
 to the N.E., to Borku, a district to the south of Tibesti, and also^ not before
 visited. This journey resulted iu the remarkable discovery that Lake Tsad at some
 former period discharged a river iu a north-easterly direction, which emptied itself
 into a vast lake, at that time tilling the depression of Bodele. Numerous ske-
 letons of flshes, &c. testified to the existence of this ancient lake ; and even now,

mafter unusually heavy rains, Lake Tsad is stated to discharge a river that direc-

 tion. After his return to Kuka, Nachtigall started for Bagirmi, to the exploration

 of which he devoted the time between 'the 27th February and 9th August, 18/2.

 He unravelled the complicated hydrography of the Shari and its tributaries, and
 added much to our knowledge of the heathen tribes dwelling in the far south, a
 savao'e though industrious race, who are constantly exposed to the slave-hunting
 raids' of their Mohammedan neighbours. Nachtigall himself witnessed some of the
 most horrid scenes of the trafhc in human beings, and does not hesitate to charge

 the Turkish authorities in Tripoli audFezzan w-ith conniving^ at it. In thejbegiu-

Sartorius. The presence of Sir Garnet's force in Coomassie was communicated by

two fugitive slaves from Boankra. Aiter breaking all communication with their

rear, the column marched forward, arriviug at Essidnimpon, where Major Sartorius

set ofl^to open communication with the main body. The author then described the

arrival of the Glover column in Coomassie, the appearance of that town, and the

dissatisfaction of the native contingent at leaving it so hiirriedly. He sketched

the return map to the coast, and summed up the assistance rendered, in his opinion,

to the main body by the operations of the contingent. The languages of the native

allies, the products of their country, their style of living, and the supply of gold

were briefly mentioned.

    East-African Expedition. Extracts from Lieutenant Camehon's Journal.

    The portion read (which had then just come to this country) included the details

of liieut. Cameron's journey from Kwiliara (Unyanyembe) on the 11th November,

1873, to his arrival at Kawele (Ujiji) at the end of" March, 1874, the chief object

of his explorations being the recovery of the journal and map reported by Living-
stone's men to have been left at the latter place. Various circumstances delayed

the regular prosecution of this journey until the 2nd January, 1874, when Lieut.
Cameron started on a line between the routes taken by Burtou and Stanley, skirt-
ing the territory of Mirambo, a chief who is much more powerful than the Arabs
represent, and whose inroads have brought desolation to the whole district. West

of  Shikurah, the  countrj', though  flat, was                 lovely                            trees  grew as  if  planted                                                                                                                                                                                                                    by a

of the Malagarazi, as wide as the Thames at Abingdon. Two days after leaving

Kwihara the country gradually became more elevated, outcrops of granite, almost

precipitous, and brawling ton-euts being met with. These unite to form the Mtumbo,

a tributary of the Sinde. On the 22nd January the road led over a country covered

with sheets and blocks of granite or gneiss, but well wooded and fertile                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        and after

crossing some small rivers, the party encamped near the village of Ma'n Como, the

chief of Uvenda, 3573 feet above the sea, past which the march was through a moun-

tainous country aftbrding splendid views. All this district is depopulated by the

slave trade. On the 2nd February they crossed the Sinde by a natural gi-ass bridge,

half a mile long (the river itself being only 100 yards wide), beneath which hippo-
potami pass from end to end. The hill-country ends abruptly on the right bank of

this river, and on the other side is the well-cultivated plain inhabited by the
Wavinza.

 ^ Continuing the march to the banks of the Malagarazi, Lieut. Cameron reached
Ugaga on the 7th February, thus, for the first time, coming on the route traversed

by Burton and Speke in 1858. He crossed the river with his party on the 10th,

the operation taking five hours, owing to the primitive nature of the canoes,

although the stream was but 30 yards wide; and on the 13th entered the
Ukaranga country, the villages of which are principally supported by the manufac-

ture of the salt abounding in the black soil. After crossing the Rusugi and the

Iluguva, the land road to Ujiji was found to be impracticable on account of the
rains, and the party made for the shores of Lake Tanganyika, embarking on the

21st at Ukaranga in some fine large boats, and being hospitably received at Ujiji

by the Waswahili and Wamrima inhabitants, traders and settlers of Arab extrac-

tion from the coast.

On the Commercial, Industrial, and Natural Resources of Peru. By T. J.

   Hutchinson, F.B.G.S., F.R.S.L., M.A.I., late H.B.M. Consul for Callao.

   The author commented on our earliest knowledge of the history of Peru, observ-
ing that the country, even in early times, was as famous for its commerce and in-

dustry as for its precious metiils. He considered the modern Peruvians to be the

most industrious inhabitants of South America, as evidenced by their cultivation
of cotton and sugar-cane, and dated the establishment of their commercial status
from tlie Pacific Steam Navigation Company's inauguration in 1840. The con-
dition of native manufactures, joined to that of agriculturists, seemed to point
unerringly to success, in a commercial point of view, for a nation as it were
instinctively industrious. The author then proceeded to a notice of the enor-

mous amount of mineral wealth in the Andes, now about to be opened to the world

by means of railways. Hitherto these rocky mountain-masses had rendered
intercommmiication impracticable, from the difficulty of transport across their
almost impassable baiTiers. Foreign Office Reports were quoted, as furnished
through the Admiralty from Rear-Admiral Cochrane, the present Commander-in-
Chief in the Pacific. Recent findings of guano show an approximate amount of
9,294,500 tons, and exports of nitrates from Iquique have increased cent, per cent.
in less than three years. In the author's opinion, Peru seems likely to reach the
position before many years of being one of the first South-American Republics, as
regards commercial prosperity. Drawings of various cuttings and tunnellings of
the railways (some of which are now finished by the contractor, Mr. Henry Meiggs)
accompanied this paper.

Travels beyond three Seas, hy Athanasius Nilitin, Merchant of Tver, 1466-
   1472. Compiled from Russian documents by T. Seesneffskt, o/ <7ie /╗?i-
  perial Academy of Arts and Sciences of St. Petersburg, and rendered into
   English by E. Dblmae Morgan, F.R.G.S.

   Much fresh explanatory matter is here added to Nikitin's memoirs. They were
first discovered by Karansin, who paid a high tribute to their importance in his

' History of Russia,' and have been critically reviewed in the Transactions of the

Imperial Academy of Arts and Sciences by M. Sresneffsky, and translated by Mr.

Major in one of the publications of the Hakluyt Society.
   The 15th century, remarkable in the annals of Western Europe for a special

desire to become acquainted and establish relations with the distant East, is not
without its reminiscences to Russians, whose ancestors took their part in the pro-
gress of the times and the march of events, as far as circumstances would allow.
The development of the kingdom of Muscovy, following the overthrow of the
Tartar power during the reign of Ivan HI., opened out new countries to the enters
prise of Russian merchants; and, towards the close of the 14th and beginning of
the 15th centuries, they traded with India, Persia, and Central Asia. Commercial

intercourse was succeeded by closer political relations, and we read of interchanges
of envoys between the Grand Dukes of Muscovy and the rulers of Transcaucasia

and Persia. It was on the occasion of the departure of one of these embassies from
Russia that Athanasius Nikitin, a merchant of Tver, started for the East. Taking
with him his merchandize in two sailing-ships, lie descended the Volga to Astrakan,
where he was attacked by Tartars and lost all his goods : but, escaping in
.another vessel, after experiencing a violent storm in the Caspian Sea, he landed
safely at Derbend. Here the travellers were in the dominions of the Shirvan

Shah of Shamakha, who received them kindly, but refused to accede to their
request to be sent home to Russia. After wandering about Daghestan for some
time, Nikitin at length set sail for Persia from Baku in 1466 or 1407, and landed

at Balfrush on the coast of Mazanderan. Thence he crossed Persia, visiting the
 most important towns and commercial centres, and arrived at Ormuz on the Per-
 sian Gulf. Three years later, on his return journey through Persia, he visited the

" horde '' of Uzum Hassan, of the Turkoman tribe of Ak-koinlu (white sheep),

 whose empire extended over the whole of Persia and a great part of Asia Minor,
--178 REPORT 1874.

and at oue time threatened to shake the power of the Turks. Nikitin described

the unsettled state of the country, owing to the ambitious designs of Uzum Hassan

and the revolts and rivaliy of his sons and vassals ; and his remarks are the more

valuable as they entirely confirm the records of the chroniclers. Sailing from
Ormuz the week after Easter 1469, Nikitin approached, for the first time, the

shores of India at the Peninsula of Gujerat ; he touched at Din and Canibay, con-

tinuing his voyage to Chewul, where he landed and crossed the Ghaut Mountains,

entering the Deccan and visiting the towns of Junir and Kulburga on his way to
Beder, where he stayed for some time. Beder has now lost all its importance,

but in those times it was the capital of a powerful Mahometan state and a great

emporium for trade.

   Our traveller visited the fair at Aliand (AUund), instituted in memory of Shah
Alia ad Deen Hildji (1297-1347), who made himself notorious by his terrible

march through the peninsula with 300,000 cavalry and 2700 elephants, devasta-

ting the country. Nikitin also accompanied the Indians to their sacred city of

--Parvat, not Ellord, as Karansin and others believed, but most probably Parvattum

or Perevattum pagoda on the right bank of the Kistna (16░ 12'), south of Hydera-

bad, described by Hamilton as the site of one of the Buddhist shrines, marked to

this day by some beautiful remains. In Nikitin 's time this shrine was visited by

pilgrims from all parts of India. It contained, among other objects of Hindoo

worship, twelve temples covered with sculptures, illustrating the miracles of

Buddha                                           a statue  of  that god, resembling that               of the Emperor Justinian at Tsar-
                                              ;

grad or Byzantium ; a black ox of stone covered with gilding, &c. Among the

other places of interest described were Bidjnaghur, the capital of the great Indian

kingdom ; Rachiur, famed for its diamond mines ; and Kulur (Culoor), a great

industrial centre.

After the personal narrative of his jom-ney, Nikitin records his observations on

the country and                                  its       products                                    the people, their morals, customs,  and religion ;  the
                                                                                                    ;

government, the army, &c. : and some of these remarks are the more valuable as

they are not to be found in the writings of any of his contemporaries.

It may be observed that in his time there were two principal kingdoms in India,

the capitals of which were the Indian Chiumidar-Bidjnaghur and the Mahometan

Khorassau-Beder. Of the former he communicates little, except that its Prince

Kadam was very powerful and had a large army ; but of the latter he notes that

--the ruling classes were all Mahometans of Khorassan a proud race of conquerors,

riding in armour, their Indian subjects poor, ill-fed, nearly naked, swift runners,

with shield in one hand, bow and arrows in the other. The Sultan's array num-

bered 300,000 men, besides elephants and the contingents of his great lords or
feudatories. The description seems almost fabulous of the splendour of the Sultan's

Court, of the grand ceremonial processions on the Mahometan festivals, and of the

wars and military exploits of the great Lord Meliktuchar attached to the suite of

the young Sultan.

   After three years' stay in India, Nikitin departed from Dapul, then a prosperous
sea-port, on a " tava " or merchant vessel bound for the Persian Gulf. After being

wrecked and falling into the hands of robbers, he reached Muscat, whence a few

days' sail landed him at Ormuz. He then travelled through Persia to Trebizonde;

and, after crossing the " Stamboul daria " (or Black Sea) to Balaclava, he could ofler

up his thanks with a grateful heart, exclaiming, " Thank God, I have crossed three

seas."

   By what route Nikitin returned to Holy Russia is uncertain ; but, as he died at
Smolensk before reaching his native Tver, it may be inferred that his road lay
through the territory of the Khan of the Crimea and the Prince of Lithuania.

The record of his travels entitles him, in Mr. Morgan's opinion, not only to

claim rank as a distinguished Russian of the loth century, but as not unworthy to
be named after Di Conti and Vasco de Gama.

            On the Survey of Palestine. By Lieut. R. Condeb, R.E.

   This survey is confined to Western Palestine, containing about 6600 square

the hill-country of Judaea and the plain of Sharon ; the third, containing the
plain of Esdraelon and its boundary chains ; the fourth, the hill-country of

Galilee; the fifth, the Jordan valley. The country of the Beui S'ab or Shep-

halah, west of Nablus, was unlcuown until visited in this survey. The author

described the commencement of the work (one-inch scale) in October 1871, and
the share taken in it by Mr. 0. F. Tyrwhitt-Dralce, who died on the 23rd June last.

The map was prepared on Sir II. James's system of tangential projection, in sheet3

containing 30' of longitude and 20' of latitude. Six of the proposed twelve are

complete, and three are in England. The first base was connected with the trigono-

metrical point at Jafta, the second being established at Esdraelon ; this was 4^

miles long, and the difference between its measured and calculated lengths gave

an error of only -03 per cent. The average length of the triangles side was about

iifteini miles, but never greater than ten in the Judsean hills ; and every possible

check appears to ha'^e been emplo3-ed in all cases with an encouragingly minute

amount of error. The rate of work rose from GO square miles per month to about

180 in October 1873, and then, with an extra man, gave a steady average of 280.

All is done on horseback, and the method is most fitted for military reconnaissance.

The heights are obtained by Abuey's clinometer, sketches of hill-tops, aneroid

observations, thcrmometrical readings, &c. ; and astronomical bearings are con-

stantly obtained as rough checks. As to names of places, the author observes that

the original Hebrew names are still to be found under slightly modified forms of

the Arabic. The collection and correction of these, tending to elucidate geogra-

phical passages in Scripture, wore carefully attended to. 'I'he number obtained

was very great (seven or eight times more than in any pi'evious map), averaging

two per square mile. Seventy special plans of antiquities, net before satisfactorily

explored, are here mentioned ; and seven churches and two sites of towns are stated

to have been before entirely unknown. The antiquity of ruins in Palestine has
been much exaggerated, many supposed to be Jewish or Phoenician turning out to

be Crusading or Saracenic. 'The identifications of the altar 'Ad, the site of ^non,

Zaretan, Gilgal, Scopus, Oreb, Zeeb, Samson's tomb, Archelais, Ecbatana, Sozuza,

and other places mentioned in Scripture were made during the survey, and various

other points and discoveries of archaeological interest are discussed. As to climate,

there is an entire absence of ozone during the east wind ; the mirage is not depen-

dent on heat only, but requires also moisture                                                                                                                                                                                                       and the rise and foil of the barometer

                         Notes on a recent Journey East of the Jordan.

                        By the Eev. J. L. Pouter, D.D., LL.D.

   Eastern Palestine is divided from Western by the valley of the Jordan, which
extends from the base of Hcrmon to the borders of Edom, a distance of 150 miles.
For about 180 miles its surface is below the level of the sea, its depression at one
place being 1312 feet. This great chain gives the country eastward its most
striking physical feature. Viewed from the west, it appears an unbroken mountain-
chain ; but when ascended a tableland is seen to stretch from its summit into
Arabia. The central erection rises into wooded heights, with an average elevation
above the plateau of 600 feet : this is Moimt Gilead ; while the southern table-
land is IMoab, and the northern Bashan. The western side of the countrj' is deeply

--furrowed by ravines, three of which are historically important : 1, the Anion,

which separated the Moabites from the Amorites ; 2, the Jabbok, which was the
northern border of the Ammonites ; and 3, the Ilieromax or Jarmuk, the
boundary between Bashan and Gilead. The countiy was the scene of some of
the most remarkable events in early Bible history, such as the raid of the Eastern
--180 REPORT 1874.

Kings upon Sodom and the conquests of Israel under Moses. Questions of im-
portance arise in connexion witli those events. Are there any traces, monumental

or traditional, of the aboriginal races ? or can the line of conquest be followed ?

The ancient inhabitants had some very marked characteristics ; they were to a
large extent migratory ; they were subject to wild outbursts of passion ; they were
celebrated for unbounded hospitality ; they had a peculiar costume and a peculiar
accent. It is therefore important to inquire whether there be any thing in the

physical features, natural resources, or geographical position of the country that

would account for these characteristics, or whether any of them still exist.
   The author proposed to show the conclusions he had arrived at upon these and

other points, while giving a sketch of his recent journey. lie left Jerusalem on
13th April, but v/as unable to cross the Jordan at Jericho, because, as stated by

Joshua, the river at that season " overfloweth all his banks." He travelled up the
plain to Damich, and crossed a feny beside the ruins of the Roman bridge, over
which ran the ancient road from Neapolis to Geraxa and Philadelphia. He showed

that the dress of the people beyond the river is different from that of the Western
tribes, and of a more primeval type ; their pronunciation of certain words is also

different. He ascended Jebel Osha, the highest peak of the Gilead range, and

identiiied it with Mizpah, where Jephthah assembled the Transjordanic tribes.

He also showed that Es-Saet is the Ramoth Gilead of the Bible. He travelled

south to Arak-el-Emir, and described the remarlcable excavations and classic ruins

of the palace of Ilyrcanus. Thence he went to Ileshbon, and pointed out how it
commanded the passes from the plateau of Moab to the Jordan valley, thus ren-

dering it necessaiy for Moses to ask permission of Sihon to pass through his
territory. Tlie western brow of the plateau is deeply furrowed, and the projecting
peaks near Ileshbon formed those " heights of Pisgah" which looked " towards

Jeshimon," i. e. " the desert " bej'ond the Dead Sea. He described the ruins of

Nebo, showing that it was a town which gave its name in ancient, as it does in
modem, times to some peaks around it. One of these peaks bears a name which
is probably a con-uption of Pisgah, and the view from it is similar to that described
in the account of Moses's death. The author went to Rabbath Amnion over a table-

land rich in pastures and dotted with ruined towns. He urged the importance of

excavations at Rabbali as likely to be productive of interesting archreological

discoveries. He travelled thence to Gerasa, through the semicircular region of

mountains skirted by the ravine of the Jabbok, and illustrating the statements in

the Bible regarding the strength of the borders of the Ammonites. He suggested

Neby Hud, a noted sanctuary between the ford of the Jabbok and Gerasa, as the

probable scene of Laban's covenant with Jacob, and proposed to identify Gerasa

with the long lost Mahanaim. From Gerasa he made an adventurous journey
through an unknown region to the plain of Ilauran, following the line of an ancient
road ; and he gave reasons for believing that this was the route by which Abraham
and Jacob entered Palestine, and by which Moses invaded Bashan. He denied the
identity of Dera with the Edrei of Og, maintaining it to be the Adraha of the
Peutinger Tables, and followed the Roman road there laid down to Bozra. Thence

 he went north to Jebel Hauran, visiting its old cities, and describing their archi-

tectm-e. He argued that some of the private houses in those cities are much older

 than the Greek temples beside them, giving measurements of a few of the massive
 stone doors. Here were two colossal heads of Astarte, with the crescent on the
 forehead which give that deity the name found in Genesis, Ashteroth-Kamaim.
 The ruined temples and palaces of Siah contain inscriptions bearing the names of

 Herod the Great and Agrippa ; and there is one in Nabathean characters of a very
 remarkable type, apparently recording the erection of a statue to a certain Malkath
 about 30 B.C. From Kenath he crossed the plain of Bashan to Mezarib, and then,

 turning southward, passed over the northern ridge of Jebel Ajlnn, visiting several

 cities of Decapolis, and iinally crossing the Jordan valley to Bethshean. In con-

 clusion, the author strongly urged the importance of a regular survey of the whole

 country, as calculated to illustrate Biblical geography and archaeology.

The Yarlcund Mission. Communicated by Colonel Biddulph.

The advanced party of the expedition, of which Colonel Biddulph's brother,

Captain Biddulph, was one of tne chiefs, started from the station of Murree

(Punjaub), on loth July, 1873. It consisted of 80 men and 100 animals, and

included Dr. Stoliczka, the celebrated Indian naturalist (who eventually suc-

cumbed to the inclemency of the climate). They reached Leh via Srinuggur on

27th August, much tried by heavy rain, at times washing the road away, and by

the temperature, which varied from 31░ to 140░ in a single day. After a fortnight's

halt they again set out by the Changchenmo route, passing the last human habita-

tion at Tanksee (on 16th September), 13,000 feet above the sea, an elevation

--continuing to Shahdula, a five weeks' journey. The temperature continued

variable, and at times very low at the Sakti Pass (15,000 feet) 118░ at noon and

6░ at night. After heavy snow, they reached the Pangkong Lake (1-42 feet

deep) on 20th September, and separated on the 2Gth, Captain Biddulph wishing to

find a short cut to Kiziljilga. After crossing very easily on foot a pass 19,200 feet

high, a grassless track of low and rounded hills, like Brighton Downs, was reached,

the gradient of descent from which was only GOO feet in ten miles. The Lingzi-

Thuu^ plains (17,000 feet) took two days to cross, traversed by snow-storms and

most bitter winds, the thermometer beiug twice at zero within half an hour of

sunset. Here, in spite of the precautions taken in sending on supplies and estar

Wishing depots, twice they encamped %vithout fuel and once without water.

Kiziljilga was reached on 1st October, and, although snow fell daily and ink

froze in the pen, was found comparatively warm. The party here again united
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;

but the severe cold utterly demoralized the native servants and caused much illness,

a tierce cutting wind blowing daily from noon to dusk, so that little exploring

could be done. Starting on 7th October, they followed the River Karakash,

visiting jade-mines deserted by the Chinese, and joining the main body with

Mr. Forsyth, who had crossed the Kara Korum without difficulty at Shahdula

leaving which place on the 21st, after crossing the Grim Pass (the most difficult

they passed, though but 16,500 feet high), they once more met with vegetation,

and, after crossing the desert of Gobi (four days) and camping in an oasis, arrived

at Yarkund on 8th November. Here horses (like big Welsh ponies), cattle,

sumptuous dinners, and fruit abounded, and daily marches of thirty miles were

easily made. The Yarkundees are quiet and go unarmed. They will doubtless

rise in the scale of nations, as they intermarry with the upper class Andijanees, a

much superior race. There are no antiquities in this very ancient but entirely

brick-built city. Its chief is the Dad Kwah, the second man in the kingdom.

Leaving Yarkund on 28th November, the mission reached Kashgar in five

marches of twenty-six miles average, and stopping two days at Yanga Shahr,

where there is a sti'ong fort. At Kashgar new and most comfortable quarters

were provided, and the officers were allowed to go about the city at pleasure and

Ashoot game in the neighbourhood.  treaty of commerce with the Atalik Ghazi

(now Ameer) was negotiated by Mr. Forsyth, and finally returned ratified in charge

of Mr. Shaw as British envoy. Permission being given to travel. Colonel Gordon

and party went northwards (85░ below zero in tents, 26░ below zero outside), and

Captain Biddulph eastwards. Letters were sent regularly to India during the winter,

but were delayed by the comparatively low Zoji-la Pass (11,500 feet), sometimes

closed for weeks by snow, which always lies lightly on the higher Kara Korum.

On 17th March the mission left Kashgar and separated at Yangi Hissar,

Mr. Forsyth returning to India and Captain Biddulph starting with Colonel Goi-don's

party (^42 men, 65 horses) for Sir-i-kol ou the 21st. On the 30th, after crossing

three snow-passes, they reached the important strategic position of Tashkurgan

(11,000 feet) on the edge of the Pamir Steppe, commanding the high road to India

by Chitral, and where various important routes converge. It is the last place

on that side in the possession of the Atalik, whose rule appears most just and

equitable, and who has increased the welfare of the country in less than ten years

to a degree before unheard of in Central Asia.

After much snow, traversing a road 13,000 feet high, and crossing four passes,

they reached Kila Panja, on the Oxus, in Wakhan, on 13th April, via Aktash and

 the little Pamir, by the lake Barkut Yassin. The Pamir was crossed by twenty-
 live mile marches through deep snow-drifts, iirewood having to be carried for sevt'n
 marches and grain the whole ^^'ay. Its drainage is all to the west, the Kizzilyart plain
 being the true watershed. There are ttco lakes called Kara-kull, one draining east,

 the other west, the apparent discrepancies in the accounts of former travellers

 being thereby explained. Wakhan itself is very poor and thinly inhabited.

    The party, not receiving permission fi'om Shere Ali to proceed via Cabul, left
 Kila Panja on 2Gth April, Colonel Gordon returning by the Great Pamir and
 Captain Eiddulph by the Little Pamir, diverging from the original route at Surhud
 with the view of visiting the Buroghil and Darkot passes, never yet seen by a

European.

Notes on some Roads in Northern Persia and on the Russio-Fersian Frontier.

                                   By Lieut. Gill, R.E.

    Lieut. GiU accompanied Colonel Baker in a tour through Northern Persia in
 1873, during which he made a rough survey of the country seen, determined the
latitude of places and their altitude by aneroid or hypsomelCTS. The mountains to
the south of Teheran rise to an altitude of 15,000 feet, and the roads through them
wind along fearful precipices and are practicable only during summer, after the
 melting of the snows. Gulhek is one of the most channiug villages at the foot of
these mountains. It absolutely belongs to the British Government, and its inhabi-
 tants are exempt from paying taxes. "AU the valleys on the southern slope of the
great mountain-range which separates the tableland of Teheran from the plains of
 the Caspian abound in water and vegetation ; small villages occur at intervals of
two or three miles, and in their fields the streams, having their rise in the hills, are
absorbed by irrigation before they reach the desert plain. The upper portions of
the valleys afford pasturage to sheep and goats, and in the most inaccessible
recesses the mouHon and ibex are met with. Coal of fair quality is found at
Shunshak, but owing to the cost of transport it fetches as much as Б.3 a ton at
Teheran. Immediately on crossing the water-parting towards the Caspian the
nature of the country changes, and the valley of Lar contrasts by its dreariness
with the valleys to the south. Its stream abounds in excellent trout ; and at
Ask, well known for its hot sulphur-springs, cultivation is carried on extensive!}'.

The valley is hemmed in several times in succession by precipitous rocks, until it

Aenters a wooded park-like country, extending to within live miles of Amol.

large portion of the Caspian plain consists of jungle, and cultivation is not so exten-
sively carried on as might be expected. Amol, at the time of Lieut. Gill's visit,
was almost deserted, the inhabitants having gone to the hills. The nature of the
country remains the same as far as Bartrush ; but thence, and as far as Ziaret, it
is covered with extensive forests of magnificent planes, beeches, oaks, walnuts, and
immense box trees, having trunks as thick as a man's wrist. The teak likewise

grows in certain localities. Cultivation is can-ied on only at a few spots. Above
Ziaret the forest ceases, and beyond a pass 4500 feet above the sea a fertile valley,
thickly populated and aflbrding pasture to sheep and cattle, is entered upon. The
trees here grow in clumps, and beyond Atula they disappear altogether, and a
barren plateau, seven or eight miles across and 7000 feet above the sea, is entered

upon. This plateau forms the water-parting between the Caspian and the rivers
Uowing inland towards the desert. Lieut. Gill proceeded by a well-known road to
Shahrud, Sebzawar, and Mushed, the latter, aside from its sanctity, offering no
features of interest. Ivilat is one of the most remarkable places in the world. It
lies in a circular valley encompassed by precipitous hills, and accessible only
through five naiTOw gorges not more tlian two or three yards wide. Water abounds

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ;

and as there is much space for cultivation, the inhabitants could hardly be starved
out. On the road from Kilat to Idalilv the mouTitains rise to a height of 10,000 feet,
and from the top of the difHcult pass the valley of Atrek may be seen. The Persian

frontier province of Deregez is described as one of the most prosperous of Persia
and, though situated in the immediate vicinity of the Turkmen, it suffers nothing
from their incursions. This prosperity is due entirely to the wise government cf

Eha Klian, whose family has held the post of governor for many years past, and

whose honesty contrasts stikingly with the corruption pervading; every class of
Persian society. Lieut. Gill reached the Atrek at Sison, and descended "its valley

                            On the Russian Expedition to KJiiva.

      By J. A. MacGahan, late Correspondent of the 'Netv Yorlc Herald.'

   The Russian campaign against Khiva was i-emarkable for the admirable manner
in which the expeditionary force was supplied with every requisite for a march
across a waste of sands. The operations of the topographical coi-ps merit special
attention. The Russians keep pace, in the survey of the country, with their
advance in Central Asia, and every reconnoitring force, every embassy, is accom-
panied by competent surveyors. Struve's and Kaulbars's visits to Khiva and
Kashgar are instances of this kind. The roads to Kliiva had been explored by
flying detachments long before the late expedition was undertaken, and the expe-
ditionary force never moved until the ground in front had been reconnoitred
by %ing detachments and the capacity of the wells ascertained. The only
part of the route not explored in this manner, owing to the presence of Khivan

forces, was that between Adam Kurulgan and the Oxus, and this omission nearly

led to a disaster. General Kaufmann fully appreciated the value of these explo-
rations, though he does not seem to have treated the officers employed on thia
arduous service with the consideration they deserved. The trigonometrical survey
of Russian Turkestan is proceeding rapidly', and the time when a map of the whole
of Central Asia, based upon accurate data, can be prepared is not far distant. The
extensive explorations of Russian travellers become but rarely known to the rest

of Em-ope, for they are published in a dry matter-of-fact style, and not in the shape
of readable books. The .surveyors attached to the Khivan expeditions have
probably determined by this time the old bed of the Oxus. In conclusion, the
author describes the soil of Khiva as being exceedingly fertile, producing crops of
wheat, barley, and rice, not to be surpassed elsewhere.

             Heproditction of Maps and Plans in the Field.

                By Captain Abnet, B.E., F.B.A.S., Sfc.

The author pointed out the immense advantage that must accrue to military

commanders by placing in every subordinate officer's hands a plan of the ground

Aon which the campaign might take place.  large scale of map, at least 6 inches

to a mile, was recommended, as on it every feature of the country might be shown.
Two modes of securing this have been introduced into the service, reproducing

Abj'lithography sketch maps made by officers and men when executing a recon-
naissance.   peculiar kind of ink is employed, invented by the author, which is

capable of being transferred to stone or zinc from any paper. The advantages

claimed for this are, that the ink is liquid like ordinary ink ; that it is not greasy

in the ordinary acceptation of the word as applied to lithography, and consequently

there is no danger of finger-markings obliterating the drawing by their transfer

to the stone or zinc ; and finally that unprepared paper can be used for the drawings.

The next point touched upon was the method of reproducing plans by photography,

either to the same or larger scale. The process adopted for these was called

papyrotypy.    This  differs  from  ordinary photo-lithography  in  rolling  up  a  print

             _

from a negative in greasy ink direct on the paper, after immer.'^ingit in cnid water.

Those parts acted upon by light take the ink, as Ihey do not absorb water, whilst

those parts unacted upon by light, and which do 'absorb walcr, remain intact.

Tlic paper print thus obtained is really a transfer which will go down to stone or
zinc. From that point the work is "that of ordinary lilhogi-aphv. It was then

pointed out that papyrotypy was capable of giving half-tone prints as in the

ment for these processes consisted of a photographic, a lithographic, and

printing waggon, all of which are attached to the telegraph troop of the Royal

Engineers, each waggon being horsed by four horses. Enough material is carried

for a four months' campaign for every purpose for which the respective waggons are
Aadapted.
           mountain equipment for each of these processes was described. It is

capable of being carried on the backs of mules, and is therefore adapted for such

campaigns as the Abyssinian and Bhootan.

      On Surveys in Ireland. Communicated by the Ordnance Department.

   The circumstances connected with the Government surveys of confiscated lands

in 1586, 1609, and 1652 are here succinctly narrated, the last (the " Down

survey) being given more in detail. After a sketch of the origin af the English
Ordnance Survey, its extension in 1825 to Ireland (when the triangulation com-
menced on Divis Mount near Belfast) and subsequent operations are described,

and the various uses to which the resulting maps may be put are recapitulated,
the older siu-veys being shown to have been but portions of various oppre!!sive

plans, whilst the operations of the present scheme relieve all classes from unequal
taxation, simplify the conveyance of land, and in various ways act equitably' for
the good both of individuals and the State.

               Note on the International Conyress of Geoyraphical Sciences.

By Mens. Charles Maxjxoir, Secretary of the French Geographical Society.

   After a precise account of the origin and proceedings of the first meeting of the
Congress at Antwerp, from 14th to 22nd August, 1871, and of the successful steps
taken by the Organization Committee of that meeting to induce the French Geogra-
phical Society to undertake the management of a second gathering at Paris, tlie
author gave details of the composition and labours of the General Commission and
its Subcommittee, resulting in the appointment of an Honorary Committee and a
Committee of Congi-ess, the latter divided into Scientific, Organizing, Exhibiting,
Publishing, and Account sections, and the Scientific Section being subdivided into
Mathematical, Hydrographical, Physical, Historical, Economical, and Instructional
branches, with another for explorations and travels.

 --The points settled by the Committee of Congress were : 1, the establishment of

a provisional Board of Inquiry, to which questions could be referred, each of the
scientific groups being required to prepare a series of these ; 2, the constitution of
an Honorary Committee of all Nations (a fuU list of the members hitherto elected
being given) ; .3, the procuring the countenance of the French Government and
of the Parisian municipal authorities.

   Subscriptions were fixed at 15 francs for each member, and a separate class for
donors of 50 francs and upwards was instituted.

   It was fixed that the Congress should open on 31st March, 1875, and last (at most)
for ten days. Separate morning meetings were to be held in the various groups,
and general afternoon sessions. The Exhibition will open simultaneously with the
Congress, and close on 30th April, when prizes awarded bj' an international jury to
exhibitors will be given. Transactions and Proceedings of the Congress will be
published, with lists of subscribers and donors, and a copy of such publications,
and a card of admission to the meetings and the Exhibition, will be given to each

subscriber or donor.
             TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS,                         185

             ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND STATISTICS.

Address hy the Right Hon. Lord O'Hagak, President of the Section.

Since I accepted the invitation of the Council of the British Association to meet

you here, I have glanced through the Addresses of some of the gentlemen who

have heretofore enjoyed a similar distinction, and I find, in most of them, an

authoritative statement, that brevity is held a virtue in the Presidents of its

mySections. I appreciate the reason of the rule : it has  full approval ; and I

shall endeavour to act upon it, so as to avoid delaj' of your discussions, or antici-

pation of their details, or prejudgment of any questions which may probably come

before you.

   I am glad to have the honour of presiding over such an assembly in a town to
which I am attached, not merely as the place of my birth, but, far more, by life-

long associations of interest, duty, and aflfection. I rejoice that it is again distin-

guished by the presence of so many men illustrious in every walk of science, who
come to take counsel together, as to the conquests of human thought and the

extension of the bounds of knowledge ; and I may be permitted to say that Belfast,

in its industrial eminence, its honourable traditions, and its intellectual progress, is

not unworthy to receive them.

As to its varied industries, they may more fitly be considered by other Sections

of the Association, in their connexion with those branches of science (such as

Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, or Mechanics) with which they have more direct

concern. But the Statistician and Economist, without trespassing on the province

--of any of those branches, has relations with them all aiming to test the value of

their results and make them practically conducive to the general well-being. Thus,

--when you note the wonderful progress of this community increasing in population

from 37,000 in 1851 to 174,000 in 1871, and possessing multitudes of palatial manu-

--factories where, within my own memory, there was exactly one you may be led, le-

gitimately, to consider its causes, its consequences, and the means of its extension.

You may find food for profitable speculation in examining the industrial eiibrts

which continue that progress without pause or faltering ; and, perhaps, amongst

them not the least remarkable is that which has established great iron-foundries,

winning for their work the highest honours in the industrial competitions which

have occupied the capitals of Europe from time to time for a quarter of a century,

and commanding orders from the most distant regions of the globe. Or you may

examine, with equal interest, ship-building establishments which employ skilled

artisans in thousands, send out scores of great vessels to traverse the Mediterranean

and bridge over the Atlantic, and have cultivated the special manufacture of long

iron-decked ocean-steamers, from the year 1861, when it was first begun, until

they have produced the gigantic ' Britannic ' and ' Germanic,' measured at 5000

tons (not surpassed, if they have been equalled, in any country), and exhibiting

improvements which are largely imitated in all ocean-going ships throughout the

world. But apart from its general industries, Belfast has peculiar claims on the

good will of this branch of the Association.

It is nearly a quarter of a century since, at a former Meeting of this Associa-

tion in this town, the place which I now fill was more fitly occupied by the late

Archbishop Whately, whose services to Economic Science, as well in his own

masterly publications as in the liberal energy with which he encouraged the study

of it in Ireland, I need not eulogize before this assembly. On that occasion there

were not wanting able and instructed men to show that its principles had already

found acceptance here. Such men had been already active in the prosecution of

those special inquiries which in this section it will be our business to pursue.

In distant days, when Belfast was poor in material wealth and very limited in

population, they had formed a speculative and literary society which did excellent

work. They had, also, societies for the culture of natural science, and others

which were useful in training young people for the encounters of public and pro-

fessional life. And these, with great schools, which were the creation of the

spirit and enterprise of private persons, tended to the remarkable advancement of

individuals, and assisted in laving the foundations of that great prosperitv, the
                                                                                                    '

unaided gi-owth of self-reliance and self-assertion, wliicli has so distingiiislied this
community amongst the cities of the empire.

   It was .not strange that, with such antecedents, Belfast should have early moved
in the new path of statistical inquiry ; and accordingly, long before the meeting
to which I have alluded, it had established a Social Inquii-y Society for the con-
sideration of " Statistics, Political Economy, and Jurisprudence," which, in some
particulars, remarkably anticipated the Social Science Association, and was, whilst
it existed, very useful and efficient. And thus it came to pass that not the least
distinguished of those who, in 1852, discussed the subjects peculiar to this section,

in able papers, were inhabitants of Belfast, some still living and some departed,

who well maintained the intellectual reputation of their town. Subsequently, the

Social Inquiry Society merged in the larger combination represented by the Statis-
tical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, which has laboured, and continues to

labour, in the metropolis, with great and increasing success. It has dealt, in its

published transactions, with almost every important economic question of the time,

and has acted beneficially, by suggestion and argument, on the Irish legislation of

later days.

   It has operated, also, in spreading economic knowledge through the orgiiuization

of the Barrington Lectureships on Political Economy, which were founded by the
munificence of a citizen of Dublin, and through which competent teachers aflbrd

the opportunity of instruction in the principles of the Science to the various towns
of Ireland. But although the capital of the Ulster Province has thus allowed its

local society to be absorbed in one which is national, the spirit which originated

both continues to prevail in Belfast ; and it will gratify the members of this section
to learn that, in the month of January .ast, a committee was formed to establish
classes for the systematic teaching of Political Economy chiefly to young men
engaged in mercantile pursuits. That committee is composed of the Chief Magis-
trate of the town (to whose intelligence, energy, and affluent liberalit)', I am not
sm-prised to learn, the British Association is largely indebted), many of its leading
merchants and professional men, and several eminent professors of the Queen's
College. They were fortunate in obtaining the services of a highly informed
economist ; and the experiment has, so far, proved very satisfactory. The number

--of students on the roll has been 55, 3 of them alumni of the Queen's College,

7 apprentices of solicitors, and 45 engaged in commercial business. The average
of attendance on the classes has been from 40 to 50. The committee may well be
congratulated on the result of their novel and excellent effort, and the probable

influence, in other communities, of the example thej^ have given. Alreadv it has

been imitated in Dublin ; a class of young mercantile men has been formed in the
metropolis for a similar purpose ; and there is no reason why others should not

compete with it there and in the provincial towns.

   In connexion with this matter, I may mention that veiy recently a consider-
able portion of the Barrington Fund has been devoted to the instruction in
Political Economy of schoolmasters, who are examined in its principles under the

direction of the Banington Lecture Committee of the Statistical Society ; and

at an examination held on the 12th of May last, 13 of them obtained di-

stinctions and certificates. The importance of such a movement I need not dwell
upon. It was anticipated by Archbishop Whately in the preparation of Lis
' Easy Lessons on Money Matters ' and other books ; and I find that the Labour
and Capital Committee of the Social Science. Association have endeavoured to
induce the Educational Committee of the Privy Council in England to promote
the teaching of economics in schools under its inspection, and have urged the im-
pprtance of such teaching on the Lord President, lor reasons which, in the painful
circumstances existing around us, may not unprofitably be repeated here. They
declared their strong conviction " that the hostility between Labour and Capital,
arising from an erroneous belief that the interests of workpeople and their em-

--ployers, and of tenants and landlords, are opposed to each other a belief leading,

in manufactures, to attempts to oppose harrowing restrictions regarding rates of
wages, hours of labour, piece work, number of apprentices, and the use of machineiy
and, in agriculture, to attempts to dictate the amount of work to be exacted aiul
the selection of tenants ; and leading, in its further stages, to strikes, lock-outs,

rattenings, and threats of personal violence, and ultimately, in many cases, to

--murder itself ihight have been mitigated, and in great measure prevented, had

 the people of this country in their youth, and before the mind could be warped,

been instructed in the elements of Economic Science." And on this, and on other

grounds, they m-ged that no more time should be lost in taking measures for gra-

dually introducing this knowledge, as a regular branch of education, into all schools

to which the State gives pecuniary aid. Their demand was not fully conceded j
but a beginning has been made in England as in Ireland, and the study has been
introduced in some large schools under efficient inspectors. Individuals have made
the same experiment in London and Glasgow (eminently Mr. Ellis and Mr.
M'Clellandj, and with a success demonstrating the feasibility of imparting econo-
mic knowledge to young people, and making it full of attractive interest to them.
"We must all sincerely trust that the same success may attend the effort which has

been so well begun in Ireland.
    I do not think I need apologize for these references to the connexion between

economic and statistical science and the intellectual traditions of Belfast ; for, whilst

they prove that I am not unwarranted in asserting its worthiness to receive this

great Association, they must gratify specially. those vrhom I address, as indicating

tt healthy interest in the prosecution of that science and a continuous efibrt to

assist its progress here.

    It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of such progi'ess to the highest

interests of every class of our societ}'. The branch of knowledge with which we

have to deal must have had an existence coeval with all advanced civilization,
although its name is new. It could never have been ignored by the historian, who^
properly marshalled facts and drew inferences as to the characters and actions of
individuals and the causes of the rise and fall of nations. It was necessarily
cultivated by investigators of the working of commercial communities, and the
influences which affect their prosperity or decay. It was implicitly recognized by
all careful and conscientious statesmanship, in dwelling on the events and circum-

stances which might require the maintenance of institutions or warrant their aboli-'

tion or reform. Those who fulfilled such functions were, consciously or uncon-

sciously, statisticians and economists, although the recognition of statistics and

economy, as distinct domains of human knowledge, and the cultivation of them,

with exclusive attention, are comparatively of recent origin in the world of thought.
   It is not, perhaps, matter of surprise that such new-comers have not always met

--a cordial reception that the masters of exact science have sometimes looked

askance on their looser and more speculative methods, and disputed their right to
rank at all with the older scientific sisterhood. But the controversy was never of
much practical account ; and it has weU-nigh ended.

   The statistician and economist do not demonstrate ; do not claim for their pro-
positions the certainty of mathematics ; are too much engaged with the shifting
conditions of human existence and the infinitely varied shades of human thought
and feeling to pronounce, with rigid dogmatism, as to the course to be adopted in
all the varying circumstances which concern the wealth of nations and the social

interests of mankind.

    But, nevertheless, they are entitled to call tlieir labours scientific, if science be

needed to deal with subjects and educe results of the last importance to our race,

and to accomplish this by drawing, from facts rightly ascertained, lucidly classified,
and profoundly considered, conclusions of permanent truth and wide application

for the government of human conduct and the increase of human happiness.
   The reign of Law is not bounded by the pliysical universe. Its vigilant power is

not exhausted when the planets have been kept in their courses and the earth is
made bountiful for the maintenance of man. As the material creation assuredly
did not owe its hannony and beauty to a fortuitous concourse of atoms, so th-e
humanity, to whose needs it has such a manellous adaptation, has not been left to

be the sport of chance, stumbling through the ages in blind disorder and hopeless

desertion by the Infinite Power which called it into being. There is a mo_M

government which " shiipes our ends," pei-vading the apparent chaos of motive
and action, and making the liberty which belongs to us, as individuals, subor-
dinate itself, with a felicity as admirable as it is incomprehensible, to the promo-
tion of the universal good. Three millions of free and responsiljle beings consti-
tute the population of London, each having his own idiosyncracy and power to

                                                                                                 14*

act in independent isolation, but all overruled and subdued by an overmastering,

although an unacknowledged influence, to the working out of a common system

by which, whilst they prosecute, for their respective interests, their separate objects
and pursuits, they supply one another with all things useful for their exist-

ence and enjoyment.

   This is surely the greatest of marvels ; and it is achieved, as no human power

could achieve it by any governmental force or police strategy, because there is a

Law which dominates the movements of society and moulds the earthlj' destinies

of men. And, surely, the inquiries which are bent to the comprehension of that

Law, and strive to ascertain the principles on which it acts, from earnest observa-
 tion, laborious record, and just appreciation of the facts which, more or less clearly,
disclose its systematic operation in the various departments of human effort, are
 vital to our well-being and progress in the world. They are fruitful in precise and
 enduring results. They have already, in many points, revolutionized the opinions
 of communities and shaped the policy of cabinets, and they have furnished canons
 of public conduct which have had an ever-widening acceptance wherever civiliza-
 tion has made its way.

 ' Statistical inquiry is, therefore, scientific inquiry, and scientific inquiry of tho
 highest value ; and its successful prosecution is important to every class of men,
 from the statesman and the legislator to the humblest operative. It has relations

 with all matters of real human interest. It touches the reciprocal rights of classes,

 the claims of capital and labour, the advancement of education, the repression of

 crime, the relief of distress, the prevention of disease, the improvement of
 agriculture, the extension of commerce, and all the various cognate questions
 which aft'ect our social and industrial state.

  --All men may profit by an acquaintance with a department of knowledge which

 concerns all alike the high and the low, the wealthy and the poor. If there be

 ascertainable laws by which the relative rights and responsibilities of human beings
 are regulated, and by the evasion or defiance of which they must suffer inevitable
 injury, it is plainly important that some knowledge of such laws by all men should

 promote the equitable and reasonable enforcement of those rights and responsibilities.
     There is, at present, a sad encounter of classes in this great town, which has

 paralyzed its most important industry. As to the origin of the dispute or the
 conflicting views of the parties to it, I do not presume to offer an opinion. But
 I may say for myself, and I am sure for those whose pleasant meeting here has
 been clouded by that grievous calamity, that we lament its occurrence, and trust it

 will find a speedy ending, for the avoidance not merely of privation on the one

 side and embarrassment on the other, but of evil consequences which may bring
 permanent mischief to every order of the community, and damage vitally the great
 commercial position of Belfast. I refer to the sad subject only to indicate how

  important it might have been if the educational effort on which I have already
  spoken had so far advanced as to spread abroad a knowledge of the issue of like
  encounters in other places and at other times, and of the teaching to be derived
  in this, as in most things else, from that old experience which

                                                      " Doth attain
                                      To something of prophetic strain ! "

     But the statesman and the legislator need the knowledge which is accumulated
  by statistics even more than the mass of men. To legislate aright, to guard a
  nation safely through calm and stormy times, to take advantage of opportunities
   of safe and wise refonn, and avoid alike the evils of obstinate adherence to abuse
  and reckless innovation, a member of Parliament or a minister holding political
  power should qualify himself by familiarity with that science of which a most
  eminent professor of it (Dr. Farr) has said :--" Statistics underlies politics. It is in
  fact, in its essence, the Science of Politics without party colouring." And yet there
  are many members and some ministers who, from time to time, undertake the dis-
  charge of their high functions without any such preparation as is deemed essential
   in the aspirants to any ordinary profession--of which, in their case, some little
   statistical and economic knowledge might well form a necessary part. Political
   action should not be altogether empirical : and scientific instruction, specially aimed
   to qualify for the undertaking of it, might be usefully supplied bv our hio-her

  schools and universities, in far larger proportion than they now afford it ; for they
  would so supply new faculties of perception and persuasion to the political aspirant,
 whom they might train to marshal facts for the elucidation of economic questions,

  and apply established principles iu the novel emergencies which perpetually test
  the quality of statesmanship ; and so, promoting an attempt to foimd legislation
  on a scientiiic basis, or, at least, to have it conducted with infomied and fore-
 thoughtful intelligence, they might take away, in some degi-ee, the reproach of the
 famous Chancellor

                                 " Quarn parvula sapientiil regitur mundus ! "

 There are, no doubt, subjects on which the law-maker may decide promptly and

 on the first impression ; but on most of those which are really important and
 permanently affect the general interest, he should seek the help which the statisti-
 cian can afford by casting light from the past on the dim pathways of the future,
 if he would avoid perfunctory and haphazard legislation, issuing often in serious
 mischief, and necessitating attempts at unsatisfactory amendment, which he need
 never have essayed if he had allowed that light to lead him to an appreciation of

 the difficulties in his way and the means to master them.
    Still further, the statistical method may be employed beyond the bounds of mu-

            ^

 nicipal arrangements, and made to operate for the benefit of that great community of
 nations, ever more closely approximated to each other by the practical annihilation
 of space and time which has been accomplished by the railroad and the steamship.
 It may assist the jurist in dealing with the vexed questions of international law
 and preparing the way for that progressive agreement as to the reciprocal claims
and duties of civilized states ; and this, though it cannot, perhaps, whilst man is man
 subdue the turbulence of ambition or end the crimes and calamities of war, may
promote, at least, an approach to that " federation of the world," which may be
delayed or forbidden by human pride and passion, but is dictated by the highest

interests of mankind.

    But, further still, there are collateral advantages which statistical inquiry affords,

in bringing together, to such a meeting as this, men of science and men of the
world (the professor, the actuary, and the politician), who find the occasion of union

and mutual benefit in a pursuit which exercises at once the student's capacities of
intelligent research and logical deduction, and aids, as I have shown, to a happy

issue the best efforts of those who move in the busiest and the noblest spheres of

 active citizenship.

    And, even more widely, it promotes the diffusion of intelligence and the

unity of intellectual ettbrt throughout the earth, as iu the case of the Interna-
tional Statistical Congress, which was originated at the London Exhibition of

1851, and has assembled successively in Brussels, in Paris, iu Vienna, in London,

in Florence, at the Hague, and, lastly, in St. Petersburgh. At those meetings

various countries have been represented by delegates from their Governments and

by men of science, with the object of discovering the best modes of statistical

inquiry, of ascertaining the facts capable of numerical expression which can be
collected in all civilized communities, and of establishing a world-wide uniformity

of statement, tabulation, and publication of those facts, giving a more exact and
scientific character to results, and making them more av.ailable for universal useful-
ness. At the last Session, the eighth of the series, in St. Petersburgh (of which I

should be glad, if I had time, to give some account from a Report of Mr. Ilammick,

one of the foremost of living statisticians, with which I have been favoured), not-

withstanding the distance from which they came, and the dangers they encoun-
tered from cholera and otherwise, 128 foreign members attended from almost every

country in Europe, from the United States of America, from Brazil, Egypt, and

Japan. There were 360 Russian members, including the first scientific men and
University professors from all parts of the empire. The Grand Duke Constantino
presided and opened the proceedings in a forcible address. The limperor gave his

best assistance in every way, and the meeting was most harmonious and successful.
I cannot attempt even to indicate the natm-e and the fruits of its important labours

and I refer to it only that I may illustrate, by a late and conspicuous example, the
mode iu which the prosecution of statistical studies may tend to promote the good

understanding of Governments, to dissipate the evil prejudices which have so

often held nations in unnatural and absurd antagonism, to diftiise the highest
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              .;

intelligence of its most instructed members amongst the whole family of states,
and bind them together by an identity of mental action and an equal participation
of discoveries and suggestions abounding in advantage to them all.

  I fear I have already overpassed the limits which should have been prescribed by my

undertaking to be brief, and I pursue no further the general considerations on which

1 have partially and imperfectly entered. But it seems to me that those who are
charged with the duty which I have assumed may fairly be expected to make
some allusion to matters within the sphere of their own special division of scientific
knowledge, which may have peculiar relations with the localities in which they act.
The opportunity of concentrating attention upon such matters may be judiciously

and largely used by the authors of papers in the several sections ; out a very
brief allusion to some of them should be allowed to make the opening addresses
" racy of the soil." I shall merely glance at two or three, which will be of interest

as belonging to Ireland.
    I believe that in uo other department of statistical inquiry has such progi-ess been

--made in these countries, within living memory, as in that which comprehends

 " Judicial Statistics " dealing with crime, its motives, its causes, and the means
 of its repression, and with all the various questions of interest which arise in con-

nexion with the administration of civil and criminal justice. In this department,

men of high intelligence have long been laboming throughout the world ; and it

was the subject of sedulous attention at all the international congresses of which
I have spoken. The results have been ah-eady satisfactory and full of practical
advantage, and they will become still more so when the inquiries which those

 congresses have organized shall have submitted for comparison the judicial systems

of all lands, described by those who are best acquainted with them. In this good
 work Ireland has done more than her part, under the supervision of Dr. Neilson
 Hancock ; and I owe it to that very eminent statistician to quote from a letter

addi-essed to me by Mr. Hammick, of whom I have spoken already, and whose

 absence from our Meeting I sincerely lament, the remarkable statement, that " tlie

 Irish Judicial Statistics are unequalled in Em-ope for skilful arrangement and lucid

 exposition."

    The changes in the social state of Ireland and the legislation of latter years
 have fixed attention on our County Courts, aud made some reforms in their pro-
 cedure and some extension of their jurisdiction very desirable. The Land Act
 creates ne^y exigencies in connexion with our agricultural and commercial life, and
 they must be satisfied by a moderate and carefully considered reform of institutions
 which have worked well aud command the confidence of the people. This is one
 of the most important matters which can receive the attention of the Legislature
 and I am glad to say tliat a beginning of improvement has been made in the last
 session, by an act which gives the chairman power to adjudicate, in 'small cases
 and with certain limits, although honaf.de questions of title may have arisen. The
 want of this power has often produced a denial of justice to suitors whose poverty
 has forbidden them to seek it in a superior Court, with the frequent consequences

 of lawless contentions, violent assaults, and sometimes lamentable homicides. The
 humble man who is wronged, in fact or fancy, and has found all available legal
 tribunals closed against him, takes tlie law into his own hands and becomes his
 own avenger. I hope this gi'eat mischief will now exist no more. But the exten-
 sion of jurisdiction in title-cases and the further concession of a limited right to
 deal with transactions of partnership are only, I trust, the heralds of a more com-
 prehensive measure, giving to om- local courts, with such modification as may be
 necessary, the equitable jurisdiction already possessed by the county courts of

  England.

    You will, I am pleased to say, have the opportunity of hearing a paper on

 Laud-Tenuro, prepared by Sir George Campbell, the late Lieutenant-Governor

 of Bengal, who is emiuently qualified to speak with authority on that mo-

 mentous subject, and to whom the people of this country owe serious obhgations

 for the counsel and assistance which his great ability and large experience
 enabled him to aftbrd during the discussions which preceded the passing of
 the Irish Land Act. Of that Act, generally, I have no purpose to speak here.
 It has been hi operation for too brief a time, and its provisions have yet
 been too little interpreted by judicial exposition, to wan-ant a confident pronounce-

 ment on many points connected with it. I believe that it has ah'eady been of signal
'advantage, and will yield far greater benefits hereafter. But I refer to it now only

--that I may say a word of its purchase clauses, which and the best mode of giving
--them vitality and effect are worthy of the attention of all who care for the pros-

 perity of Ireland. As to those clauses, there was no controversy in Parliament:;
 they passed with universal approval through both the Houses. They recognized,

 with all the authority involved in so rare a unanimity of acceptance, the value of

 diffused proprietorship of land amongst om- agricultural classes. It is impossible

 to overestimate their importance to the progress of this country in industry and
 order. Yet they liave a very inadequate operation, and remain almost a dead letter
 on the Statute Book. I learn, from a report of the Commissioners of Public Works,

 that, since the passing of the Act, 338 tenant farmers have purehaaed their hold-
ings, comprising an acreage of 22,116 acres, of which the annual rent amounted to

Б13,141, at a gi-oss cost of Б319,522, including advances from the Commissioners of
Б192,066. The report informs us, further, that the applications of tenant farmers

for loans under the Statute have diminished instead of increasing, and that the
]3urchase3 of one year have been 206, whilst only 100 were made in that which
loUowed. These facts are disappointing in a high degree ; and I call attention to

them in this place that, if possible, the causes of the disappointment may be

ascertained and done away, and free and fruitful action given to legislative provi-
sions amongst the very best which have ever been vouchsafed to us. Of course I

cannot here discuss so large a question ; but I may indicate my own opinion that,

in order to the effective working of those provisions, it will be necessary to facili-
tate still further the transfer of land in small proportions, by cheapening con-

.veyances'and validating titles at a small expense; and that for this purpose it will
be essential to extend the operations of the Record of Title Office beyond the

narrow sphere within which Parliamentary opinion confined it when it was origi-

--nally designed, and to make it effective as it has never been, though years have
--elapsed since it was opened by the application of the principle of compulsion,

without the aid of which old habits, ignorant dislike of innovation, and powerful
class interests will continue to nullify its influence. The purpose of the Legis-
lature, to secure a complete and permanent register of all dealings with property
in the soil, is of high policy and plain necessity, and must not be baulked by the

supineness or the obstinacy of individuals whose own best interest will be pro-
moted when they are forced to aid in carrying out that purpose. In addition, it

will be necessary to reconsider the fiscal arrangements of the Office as well as of
the Landed Estates Court to which it is attached, and to localize their action by

the establishment of District Registries of easy access for small transactions and

with fees too moderate to bar approach to them. These seem to me the outlines

of a reform long desirable, but heretofore difficult from the vis inertice of some
and the active antagonism of others, which should promptly be undertaken by
Parliament, and has already in principle received its sanction by its general
approval of the Bills introduced by Lord Cairns during the past Session. It is

essential to Ireland, if we would have the action of a beneficial law no longer

paralyzed, and tlie passionate eagerness with which the Lish people covet the
possession of the soil indulged legitimately and within the limits of the law; so

that, instead of finding it often identified with agrarian crime, we shall see it

become subordinate and ancillary to the equitable settlement of the country and
the lasting contentment of its people, by promptiug them to obtain, through
honourable industry and manly effort, that position of secure and independent

proprietorship, which, according to all our experience of human nature, will lead
them to identify their individual interests and objects with their duty to the State,
and make them loyal and law-abiding citizens.

    There are other topics on which I coidd willingly address you, but must re-

--member my promise and conclude only observing that I should more strongly

feel the difficulty of adequately discharging the duties of a position which has been
held by Lord Derby, Lord Littleton, the late Archbishop Whately, the present
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and other very eminent persons, were I not sustained

by so many men of high capacity and established reputation, -with whose aid I
trust that our meetings may be made agreeable, instructive, and of some public

utility.

--192 REPORT 1874.

On some Practical Diffimlties in Working tlie Elementary Education Act, 1870.

                                 By Ltdia E. Beckek.

   The Elementary Education Act of 1870 contains provisions -whereby the com-

Eulsory attendance at school of children between the ages of five and thirteen may

  e secured. In consequence of the action of school-boards under these provisions

many thousands ofchildren are now attending school who did not attend previously
but the effect of the compulsory action has not been altogether favourable. In Man-

chester, while the number of scholars in the district has been increased by 13,000,
the average attendance at some of the best elementary schools has been lowered
as a direct consequence of the compulsory action of the Board. The Manchester
Board practically limited the service of notices to cases where the children had made
50 per cent, of attendances. The people rapidly discovered that they were not inter-
fered with if the children had made half the possible attendances; thence arose an
impression that half-time satisfied the requirements of the Board and of the Act,
 and this caused a lowering of the average attendance in the best schools. If a
minimum rate is fixed on as a concession to the weakness and needs of the very

poor, that becomes practically the maximum for the whole district, and the general

 rate of attendance is lowered to it.
    One of the greatest practical difficulties, especially with regard to girls, is the

 domestic difficulty. Houses have to be kept in order, babies have to be nursed,
 fathers' dinners have to be taken, &c. Girls are kept from school to do these things

 and when there are no girls, boys are frequently detained for these purposes. It

 appears open to giave doubt whether it is really necessary, in order to teach a
 child reading, writing, and arithmetic, to require two school attendances per A&j,

 It is suggested that, with properly organized schools, children who attended once a

 day regularly would be able to pass the Government standards as readily as they
 do now. There is a large proportion of cases where the earnings of the children
 stand between the parents and pauperism ; and the question suggested is, whether it
 is most in accordance with sound economic science to require that the children shall
 be sent to school at the cost of throwing the parents on the parish, or to allow the
 schooling of the children to be sacrificed to the exigencies of the poverty of the

 parents.

             Ptindiiles of Penal Legislation. By the Kev. J. T. Bitet.

     The elementary principles on which penalties ought to be regulated are not

  generally agreed upon.
     Penalties are, at the present time, regulated upon three different principles.

    i. The principle of retributive justice. This principle is now generally repudi-

  ated in theory but it is still largely acted upon in the administration of
                                                                    J

  punishment.

     ii. The principle of reforming offenders by a course of moral training. This prin-

 ciple is not allowed by practical politicians ; but it has influenced modem legislation.

     iii. The deterrent principle. This principle accords with the true theory of

  punishment, subject to limitations.

     The deterrent force of penalties is limited
         1. By defective mental capacity in a large portion of the population

        2. By excessive pressure of external circumstances, especially by want.

     The attempt to extend the deterrent force of penalties beyond those limits will
  be, to a great extent, futile; and all useless punishment is both inhuman and

  impolitic.
                                                                                         --;

                                                                                         TRANSACTIONS OV THE SECTIONS.               193

   The perfection of a penal code will be found in the deterring from crime to the
greatest extent practicable with the infliction of the least possible amount of
punishment upon those who incur the penalties.

                                                                                    II.

  A second principle is required for regulating the tnethods of punishment.

  By the fact that crime is committed, the population is divided into two classes.
The criminal class is composed of persons in whom the deterrent force of penal

laws is overborne, either from defective mental capacity or from an excessive force

of positive incentives to crime.

   The limitations to the deterrent force of penalties indicate that excessive severity
of punishment will not be employed with success in combating those causal influ-

ences in these persons.

   The dealing with these persons is a distinct problem from the dealing with the

population generally.

   This secondary object of penal legislation is to be arrived at by adapting the
methods of punishment to the causes in which the different forms of crimes

originate.

   The solution of this problem requires :

  Ani. analysis of the causes of crime.
   These may be classed as

           1. Internal and External.
           2. Negative and Positive.
           3. Proximate and Remote.

  ii. An analysis of the moral and material influences of the available methods of

punishment.

   The purely penal element of punishment is to be distinguished from its acces-
sories, whether they are inseparable from it or intentional additions to it.

   The purely penal element ought to be addressed to the criminal passion. The
accessories of the penal element must supply the influences for correcting the
internal and for remedying the external causes of crime,

                                      m.

 --Five kinds of pimishment in use enumerated : 1, Capital pimishment ; 2, cor-

poral punishment ; -3, imprisonment, of which penal servitude is one modification

4, restricted or conditional liberty ; 5, fines.

 --The extent to which these several kinds of punishment were used in the year

] 872 was as follows : 1st, thirty persons were sentenced to death, of whom fourteen

were executed                                                                      2nd,  837 persons were sentenced to be whipped ;  3rd, the commit-
                                                                                ;

ments to prison were 158,141 ; 4th, 1514 persons were released under " tickets of

leave," and others were sentenced to police supervision without penal servitude,

and 18,930 persons were released upon bail under sureties and upon their own
recognizances ; 5th, the number of fines inflicted was 281,934.

   The results obtained from imprisonment considered. The recommitments not a
fair test of its effects. The rate of the recommitments is generally misapprehended.

The rate, correctly calculated, shows that of all persons committed to prison once

75 or 76 per cent, do not return. After repeated commitment the rate increases

rapidly.

   Tlie imposing of restrictions or conditions upon liberty is a method of treatment

which is now enforced every year upon about 2000 of the worst class of offenders,

and upon 18,000 or 19,000 persons accused of the lighter forms of crime. It is

proposed to extend this method of treatment to some of the 100,000 persons who

come between these extremes of criminality.

The Increase of DnmTcenness among the Worldng Classes and the Causes of it.

                             By the Eev. W. Caine, M.A.

  A scientific writer in one of our periodicals, after describing the effect of the

elective telegraph in promoting civilization in our own coimtry and over all the
                --

--194 и" REPORT 1874.

--earth, makes a saddening remark : " But civilization," he says, " has two aspects,

and, side by side with the development of a wonderful scientific invention, we

must place the fact that in 1872 the quantity of spirits consumed in the United
Kingdom was 26,872,183 gallons, being 2,708,539 gallons more than in 1871."

So said this writer in ' Chambers's Journal,' in March 1873. Now we have

the shanie of confessing that, during the year 1873, there has been a very large
increase in the consumption of intoxicating drinks in the United Kingdom. "We

used last year

Home spirits               ,                  28,908,501 gallons.

Foreign spirits                               10,223,706  ,,

Wine                                          18,027,104  ,,

                                              57,159,311  ,,

In addition to this we used 1,076,844,942 gallons of beer, and about 18,500,000 gal-

lons of British wines, cider, &c. When we consider the enormous quantity of

intoxicating drink which has been consumed, we need not wonder at the increase

of crime, especially in our manufacturing districts, where wages have been so high

and trade so prosperous.
   The statistics of the county gaol, Manchester, in which the author was chaplain

during the years 1808 and 1869, are truly startling. This prison receives all the
criminals in the hundred of Salford, except those from the city of Manchester, for

whose accommodation a special gaol is provided.
   For the year ending September 29, 1869, the committals for drunkenness to the

county gaol were 2003, viz. 1324 males and 679 females.

 --For the year ending September 29, 1870, there were 2322 males 1518 and

females 804.               2332--males 1603, females 729
                     1871

                1872       2784 ,, 1900, ,,               884
                1873
                           3208 ,, 2095, ,, 1113

We learn from these figiu-es that in four years the committals for drunkenness

have increased 60 per cent.
   In Manchester, during the twelve months ending the 31st of March last, 9150

persons were apprehended by the police and brought before the justices for being
drunk and drunk and disorderly in the streets. Large as this number is, it is less
by 903 than the number arrested in 1872. The diminution in 1873 was doubtless
owing to the operation of the Licensing Act and the earlier closing of diink-houses,
as comparatively few were arrested during the night, and there was a decrease of
467 in the number arrested on Sundays. But it appears from the monthly reports

of the chief constable that the number arrested for drunkenness is now again

increasing.

But the committals for drunkenness to our prisons do not show the full extent of

the evils which follow in the train of drunkenness. Very many of those committed

to gaol are drunkards, though convicted of other offences of which they would never

havG been guilty if it were not for their drunkenness. The committals to the county

--gaol, Manchester, for all oifences were, in 1869, 6532 males 4fl00, females 1632.
--In 1873 the total committals for all offences were 7210 males 5051, females 2159.

Here is a lamentable state of things ! The committals of females have increased in

four years from 1632 to 2159. Female drunkenness is increasing to a frightful

extent (60 per cent, in four years), and their drinking leads to the commission of

Weother crimes.            are told by Plutarch, in his comparison of the lives of Numa

and Lycurgus, that in the early ages of Rome women were strictly prohibited from

tasting intoxicating wine ; and other ancient writers tell us that they were punished

with death for their crime, just as if they had committed adultery, " because the

drinking of intoxicating liquor was regarded as the beginning of adultery." When

will English legislators be as wise as Romulus and Numa so far as to prevent

Afemales from using these poisonous drinks ?  drunken woman was a very rare

sight in ancient Rome, but in one prison in England the author saw in two j'ears

about 3000 drimken women. He knows no greater reproach to Christianity than

this most horrible fact.

      TKANSACTIONS OF THE SUCTIONS.           195

   In the Liverpool Borough Gaol during the year ending September 30, 1873, the
committals were 12,420 ; of these, 5747 were males and (dreadful to contemplate)
6673 were females. Of these 12,420 committals, 8322 were under the care of the

--Roman Catholic chaplain, the Rev. Father Nugent ; and it is sad to think there

were 4742 women under his care in fact more females than males, as the males

were only 3580. Under the Protestant chaplain there were 1931 females and
2007 males. The author distinguished the sexes in this manner in order again to
draw attention to the absolute necessity there is of imposing some check on the

driulring of alcoholic liquors by females, if the comfort and happiness of the homes
of our people ought to be maintained. Napoleon the Fii'st said the great want of
France was " good mothers." If female drunkenness continues to increase as it
does now, the great want of our nation also will be " good mothers." Of these

committals, nine out of ten have been caused by indulgence in drink.

   The author spoke of the drunkenness in the county of Lancaster. From the

Judicial Statistics he finds there has been a corresponding increase of drunkenness
throughout the whole of England. The apprehensions for drunkenness in Eng-

land and Wales, dming the last eleven yeai's, has been aa follows :

]803   94,745  1868                  111,465
1864  100,067  1869                  122,310
1865  105,310  1870                  131,870
1866  104,368  1871                  142,243
1867  100,357  1872                  151,084

  As to the apprehensions for drunkenness in 1873, Mr. Cross, the Home Secre-
tary, in his speech in the House of Commons on April 27, when moving for leave
to bring in his Licensing Amendment Bill, said, " When we look at the facts
which I am about to place before the Committee, we must acknowledge that in

their broad outline they certainly do present a fonnidable state of things. I find
that in 1873, in England alone, no less than 182,000 persons were proceeded against

for drunkenness." From this statement it appears that in 1873 there was an

increase in the apprehensions for drunkenness of not less than 30,000.

   To what are we to attribute this increase of drimkenness ?

   1st, the author thinks, to the higher wages received by the working people

   2nd, to the shorter hours of labom- ; and

   3rd, to the increase of facilities for the procuring of the drink. The sale of

drink in gTocers' shops is, the author believes, the chief cause of the intemperance

amongst women ; and an earnest effort ought to be made to remove this source of

temptation out of their way.

                On the Privileges over Land, wrongly called Property.
                     By Sir George Campbeli,, D.C.L., K.C.S.I.

   The author said he had adopted this title for his paper in order to distinguish be-
tween absolute property and those privileges which he would rather call limited

property. What he meant to express was, that land was not an absolute property,

but a limited property', a priiilege conferred by the commimity for the benefit of
the community, and subject, to a certain extent, to the convenience of the com-
mimity. For instance, he might do what he pleased with his handkerchief, and the

law recognized his absolute property in it. But, as regarded land, his contention
v/as that there was no absolute property of that kind ; that the laud, made not by

man but by God, was rather the property of the nation, and that certain limited

pri-\dleges were conceded to individuals for the benefit of the nation, and must be
held subject to the will and convenience of the nation.

   It had been said that the man who first enclosed the common land was a robber

but he did not think that view was justified, for it was necessary that the land
should be in some degree enclosed in the first instance to protect it against the

beasts of the forest. He might quote experience of his own among aboriginal races

to show that this early property was in fact not continuous, and not injurious to a
commimity, for such land was never held in permanency ; but as soon as the
--196 REPORT 1874.

primeval fertility of the laud was exhausted, the people moved to another portion

and repeated the process there.

The land which was originally held by tribes became subject to periodical re-

distribution ; but as its cultivation became more settled, and improvement more
common, the practice of redistribution gi-adually fell into desuetude, and the

shareholders retained their shares. That process the author had seen step by

step going on. Not only were the grazing lands and also wood, water, and

other things held in common, but the inchoate individual rights were jn very

many cases subject to the rights and convenience of the community in general.

A holder could not alienate his individual holding to a stranger, arable lands

were imenclosed, and there was a imiversal right of way so long as the growing
crops were not unfairly damaged ; also there was a right of common pasture when

the crops were olf the groimd. It was, indeed, one of the most painful featvires of

our modern civilization that the land was so far enclosed that the people who did

not own it were almost altogether confined to the highways.

The village commimity was the earliest teniu-e in Evirope and Asia in which a

right in land could be traced. Sir Henry Mayne had well shown that traces of

that kind of tenure exist in our own and in neighbouring coimtries. There were

large traces in England and Scotland ; and Sir Henry Mayne had found one place
in Scotland in which the ancient tenure still existed in fidl perfection, where the
" infield " was permanently divided among the different members of the commimity,

the " outfield " divided temporarily according to the circumstances and necessities

of the season, and grazing land quite imdivided. In Ireland the tribal rights, which

imdoubtedly had existed, were only superseded by conquest. In the Highlands of

Scotland, where the people and their institutions were cognate with those of Ire-

land, the same rights prevailed, which were abolished partly by conquest after tlie

rebellion, partly by the lawyers, who applied the principles of feudal tenure to the

estates of the  Highland chiefs                                                                and thus, while the chiefs were  constituted feudal
                                                                                            ;

holders, their co-proprietors, the clansmen, were dispossessed and in a certain

degree expatriated. TJnder the feudal system the rights of the Celtic people were in

theory wholly ignored, and the villagers were treated as serfs bound to the soil. He

thought it very clear that the system under which the serfs became adscripti gleba3

was adopted to prevent moving from one part of the coimtry to another, which

might have given certain rights to the subject people. There were two rights which

mitigated despotism over a subject people : first, the right of rebellion ; and

secondly, the right of nmning away. That of rebellion was very important. He

need not say more of that at present. The right of running away was not sufficiently

understood. He had seen a great deal of benefit obtained from that right. When

a man was much oppressed it was a very great right that he should be enabled

to run away, to desert his master, and enlist himself under the banner of a new
one. In days of anarch}-, when lords were ready to turn their hands against each

other, it was necessary to establish a Irind of trades' union to prevent that emigra-

tion. One way of doing that was by passing a law to prevent serfs from nmning

away. But even the binding of the serfs to the soil gave them certain rights in
connexion with the soil, so that what was injurious in one way was beneficial in

--another. The other day, in Russia, on the occasion of the emancipation of the serfs,

the view put forward by the latter was " True, we are yours ; but the land is ours."

Philologers believe that some of the modern languages are not corruptions of the

ancient ones, but revivals of popular languages of ancient days. So also with

regard to the inferior rights to land, the author was inclined to believe

that the lower classes of tenure which cropped up in altered forms imder the
feudal system were not merely what the lawyers held them to be, the produce of

indulgence and prescription, but a revival, in another form, of the old right of the

subject people, long suppressed, but never wholly extinguished. Such he believed

to be the English copyhold tenure. In Ireland the ancient rights of the people had

been recently recognized in the Land Act. The numerous commons in England

were, no doubt, very substantial remains of the old rights of the commimal holding.

The right of primogeniture he believed to have arisen simply because the title to

land was not an absolute right. It was evident that some one person must be respon-

sible for the duties of an office, which duties could not be divided amongst the

Wean office, the succession went to the eldest male.  should be very careful how

we do away with office-tenure by abolishing the right of primogeniture. He much

suspected that such a change would be more in the interests of plutocracy than of

the people. He doubted whether it would bring us one step nearer to a wider dis-

tribution of the land among the people, properly so called. It would free the land-

lords from the burthens of special taxation, which were the legitimate successors of

the service burthens of former days. In India the establishment of an ordinary law

of property applied to land had produced most ruinous effects. Lord Comwallis sought

to create an Indian aristocracy by turning the land-revenue collectors into landholders.

But the law of primogeniture not being carried out, the result was that in Bengal

there was scarcely an estate that was not held by a great many holders imder every

variety of tenure, and the duties of the landlords were thrown back again on the

Government. After an experience of seventy or eighty years, that was a difficulty

which they had now begun most thoroughly to realize in India, and it had been

especially realized in connexion with the recent famine. When they tried there

to insist on the landholders doing their duty to the people and their tenants, the

particular responsible landlord could not be got hold of, so vast was the variety of

rights and interests, inferior and superior, on the estate. The Government had

therefore been obliged to step in, and do the duty which it was originally supposed

the landlord would do. If the division of property among all the children were

made compulsory in England, he doubted whether the etfect would be, on the

whole, good. If by such means the land came to be divided generally among the

people at large, he would be in favoiu: of it ; but he suspected that the more such

land was brought into the market the more it would go to plutocrats, and as little

as ever to the people. Moreover, people holding a divided estate, treating their

portions as absolute property, woiild be far less liberal landlords than a single

owner, would bo less restrained by social bonds, and would be more likely to seek

to make the most of their property. Under such a system, for instance, tenant-right

in Ulster and other parts of Ireland would never have assumed the shape it has, and

it would not have been possible or, at all events, so easy to establish it by statute

as it has been now established. It would also be injurious in inducing younger

sons to remain at home with less property than their fathers, as Frenchmen and

others did. In Scotland especially it would be a great misfortune if yoimger sons

had not gone out into the world to carve fortunes for themselves. There is still a

great deal of the aristocratic spirit in this country. As soon as a man becomes rich

Wehe seeks to rise into the aristocratic class.  have a gi'eat respect for lords, ladies,

and swells. So long as this lasted he doubted whether we ought to throw away

those duties to the public which the moral persuasion of public opinion imposes on

Athe holders of great estates imder the law of primogemture.  great landlord,

subject to the compulsion of public opinion, was likely to do more, for instance, in

the erection of workmen's dwellings, than a man who buys property as a specula-
tion ; and he believed, as long as we treat those great landholders as office-holders,
we may, by moral compulsion, force them to do their duty to the public, which

they would not do if they were allowed to muddle away their estates. At the same

time he thought a divorce of the people from all rights in the land would be the

greatest of all evils, and would lead to revolution. He thought that, rather than
look to any petty measiu-es to promote the subdi^-ision of estates, we should rather

look to the growth of tenant-right as a legitimate mode of giving a large propor-

tion of the people a real interest in the land ; and by tenant-right he meant such a
Erivilege as would give the tenant some value in his holding, and some feeling that

  e might improve without fear of being unfairly turned out or risk the loss of his

property. With reference to the Irish Land Act, men in high position in Ireland

agree That it has immenseh' raised the position of the Irish tenant ; and, on the

other hand, complaints were not heard of ruinous confiscation on the part of the

landholders. He believed there was no doubt that property in Ireland had actually

risen in value since the introduction of that Act ; and that was a true test that the
landlords had not been injui-ed. They had heard that the Land Act liad, in the

main, been successful, and only wanted improvement in its working details. If

honestly made the best of, and improved in a true spirit of soimd legislation, he

had BO doubt of its ultimate siiccess. In England and Scotland the question stood
on a different footing ; but it was becoming more and more evident that the far-
mers would insist on obtaining more security for their interests than at present

existed.

On the Teacliing of Hygiene in Government Schools.

               By EicHAED Caton, M.D.

Notwithstanding the effects of sanitary legislation, tlie death-rate among the

poorer classes in large towns, in the manufacturing districts especially, continues

to be very great. The duration of life among this class averages from twenty to
twentj'-five years in many of the larger centres. As town population is rapidly

increasing, and that of the country districts diminishing or remaining at a stand-

still, the injurious influence of town residence on tlie health and vigour of the

people is likely to become a very serious question, and calls for great earnestness in

sanitary reform.

   Hitherto sanitary legislation has been solely directed to the amendment of the

--outward circumstances in which the people are placed such, for example, as the

avoidance of overcrowding, the improved construction of dwellings, the establish-

ment of good systems of drainage and water-supply.

While such reforms as these are of the highest importance, there is yet another

direction which eftbrts at the inipro^'emeut of the health of the people might take,

viz. that of reforming their habits of life. The absolute ignorance of the laws of
life and health which prevails among our lower-class town population is disastrous
in the extreme. Were all external sanitary conditions made as favourable as towns

permit of, the mistaken habits of life of the people would of themselves cause a

high mortality.

The object of this paper is to suggest that the required Imowledge might be

Adiffused among the people through the agency of our National Schools.                                           brief,

simple catechism, explaining the rules of health, and pointing out how greatly the

comfort and length of life depends upon their observance, coidd be readily taught

to the elder scholars. Such points as the following, dealing with the affairs of

--their every-day life, would, I think, be readily understood : The importance of

fresh air and free ventilation in houses ; the dangers of sleeping in close crowded

bedrooms the danger of breathing sewage-gases the value of sunlight, of exer-
                                              ;;

cise, of the free use of pure water ; the main rules of diet, such as a statement of

the kinds of nutritive foods necessary for health, and the forms in which they can

best be obtained ;  the  proper dieting and  management  of children                                             the disastrous
                                                                                                              ;

effects of intemperance ; simple rules as to clothing ; the dangers of unhealthy

occupations, the modes of escaping their injurious effects ; the requirements to

be kept in view in selecting a healthy dwelling-house, &c. It is true that our

system of education is yet crude and undeveloped, but every year will increase its

efficiency, and render such teaching as this less difficult. If the object of education

be to prepare for life, I cannot conceive any thing more essentially a part of it than

this : to Imow how to live must surely be as important as how to read, write, and
count ; from the want of such knowledge thousands of the people die needlessly

evei-y year. Such teaching as the above would be a means of helping them
intelligently to improve their own condition, and, along with other sanitary

measures, it might reasonably be expected to lessen the excessive mortality at

present existing among the lower classes.

   On the Compilation of Statistics, illustrated hy the Irish Census Meturns.
                         By George Egberts Croa\t;, Belfast.

   The author suggested a system of compilation by which census returns, or any
other statistics which it wotdd be necessary to produce from a large mass of data
periodically, could be prepared within one half the time and at one half the cost
at present expended, and show the results in a more exact, vaiied, and utilitarian
light, without causing any disturbance of existing formulae or precluding comparison

malce four marks or cuts, viz. a straight line, a curve, a right angle, a point ; and
with incisions or cuts made by it he proposes to have the data registered. These
cuts can be made to show thirteen aspects of a leading question ; and in illusti'ation
of his method he suggested their applicability for recording the " religions " of the

people in connexion with their ages and occupations, thus

superior class of clerks should be employed (some of the " supernumeraries." of Go-

that at present obtains. To obviate any difficulty that might arise in the subse-

quent analysis from the concrete or synthetic nature of this method, and at the

same time to economize time and extend the efficiency of the compilation, he pro-
poses that the record should be made on six (or more) sheets simultaneously by
placing one over the other, and having the incision made through them, thereby

opening up a field for a valuable division of labour ; for the forms could be divided,

after the enumeration had been completed, among six clerks, each clerk to get on
simple duty to attend to in connexion with his sheet. For instance, one clerk migh
condense in the place for totals, whether vertical or transverse, all the informatioi

respecting education, another that relating to matrimony, a third to religion, and 8(
forth ; or one could count up all the " pei-pendicular cuts " in each column, whicl

would give the numbers of each age, of each trade, who were " Protestant Episco

palians ; " while the transverse totals of the same cuts would give the numbers o
all ages of that religion and occupation, the colom-ed chambers in which thosi
totals should appear aifording an analysis of their connubial and educational condi

tions, showing how each was repressed or encouraged by the other. The nex

clerk would in like manner work on the " right incline cuts," which would givi

the same particulars regarding " Roman Catholics," and so on for " Presbyterians,'

" Methodists," &c. In connexion with the tabulation of these conditions of th<
people, viz. the " occupation," " age and sex," " religion," " education," and " matri
monial state," he suggested that the "house census " might be shown to the left o
the form ; the colours and cuts to show the "classes of houses," "numbers of families,'

&C., from which would be seen how those conditions affect the domestic comfort
means of living, and position in society of our people. The author thinks that all th(

Adata provided by the census-paper, "lorm " (excepting that relating to disease anc

death), might be tabulated by two manipulations ; the second tabulation to show tht
" birthplaces " of the people, the " relation " of the members of each household tc
the head of it, the state of education of the " married," unmarried," and " widowed,'

--the " ages and sex ; " the ages to be shown by,the cuts in school periods of " undei

seven years," "twelve years," and upward which plan, he thinks, would be most

suggestive, .all showing, from an ethnological point of view, how the idiosyncracies
of race affect us and tend to make oui- populations more or less homogeneous ; how-

ever, the skilled statistician might group those conditions in a more useful manner

Even the blind might do it ; for the cuts would .appear ou the obverse of each

sheet slightly in relief, and the acute sense of touch which they possess would
enable them to distinguish the symbols. However he would not recommend tht

experiment; he mentioned the matter parenthetically to show how the system
might be made available for the instruction of that afflicted class. For the com-

pilation of " Vital Statistics," the writer considered the method would be peculiarly

valuable, seeing that our occupations and social conditions have such an effect upoi
our health and longevity. The circumstances calculated to repress or occasioi

disease would be specified ; and the exceptional data required for some classes, sucl

paupers are at present reported on in the status of disease ; the causes and temp
 tations that led to their degraded state could be ascertained with greater nicety
 and measures founded thereon calculated to drive vice and misery from societj
 The author submitted that by this system the chief difficulty that statistica
 scientists have to contend with could be removed ; for as at present, owing ti
 the great labour and delay in compilation, he is obliged to contract his desire
 within the limits of what he considers practicable of attainment, that more subtl
 and refined analysis of conditions necessary to show statistical truth in all it
 bearings is too often not made, on account of which erroneous conclusions regard
 ing some cases or localities are arrived at ; but as by this method any twelve sub

 sidiary conditions relating to any' (me leading subject can be registered bj' tw
 simple operations in a most intimate and truthful connexion, the field of inquir
 can be enlarged, while at the same time the work would be diminished, therefor

 many things that at present appear anomalous or strange, and which are now onl

 accounted for by surmise, could be placed in a true statistical position. Also ne^

 features of much interest would be necessarily shown ; for instance, in the Iris

 census returns, the occupations of the married and unmarried are not given (ho^
 requisite in preparing factory bills !) ; but this method would show them in connexio
                               TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.      201

with the age, sex, religion, and education, all in a concrete manner or in their several

relations. He also submitted that by it records could be kept at each dispensary

district of the diseases of the locality pari passu with their occurrence, showing

how they were " begun, continued, and ended ;" one of the incised copies to be

forwarded periodically to a central office to be tabulated for the advancement of
medical science and the consequent sanitary benefit of the community. Doctors
could, on a properly arranged table, register the leading particulars of each day's
work in a few minutes.

   In conclusion, he attributed the delays that occur in the publication of census
and other standard statistics to the apathy of the public regarding statistical

science ; for if it were more generally appreciated, the laws of demand and supply

would soon provide a remed)\ By a proper arrangement of the statistics of his

business, both as regards "plant," "materials," and "money," the merchant or
manufacturer could learn when, where, and hoio to repress expenditure and develop

income, and from an intelligent examination of our national statistics see new
fields for the investment of capital. Narrow and sectarian views too often restrict

the utihty of a census, as is the case in that of Great Britain, which affords no

information respecting the religion or education of the people, which was so much

wanted in connexion with recent legislation. If statistics were better imderstood,

we would very soon have a department at Whitehall where all our national facts

would be registered with mathematical precision and published with the regularity
of a gazette, so that merchants, manufactui-ers, and philanthropists, as well as
statesmen, could obtain standard information on all subjects of importance. It

could supply at a day's notice the Parliamentary returns so frequently called for

by the advocates of new measures and now provided with such delay and expense,
and, what would be perhaps of greater importance, it could aiford correlative infor-
mation to the opponents of them fully and promptly.

T?ie Economic Law of Strihes. By W. H. Dodd, A.M., Barrister at Law.

   At the outset it is necessary to inquire if there be a " law." Economic science
has been put on its defence recently by writers both in America and England.
The "law " of abstract political economy on the subject is modified in actual fact
in two ways. It is modified by the nature of profits themselves. The first element

in profits is remimeration for saving, or interest ; the second is remuneration for

risk, or assurance ; the third is the wages of superintendence, including all

elements not included under the first two. The first two elements are equal or

nearly equal over all trades and manufactures in the same country at any given

time                      the  third varies  from  trade to trade, and from individual to individual.  It
                       ;

is this third element that a combination of labour attacks ; and on this very account

a strike is more difficult of settlement, since the amount of the profits is unknown

to those attacking them. But the economic law is also modified by historical or

local circumstances and here it may be well to inquire what is the law. The rate
                                                                                          ;

of wages depends on the amount of the wage-fund divided by the number of

labourers. The first element in this (wage-fund) is made up of all capital other

than fixed capital, and all wealth not capital devoted to the employment of labour.

AAgain, profits depend solely on the cost of labour. If we assume to be the
A--finished commodity, W-|-P = A, and therefore
                                                   \V = P. Lastly, as regards

exchange. Articles will exchange in accordance with the wages and profits

=expended on them, or W-|-P W'-|-P'Hh. This is briefly the law of political

economy ; but it is modified locally and historically by a variety of considera-

tions. In a place, for example, where there is only one manufactory, such as

Bessbrook, the relations between employer and employed are open to modification

from the sagacity and wisdom of the employer in making more profits than usual

in the manufacture, from his being content with less, or from his deliberately

sharing his profits with his workmen. On the other hand, they may be modified

by the ignorance or selfishness of the employed, or by factious and evil-minded

agitators. Again, a particular manufacture may have exceptional advantages in

locality, and may for a series of years obtain a kind of monopoly. Capitalists in

1874.                                                         15

such a place get an advantage in tho nature of rent. Now, wliether they can
maintain the monopoly depends on whether the natural advantages are being well
managed, whether they are not overborne by corresponding disadvfintages. AVhether
the capitalists can grasp all those benefits or be compelled to share them with the
labourers depends on the degree of skill required for the work, and the length of
time required for the obtaining such skill. "Whether, again, the monopoly be per-
manent or temporary must be considered. If it be temporary, and fresh hands not
immediately obtainable, the owners must share their profits with the workers. If
the manufacture be overcrowded, the remedy is not to lower wages, but for

the weakest or least competent employers to discontinue production.
   Manchester has advantages for cotton manufacture in its coal and iron and

knowledge of machinery. When these are overtaken (if they be overtaken by
America) we will not perhaps see the anomaly of the raw material being brought

thousands of miles to be manufactured, and sent back thousands of miles to be
sold. Belfast has advantages in the flax-fields of Ulster and in the knowledge

and skill of its manufacturers, slowly acquired and carefully treasured, in banking-
accommodation, facilities for locomotion, and otherwise. Whether the advantages

are abused or not, whether the manufacture has not been pressed to a point
beyond what the natural advantages would warrant, whether the employers can
keep all the extra gains arising from such advantages or must share them with the
workers, depends on the wisdom and sagacity of the manufacturers, on the con-
fidence placed in them by the workmen, on the general state of trade, and other
considerations which abstract political economy rejects. But though feudalism
has ceased to be sole arbiter in land-tenm-e, and though the relations between
capital and labour are supposed to be founded solely on contract, political economy
cannot disguise, and does not seek to disguise, the fact that friendliness and
sympathy and cooperation between employer and emploj'ed, as between landlord

         On the Ulster Tenant-Right. By Professor Donnell, M.A.

   The Ulster Tenant-Right, up to the introduction of the Irish Land Act, was
almost unknown in England, and but imperfectly understood outside the limits of

Ulster. Mr. Gladstone's speech on introducing the Bill brought it under the notice
of the empire. This speech contains an admirable exposition of the Ulster Tenant-
Right. The Ulster Tenant-Right is the tenant's right of continuous occupancy of

his lands, subject to a fair rent, which may be periodically revised, and the right of

selling this occupancy right at the best price to a solvent and unobjectionable
tenant. This right embraces a property valued by Dr. Hancock twenty years ago
at Б20,000,000, but recent invostigations in the Land Courts show that it would
not be overestimated at Б35,000,000. This right was universally respected by the

large landowners in Ulster up to 1838, when the Irish Poor-law was introduced

and an impetus given to farm consolidation. Restrictions on the price of the
Tenant-Right have in some cases been since introduced ; and in other cases the right
has been altogether abolished. This arose from the fact that the custom, though
as old as the Ulster Plantation and generally observed, had no legal protection.
The first section of the Irish Land Act first legalized it. The custom is economi-
cally beneficial ; it gives security for improvements, and it is the cause of a great
saving in poor-rates and police charges. The legalization of the Ulster custom has
not diminished the value of the landlord's estate ; on the contrary, the sales in the
Landed Estates Court show, since 1870, an increase of two to three years' purchase
 in the value of estates.

    The Act has not, as was intended, fully legalized the custom. The leaseholders'
 tenant-right has not been sufficiently protected. The tenant-right in town-parks and
 pasture-farms is still without legal protection. The resti-ictions on the prices of the

 tenant-right have not been entirely removed. Disputes about the adjustment of
 rent are not directly investigated. The Courts have been declared incapable of
 making decrees of declaration of right and of specific perfonuance. These are

blots on the Act, but appear not to have been contemplated by it. Their removal
by a declaratory Act woidd do much to complete the great and beneticent measure
of justice to the L-ish tenants--the Irish Land Act.

Oa Political Economy and the Laws affecting the Prices of Commodities and
   Labour, and on Strilces and Lock-outs. By Frank P. Fellows, F.S.S.

A better knowledge of the principles of political economy which regulate the

prices of commodities and labour, which cause trade to b3 good or bad, by both

employers and employed, would do much to prevent the unfortunate lock-outs and

strikes that waste so much of our national resources. In this paper the author

endeavoured to show clearly what are the causes which make wages rise and fall,

and which cause trade to increase and decrease.

It unfortunately happens that political economy is too often spoken of as a hard,

harsh, unfeeling science, and that it is considered to be inimical to the best interests

of the wage-receiving classes ; whereas, properly understood, it is a light and a
beacon to guide these and all other classes ; by which individuals, communities, and

nations may discover that by which they may earn the most, and which will be

best for themselves and the world at large.

  The author asked first. What is it that makes trade good or bad ? and this was

answered by an illustrative argument.

  " I will suppose first that by the fiat of my will I coidd at once double the )mm-

ber of people living on this earth, doubling the houses, mills, &c., at the same time

keeping the proportional numbers occupied in each class of trade, agriculture (the in-

creased agriculturists cultivating new land), &c., the same. What would be the result

to the various trades and occupations of men, and to the amount of wages earned by

workmen, and to the profits of the employers ? It will be at once seen from my ques-

tion that if I double the number of each class of iron-workers, weavers, carpenters,
food-producers, and of every other class of occupation, I double the number of each

ai-ticle made, of each sort of food produced, and that I double at the same time

the number of consumers for the said articles or food, the wages of each class

would remain unaltered ; for if double the quantity of shoes are made, double the

quantity are wanted ; if double the quantity of food is produced, double the quantity
IS wanted, &c. But suppose (instead of the above case) that I were to double the

goods'-producers and goods produced, but that at the same time the food-producers

--and the food produced remained stationary What then would be the result ?

" Simply this, that there would be a glut of goods'-producers and of goods pro-

duced, and a great scarcity of food-producers and of food produced. Consequently

the merchants and manufacturers would find gi-eat difficulty in selling their goods,
and the prices thereof would fall ; the wages of the goods'-producers would fall also.

At the same time the price of food would rise, there being a scarcity of it in pro-
portion to the demand for it, and the wages of the food-producers would rise also.
Of course this is on the assumption that tliere is no transfer of labour from the

goods'-producing class to the food- producing class."
   This latter process has in times past been going on with us; for the United

Kingdom, the author continued, is the workshop of the world, i. e. the goods'-
Wef)roducing country and people.
                                  have increased in times past our popu-

ation and goods produced faster than the food-producing countries. This

has induced the emigration to America, Canada, and Australia to keep up the

equilibrium. Individual trades, he said, are aft'ected in like manner. Limitation

of production is, he continued, an evil, and the wages of men must be considered

with reference to what those wages will purchase. He next referred to the boon

of machinery, of cheap production, i.e. of abundant production, i.e. of not limiting
production in order to raise prices. It does not necessarily follow that this means

the lowering of the money amount of wages; indeed facts show the reverse to be
                                                                                                   15*

the case; tut it does mean increasing the amount of things those wages will
purchase, or, in other words, of raising those wages. Working men, so called, are

termed the bone, muscle, and sinew of the nation ; but what would this bone,

muscle, and sinew be without the brain and the directing power ? The bone and

muscle and  sinew of one man will do the manual work of  one man                                            the brain and
                                                                                                         ;

directing power of one man may devise means by which one man may do the work

of a thousand. Skilled artisans have high wages because of brain-directing power,

machinery, and capital. It is the brain and directing power and the economizing

spirit that has created capital and increased wages, and not combinations or strikes

nor can lock-outs permanently lower wages.

 --The economizing spirit creating wealth and increasing wages was spoken of and

illustrated thus: "Two persons, each having Б1000, expend the amoimt as

--follows : The first spends his Б1000 entirely upon himself or family, in rent, food,

--clothes, &c., for his or his family's use. He has thus certainly distributed the

Б1000 amongst the community the bakers, grocers, &c. ; but at the end of

the year, although he has thus spread it abroad, he himself has none of the Б1000

left. The second expends his Б1000, say, in building houses or in making goods.

The Б1000 is distributed first amongst brickmakers, masons, carpenters, labourers,

&c. in wages for building, and in so far it tends to increase wages by creating more

employment ; secondly, the Б1000 is also distributed amongst the bakers, grocers,

--&c. as in the first illustration, but by the masons, labourers, &c. instead of by

the individual himself, with this result that the second has expended his Б1000,

and yet he has houses of the value of Б1000 left. Thus he increases the goods or

houses produced, and in so far tends to lower their prices or rents, and increases

the demand for useful and profitable labour, and in so for tends to raise the rate of

wages."

  The author, quoting "Man doth not live by bread alone," showed the necessity

(apart from mere pecuniary considerations, but still from a politico-economic point
of view) of our being civilized and refined, of having clean and healthy houses, of
having recreation and leisure, and even some of the refinements and luxuries of
civilized life, as tending to increase and strengthen our mental, moral, and physical
efficacy, and therefore our creative originating power and our power of work,

especially the higher kind of work. He went on, in conclusion, to show the evil

eftects of strikes, and the tendency they have to drive away trade from particular

districts.

         On the Study of Education as a Science. By Mrs. W. Grey*.

   The first question to be met is that which will be raised by the title of this

paper, '' Is there or can there be a science of Education ?" If the general or even
the educational public were polled upon it, the answer would almost certainly be

in the negative. The College of Preceptors alone among our scholastic corpora-

tions has acknowledged the fact by appointing a Professor of the Science and Art

of Education, Mr. Joseph Payne, than whom no one was better qualified for the

post yet the appointment excited some derision among even zealous advocates of
                         ;

national education. It is, however, beginning to be admitted in theory that there
is an art of education, and that teachers ought to be taught to teach, all hough it
is not recognized in practice beyond the sphere of elementary school teachers. In

every German and vSwiss University there is a Professor of Pedagogy, or the art i
and method of teaching ; but here all the secondary education of both sexes is in the I
hands of those who have never even been taught that there is such an art. Whence .
this disbelief and distrust in scientific principles and methods in education, while
their superiority is admitted by every educated person in all other departments I
of human activity ? The answer probably lies in this, that there is no adequate |
or general conception of what education is, and therefore of the magnitude and

complexity of the facts on wliich a science of education, wliich can never be an

exact, but only a mixed and applied science, must be based. If we had such a

conception, fjiving; us a standard by which to measure success or failure, we should

at once feel the necessity of scientific methods to realize it. Instead of it we start

with a confusion of terms, using education as synonymous with instruction ; and

the confusion of thought indicated by this misnomer runs through our whole

treatment of the subject, theoretical and practical, as is shown in every parlia-

mentary debate and in every discussion of the subject, public or private, especially

where the education of the working classes and of women is concerned. It is

surely time that this confusion should be replaced by a scientitic conception of the

--process which should result in the most valuable of all products human beings

developed to the full extent of their natural capacity, trained to understand their

--Wework in this world and to do it. The conditions of the problem are these :

have to consider the threefold nature of the human being to be dealt with, physical,

intellectual, and moral, together witli his power of volition, which makes him a

responsible agent, and to distinguish what elements of his constitution are common

to him and his species, race, or family, and those pecuhar to himself which con-

stitute his individuality. Next come the external conditions under which he lives,

physical, mental, and social (which also may be classed as those common to all
human beings), those common to all of his time, country, and social position,

and those peculiar to himself and forming his individual lot. Throwing out that

which is purely individual, and does not therefore admit of generalization, though

forming a most important branch of study for the practical educator, there remains

the wide field of general facts and forces ; and the study of the comhination of these

forces, and their resultant influence on the formation of character, is the study of

education as a science. It is at once apparent how vast a field of knowledge is thus

Wecovered.  must learn from physiology how to train the body not only to health

and strength, but to grace and beauty ; from psychology, how to train the intellect

and moral nature, how to form habits, which is the master power of education

from observation of human life in the world around us, and from the records of

the history of human societies, of religion, art, literature, and science, how to reach

the springs of human action, and especially the idealistic or spiritual element,

which is the most powerful of all, and from these deduce the right order of educa-

tion, the right methods of teaching, and the right subjects to be taught, relatively

to the age and mental development of the pupil.

The study of education as a science includes the education of nations as well as

individuals. Nations have characters as well as individuals, on which their well

or ill being depends ; and no questions are more worthy of scientific study than

how those characters are formed. The statesman is the most powerful of educa-

tors, for he helps to form the social atmosphere, which is the most active force in

the education of every individual. The educational influence of the poor-law,

which was the real Elementary Education Act of England, may be cited as' an

instance. Of the practical questions requiring solution by a scientific standard,

only a few of the most pressing importance can be mentioned. The first is class in

education. The impartial comparison of our own system, which preserves social

distinctions in education, with that of Scotland, Germany, Switzerland, and the

United States, which disregards them, and makes the primary and secondary school

and the University parts of one whole, adapted to diflereut ages and degi-ees of

--mental development, not diflbrent classes of society such a comparison, including

social as well as educational results, would greatly assist us in the gradual re-

modelling of our scholastic institutions, now going on under the influence of the

vast movement of transition which characterizes our epoch. The second problem

is that of sex in education ; and as there is none that touches such burning ques-

tions, so there is none that more urgently requires to be considered in the scientific

spirit which seeks the truth only. Whether the ditt'erence between the sexes is

one of kind or degi'ee, or only of proportion, between the various mental and moral

faculties, how this difference should be dealt with in education, whether women

suffer physically from regular and sustained mental effort daring the transition from

girlhood to womanhood, or whether it does not rather steady the nervous system and

preserve the due balance between the emotional and intellectual nature essential to
                                   --

--206 REPORT 1874.

the sound mind in the sound body, what, in short, is the type of perfect woman-

hood and how it is to be developed, are questions waiting for impartial study, and

on the right solution of which the future welfare of the race will largely depend.

The last point to mention is the system of examinations, which practically governs
Weour whole scholastic procedure.
                                   require some scientific principle to decide

what is the right system of examination, whether it shall test memory or intelli-

gence, the knowledge of words or of ideas, of rules or of principles underlying

those rules. Since an examination is now the inevitable portal to every professional

career, it is not too much to say that the results it tests and rewards will be the

only ones generally aimed at. It is not expected of schoolmasters and mistresses,

and mothers of families, that they should master this vast range of knowledge or

be ready with answers to all these questions. What is wanted is that they, like

our practical navigators, should be furnished with the principles of a science they

have not had to discover for themselves, and with charts to guide their general
course, leaving to their individual acumen the adaptations and modifications

required by special cirumstances.
   The proofs of these charges against the present system, or want of system, in

education are to be found in the Reports of the Royal Commissioners on Public

Schools and Endowed Schools, of the Committee of Council on Education, of the

various medical examining bodies, in the evidence of schoolmasters and mistresses,

and in the facts of our social life. Great services have been rendered to the cause

of scientific education by many writers and practical educators at home and
abroad, in times past and present ; but these services have not had their due meed

of public recognition and acknowledgment, and the valuable materials supplied

have not been coordinated into a body of science admitted into the recognized

hierarchy of sciences, although education, as the application of all other sciences

to the production of the highest of all results, may be boldly proclaimed the crowning

science of all.

Sanitary Legislation and Organization : its Present State and Future Prospects-

                       By Thomas W. Geimshaw, A.M., M.D.

   Although the parliamentary session which has just terminated has not been so
eventful in sanitary legislation as many sanguine sanitarians anticipated, yet, with
the small time at its disposal, the extreme hurry of public business, and the
difficulties which a new Ministry had to deal with in a new House of Commons,
a considerable advance has been made in sanitary legislation during the past
session by the passing of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, the Public Health

(Scotland) Act, the Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, the Vaccination Amendment
Acts, and the Registration of Birtlis and Deaths Amendment Act, besides the advan-

tage likely to accrue from the Report of the Select Committee on the Adulteration

Act of 1872, and the passing of the new standing orders with regard to the

destruction of dwellings of the working classes for the construction of works for

public companies.

   The requirements of sanitary legislation appear to me to be as follows :

  AI. codification, consolidation, and amendment of existing laws.

    II. Convenient areas for administration, with easily workable subdistricts.

    HI. Uniform authorities without clashing of jurisdiction.

  AIV. complete executive organization.

    V. Constant supervision by the central authority.
    VI. Security for a certain amount of independence for the local officers from the

local authorities.

    I. Codification and amendment of sanitary law.

    I believe sanitary law to be one of those subjects so technical, and the terms of
 which are susceptible of very considerable accuracy of definition, that it is emi-

 nently suited for codification.

    Not only was sanitary legislation spasmodic, but generally imdertaken under
 the influence of panic, either from a recently past, present, or impending epidemic.
 The first real attempt at systematic legislation was made in 1848. In 1866 was
 passed the Sanitary Act of 1866, which may be considered the first attempt at
                                                                         ----

                      TRiiNSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                                             207

a general measure of public health legislation. This Act was got up in a hurry to

meet the cholera epidemic of 1865-6G. The Act was permissive and nearly useless.

It laid down useful principles, and must be looked upon as the backbone of future

sanitary legislation. All these Acts were useless until the Public Health Act of

1872 was passed, which made action under the sanitary Acts compulsory on local

authorities. This Act broke down almost completely. Now a similar Act hoa

been passed for Ireland, but is vastly superior to its English prototype. After the

foregoing statement it is scarcely necessary to prove that sanitary law requires

coditication and amendment. Mr. ilichael, an English, and Mr. Furlong, an Irish

barrister, agree in condemning the present state of sanitary law.
   The Royal Sanitary Commission of 18G7, in its Report, states that " the present

fragmentary and confused sanitary legislation should be consolidated, and the

administration of sanitarv law should he made uniform, universal, and hnperutive

throughout the kingdom." The amendments of sanitary law which should be

introduced into any complete code are :

  --1. General laws with regard to the construction of dwellings. Houses at pre-

sent may, in the majority of places, be built in anj' way the owner pleases, and the

law concerning houses unfit for human habitation does not come into force unless

the owner of the houses purposes that they shall be inhabited.

2. Amendment of the laws respecting food and drink.

3. General laws regarding markets and slaughter-houses.

4. Laws with regard to the keeping of animals to be used as food or in the

production of food, such as would be specially applicable to dairy-yards, which are

a great evil in most large towns. I believe, with regard to other matters, there

is now law enough to  remedy  defects                                    and  if the above additions were made,  the
                                                                      ;

present law slightly amended, and the whole codified, scarcely any thing more

would be required.

II. Convenient areas of administration, with easily workable subdistricts.

The areas which suggest themselves in the first instance as suitable sanitary dis-

tricts are those which are in use for other pm-poses, and this principle was at once

adopted in all sanitary legislation. It is impossible to go into all the various

kinds of subdivision of the difterent parts of the kingdom ; but it is sufficient to

state that for each important piu-pose a separate kind of division has been adopted,

especially in England, less, however, in bcotland, and still less in Ireland. Two

classes of existing local districts were selected, namely, urban districts and rural

districts. In England the districts consist of the Metropolis-Boroughs, Improve-

ment-Act Districts, Local-Government Districts, and Poor-Law Unions, each with its
local governing body as its sanitary authority. In Scotland the districts are Towns
under Town Councils, places under Police Commissioners, and parishes with paro-

chial boards. In Ireland the districts are the city of Dublin, towns corporate,

towns with populations over 6000 having town commissioners imder General Acts,

all towns under Local Acts and Poor-Law Unions, each with its local governing

body as its sanitary authority.
   The difficulties which arise from want of imiformity are :

1. Conflict in the jurisdiction of the authorities.

A2. want of uniformity in their areas and population, most of them being too

small for separate administration.

3. General irregularity in their form, many being long and narrow, and therefore

unmanageable, and often laid out without any reference to the natural drainage of

Howthe country.     can all this be remedied ? It seems to me that, by takmg a

sufficient number of these divisions, uuiting them into an administrative district for

all local purposes, and constituting the local authorities from the representatives of

these, the difficulty would be got over.
   If the English and Scotch systems of poor-law medical relief were assimilated to

that of Ireland, the principle of the Irish Public Health Bill could be immediately

made applicable to those countries, and thus one great difficulty solved.

   III. Uniform authorities without clashing of jurisdiction.
   The views I have stated regarding districts must, if accepted, decide to a great
extent all other questions, especially those with reference to authorities. In a few

instances large towns, say of over 30,000 inhabitants, should constitute separate и
208 REPORT-- 1874.

disti-icts. The authorities of these should include, besides elected, a certain number
of ex officio members, or members recommended by the central authorities.

   IV. Complete executive organization.

   This should consist of--

             1. The Central Authority.
             2. The Medical Advisers of the Central Authority.
               3. Inspecting Medical Officers of Health.
             4. The Superintendent Medical Officers of Health.
               5. Local Medical Officers of Health.

               6. Engineering Staff.
                7. Inspectors of Nuisances.
                8. Analysts.

   1. The Central Authority is in England and Ireland at present, and should con-
tinue to be, the Local Government Board. In Scotland it is the Board of Super-
vision for the relief of the Poor and of Public Health, which might be better called
the Local Government Board of Scotland. In order to make these boards efficient
as central authorities for supervision of matters connected with public health, I

--consider that certain duties now attached to other departments should be transferred

to these boards namely, the supervision of lunatics and the inspection of factories,

and the registration of births, deaths, and marriages, and a new department for the
registration of disease. The Central Health Authority is the only department
which requires immediately to utilize the statistics collected by the Registrars-
General ; and I would suggest that the Kegistrars-General departments should be
amalgamated with the Local Government departments, and the Registrars-General
become Local Government Commissioners.

 --2. The Medical Adviser of the Central Authority. I consider the position occupied

by this officer in Ireland is his proper position, and that the medical adviser in
such important matters should always occupy a seat on the Board.

 --3. Inspecting Medical Officers of Health. This title was proposed by my friend

Mr. Furlong, and I consider it an extremely suitable one. It must be admitted
that an efficient special department of experts exists in connexion with the English
Local Government Board, namely, the medical department which is under the
direction of Mr. Simon ; but the inspectors (all eminent men) only exercise their
functions imder special circumstances, generally connected with outbreaks of disease.

The duties, thereiore, of this department do not so much tend to the prevention

of disease (the object of sanitary legislation and organization) as to inquire into the
cause of some disease which has already been allowed to produce fatal results. I
would suggest that a staff of local government inspectors should be constantly
employed, each with a special district assigned to him, these inspectors to be called
Inspecting Medical Officers of Health. There would be considerable difficulty in

selecting suitable districts ; but I think this may be accomplished by taking as a

basis the divisions adopted by the Registrars-General.

 --4. The Superintendent Medical Officers of Health. These are the officers provided

for by the Irish Act of 1874, and are, I believe, intended to superintend onlj- public
health operations in populous places, such as large towns, say towns of 30,000
inhabitants and upwards. Of such towns there are 130 in England, seven in
Scotland, and four in Ireland, but with subm-ban districts added there must be
several more in each country. I consider similar officers should be provided for
towns in England, and they would correspond to the medical officers of health of

--urban sanitary districts.
    5. Local Medical Officers of Health. These should be, as provided in the Irish

Act, the poor-law medical officers, each for his own district ; but their emplovment
is at present optional in England, and this has resulted in great confusion.' The

poor-law officers are manifestly the most suitable, as the very nature of their

--occupation brings them in contact with the first outbreaks of epidemics.
   6. The Engineering Staff. Every sanitary authority must have a surveyor in
 arge towns permanently employed, but in small places and rural districts employed
as consultants only when required. There should also be engineering inspectors cor-
responding with the medical inspectors, but their districts might be much wider.

                                                                           I
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.  209

 --7. Inspectors of Nuisances. These should correspond respectively with the

superintendent medical oificer of health and the local medical officer of health, and
should be under the control of these officers.

   Now, how are these officers to be appointed and paid ? All the inspecting

officers should be appointed and paid by the state. All the local officers should be
appointed by the local authorities, but with the consent of the central authority,
and should be paid partly by the local rates and partly by the state as at present,
or (what I should prefer) the whole service for the United Kingdom should be

--made a public health Chil Service of the state.
   8. Analj'sts. The appointment of public analysts has rather fallen into disrepute
of late ; and no wonder, considering the curious nature of the appointments.

   V. Constant supervision by the central authority.
   It is scarcely necessary to write more upon this point, as the inspecting medical
and engineering officers will secm-e this.
   VI. Security for a certain amount of independence for the local officers from the

local authorities.

   This will, I think, be amply secured by the constant supervision and the
arrangements for payment and appointment. If the service was made a State
Civil Service, the independence would be complete. This security for inde-

pendence is a matter of more importance than most people think. It may not
unfrequently happen that the offender against sanitary law will be a member of the

local authority.

                        On Postal Reform. By "W. Hastings.

   Reference made to the paper read at the Bradford Meeting proposing an imme-
diate adoption of one penny as a sufficient rate for a single letter between any two
post-offices, however distant, which have a regular uninterrupted communication.
As one penny is sufficient where there is transit in addition to the service of
two post-offices, one eighth of a penny should suffice for mere stamping, sorting,
and delivery ; and if this were combined with hourly deliveries fi'om 8 a.m. till
evening, a traffic which has now no existence, but which would be an immense
boon to the public, would soon arise, and the lowness of the postage would draw
into the post-office a host of printed matter, (Circulars, cards, and advertisements
which are now almost invariably sent out by special messengers.

   The plan of hourly delivery was adopted in 1766 in Edinburgh by a Mr. Peter
Williamson, and was so successful that the post-office gave him a pension to give
up his ventiu-e.

   The success of omnibus traffic, which depends on frequency and punctuality, is
a wan-ant, in the author's opinion, that if his plans were adopted with letters it
would hjive a like success.

                 Reclamation and Sanijication of the Pontine Marshes.

                              By Dr. Henkv MacCoemac.

  A multitude of publications have appeared on this important matter, among the

rest Prony's " Marais Pontins " and Dr. Palestra's "Poche Parole sul Eisanamento
dell' Agro Romano " in the ' Archivio di Medicina,' Rome, 1873. If things go on
as they are doing, observes Secchi in his ' SuUe Condizioni Igienice del Clima di

Roma,' we need have little hesitation in prophecying that Rome must become an

oasis in the midst of a pestiferous desert, the prey of desolation ('' preda della

desolazione "). The tracts variously termed Pontine Marshes (Maremma, Campagna,
Agro Romano) extend some few hundred miles along the Italian shores, occasion-
ally penetrating twenty miles into the interior, from Cecina in the north to TeiTa-
cina in the south. The alluvium from the Apennines, in the course of ages, has
formed appai-ently this low-lying, naturally fertile, but otherwise most insalubrious

preceded by more than one Roman Emperor, tried tlieir hands at drainage ; but tlie

incessant civil and religious wars, with the absence of general simultaneous effort,
Adefeated every attempt.
                          permanent staff of engineers, such as we find in

Holland in connexion with the dykes, a well-digested plan of action, with unin-

termitted personal supervision, would all prove requisite. The antiquated Appian

Way and railways excepted, no properly constructed roads traverse this vast

region. There are no dwellings either ; at least the poor labourers who reap the
sparse crops in the season, when their sweltering day's toil is done, sleep absolutely

without a roof over them in the open, and with little sustenance beyond a slice of

water-melon and a crust. The Pontine Marshes are said to derive their name

from Pometia, one of the perished cities. Eoads and even canals appear to have

been constructed so far back as the times of Appius Claudius, Julius Ccesar,

Augustus Caesar, Trajan, and subsequently by Popes Boniface, Martin, Leo, Sixtus,

and Pius. The French also made some attempts ; but, all these notwithstanding,

the Pontine Marshes are Pontine Marshes still. The reclamation of the Agro

Romano, as Dr. Balestra most justly insists, in point of canalization and subsequent

cultm-e ought to extend simultaneously to the whole of the implicated surfaces

(" all intern campagna, assohdamejite a tutti i terreni"). No operations, however, at

least in certain locaUties, ought to be conducted in July and August, as the paludal

poison or malaria at such periods is simply homicidal. Periodical overflows of the

Tiber should also be prevented. Such oecun-ences, as shown in the great recent

increase of intermittents from the bursting of the banks of the Po, are greatly

conducive to paludal disease. Raised tram- and causeways, in fact, ought to inter-

sect the whole region. Canals extending to the sea, aided at their outlets when

needful by the steam-engine, should carry off everj' particle of stagnant water.

Salt water and fresh ought nowhere to be permitted to mix. Labom-ers should be

safely housed in suitable localities, or, when season and position permitted and

required, conveyed nightly to their homes on the bills. Steam-ploughs, steam-

reapers, and steam-mowers, as far as possible, must be made to supersede human

toil. And, lastly, I would have sen-ied masses of the Uiicali/ptus glohilns, Ilelian-

thus or sunflower, Pistia stratiotes, and others, as the editor of the 'Pabellon Medico '

in May last urges, to extend along highways and around dwellings, in short every

locality where human beings require protection from the baneful influence of marsh

miasma (" como prescrrador de las Jfebras de acceso "). The pine-trees generally

and the various individuals of the natural order Myrtaceae, indeed, seem highly

antagonistic to malaria, qualities more or less appreciated in. ancient as well as

modern times. It is, in truth, almost incredible that nations should, at a vast

outlay, keep playing at soldiers and sailors when, as in the case of the Italian

Maremma and the watery expanses Еf Ireland, highly removable blights are

permitted to eat into the very vitals of the community.

       Reformatory and Industrial School System, its Evils and Bangers.

                         By Hans M'Moedik, M.A. {Belfast).

   The author directed attention to the evils and dangers of the Reformatory and
Industrial School system. The governing committee is a private and self-elected
body and practically irresponsible. The tax-payers have no voice in the selection
of the persons who control and distribute the funds. The Reformatory and Indus-
trial Schools are prisons, for the inmates are deprived of personal liberty. The
supervision exercised over them is inadequate. Om- jails are subjected to the most
regular and careful supervision. Voluntary associations should not be entrusted
with the punishment of crime. The committees, moreover, are not bound to

receive all whom the magistrate or judge may send. The cost of the system is

enormousty great, and in addition to its revenue from the public funds, it intrudes
on the supplies intended for truly charitable institutions. Though the condition
of destitution is that most prolific of physical imperfection, the schools will not
receive the deformed child. The schools must pay, and therefore a selection is

necessary. The system is competing unfairly with the artisan and trader. Some
committees tender for orders; they being subsidized by the public funds can

--market.
The  institutions  are  sectarian                                             they thus intensify religious bigotry

fruitful source of great evils in our social system. The number of juvenile criminals

is not decreasing. The system has failed to repress juvenile crime and to reform

criminals. Its indirect moral effects are bad. It tempts the children of the poor

to abandon honest labour and become inmates. It tends to destroy the feeling of

parental responsibility. It induces parents to neglect their duties to their children

so as to qualify them for the Industrial School or Reformatory. He suggested

that the workhouse system (reformed in its present vforking) could by an easy

extension take the place of the Reformatory and Industrial School. The tax-payer

is represented on its board. The proceedings and accounts are subject to public

control. It has buildings and a staff" of officials in every union. It was devised

to meet the claims of destitution, and is non-sectarian. It is much less costly, and

the rights of the state are protected by the Local Government Board.

    A Scheme for the Technical Education of those interested in Land.

        By the Rev. AVilliam Watson Wood, Wichham Market, Suffolk.

   The writer of this paper drew the attention of the Section to the want of

technical knowledge displayed by those most interested in the cultivation of land,

wliether as landlords or tenants, and proposed a plan by which this necessary know-
ledge might be obtained. After remarking upon the unintelligent cultivation of
land which was made to produce only two and a half quarters per acre, whilst

land of the same description, in soil and subsoil, produced five or six quarters of
the same cereals, and on grass lands showed even a greater disparity of production,
he cited instances within his own experience of improvements actually made on
farms of different soils and situations.

  A1st. light-land park in 1848 produced scarcely gi-ass enough for two cows and

twenty sheep, and was let at 12s. 6d. per acre. By a very small outlay the amount
of stock fed was trebled, and the land has been let since for Б2 5s. per acre.

   2nd. On poor heavy-land pasture, almost valueless and growing the worst kinds

of grasses only, by drainage, manuring, and sowing the better kinds of giass seeds,
the produce in 1872 was estimated at Б100 on nine acres. The purchase of manure,
he remarked, would be needless if the right artificial manures were used on the
arable lands at the right time in fair quantity, and suitable to the wants of the
different cerccals for which it was applied, three and a half loads of straw per acre,
which might easily be grown on such lands, allowing a good margin for the
manuring of pastures, if mixed with artificial food, and thus made into manure

of a certain strenglh.

   The third instance he adduced was that of a park that would scarcely keep a herd
of deer, and which, by the use of underground irrigation, returned Б40 per acre in

1870. He then proceeded to remark tliat whilst England justly claimed pre-

eminence for her breeds of horses and cattle, yet the gi-eat majority of these were
bred regardless of those points which would add to their utility and beauty.
" Drive," he writes, " a few miles in any direction from visiting the most famous

breeds, and how many flocks or herds do j'ou find possessing any thing approaching
their qualities F It is no exaggeration to say that many persons might suppose,
from observation of tlie stud or stock-yard, that those who send stock to them

were intent upon perpetuating their imperfections. There is no reason, except

unintelligent management and cultivation, why we should not have horses and
meat both better and cheaper." The attention of the Section was next invited to
the number of unintelligent farmers intermixed with others who farmed unin-

"Atelligently and injured the farms, the community, and themselves.   close

observation of many years," said the wi-iter, " during which it has been my custom

to diive long distances for the express purpose of iuvestigting this matter, convinces

me that the proportion of ill-cultivated land in England is seriously large, and the

loss to the nation and to individuals is immense. Men will take farms, and land-

lords will accept them as tenants, who scarcelj' understand the sj'stems in vogue,

nor the modern discoveries and inventions which would increase the fertility of

their land and enhance its value : the consequences are ohvious, the land, improperly

cultivated, deteriorates in value, a double blow is death at the pocket of the occu-

pier and at the condition of the fai'm, and too often it takes years to recoup the

one and to restore the other."

The scheme " for the technical education of those interested in land " was then

introduced. The main points were the combination of ordinary education with

the gradual acquisition of agricultural knowledge, the slow process of vegetable

growth admitting of gi-adual instruction in the raising and treatment of plants

and cereals, especial stress being laid upon the fact that "life at a public school or

at a imiversit)' unfits young men, more or less, for the acquirement of such know-

ledge, their tastes and inclinations interfering in many cases with the necessary

work to be done and the necessary observation to be given ere a man can really

understand the requirements of plants and animals and the manipulation (which

on heavy land is extremely delicate and important) of varying soils.

Assuming that the desirability of acquiring this knowledge was conceded, the

writer then proposed that it should be imparted to students, from time to time, in

such a manner as not to interfere vrith ordinary scholastic teaching, the only

objection appearing to be the expense of an extra teacher, whose whole time should

be given to this branch of education. In this manner, it was the writer's opinion,

that it was possible to make young men " brilliant scholars and intelligent practical

farmers at the same time," conferring upon them information most useful to members

of Parliament, magistrates, and country gentlemen, and " enabling them to compre-

hend the wants and feelings of their tenants and neighbours, and thus investing

them with a certain moral power which without this knowledge they could not

possess in so high a degree."

                       MECHANICAL SCIENCE.

   Address by Prof. James Thomson, C.E., F.B.S.E., President of the Section.

Foe a number of years past it has been customary, in this and other sections of the

British Association for the Advancement of Science, that the President should give
an introductory address at the opening of each new session. In compliance with
that usage, 1 propose now to offer to you a few brief remarks on various subjects of
Mechanical Science and Practice. These subjects have not been chosen on any
systematic plan. I haA'e not aimed at bringing under rcA'iew the whole or any large
number of the most important subjects at present worthy of special notice in En-
gineering or in Mechanics generally. I intend merely to speak of a few matters

which have happened to come under my notice, or have engaged my attention, and
which appear to me to be interesting through their novelty or through their im-

portant progress in recent times, or to merit attention as subjects in which amend-
ment and future progress are to be desired.

   In Railway Engineering, one of the most important topics for consideration, as
it appears to me, is that which relates to the abatement of dangers in the conduct-

ing of the traffic. The traffic of many of om* old railways has become enormously
increased in recent years. With the construction of new lines the numbers of

junctions, stations, and sidings have been greatly increased ; and each of these en-

tails some attendant dangers. As a natural consequence of the increased traffic on

                      TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.                                           213

old railways, the additional traffic on new lines, and the increased complexity of
the Teailway system as a whole, there have been during recent years more numerous

accidents than in the earlier times of railways. It is to be recollected, however,
that with a greater number of people travelling daily, more niimerous accidents
might be expected, and that their increased frequency, on the whole, does not
necessarily indicate increased danger to the individual traveller. Referring to the
Statistics of Railway Accidents published by the Board of Trade in Captain Tyler's
Report for the year 1873, I find, for various periods during the last 27 years,
throughout the United Kingdom, the proportion of passengers killed from all causes

beyond their own control, to the number of passengers carried, to have been, in

round numbers :

Proportion of number killed to number carried in the

three years, 1847, 1848, and 1849                     1 in 4,782,000

In the four years, 1856, 1857, 1858, and 1859         1 in 8,708,000

In the four years, 1866, 18G7, 1868, and 1869         1 in 12,941,000

In the three years, 1870, 1871, and 1872              1 in 11,124,000
                                                      1 in 11,381,000
And in the single year 1873

It is thus gratifying to observe that, in spite of the increased risks naturally

tending to arise through the increased and more crowded traffic, and the more com-

plicated connexions of lines, the danger to the individual traveller is now less than

half what it was 26 years  ago                     at least this result is indicated, in  so  far as we can
                                                ;

judge, from the statistics of deaths of passengers from causes beyond their own con-

trol. That the conducting of the traffic of railways still involves hazards far from

inconsiderable, and that we have much to wish for towards abatement of dangers

of numerous kinds, is proved by the fact that, during the single year 1873, there

have been killed of the officers and servants of the railway companies in the United

Kingdom 1 out of every 323 ; so that, at this rate, extended through a period of,

for example, 20 years' service, there would be 1 out of every 16 of the officers and

servants Idlled.

   These deaths of officers and servants are not to be supposed to be caused in any
large proportion by collisions and by other accidents to trains in rapid motion.
The great majority of them arise in shunting and other operations at stations and
along the lines, and occur in numerous ways not beyond the conti'ol of the indi-

viduals themselves. In respect to the passengers, too, it ought to be known and

distinctly recollected, that although collisions and other violent accidents to trains

in rapid motion, together with other accidents beyond the control of the individuals,
usually cause by far the deepest impression on the public mind, yet the numbers

of these fatal accidents are small in comparison to others arising to passengers from

causes more or less within their own control. For instance, it may be noticed

that in last year, the year 1873, while the deaths of passengers arising from all

causes beyond their own control, in the United Kingdom, were only 40 in number,
there were four times as many killed, namely 160, in other ways ; and of these there
were so many as 62 killed in the simple way of then- falling between carriages and

platforms.

    In respect to the conducting of the traffic of the trains in motion, it appears to

me, on the whole, that when we consider the vast complexity of the operations in-
volved in worlring many of our ramified and crowded railways, and when we con-

sider tlie indefinitely numerous things whicli must individually be in proper order
for their duty, and must be properly worked in due harmony by men fai- away fi-om

one another, some stationed on the land, and others rushing along on the eno-ines

or trains, the wonder is, not that we should have numerous accidents, but that

accidents should not be of far more frequent occun-ence. There can be no doubt,
however, but that of the accidents which do occur many arise from causes of kinds
more or less preventible according to the greater or less degree in which due pre-

catitions may be adopted.

    Gradually, during a period of twenty or thirty years past, a very fine system of
watching, signalling, and otherwise arranging for the safety of trains has been con-
trived and vers' generally introduced along our principal lines of railway. In
.saying this, I allude chiefly to the block system of working railways, with the aid
--214 REPORT 1874.

of telegi-aphic signals and interlocking mechanisms for the working of the points

and signals.

In former times it was customaiy to allow a certain numher of minutes to elapse

after a train passed any station, or j miction, or level crossing, or other point where
a servant of the company was stationed, before the succeeding train was allowed to

pass the same place. Thus at numerous points along the line a time interval was

preserved between successive trains. It was quite possible, however, that the fore-

most of the two trains, after passing any of these places where signals were given,

might become disabled, or might otherwise be made to go slowly, and that the fol-

lowing train might overtake it, and come into violent collision with it from behind.

In order to provide against the occurrence of such accidents, a system was intro-

duced called the Block System ; and its main principle consists in dividing the line
into suitable lengths, each of which is called a block section, and allowing no engine

or train to enter a block section until the previous engine or train has quitted that

portion of the line. In this way a space interval of at least the length of a block

section is preserved between the two trains at the moment of the later train's passing

each place for signalling ; and the risk of this space interval becoming dangerously

small by negligence or other accidental circumstances, as the later train approaches

the next place for signalling, is almost entirely avoided.

Further, at each signalling-station, the various levers or handles for working the

points, and those for working the semaphore signals for guiding the engine-drivers,

instead of being, as was formerly the case, scattered about in various situations

adjacent to the signalling-station, and worked often some by one man and some by

another, without sufficient mutual understanding and without due harmony of action,
are now usually all brought together into one apartment called the signal-cabin. This

cabin, like a watch-tower, is usually elevated considerably above the ground, and is

formed with ample windows or glass sides, so as to alFord good views of the railway

to the man who works the levers for the semaphores and points, and who transmits

by electricity signals to the next cabins on both sides of his own, and, when neces-

sary, to other stations along the line of railway.

The interlocking of the mechanisms for working the points and for working the

semaphores, which, by the signals they show, control the engine-drivers, consists in

having the levers by which the pointsman works these points and signals so con-

nected that the man in charge cannot, or scarcely can, put one into a position which

woidd endanger a train without his having previously the necessary danger-signal

or signals standing so as to warn the engine-driver against approaching too near to

the place of danger.

The latest important step in the development and application of the block system

is one which has just now been made in Scotland, on the Caledonian Hallway.

Before explaining its principle, I have first to mention that a semaphore arm raised

to the horizontal position is the established danger-signal, or signal for deban-ing an

engine-driver from going past the place where the signal is given. Now the ordi-

nary practice has been, and still is, to keep the semaphore arm down from that level

position, and so to leave the line open for trains to pass, except when the line is blocked

by a train or other source of danger on the block section in front of that semaphore,

and only to raise the semaphore arm exceptionally as a signal of danger in front.
The new change, or improvement, now made on the Caledonian Railway consists

mainly in arranging that along a line of railway the semaphore arms are to be

regularly and ordinarily kept up in the horizontal position for prohibiting the

passage of any train, and that each is only to be put down when an approaching

train is, by an electric signal from the cabin behind, announced to the man in charge

of that semaphore as ha-\dng entered on the block section behind, and when, further,

that man has, by an electric signal sent forward to the next cabin in advance,
inquired whether the section in advance of his own cabin is clear, and has received
in return an electrical signal meaning " The line is clear you may put doicn your

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;

debarring signed, and let the train 2^(iss your cabin." The main effect of this is

that along a Une of railway the signals are to be regularly and ordinarily stand-

ing up in the deban-ing position  against allowing  any train  to  pass                    but  that just
                                                                                        ;

as each train approaches, and usually before it has come in sight, they go down

almost as if by magic, and so open the way in front of the train, if the line is ascer-

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1

tained to be duly safe in front ; and that immediately on the passage of the train

they go up again, and, by remaining up, keep the road closed against any engine or

train whose approach has not been duly announced in advance so as to be known

at the first and second cabins in front of it and kept closed, unless the entire block

section between those two cabins is known to have been left clear by the last pre-

ceding engine or train having quitted it, and is sufficiently presumed not to have

met with any other obstruction, by shunting of carriages or waggons, or by accident,

or in any other way.

This new arrangement*, which appears to be a very important improvement, has

is no reason why we should not abate as many dangers as we can.

Within the past twenty years very remarkable progress has been made in steam-

navigation generally, and more especially, I would say, in oceanic steam-navigation.

In this we meet with the realization of great practical results from the combination

of improved mechanical appliances and of physical processes depending on a more

advanced knowledge of thermodynamic science.

The progress in oceanic steam-navigation is due mainly to the introduction jointly

of the screw propeller, the compound engine, steam-jacketing of the cylinders, super-

heated steam, and the sm-face-coudenser.

The screw propeller, in its original struggle for existence, when it came into

competition with its more fully developed rival, the paddle-wheel, met with favoiu--

ing circumstances in the want tlien strongly felt of means suitable for giving a

small auxiliary steam-power to ships arranged for being chiefly propelled by sails.

For the accomplishment of this end the paddle-wheel was ill suited ; and so the

screw propeller got a good beginning for use on long oceanic voyages. Afterwards,

in the course of years, there followed a long series of new inventions and improved

designs in the adaptation of the steam-engine for worlring advantageously with the

new propeller                                                        and it has resulted that now, instead of  the screw being used as an
                                                                  ;

auxiliary to the sails, the sails are more commonly provided as auxiliaries to the

screw. For long oceanic voyages it became very important or essential to get

better economy in the consumption of fuel. In order to economize fuel, high-pres-

    * [Since the delivery of this address, a remark by the editor of 'Engineering,' in the

issue of that Journal for August 28, 1874, has come under my notice, in which he denies

the supposed novelty of the system of signalling here described as newly introduced on

the Caledonian Railway. He states that the system described has been in use for many

years past on several railways, and that, amongst others, the Metropolitan Eailway has
never been worked upon any other system. Also he says that on a portion of the Great
Eastern (then the Eastern Counties Railway) the system was in use upwards of twenty

years ago. On the other hand, I learn from officers of the Caledonian Railway engaged

in carrying out tlie alteration of system on the lines of the Caledonian Company, that
tliey think the system as introduced on their railway has still much of novelty in com-
parison with any thing previously done on any line extending over long distances in the
country, and that though the Metropolitan Eailway be worked on a system similar in
some respects to that which they are introducing, yet the whole circumstances of that
urban railway are so different from those of railways extending through the country, as
to leave tlie introduction of the system here described on an ordinary railway, such as
the Caledonian, still to be regarded as a change jjresenting important features of novelty

in a practical point of view.

   Having now mentioned these statements, I prefer to leave any further discussion of

the distinctions of different systems which have been or are in use, and of exact points of

novelty in their introduction, to those who may be in possession of fuller evidence on tlie

subject than what has hitherto been obtained by me. J.imes Thcmson, November 1874.]
--216 REPORT 1874.

sure steam, with a liigli degree of expansion and with condensation, was necessary.

This led to the practical adaptation for the propulsion of vessels of the compound

engine, an old invention which originated with Hornblower in the latter part of

last century, and was afterwards further developed by Wolff. The high degrees

of expansion could not be advantageously used in cylinders heated only by the

ordinary supply of steam admitted to them for driving the piston ; and more espe-

cially when that steam was boiled off directly from water without the introduction

of additional heat to it after its evaporation. The knowledge of this, which was

derived through important advances made in thermodynamic science, led to the

introduction into ordinary use in steam-navigation of steam-jacketed cylinders,

and to the ordinary use also of superheated steam. With increased efforts towards

economy of space in the hold of the ship, which became the more essential when

very long voyages were to be undertaken, and with the new requirement of greatly

increased pressure in the steam, the old marine boilers, with their flues of riveted

plates, were superseded by tubular boilers more compact in their dimensions and

better adapted for resisting the high pressiu-e of the steam. In connexion with

these various changes the old difficulty of the growth of stony incrustations in the

boilers became aggravated rather than in any way diminished. As the only avail-

able remedy for this, there ensued the practical development and the very general

introduction of the previously known, but scarcely at all used, principle of surface-

Acondensation instead of condensation by injection.                                            supply of distilled water from

the condenser is thus maintained for feeding the boilers, and incrustations are

avoided. The consumption of coal is often found now to be reduced to about 2 lbs.

per indicated horse-power per horn*, from having been 4 or 5 lbs. in good engines

in times previous to about twenty years ago.

Before the times of ocean telegraph-cables very little had been done in deep-

sea sounding                                                     but when the laying of ocean  cables came first to  be contemplated,
                                                              ;

and when it came afterwards to be realized, the obtaining of numerous soundings

became a matter of essential practical importance. In the ordinary practice of

deep-sea sounding, as carried on both before and since the times of ocean telegraph-

cables, until a year or two ago, a hempen rope or cord was used as the sounding-

line, and a very heavy sinker, usually weighing from two to four hundredweight,

was required to draw down the hempen line with sufficient speed, because the

frictional resistance of the water to that large and rough line moving at any suit-

able speed was very great. The sinker could not be brought up again from great

depths                              and arrangements were provided,  by means of a kind        of trigger-apparatus,
                                 ;

so that when the bottom was reached the sinker was detached from the line, and

was left lying lost on the bottom, the line being drawn up without the sinker, but

with only a tube of no great weight, adapted for receiving and carrying away a

specimen of the bottom. For the operation of drawing up the hempen line with

this tube attached, steam-power has been ordinarily used, and practically must be

regarded as necessary.

  A great improvement has, within the last two or three years, been devised and

practically developed by Sir William Thomson. Instead of using a hempen sound-

ing-line, or a cord of any land, he uses a single steel wire of the kind manufactured

as pianoforte wire. He has devised a new machine for letting down into the sea

the wire with its sinker, and for bringing both the wire and the sinker up again

when the bottom has been reached. With his apparatus, in its earliest arrange-

ment, and before it had arrived at its present advanced condition of improvement,

he sounded, in June 1872, in the Bay of Biscay, in a depth of 2700 fathoms, or a

little more than three miles, and brought up again his sinker of 30 lbs. weight

after it had touched the bottom, and brought up also an abundant specimen of

ooze from the bottom, in a suitably arranged tube attached at the lower end of the

sinker.

  An important feature in his machine consists in a fi-iction-brake arrangement, by

which an exactly adjusted resistance can be applied to the drum or pulley which

holds the wire coiled round its circumference, and which, on being allowed to

revolve, lets the wire run off it dovra into the sea. The resistance is adjusted so

as to be always less than enough to bear up the weight of the lead or iron

sinker, together with the weight of the suspending vnre, and more than enough to
       TRANSACTIONS OP THE SECTIONS.                                     317

bear up the weight of the wire alone. Thus it results that the arrival of the sinker

at the bottom is indicated very exactly on board the ship by the sudden cessation

of the revolving motion of the drum from which the wire was unrolling.

Another novel feature of great importance consists in the introduction of an addi-

tional hauling-up drum or pulley, arranged to act as an auxiliary to the main drum

during the hauling-up process. The auxiliary drum has the wire passed once or

twice round its circumference at the time of hauling up, and is turned by men so

as to give to the wire extending from it into the sea most of the pull requisite for

drawing it up out of the sea, and it passes the wire forward to the main drum, there

to be rolled in coils relieved from the severe pull of the wire and sinker hanging in

the water. Thus the main drum is saved fi-om being crushed or crumpled by the

excessive inward pressure which would result from two or three thousand coils of

very tight wire, if that drum unaided were required to do the whole work of haul-

ing up the wire and sinker.

The wire, though exposed to the sea-water, is preserved against rust by being

kept constantly, when out of use, either immersed in or moistened with caustic

soda. The fact that steel and iron may be preserved from rust by alkali is well

known to chemists, and is considered to result from the effect of the alkali in

neutralizing the carbonic acid contained in the watei-, as the carbonic acid appears

to be the chief cause of the rusting of steel and iron.

This new method of sounding, depending on the use of pianoforte wire, was first

Wm.publicly explained by Sir  Thomson in the Mechanical Section of the British

Association at the Brighton Meeting two years ago ; and in the interval which

has since elapsed it has come rapidly into important practical use.

I have to-day already brought under yom- notice a system of elaborately contrived

and extensively practised methods of signalling and otherwise arranging for the

safety of trains in motion on railways. These methods, in the aggregate, as we
have them at present, may be looked on as the result of a gradual development,

which, through design and intelligent selection, has been taking place during the

last twenty or thirty years or more. In contrast with this I have now to mention

a reform towards abatement of dangers at sea, which at present is only in an

incipient stage of its practical application, but which, I am sure, must soon grow

into one of the important reforms of the future. I refer to the provision of means
whereby every important lighthouse shall, as soon as it is descried, not only make
known to the navigator that a light is visible, but also that it shall give him the

--much more important information of what light it is, that, in fact, it shall distin-

guish itself to him from aU other lights either stationed on land or can-ied by ships

out at sea. The rendering of lighthouses each readily distinguishable from every
other light by rapid timed occultations was urged on public attention by Charles

Babbage about twenty or twenty-three ago, in connexion with a like proposal of

his for telegraphic signalling by occulting lights. His admirable idea, however, so

far as it related to the distinguishing of lighthouses, has unhappily been left almost

entirely neglected until quite recently. Although 1 say it was almost entirely

neglected, yet very important steps in the direction of the object proposed were

taken many years ago by Messrs. Stevenson, Engineers to the Commissioners of

Northern Lights ; and the flashing and intermittent lights introduced by them, and

now used, although too sparingly, in various parts of the world, constituted a very-

great improvement in respect to distinctiveness. The first practical introduction of
an intermittent extinction of a gas-light, which is a method now likely to become
fruitful in important applications with fiurther developments, was made many years

ao-o by Mr. \Vllson at Troon ; and an admu-able application of this plan by the Messrs.

Stevenson to cfifry out the principle of rapid signalling is to be seen in the Ardrossan
Harbour light, which is alternateljr visible for two seconds, and then for two seconds

is so nearly extinguished as to be invisible. The whole period--four seconds--is,

1 suppose, the shortest of any lighthouse in the world. This light fulfils the con-

dition of being known to be the light which it is within five or ten seconds of its

beino- first perceived ; and thus, in respect to distinctiveness, I trust that I may,

with'out mistake, say it is the best light in the world. Mr. John Wigham has suc-

ceeded in constructing large burners for the combustion of gas in lighthouses in

general, including those of the first order, and embracing both fixed lights and

revolving lights. He has also, in both these cases, applied with the most striking

success the principle of occultation. Dr. Tyndall, in his Eeports to the Board of

Trade, has dwelt frequently and emphatically on the ease with which gas lends

itself to the individualization of lights. By its application he affirms that, by simple
arrangements, it would be possible to make every lighthouse declare its own name.

Withm about the last two or three years, the subject has been taken up energeti-
cally by Sir William Thomson. He has become strongly impressed with the
enormous importance of the object in question. He has perseveringly laboured in

making trials in various ways, Doth by the method of partially extinguishing gas-

flames and by the method of revolving screens ; and I have pleasure in stating that,

as a result of his effijrts, a self-signalling apparatus is now constructed for the Bel-
fast Harbour Commissioners, who are preparing to bring it into immediate use at

the screw-pile lighthouse, at the entrance of the harbour of Belfast. I shall not

now enter on any description of this arrangement, as I imderstand that the appa-

ratus, which has already been temporarily erected for trial in the lighthouse, and

has shown good results, is to be exhibited and explained to this section by Mr.

Bottomley, who, as a member of the Board of Harbour Commissioners, has taken

an active part in the promotion of the undertaking.

I wish next to make mention of the very remarlcable works at present in progi-ess

in the Harbour of Dublin, under the designs and under the charge of Mr. Bindon

Stoney. In order to form quay walls with their foundations necessarily deep under

water, he constructs on land gigantic blocks of artificial stone, or, as we may say,

of concrete masonry, each of which is about 350 tons in weight, and which are

accurately formed to a required shape. After the solidification of the concrete, he

carries them away, and deposits them on an accurately levelled bottom of the sea, so

that they fit closely together, and form so much of the quay wall in height as to

reach above the low-tide level, and so as to allow of the completion of the wall

above by building in the usual manner by tidal work, and to allow of the whole

structm-e being earned out without the use of coffer-dams. These operations are

on a scale of magnitude far surpassing any thing done before in the construction

and moving of artificial stone blocks. They are carried out with machinery and

other appliances for the removal and the placing of the blocks, and for other

requirements of the undertaking, which are remarkable for boldness of conception

and ingenuity of contrivance. The new methods of construction devised and

applied in these works by Mr. Stoney are recognized as being admirably suited for

the local circumstances of the site of the works in the Harbour of Dublin, and their

various arrangements form a very important extension of the methods of construc-

tion available to engineers for river- and harbour-works.

While progress has been made with gigantic strides in many directions in

engineering and in mechanics generally, while railways, steamboats, and electric

telegraphs have extended their wonders to the most distant parts of the world,

and while trade, with these aids, is bringing to our shores the produce even of the

most distant places to add to our comforts and our luxuries, yet, when we come

to look to our homes, to the places where most of our popiilation have to spend

nearly the whole of their lives, I think we must find with regret that, in matters

pertaining to the salubrity and general amenities of our towns and houses as

places for residence, due progress in improvement has not been made. Our house-

drainage arrangements are habitually disgracefully bad; and this I proclaim

Weemphatically, alike in reference to the houses of the rich and the poor.  have

got, since the early part of the present century, the benefits of the light of gas in om-

apartments ; but we allow the pernicious products of combustion to gather in
large quantities in the air we have to breathe ; and in winter evenings we live

with our heads in heated and vitiated air, while our feet are ventilated with a

current of fresh, cold air, gliding along the floor towards the fireplace to be drawn
Aiiselessly up the chimney.
                             very few people have commenced to provide chimnejs

or flues to carry away the fumes of their more important gas-lights, in like manner
as we have chimneys for our ordinaiy fires. In mentioning this, however, as a

suggestion of the course in which improvement ought to advance, I feel bound to
ofler a few words of caution against the introduction of flue-pipes for the gas-
flames rashly, in such ways as to bring danger of their setting fire to the house.
TRANSACTIONS OF THE SECTIONS.       219

People have a strong tendency to require that such things as these should be con-
cealed from view. In this case, however, special care should be taken against

rashly placing them among the woodwork between the ceiling of the apartment
and the floor of the room above, or otherwise placing them in unsafe proximity
to combustible materials. In many cases it would be better to place the flue
exposed to view underneath the ceiling, and, by introducing some accompanying

ornamentation, to let the flue be regarded as a beneficent object not unpleasing to

the eye.

   The atmosphere of our large towns, where people live by hundreds of thousands
all the year roimd, is not yet guarded against needless pollution by smoke,
jealously, aa it ought to be. Many of the wealthier inhabitants take refuge in
living in the country or in the subm-bs of the town, as far away as they can from
the most densely built and most smoky districts ; but the great masses of the people,
including many of all ranks, must live near their work, and for them, at least, greater
exertions are due than have yet been made towards maintaining and improving the
salubrity and the amenities of our towns. As to the abatement or prevention of
smoke from the furnaces of steam-engines, the main requisites have long been very
well known ; but sufficient energy and determination have not yet been manifested
towards seeming their due application in practice. In too many cases futile plans
have been tried, and on being soon abandoned have left a strong impression against
the trying of more experiments ; and this may account in part for the introduction
of real improvements having been so slow. Smoke occurs when fresh coal is

thrown suddenly, in too large quantity at once, on a hot fire. By extreme
care a fireman may throw coal into his furnace so gradually as to make very little

smoke ; but mechanical arrangements for introducing constantly and uniformly the
new supply of fresh coal have been devised, and several of these have been such as
to reduce the smoke emitted to almost nothing. I have seen in the neighbourhood of
Glasgow, at a large manufacturing establishment at Thornliebank, one method which
is applied to about thirty ordinary 40 horse-power boilers, in which upwards of 100 tons
of coal are daily burned, and from the chimneys of which not more smoke is emittad
than from many a kitchen fiie. This method is under the patent of Messrs. Vicars, of
Liverpool, and it seems to work very well. It has been about two years in work there.

It was introduced at a time when coal was exceedingly high in price, as much to effect
economy in fuel as to prevent smoke ; and although the fiirst cost was somewhere about

Б130 per boiler, the proprietor considers himselfto be already more than recouped for his
outlay, as a saving of fully 12 per cent, in the fuel consiuued was effected. At the same
works I have also seen in operation the method of Messrs. Haworth and Horsfall, of
Todmorden, wliich has, I aip told, in certain circumstances, some advantages over
the other. In this, as in the other, the coal is fed in imiformly by mechanical
arrangements. The mechanism is different in the two cases, but the result in the
motion communicated to the coals is very much alike in both. The bed of coal,
which is gradually supplied in front, is caused to travel along the bars towards the
inner end of the furnace, and the combustion proceeds in a very uniform manner in

conditions highly favoiuable to economy of fuel, and without the emission of
almost any visible smoke.

   These two methods I have mentioned because they appear both to work very

successfully in practice, while they both bring into effect the principle of action of

the friel which has long appeared to me to be the best that can be adopted for

ordinary cases of steam-engine boilers.

   Having now occupied, I think, enough of your time, I will conclude. I have

endeavoured to select out of the wide range of subjects which fall within the
scope of the Mechanical Section of the British Association a few which have come

more particularly under my own notice, and on which I thought it was in my

power to give intelligence that might be interesting as to past progress, and sug-

gestions that might be useful towards extension of improvements in the future.

           Oompsiisatinj Ajyparatus for Distant Signal-wires of Railways.

                                    By G. "W. Beynox.

   Hitherto the old methods of the screw connexion or the ratchet-wheel have
generally been employed as the only means of adjusting the wires of distant signals.
At the commencement of this year the author invented this apparatus, which
self-regulates and adjusts automatically the wires of signals, and which combines
extreme simplicity and non-liability to get out of order with cheapness in manu-
facture. It consists in the use of a flat iron bar (the proportion of its depth to thick-
ness being about -3 to 1) running upon its edge between grooved rollers contained
in cast-iron brackets. To the front end is fastened the wire to the signal, and to
the other is attached a chain, having a weight at the end sufficient to keep the wire

in a state of tension. Upon this bar slides a frame containing two clutch-blocks.
 So long as this frame remains at 90░ Fahr., the bar is free to move backwards or for-
wards between its rollers, as expansion or contraction may require ; but when pulled
 so as to decrease the angle, the blocks seize the bar and draw it through its rollers
 a sufficient distance to efficiently work the signal. This machine has been at work
 for nearly eight months upon a signal distant five eighths of a mile, situated at the
 West Junction box, Reading, Great Western Railway. Ever since it has thoroughly
fulfilled its object, and given the greatest satisfaction. Two machines have also
 been applied and have been at work for some time on two signals (semaphore and

 disk and cross-bar signals) five eighths of a mile distant each at East box, Reading
 Station, and have also given every satisfaction. Tlie apparatus is imafiected by the
 weather, and can be relied on thoroughly ; it is so contrived that no mischievous

 interference with the wire can take place whilst the signal is pulled over in either

 position.

On the Eclipsing-Apparatus constructed for the Lighthouse on the Holywood

               Bank, in Belfast Lough. By Whliam Bottomlet.

The main purposes for which lighthouses are erected are to mark the presence of

dangers, either of rocks or sandbanks, which are to be avoided by ships, and to serve

as guides for navigation. To attain these objects it is absolutely necessary that the

light exhibited shall be easily and certainly recognized as being that of a particular

lighthouse in a certain position, and no other. The mode at present in use for di-

stinguishing lighthouses from each other is to have some variety in the lights exhi-

--bited ; and the Admiralty charts mark the different lighthouses according to one or

other of six different descriptions: 1. Fixed or steady ; 2. Revolving; 3. Flashing;
A4. Fixed and flashing ; 5. Intermittent ; 6. Alternate.
                                                          large majority of the

lights on the coast are fixed, a considerable number are revolving, and out of 514 in

the list corrected to January 1871, only 29 belong to the other four descriptions.

It must be evident that such a mode of distinguishing lighthouses is extremely

imperfect. Fixed lights, though usually brilliant, are at a distance, and in foggy

weather undistinguishable from shore- or ship-lights near at hand and, notwith-
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;

standing the greatest care, one lighthouse may be mistaken for another. Revolving

or flashing lights might possibly be distinguished by their periods, if those periods

were regularly kept ; but observations of such periods require an accuracy difficult

to be attained at all time.s, and impossible in the trying circumstances in which

vessels often approach a coast.

     In order, imder present arrangements, to make out with certainty what any

observed light is, it is necessary that the master of the vessel shall first ascertain

the position of his own ship. In many cases this cannot be done even in short

voyages ; but after a long voyage, and with few opportxmities of making correct

observations, errors of many miles may occur on a ship's reckoning. Every year

the accounts of shipwi-ecks show the fatal results arising from the mistake of one

light for another light many miles away. The signal which, properly interpreted,

should have preserved the mariner from danger, becomes the false "guide which
lures him to destruction.

     If, however, we had the means of causing each lighthouse to exhibit constantly
                                                                                    ';

a liglit of such a character as could not possibly be mistaken for any othei light-

house, for any ship's light, or for an ordinary shore-light, the master of the vessel

would not only at once recognize it as being a particular lighthouse, but would be

able at the same time to correct any error he had made in regard to his own posi-

tion, and be able to proceed with confidence on his voyage.

Such a plan was proposed bv Charles Babbage, and actually exhibited in the

Exhibition of 1851. It was oificially communicated by him to all the great mari-

time governments, and was elaborately described by him in a letter to the ' Times

of the 16th July, 1855.

For many years the suggested individualization of lighthouses remained unheeded

by the public and neglected by the lighthouse authorities but dm-ing the last few

years the matter has attracted the attention of some men of scientific eminence, who,

thoroughly convinced of the important benefits which would result from its uni-

versal adoption, are able to carry out the practical details required for putting it

into operation, and whose character and position entitle them to press their convic-

  A modification and improvement of Babbage's plan has been lately published by

Sir William Thomson, who proposes that each lighthouse shall exhibit from sim-

set to sunrise a certain definite series of eclipses, representing one of the letters of

what is known in telegraphy as the Morse alphabet. The Harbour Commis-

sioners of Belfast, impressed with the great value and importance of the plan,

adopted it for an improvement of the light on the Holywood Bank, which at present

is a fixed red light liable to be mistaken for the red (or port) light of a vessel

and the apparatus exhibited to the Section was designed for the purpose bv Sir
William Thomson, and constructed by Mr. James White, of Glasgow, for the Com-

missioners. It consists of a horizontal ring of brass revolving on three vertical

wheels or rollers, and it is kept in its place by three light horizontal wheels. One

of the wheels on which the horizontal ring rests is kept in motion by a descending

weight and a train of wheels, and the motion is regulated by a centrifugal fiiction-

governor, which gives ample steadiness and regularity of speed. The horizontal

ring carries three eclipsing-screens, the weight of which is counterbalanced by a

piece of iron on the opposite side of the ring. The screens are at present arranged

Uto give two short eclipses and one longer eclipse, corresponding to the letter of

Athe Morse alphabet.     complete revolution occupies eleven seconds, of which six

seconds is the period of uninterrupted white light, and five seconds of eclipses with

the intervening intervals of light. An alteration of the number and position of the

screws enables us to form any letter of the alphabet that may be desired.
  An experimental trial has been made of the apparatus on the lighthouse with

very satisfactory results. In the coui-se of a few weeks it will be in permanent

operation ; and the author ventured to express the belief that the success of the plan

will keep public attention directed to the simple means of rectifying the defects of our

present lighthouse system, and, in connexion with what is doing elsewhere, cause the

adoption of it, or similar means of distinguishing lighthouses, along the coasts of the

United Kingdom.

                        On the Differentiating Waster-water Meter.

                         By George F. Deacon, M.Inst. G.E.

   The author explained that this instrument had been designed for the pm-pose of
ascertaining the locality of waste of water due to leakages from pipes and fittings.
It consists essentially in a vertical hollow truncated cone of brass, to the upper and
smaller end of which the water from any service main is led, and from the lower
end of which it passes to the district supplied by that main. Within the hollow
cone, and equal in diameter to its upper end, is a horizontal metal disk, having on
its upper side a rigid central stem by which it is hung from a Gennan-silver wire
passing through a lignum-vitse bush to a dry chamber above, where it is connected
with guide-wheels and with a gut-band passing over a pulley, on the other side of
222 REPORT--1874.

which the gut-band is attached to a weight of fixed amount, which, when no water

is passing, maintains the disk at the top of the cone.

   Water being caused to flow through the cone, the disk will obviously move to a
level at which the coimterbalance weight is exactly balanced by the excess of pres-

sure of the water on the upper surface of the disk, added to the weight of the disk
in water and of the guide-wheels and wire in air.

    There is therefore for every particular velocity of water a particular position of

the disk from which it will not move until that velocity is changed. The particular
rate in gallons per hour for each particular position of the disk had been deter-
mined, and a scale had been constructed on which a pencil, attached to the cross-
head carrying the guide-wheels, shows at any instant the rate of flow in gallons per
hour. In practice this scale is printed on a sheet of paper, which is mounted on a
drum and caused to revolve once in 24 hours. By this means the rate of consump-

tion iu the district for every instant during the day and night is determined ; and the
waste of water is distinguished from the use of water by the comparatively steady

natme of the line due to the latter. By placing a turning key on the plug of the

stopcock outside any private premises during the night, and by applymg the ear

to the top of the key, any flow of water may be detected. If waste is thus found

to be taking place the stopcock is closed.

    The waste of a district is thus traced to a few premises, and on the following
morning the diagi-am is found to have recorded the change of rate in the flow caused
by the closing of each stopcock, and the degree in which the subsequent repairs

shoidd reduce the consumption.

   The author concluded by stating that waste-water meters had been for some time
in successful operation in Liverpool, where, until their application, the town was on

intermittent supply at the rate of about twenty-five gallons per head per daj' for
domestic pm-poses, which was found to rise above thirty-three gallons per head

during an experimental constant supply.
    Waste-water meters had, however, been applied in thirty-six districts, containing

in the aggregate 89,602 persons, and the domestic consumption had been thereby
reduced to 16-9 gallons per head per day, at a trifling cost and with but little
 annoyance to the people.

    The system was being quickly extended to the whole district of supply.

         On a New Form of Screw-Lowering Apparatus.
                          By E. J. Haeland.

The author, with the aid of models, gave a detailed description viva voce of a

screw-lowering apparatus for ships which he had lately invented. He said that in

some voyages, and especially during those across the Atlantic, the wave-line on the

side of the ship was very often such as to leave the ordinarj' screw half exposed.

Under these circumstances the engines had only half the work to do, and conse-

quently were apt to run off" at such speed as to injm-e the machiner3% The conse-

quence was that the engineer had to throttle or cut oft' a considerable portion of the

steam, and the speed of the vessel was much reduced. To obviate that, a plan for

lowering the screw was being introduced, which enabled the engineer in heavy

weather to keep the vessel going much steadier, with practically very little reduced
Aspeed.
         lai-ge amount of useful power was thus utilized, with the advantage of

imiform motion.

   Instead of the engineer being obliged at dilferent parts of the day to slow the
engines, he was independent of the weather, which became merely a matter for the

consideration of the captain. In crossing a bar, or when in shallow water, the tips

of the screw must not be lowered beneath the keel. The normal position of the
screw was that the tip should be in a line with the keel ; but when the vessel was

in more water than she really required, the captain gave directions to the engineer
to lower the screw, in performing which operation no change was necessary iu the

speed of the engines, and iu that position the vessel crossed the ocean. On arriv-

ing near port the captain gave a counter order to raise the screw. In Liverpool the

demand for admission into the graving-docks by vessels which had broken or
injiu-ed their screws was often so gi-eat that it was found impossible to accommodate
them all, and the consequence was that many vessels had to enter on another voyage
with their screws in an injured condition. To meet this difficidty it was proposed
to elevate the screw to such a position, as when the vessel was half dischaxged the
screw could be repaired and then lowered to its normal position, without its being

necessary to take the vessel into the dock.

   Not more than two minutes are occupied in raising or lowering the screw,
which was accomplished by means of a small steam-engine located on the deck.

   In performing the operation there was, of course, a theoretical loss of power,

although practically no loss could be discovered.
   The Harland screw has been fitted to the White Star liner ' Britannic,' which

has recently made one of the shortest runs on record to New York. The ship is

472 feet long, 45 feet beam, with a total carrying capacity of 5000 tons. She has
compound engines 760 H.P. nominal and eight boilers, and developed great speed,
making the passage in 7 days 19 hours and 35 minutes, which is within half an horn'

of the shortest time recorded.

   The S.S. ' Camel,' a smaller steamer, has also been fitted with this lowering-screw,
and in constant use during the last four years has given the utmost satisfaction.

                         On a Higher Education for Engineers*.

                        By Jeeemiah Head, of Middlesbrough.

   The author first showed that the industrial prosperity of Great Britain, depend-
ing as it does so largely upon the economical utilization of its minerals, would in
future increase or dwindle away according to the skill and intelligence brought

to bear by British engineers.

   He then investigated the meaning of the term "Engineer," calling attention to
its ambiguity, and defining it as properly denoting " him who is able, as various

necessities arise, to utilize, in the best and most economic manner, the materials of

the earth for the benefit of its inhabitants."

   In order to enable engineers really to come up to this high standard, he thought

they should have a much wider and higher education than is now commonly met
with among them. He argued at considerable length in favour of increased atten-

tion being paid to the studies of chemistry, physics, geology, physical geography,
economics, mathematics, accounts, law, inductive and deductive reasoning, rhetoric,

physiology, and professional morals. The nature of each of these branches of
knowledge, and their bearing upon the engineering profession, were successively

   He endorsed the present practice of sending students at the age of sixteen to work

as ordinary mechanics in an engineering establishment of repute, and where there
is a o-ood system of progressive advancement through the several departments. But
instelid of remaining simply as improvers after the age of twenty-one, he advocated
a three years' course at a good College of Science, where systematic attention coidd

be paid to the above higher branches of professional education. He thought a

lono-er time than has hitherto been customary shoiUd be devoted to the training of
an engineer, and did not consider the responsibility of laying out large smus of

money iu constructive works should be entrusted to men of less than thirty years

of age.
   In conclusion, he called attention to the danger of specializing the energies too

much, or before the elements in every department of knowledge have been

thoroughly mastered. Specialists are of two kinds, exciting respectively our aver-
sion and our admiration. The first kind were like sellers of omnipotent medicines

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ;

they may possibly have an intimate acquaintance with the special articles they sell,
but would be utterly helpless if called upon to deal with new conditions. The

second kind he typified by Smeaton's Eddystone Lighthouse, which has with-

stood the fierce attacks of Atlantic storms for more than a century. Two

previous ones failed because imperfectly constructed; but this one endures,

because the lower one searches among the courses of masonry of which it is com-
posed, the more solid one finds them, and the more extended in area, until they
finally terminate in the granite blocks which are dovetailed into the solid rock.

 Lulce's Patent Safety Facing-point Loch for Securim/ Railway Facing-points.

                     By R. Ltjke, of the Great Western Railway.

                          [Communicated by W. Smith, C.E., London.]

    This invention consists in forming the extreme points of the switch-rails with a

bevel projection thereon, which bevel projection may either be forged on or it may

be fixed thereto by bolting, riveting, or otherwise. This projection is bevelled to
an angle of 45 degrees, and the inner face of each switch-point is similarly provided,
but the bevel on the one is right-handed and that on the other is left-handed. The
points are connected together by a rod or rods, and they move in the arc of a circle
in the usual way. The bevelled pieces on the points each project to an extent suffi-
ciently wide to receive a correspondingly bevelled projection or the bevelled end of

a longitudinally sliding-bar, which may be of sufficient length to receive at least two
pairs of carriage-wheels ; and these bars may work or slide longitudinally by the side

of the inner faces of each permanent rail, or partly by the side of and partly under
each rail, as will be further described. There are two such bars, each so formed or
fitted with a bevelled end to correspond with and overlap the bevel projection on
each point or movable tongue of the switch-rail.

    These two longitudinal bars are connected together and moved simultaneously in
opposite directions by the interposition of either bell-cranks and connecting-rods, or
a vibrating lever mounted centrally upon a bearing between the rails for simulta-
neously moving the two bars. This vibrating lever may, in turn, be connnected
with the points through bell-cranks and rods.

   Knowing by practical experience that a single bar, when placed before facing-
points, and upon which the flange of the wheel would have to run (or over which
it would roll), would be subject to the kicking action of the driving-wheel of the
engine, and such action would tend to withdraw the bevelled end of the bars from

 contact with the bevelled piece on the switch, the author accordingly provided a
very simple means of overcoming that difficulty, which, though more ideal than real,
presented itself as one of the objections which was likely to be raised by those over-

refined and hypercritical critics who are far more ready at discovering objections
 to any plan proposed by others than in suggesting remedies. The author there-
 fore provides two bars and connects them together ; and it will be seen that, as
 they work in opposite directions, being connected together, whatever kicking is

 done to the one bar is counter-kicked and coimteracted by the action on the other
 bar, so that the kicking, being self-neutralized, has no unlocking effect, and so leaves
 the locking of the points as effective as is provided and arranged for mechanically
 by the arrangement and disposition of the moving parts. But this kicking or creep-
 ing action only applies in the case where the rotating surface of the wheel (whether
 it be of the tread or the flange of the wheel) comes in contact with or rolls upon
 the longitudinal bar or longitudinally moving portion of the permanent rail ; but it
 does not at all apply to those arrangements wherein the weight of the train is sup-
 ported on the ordinary rail which has no longitudinal motion, and the rail in turn
 acts by pressure upon, and holds securely, a longitudinally sliding-piece or portion
 of the longitudinally sliding-bar that is beneath the foot or bottom of the rail, and
 which is only free to be moved or slid when there is no load or pressure on the
 permanent rail.

   The movements of the points, or their vibration in the arc of a circle, and the
longitudinal movements of the two sliding-bars, are effected simultaneously and

correspondingly, and in proper relation to one another, either through the connexions
that are provided or any other suitable ai-rangement, and the whole is worked or
set in motion by means' of rnie lever-handle or by the movement of one connecting-

rod from the pointsman's box ; and vfhen, by the forward motion of one of the

sliding-bars, the hevelled end thereof is pressed against the bevel on the point corre-
sponding thereto, and forces the extreme point of the switch against the permanent

rail, it holds it there until the whole of the train has passed over the points. As even
the pointsman himself cannot move the lever or the oars or the pomts during the

passage of an engine or train over or along the longitudinal bar, or over the rail under
which or partly under and partly by the side of which the longitudinal sliding-bar is
applied or fitted, by reason of the load or weight of the engine or carriage upon it,
thus the pointsman or any other person would be prevented from moving this
handle or the connecting-rod therefrom, or the sliding-bar itself, and so the position

of the points cannot be changed ; and they cannot he opened to the slightest extent
whilst the train is approaching the points or until after the engine or train has

entirely passed over them.
   If the angles of the inclined surfaces of the projections from the longitudinally

sliding-bar and from the points be other than 45░, the relation of the movements
and the proportionate motions of the longitudinal bars and the vibrations of the

points must be changed to coiTespond therewith, so that they pass the one incline
surface over the face of the other when the bars, acting on the points, cause them

to be alternately moved from or to the permanent rail.

   The outside rod and mechanism of this point-locking apparatus are connected with
the signals by means of rods in the usual way ; and the protecting signals should

first be moved over into the right position to protect the road before the points are
moved ; and the points should also be connected with a point-indicator, so as to show
their true position by night as well as by day.

On the Great Western Railway, at the Portobello Junction, a combined broad-

gauge and narrow-gauge line is fitted with facing-points according to this invention,

and they have     been in constant use for fourteen  months                                 and, besides the sidings
                                                                                         ;

proper for the general traffic,, the heaviest goods traffic into the goods yard has

passed over the broad- as well as the narrow-gauge points at this Junction with

entu-e satisfaction to the engineer and all concerned, and the pointsman speaks of

the invention in the highest terms.

At Hammersmith Junction this apparatus has been applied to the narrow-

gauge line where the Great Western and Metropolitan Railway systems join ; and
there, too, after ahout fourteen months' heavy work, although the apparatus was

only roughly made up and put together, it has stood the severest tests to which it

could be subjected, and has given every possible satisfaction.

The plan view of a narrow-gauge line, with a guai-d-rail on the inner side of

each permanent rail, shows a longitudinally sliding-bar working between the
inner face of each permanent rail and the guard-rail. It shows the movements of
the two bars in opposite direction as being there produced by a lever-arm

mounted on a sleeper between the rails, and the bevel end of each bar resting

on a bed-piece or chair common (as a bearing) to it and the bevel projection

on the end of the corresponding point, against the bevelled face of which the

end of the sliding-bar is constantly in contact and ready to act or perform its

function of movingthe point over to, and firmly pressingit against, the permanent rail,

either alone or conjointly, through or by the aid of the bell-crank or other connexions

which may be introduced whenever thought to be desirable or advisable ; but the

use of bell-cranks for moving the points over in the arc of a circle is not really ne-

cessary, though many engineers may consider it a proper adjunct and precaution.
   To suit the various forms of railway bars in use, and also the views of railway

engineers, the inventor has proposed various modifications in the form and arrange-

ment of the longitudinally sliding-bars, as far as possible to suit the various condi-

tions of things.
326 REPORT-- 1874.

The Biver Shannon Drainage and Navigation *. By James Lynait, CE,

   The flood-waters of navigable rivers, such as the Shannon, may be far more

easily, quickly, and economically regulated, and the crops on the adjacent lowlands
preserved from inundations, by using- wholly movable weirs, such as the French

^^ barrages niobikfi" than by ivholly solid stone weir-mounds, such as those built by
the Board of Works, and now existing in the Shannon, or by the immovable iron

walls with submerged sluices recently designed for the Shannon by an eminent

civil engineer.

   Works on a very large scale for the improvement of the river Shannon for both

drainage and navigation were designed under the Act 5 & 6 William IV. chapter 6,
and were carried on under the Act &2 3 Victoria, c. 61. The expenditure was

about Б586,000, of which one half was a free grant, and one half was levied on
and paid up with interest by the riparian counties.

In 1850 the Commissioners reported the works complete and effective, but that

was a double mistake. It is now ascertained by measurements and admitted that

large portions of the works are still unexecuted, and that 24,000 acres of land are

periodically damaged by the inundations. In August 1861 an inundation destroyed

the whole of the crops, and nearly every year great damage is done. During the

Alast thirteen years the subject has been' much discussed.  Select Committee of

the Lords and another of the Commons have sat on the subject, heard much

evidence, and reported. Two engineering sm'veys of the river have been made and

lodged in Parliament, together with designs and estimates for the improvement of

the drainage. The cost of aU these amounts to about Б12,000, but no work has

yet been done. The landowners have asked from the Board of Works permission

to construct sluices in the solid stone weir-mounds, but the Board refused. At

length, last session of Parliament, the present magnanimous Government got an
Act passed appropriating Б300,000 of public money for the improvement of the

river, of which, as before, one half is to be a free grant, and one half is to be levied
on and paid by the landowners with interest in thirty-five years. This half, viz.

Б150,000, is to be levied on an area of 18,000 acres, being at the rate of Б8 6s. the
English acre. Most of the owners of the flooded lands think this sum is more than

the value of the benefit that would result to the la^jds from the drainage, and thus

it remains very uncertain whether these landowners will give the formal legal

assents to the project which the Act requires before works can be commenced. If
works can be designed suflicient to improve the river to the extent necessary and
desired for the sum of Б200,000, one half of which, Б100,000, levied on the lands
would be but Б5 lis. an acre, the landowners would freely give their assents, and
a sum of Б100,000 woidd be saved. That this can be done is what I here propose
to show.

   Under the recent Act of Parliament it is not proposed to improve the whole of
the river Shannon, but only three out of the eight divisions or reaches, leaving

one level or reach at Limerick below and four reaches above unimproved, and

their lands still subject to injurious flooding.

   The design for the improvement of those three levels at a cost of Б300,000 to
improve 19,000 acres comprises two principles, viz. increasing the water-way by
excavation, and keeping up a depth of 6 feet to 7 feet of water on all the shoals
and locksills in driest summer for steamboat navigation by regulating-weirs.

   The existing regulating- weirs, as built across the Shannon by the Commissioners,

are wholly solid stone moimds of a half-horseshoe form, with the leg lying very

obliquely to the stream. There is no sluice or flood-gate in any of them. In wet

weather and in floods they act as an artificial barrier to the passage of the surplus

water. From Carrick on "Shannon to Killaloe Bridge in mid flood is 35 feet 9 inches
in the surface. Of this fall 20 feet is wasted in useless cataracts at six weir-

mounds, and 15 feet 9 inches only in the intermediate reaches to propel the stream.
   The regulating-weir proposed and designed recently by the Government in lieu

of the existing weir-mounds is an immovable iron wall with submerged opes for
sluices. Each ope is 6 feet broad and 4 feet deep, and surrounded on the top,
sides, and bottom by the edges of the iron plates of the wall. The weir is 8 feet

deep, and therefore the upperside of each sluice when fully open is 4 feet sub-

Whenmerged under water.  all the sluices are open to the fullest possible extent,

the aggregate water-way is but one third of the sectional area of the river. Two

thirds' of the water-way is permanently shut. To meet this great contraction the

Government engineer has designed very large excavations ; and he provides for a

head or difference of level between the water at the upper and lower sides of the

river of about 2 feet.

   At Killaloe the existing fall in the surface of the flood-water is 6^ feet in a
distance of 4400 feet, being at the rate of ?! feet per mile. Out of this fall of 6^

feet, the head which the engineer provides for propelling the flood-water through
his sluice-opes is 2 feet 2 inches. Thus a third of the whole available fall is

appropriated to the weir, and two thirds merely to the river.

   By using a regulating-weu- wholly movable, such as the "barrages mobiles," of

which forty have been in action in the rivers Seine and Youne for several years,
no head is required, none of the natural fall of the river is wasted, the whole is
disposed along the surface of the river to actuate the current. Of course far less

excavation is then required to carry oft' the flood- waters.

   At Killaloe on the Shannon the Government engineer has been obliged to

estimate for the following excavation :

177,785 cube yards of rock at 2s. . . Б17,778

59,515 cube yards of clay at dd. .                                                                                                  2,231

With present prices that would cost Б25,000.
   The existing channel, with the surface of the river above at a level that will

injure no crop, affords a fall at the rate of 6^ feet per mile, and a cross sectional
water-way 430 feet broad and 6 feet deep. This will carry 1,230,000 cube feet of
water per minute. The greatest quantity of flood-water he proposes to provide for
the discharge of there is 1,200,000 cube feet per minute. There, with a wholly
movable weir, the existing channel is sufiicient, and the proposed excavation is not
necessary. Therefore works for the improvement of the Shannon at Killaloe,
sufficient to improve the drainage of the division of the river above it without

injuring the division below it, may be designed at a cost certainly Б20,000 less
than the estimate recently made by the Government engineer, by using a wholly

movable regulating-weir.

   Proportionate savings may be effected on the same principle in the other divisions

of the river.

    It has been stated that a wholly movable weir at Killaloe would injure the

navigation there by causing a violent current. An inspection of the map of the

missioners partly cut away, must be restored at a cost of Б1000, both for the iron

wall weir and for a movable weir, and then the navigation channel will not be at

all affected by any current in the river.
    I do not state that the French " barrages mobiles," with their mechanical details,

are the most suitable pattern of regulating-weir for the Slianuon. All I advocate

is, a regulating-weir either wholly movable or so far movable that when fully open
 it will occupy a head of water in high floods of no more than 3 inches. Such a

weir may easily be designed and constructed in lieu of the existing stotie weir-

 mounds in the Shannon without any injury to the navigation, and by their use so

 much more fall will be eftective in propelling the stream along the difterent reaches

 of the river that very little excavation to increase the water-way will be required

 and the drainage and the navigation of the Shannon may be improved to the

 fullest extent necessary or desired at a cost of Б100,000 lesfj than the estimate on

 which the recent Act of Parliament is founded.

analysis of this problem, when it was considered as subjected to the two condi-
tions which were necessary to the most economical use of a homogeneous material,

namely,

       (1) That the thrust along a meridian shall equal the thrust along the parallel

                per unit of area at every point.

       (2) That the normal thickness shall vary in such a manner that the area under

                compression shall be proportional to the thrust.

   The paper contains the investigation of the diiferential equation of the profile of
the dome subject to these conditions, and the discussion of that equation, as well
as of the law of variation of thickness imder the same conditions. The theorems
are also extended to the case of stratified stone, in which the thmsts in condition

(1) are proportional instead of equal.

   The investigation is printed in extenso in the ' Proceedings of the London Mathe-

matical Society' for 1874, vol. v. pp. 113-119.

On an Improved Tuyere for Smiths' Forges. By W. Morgan.

This is a simple but important improvement in smiths' forges, by which the forge

is much more fully under the control of the workman, and by which the life of the

tuyere is greatly prolonged, the work of heating the metal more uniformly and unin-

Aterruptedly carried on, and a great economy of fuel efi'ected.  cast-iron trunk or

box is made which is placed horizontally from the back and the front of the forge.

The front end is closed by means of a slide or door ; the back end has a hollow

tower, which rises above to a suitable height, and upon which is fitted a cast-iron

tuyere-block with, by preference, two long slot-holes for the blast. Within the

trunk is a long lever working in an axle or spindle, which at its longer end has

two punches, which rise vertically, and are from time to time projected through the

slots to displace the slag, and keep the tuyere-openings clear. This the workman

does by moving a lever upon the outer end of the spindle or fulcrum of the levers.

The iron trunk or box becomes heated by the surrounding fuel, and utilizes the

heat which would otherwise be wasted, and eifects a considerable economy of fuel

by heating the air of the blast, and the inventor employs air in a peculiar manner

for keeping the tuyere-block cold.

On the means adopted for the Improvement of the Outer Navigable Channel of

             Dundalk Harbour. By John Neville, C.E., M.R.I.A.

   The harbour of Dundalk is entered by a channel 4 miles long from and in the
bay, beginning at the bar and terminating at Soldiers Point. This channel, called
the " Outer Channel," discharges the waters of the Castletown River at low water.
In 1867 it had shifted so much that it became necessary to alter its course and fix

Ait. plan for this purpose was selected by the Harbour Commissioners, and

approved of by the Board of Trade. This consisted of directing the ebb and flow
currents into a more direct course, and fixing this course by means of jetties and

side walls constructed of loose rubble boulder-stones, varying in weight from a few
pounds to a few cwts., dropped in from punts, and raised about 2 feet over low
water neap-tides. The stones were not quarried, but picked from off the lands on
the mountain side near the shore, carted to the shipping-places by the fanners, and
sent out in punts. About 60,000 tons have been deposited up to the present time
about 2 miles of jetties and walls have been constructed, and about Б8000 expended

out of an estimate of Б40,000. As the income of the Commissioners is limited,
the works are carried on from time to time as the fuads are available. It was at
first thought by many that at a distance of a mile or two fi-om the shore, the loose
stones in these jetties and walls would be washed away. This has not been so.
Not a single stone has been removed ; but when subsidence takes place new materials
are supplied, and the walls raised up from time to time as before. The jetties, or
grains, were used to f<5rce back the channel gradually, in some cases to an extent

of about 700 feet without any interruption of the navigation. This communication

was laid before the Section for the purpose of showing that guide-walls, if not too
high, can be constructed with small stones in a cheap and eftective way to direct
the currents, and maintain a channel at a considerable distance from the shore in
bays and estuaries.

A new Construction for finding the Vertical Shearing-stress and the point of

   greatest Bending-moment in a Beam loaded in any way. By Johk

    Neville, O.E., M.B.I.A.

   The vertical shearing-stress of a beam at any point is known to be equal to the

weight on the next pier less the weight lying between this pier and the point. It
is generally represented, graphically, by ordmates to the beam of one side only.

Now as the sum of these stresses must be zero, those on one side being positive

and those on the other negative, the proper graphical representation is to show
them according to their signs above and below the beam, positive and negative as

they exist. This leads to a simple geometrical construction for finding the shearing-

stress on a beam loaded in any way with a number of weights. Find the line of
shearing-stress for the beam itself ; then using this line plot on it the line of shearing-
stress for the first weight, distributed or single, but making the ordinates vertical
 to the beam itself. Plot from this second shearing-line a third shearing-line for
 the third weight, and so on. The shearing-line last found gives the shearing-stress
 of the beam arising from all the weights, including that of the beam. The con-
 struction gives the lines of shearing-stress for each point of the beam at each step

 also.

    Where the shearing-stress is a maximum, the bending-moment is zero ; and
 where the shearing-stress is zero, the bending-moment is a maximum. Conse-

 quently where the line of shearing-stress, as here constructed, cuts the beam, the
 point of intersection is that of the greatest bending-moment.

    The areas formed between the line of beam and the lines of shearing-stress,
 above and below, are always equal.

   Improved Patent Saddle-rail and Railway Permanent-way Construction.

                                      By W. Seaton,

   The author first explained his original saddle-rail, which had been in satisfactory
use upon various railways throughout the country, including the Great Western
Railway, where for fifteen years uninterruptedly it had continued in use. On the
Highland Railway it had been laid and maintained with great economy.

   The improvements now made consisted of rolling the saddle-rail with flanches

and introducing transverse sleepers under the longitudinals, and bolting the rails
by the tianches vertically through the longitudinal bearers and the transverse
sleepers, thus combining the whole together in a firm framework -like structure

--without any understrain upon or injury to tlie bolts or fastenings the intro-

duction of transverse sleepers under the longitudinals giving a much wider base to
the road and a much stronger vertical and lateral resistance to rolling loads worked
at high speeds, with a great reduction and cost of materials and economy of first

cost for construction and maintenance of the permanent way.

On the Prevention of Railway Accidents and Automatically Recording the

   Movements of the Points and Signals and other Apparatus of Railways.

  By W. Smith, C.E.

   The author prepared this paper as supplementing that portion of the President's

address read before the Section at its opening in which he gave a brief sketch of
the improvements that had recently been effected in the working of railway- traffic,
and wlierein he shortly described the " block system," the signalling aiTangements,
and the " interlocking of the points and signals by mechanical means," so that a

mechanical check was set upon the signalman, who could not pull over certain of

the point- and signal-levers vmtil certain others were first put right, and whereby
every thing was moved and worked according to a prearranged system.

--230 REPORT 1874.

   For the invention of this interlocking of the points and signals of railways, and
the arrangement of mechanism designed to prevent the confiiction of the signals
with one another and of the signals with the points, we are indebted to Mr. John
Saxby, a very ingenious inventor, formerly in the employ of the Loudon, Brighton,

and South Coast EaUvv'ay Company, and now the proprietor jointly with his
partner, Mi\ J. S. Farmer, of one of the most extensive and well-arranged manu-

facturing establishments in the country, employing between 3000 and 4000 hands

and a large capital mainly, if not entirely, created dm-ing the last twelve or

thirteen years.

The great originahty and ingenuity of the Saxby and Farmer interloclriog appa-

ratus, and its capabilities for adaptation to the most complicated and labyrinthic

arrangements of railway-lines and trafiic-worliing at the junctions, stations, and

termini of railways, has been the means of so systematizing the working that

perfect safety may be relied on, so long as the signals can be seen and the engine-

driver  promptly  and    thoroughly  respects them                                                                    but, unfortunately, these                                                    condi-
                                                                                                                   ;

tions are not at all times observed, and serious accidents frequently occur, as will

be found on reference to the Board of Trade reports by Captain Tyler and other

Government inspectors from time to time.

Whenever accidents do occur from the disregard of the signals by the engine-

driver, or from his inability to see them, a conilict in the evidence given at a
coroner's inquest, or at a Government or otlier inquiry, is invariably the result ; and
whilst the signalman states that the signals were " against the driver," or at
"danger," the driver and his mate (and sometimes others in the train) assert

the direct contrary.

   In many other ways in connexion with the direction of the traffic and traffic-
working, that which has been done or that which should have been done, but has
not been done (but whichever it is or may have been), has produced directly, or
has been more or less immediately the cause of, serious accidents, and loss of life

and property has remained untraced or imperfectly accounted for or explained.
Such occuiTences, when they take place, are unsatisfactory, and frequently involve

serious injustice to some guiltless or innocent persons.

   The author has, during his experience and practice as a scientific expert, whilst
engaged investigating the causes of railway accidents, had his attention called to
the great importance of providing some thoroughly reliable apparatus and arrange-
ment by the use of, and reference to, which all doubts would be set at rest as to the
actual condition of the " home " and " distant " signals, and the points and switches,
the level-crossing gates, and other movable portions of the machinery of railways
and of the trains thereon, at any given period of time, at and near to every signal-

box, junction, or station.

   To effect these objects, and to do so automatically, and preserve a perfectly

intelligible and reliable record of every telegraphic direction or signalled instruction

sent and received for the movement or working of the train-signals, " day " and
" night," " home " and " distant," semaphore or other, and for the movements of
the "points " and other portions of the rails or permanent way connected with the
regulation of the movements or translation of the traffic over the main or branch
roads and other portions of the system, the author was requested to design and
provide some reliable and inexpensive apparatus. Accordingly he undertook the
task some two years ago, and after an extensive series of experiments and trials,
under every variety of circumstances connected with the working of railway traffic,
he succeeded in arranging a most complete and comprehensive apparatus which

automatically records :

1st.    The directions   given and received for regulating the movements of trains
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ;

2nd. The movement of every signal of every kind or description
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;

3rd. The movement of the " points " and other portions of the road and way

affecting or regulating the movements of trains or engines

4th. The passing of trains in each direction ; and
0th. The time in relation to such movements &c. All upon the same roll or

strip of paper and in a succinct form.

These results are obtained by connecting to the reciprocating parts of the point-

and sig-nal-working apparatus, or to the interlocking gear, a peculiar arrangement

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             i

of electric contact-making and breaking apparatus, acting througli a simple electro-
magnetic contrivance whicli in turn operates upon and deflects a pen, style, or
marker, which records upon the strip of accurately divided paper the whole of the
movements in question. In like manner, the directions sent and received for regu-
lating the tr.aihc are recorded, as also is the passing of trains, which are distin-
guished the one from the other ; and the whole of these movements are timed, and
the time is recorded uniformly on one edge of each of the strips of paper.

   Between the time-records on the one edge of the roll or strip and the passage of
trains recorded, say, on the opposite edge, the directions sent and received and
the movements of the various signal- and point-levers, or the movements of the
parts of the interlocking gear, are recorded Between the records on the two edges of
the strip, and in a clear and intelligible manner ; and on reference to these rolls all
questions connected with the traflic-working can be solved with perfect certainty

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;

and upon the rolls or strips of record-rolls being removed and sent to the manager's
office, he can, at a glance, by comparing the various records, see the work done
upon the various parts of the line during a given time; and they can be referred to
at any time, and could be produced and could be received as reliable evidence in
any legal or other tribunal.

   The apparatus costs only a small sum, and the annual cost of maintaining and
working it is very small.

On Improvements in the Mariner's Compass.

       By Sir W. TpoMSoi^, LL.D., F.E.S.

            On Power^CoujMtu/s for RoUing-Mills and olher Machinery.

                        By F. H. VAELEr and Edw. Fueness,

   In arresting a heavy body in motion it is necessary to exert a force equal to the
dynamic effect of the weight of the body, multiplied by the square of its velocity.

--Should this be effected instantaneously, a gi-eat concussion is the residt such being

the effect experienced when a piece of machinery in rapid rotation is suddenly
arrested by clogging, causing the teeth of the wheels to be stripped off or the
sbafts broken or distorted, which frequently occm-s with iron rolling-mills, sugar-

cane crushing-mills, and not unfrequently causing the breaking of the screw-shafts
of steam-vessels and all classes of machinery subject to rapidly varying strains.
To reduce these enormous strains to within the working strength of the material
of which the machinery is constructed, it is necessary to spread the force of the

concussion over a portion of a revolution or revolutions, or period of times, and so

destroy its intensity. Contrivances for effecting this purpose have hitherto taken

the shape of friction-breaks or clutches. They, however, are open to the objection
that they consume a large amount of usefid power by generating heat and destroying

the surface by abrasion. The authors describe a means of obtaining a better result
by an hydraulic pressure, rendered elastic by placing in the fluid a number of
elastic bodies, such pressure acting against the face of a ram working in a cylinder.
To convert the longitudinal motion of the ram into the rotatory motion of the

--shaft they employ the following arrangement : The wheel which communicates

the power to the machinery is bored to fit freely on a shaft, and has a boss with
its face on the inner side shaped of a spii-al incline of screw form, and which is
made to bear against an annular plunger, the outer end of which is shaped to the
contrary screw form. The hole in the plunger is bored to the same size as the
wheel, and works in a cylinder fitted concentrically on the shaft which passes
through the hole of the ram and wheel, the ram being made watertight by suitable
packing or leather. The outer end or mouth of the cylinder has slots or recesses
cut into it longitudinally in which lugs or projections on the ram work, so that
the ram can slide in and out the cylinder, but cannot turn unless the cylinder
turns with it, proper inlets for charging the cylinder with fluid and elastic balls
being provided. If the shaft be revolving, and the wheel driving the machinery is
stopped, the ram is immediately pressed into the cylinder and compresses the

elastic material placed in the fluid by the spirally inclined faces rising upon one

another ; the wheel at the same time is pi-evented from moving laterally along

the shaft hy a fixed collar. On the outer side of the wheel this motion of the ram

allows the shaft to continue its rotation, while the wheel is held by a sudden

shock or stoppage ; so that the machinery in such emergencies is gradually pulled
up without being smashed to pieces. In crushing-mills, through too heavy a feed,

pressure stored up in the cylinder reacts on the ram, and by the spirally inclined

end acting on the counter-form boss of the wheel, quickly brings the rolls to the

speed of the driving-shaft, and thus utilizes the force of the strain.

                On Recent Improvements in Breech-loading Firearms.
                                   By Andrew Wtlet.

   In continuation of a paper read at Brighton in 1872, giving an outline of the
history of breech-loading firearms, some account was given of improvements since
that date, including four different systems by the author, examples of which were
exhibited and described. The very serious defects of the " Martini-Henry " rifle,
as adopted by the British Government, were pointed out and illustrated by a
" sectional " model of that arm.

                                   By AxBKKw Wtlet.

  A short account was given of these, attention being specially directed to the

very excellent collection of modem breech-loaders contributed by the associated

gunmakers of Li<?ge, in which were represented some fifty systems, many of them
quite unknown in this country. It was remarked that, although at present we
have no such collection, the want is likely to be shortly supplied in the Museum
of Arms about to be established in Birmingham by the " Wardens of the Proof
House," who have secured, as a foundation for the same, an admirable collection
made in Italy by Cavaliere Callandra, illustrating the manufacture of firearms

from the earliest period up to the introduction of the percussion lock, and contain-

ing many examples of the highest artistic excellence*.
   Some account was also given of the great factory of the Austrian Government

at Steyer and Letten, on the Ems, which can turn out 150,000 " ^^'ernal " rifles
and 100 " mitrailleuses " yearly, of Herr Dreyse's establishment at Sommerda, in
Saxony (Prussian), famous for the production of the Prussian " Ziindnadel," and
of a curious cooperative factory at Ferlaeh, in Carinthia, where low-priced sporting
guns and pistols are made on a large scale for the markets of Eastern Europe.

                    * The Museum was opened on the 24th September, 1874.

The editor's introduction and appendix, are learned and most suygestive. The illustrations
are clear, artistic, and indispensable to the full understanding of the text. The get-up of the
volume is excellent. It is evident that all concerned have spared neither pains iior expense.

Away" T/iis is a Most refreshing little volume.   from the strife of tongues lohieh rages

everywhere, the Archdeacon leads his readers back. to days tvhen the century teas very young.

Of many well-known characters we have a fund of excellent anecdotes, told with brevity and
point. Many most interesting crises in our history, especially ecclesiastical, are glanced at,

and the biograp>hical sketches are pleasantly relieved by a moat interesting description of a

visit by the Archdeacon to Orkney in early life.

LAST JOUENALS OF DAVID LIVINGSTONE

IN CENTEAL AFEIOA,

FROM 1865 TO WITHIN A FEW DAYS OF HIS DEATH.

Continued by a Narrative of his last moments and sufferings, obtained from

CHUMAHhis faithful servants                       and SUSI.

BY HORACE WALLER, F.R.G.S.,

            Eeotor of Twywell, Northampton.

With Portrait, Maps, and Illustrations. 2 Vols. 8vo. 28s.

    " The last journals of David Livingstone' have come before ns like a voice from the dead.

The fidelity of a small portion of his jjeoplc lias enabled us to bury his withered remains in
Westminster Abbey, and has saved to the tvorld the record of his labours. There is no British
name more ividely known, or more universally respectecl., than that of Livingstone. The
greatest among African travellers, he has shown a persistence and devotion to his work which

has not only upheld the reputation of his country throughout the world, but has infused a new

spirit into African exploration, anil by his high example he has stimulated others to follotv

Smupon the same course, which will eventually result in the opening of that hitherto mysterious

region."-- Samuel Baker.

                      Second Edition. 8vo. 12s.

   m"These Lectures carry the good work begun by Sir Henry Maine in his volumes Фn

  Ancient Law' and 'Village Communities in the East and West.' The present edition
throws fresh light on that branch of historical study tvhieh deals teith the origin of human
laws, and their earlier developments in different countries. It is needless to say that everif
page gives evidence of the author's careful reading, his skill in detecting the true points of
analogy, and the unerring judgment wherewith he draws his conclusions; ivhile the value

     "Mr. Forsyth, in his ' Sortensius,' of which a second and improved edition has note been
published, has given, with much learning and literary ability, an historical sketch of the
Advocate's office and functions, and described the origin and career of the profession in Greece
and Rome, France and England. Hortcnsins, the famous Roman Advocate, has been selected by

--the author as The Advocate par excellence, and his name has therefore been taken as the tille of

thii interesting work," Quarterly Keview.

    " Sir George Lawrence has had more than a common share in the events which make up the
Indian history of the last half century, and he appears during the whole period of his serviceto
have kept a diary. This has now been compressed into readable shape, and the result is a booh
ivhich bears the impress of that accuracy as to dates and facts which can only be obtained by
recording them at the time, and which is so interesting from first to last that few persons who

   "A stupendoushj elaborate loorh, ichich only the patience of a German professor could have

brought to completion. It is an exhaustive treatise, from every conceivable point of view, on,

the grammar of our language. We cannot but appreciate it as a high national compliment
at the same time we must confess to some astonishment that an English grammar should be
carried to afar greater length than any Greek grammar with which ice are acquainted. One

would suppose that our tongue was not so complex and intricate as to require for its discussiox

to tell he knows how to tell it ; and so Moab has been reft from the domain of the iinknown and

MURRAY'S STUDENT'S MANUALS.

              |i lu'ics at liiss-l)flfllis for giitbantcli Srl]0lars.

Forming a Complete Chain of History from the Earliest Ages down to Modem Times.

         mEach Work is complete One Volume, Post 8vo, price 7s. 6d.

    'и This series of STUDENT'S MANUALS, ANCIENT and MODERN, edited for the most part by
DR. WILLIAM SMITH, possess several distinctive features which render them singularly valuable

as educational works. They incorjxirate, with judicious comments, the researches of the most
recent historical investigators, not only into the more modem, but into the most remote periods
of the history of the countries to which they refer. The latest lights which comparative philology
has cast upon the migrations and intermiugUngs of races are reflected in the histories of England

and France. We know no better or more trustworthy summary, even for the general reader, of

the early history of Britain and Gaul than is contained in these volumes respectively.

    " While each volume is thus, for ordinary purposes, a complete history of the country to which
it refers, it also contains a guide to such further and more detailed information as the advanced
student may desire on particular events or periods by copious Usts of the ' Authorities.' This
most useful feature seems to us to complete the great value of the works, giving to them the
character of historical cyclopedias, as well as of impartial histories." The Museum.

     " Before the publication of these Student's Manuals there had been established, by the claims
of middle-class and competitive examiners on young men's brains, a large annual demand for
text-books that should rise above the level of mere schoolboy's epitomes, and give to those who
Would master them some shadow of a scholarly knov.-ledge of their subjects. Such books were
very hard to find. Mr. Murray now brings out his seven-and-sixpenny manuals. They are most

fit for use in the higher classes of good schools, where they may be dehberately studied through

with the help of a teacher competent to expand their range of argument, to diversify their views
by the strength of his own reading and reflection, and to elicit thought from the boys themselves

upon events and the political changes to which they have led. Even the mature scholar may be

glad to have on his shelves these elegant manuals, from which he can at a glance refresh his

memory as to a name or date, and he will not use them for reference alone. He will assuredly be
tempted to read them for the clearness of statement and the just proportion with which there is
traced in each of them the story of a nation." Examiner.

THE STUDENT'S OLD TESTAMENT HISTORY.

         From the Creation of the World to the Return of the Jews from Captivity. With an Intro-
         duction to the Books of the Old Testament. By PHILIP SMITH, B. A. With 50 Maps and

          Woodcuts.

            " Of our own land, as well as of Greece and Rome, we have histories of a scholar-like

           character ; but Old Testament history has not been ao carefully or so fully treated before.
          It is not a little surprising that a subject of such universal importance and interest should
          have so long been disregarded. This volume is a very able and scholarly work. As a book

      --for Sunday reading, we feel assured it will be very welcome and widely serviceable." Wes-

          Uyan Times.

THE STUDENT'S NEW TESTAMENT HISTORY.
        With an Introduction, containing the connection of the Old and New Testaments. By
         PHILIP SMITH, B.A. With 40 Maps and Woodcuts.
              " This is another of those useful m-anuals of history which will no doubt obtain a wider
          circulation than the similar volumes on the History of Greece or Rome, as the subject-
        matter is of wider interest ; at the same time, it will be more closely scrutinized. We are
           glad to say that it will endure this scrutiny, and will satisfy the more it is examined. Its
           tone is eminently reverential." Churchman.

                       ANCIENT HISTORY.

THE STUDENT'S ANCIENT HISTORY of the EAST.

          From the Earliest Times to the Conquests of Alexander the Great, including Egypt, Assyria,
          Babylonia, Media, Persia, Asia Minor, and Phoenicia. By PHILIP SMITH, B.A. With 70

           Woodcuts.

            ' ' ' Ancient History ' used to mean Greece and Rome and ' sacred history ' only. These aro

           aU sepiirately provided for in this Student's Series, and there still remains matter enough in
           the domain of ancient history to fill this closely printed and tersely written volume. Our
          admiration of the mode in which a difficult task, involving great research, has been per-

          formed is cordial, and we may be permitted to express sui-prise that a history of this nature,
          crammed full of unfamiUar names, and of necessity abounding in names rather than in facts,

            can prove such attractive reading." Saturda;/ Бevie>c.

In the helief tJiat the recent adv dices of Scienc; render it desirable to collect and
      incorporate modern discoveries, and to present in a systematic form the existing

     state of our hnowledge of the Organic World, Mr. Murray is preparing to

       puilish a series of Scientific Works on

               BIOLOGY;

                                                         OR, THE

  NATURAL HISTORY OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.

    Each Work is intended to be complete in itself ; and while so plain and simple as to
address itself to any reader of ordinarj' ednoation, yet to embody the latest discoveries,
the scientific literatnre of its subject being, in all cases, fully referred to. Each Work

is also to copiously illustrated witli careful and exact Woodcuts in the text.

                                       THE FIUST WCiEK WILL COXTAIN

 A Natural Histx)ry of Mammals, including Man.

                       By ST. GEOEGE MIVAET, F.E.S.

                                                            2YoIs. 8vo.

    The object of this first Work is to present to ordinai-y readers and to medical and

other students who. have no special acquaintance with Zoology, a general view of the
structure, physiology, habits, geogi-aphical and geological distribution, aflBnities and
classification of the groups (of the rank of families and sub-famihes) which compose the
highest class of animals, Jlan included.

     It is also intended to serve as an introduction to Zoology and to Biology generally,

and will therefore explain in simple language the various ways in which organisms may

be considered, giving the elementary facts and principles of Histology, Physiology, and
the other sciences subordinate to Biolog}-, while sufficient detail will be given to entitle

the Work to serve as a guide to Teachers and Students who may desire to follow up the

subject practically with the Scalpel and the Microscope.

    The First Volltme will comprise Man and the higher Animals furnished with nails,

hoofs, or claws, thai is to say, the Apes, Bats, Beasts of Prey, and Gnawing Quadrupeds.
     The Secoxd VoiA'JIE will contain descriptions of the Hoofed and other Animals not

jireviously described, such as Horses, Cattle, Swine, Elephants, Whales, Porpoises,
Sloths, Ant-Eaters, Armadillos, and pouched Beasts. It will also treat of the Classi-
fication and Distribution of Mammals, and will review the facts of their structure in
Anatomical instead of in Zoological order.
